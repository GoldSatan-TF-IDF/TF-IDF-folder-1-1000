harry turtledove a world of difference minerva is the fourth planet out from the sun in the solar system the first planet past earth orbit at its nearest approach to earth minerva is the brightest object in the sky except for the sun and moon it then looks to the naked eye like a brilliant grayblue star of magnitude sometimes it may even exceed that brightness for a short period this is the result of the famous minervan flash which occurs when breaks in the cloud cover above the planet surface allow the sun to reflect directly off ice or water long before the cause of the phenomenon was known it gave the planet its name the greeks called it athena after their flashingeyed goddess of wisdom minerva is the latin name for the same divinity since the invention of the telescope minerva has fascinated observers it is the only worm in the solar system besides earth where water can exist as a liquid and the presence of oxygen in its atmosphere has long suggested that like earth it is a home for life since american and soviet space probes have greatly added to our knowledge of minerva despite the planet thick cloudy atmosphere we now have reliable maps of almost its entire surface not until though did the viking i spacecraft actually land on the planet the viking analyzed minerva lower atmosphere and the crafts biological experiment package and the photographs it returned to earth confirmed that there is life on the planet viking ilast photograph arguably the most famous ever taken confirmed far more than that it proved humanity is not alone in the universe for it shows a minervan native carrying what cannot be anything but a deliberately manufactured artifact whether a weapon or simply a pole remains the subject of hot debate transmission from viking i ceased immediately after this photograph was made about the author harry turtledove is that rarity a lifelong southern californian he is married and has three young daughters after flunking out of caltech he earned a degree in byzantine history and has taught at ucla cal state fullerton and cal state los angeles academic jobs being few and precarious however his primary work since leaving school has been as a technical writer he has had fantasy and science fiction published in isaac asimov amazing analog playboy and fantasy book his hobbies include baseball chess and beer i irv levitt pumped away on the exercise bike sweat clung greasily to his skin and matted his dark brown hair he tossed his head that was a mistake he still made after eight months in space little drops spread in all directions the anthropologist swore and mopped them out of the air with a soft absorbent cloth like a big diaper without mopping up the sweat would float around until it hit somethingor someone jamming six people into a ship as cramped as athena was tough enough without troubles like that levitt worked the bike with grim intensity until finally mercifully the timer rang and let him off the hook then he toweled himself off and pushed himself out of the tiny exercise chamber and past the three sleeping cubicles on his way by he stuck his head through the privacy curtain of his own chamber for a moment the light inside was dim and red his wife sarah was tethered to the foam mattress asleep he smiled a little and went on to the control room patricia and frank marquard were already there watching the monitor as minerva flowed by below at almost miles an hour levitt saw the longing on their faces it mirrored his own like him they wanted nothing more than to get down to the planet so they could start working she was a biologist her husband a geologist at the moment the monitor showed mostly ice that was not surprising each of minervas polar caps reached about halfway to the equator the northern a bit more the southern a bit less sometimes the planet looked so frigid and forbidding that even a glance could make levitt shiver not now though the athena moved north past the edge of the southern polar cap through cloud cover levitt glimpsed one of the long deep gorges that channeled meltwater from the icecaps to the seas and lakes of the southern tropics every minervan spring i think id kill for a shower about now even in water that cold he said pat marquard nodded rueful agreement disinfectant wipes just arent the same she said im sick of smelling like an infirmary im sick of short hair too and even sicker of having it smell like an infirmary back on earth her hair had been a curly blond waterfall that went halfway down her back she was vain about it keeping it only a couple of inches longer than franks had given her something to complain about ever since athena left the american space station i could go for a shower too but im not looking forward to gravity again frank said levitt glared at him half seriously you have the nasty habit of pointing out things wed all rather not think about just working the bike leaves my legs sore having to hold myself up again walk run he broke off shaking his head in distaste we may have to do some running pat said quietly she let it drop there but her eyes her husbands and irvs automatically went to one of the two pictures taped above the monitor the viking photo it shared pride of place with galileos first sketch of minerva through the telescope but galileos drawing got short shrift sometimes irv stared at the viking shot so hard that he ignored the planetary view under it that picture was the reason for athena and the reason it had an anthropologist it had himaboard the only glimpse humanity had ever had of another intelligent race ever since viking was destroyed people had been searching for words to describe minervansor at least this minervan levitt reminded himself nobody had any idea how typical he she or it was fat hatrack was about the best short phrase anyone had come up with and even the learned articles in science and nature had not done much better than that the creature was essentially cylindrical better than six feet tall and about a foot and a half across through most of its height half a dozen short stumpy legs were equally spaced around its base a like number of arms ringed its torso about a foot below the top a ring of six eyes sprouted from the bulge there no mouth was visible some people wondered if the minervan had one if so was it on the side away from the vikings camera or in the center of the top part levitt would have bet on the latter the minervan looked to be radially symmetrical not built on the bilateral pattern more common on earth he was willing to admit he was just guessing though each of the minervans legs ended in three claws each arm in three fingers two arms held the artifact as the anthropologists had dubbed it levitt had no idea what the thing was supposed to be for it could have been a crook a flail a pole vaulters pole anything he doubted it was intended as a wrecking bar but it had done the job plenty well junior doesnt look as though itd be very fast he said musingly neither are we relative to the rest of the big mammals pat said we have things besides speed going for us so do the minervans ill guarantee you that that relative is a good point pat frank marquard put in without knowing what the local competition is we cant tell whether juniors a sloth or a gazelle youve been listening to your wife too much comes of sharing a cubicle with her i suppose irv said he tried to remember when they had started calling the minervan junior and failed sometime very early on in the flight anyway me i dont care how fast junior is by local standards i just want to know whether i can outrun it if it decides to swing the artifact at me now who sounds like me pat said and poked him in the ribs thats what i said a minute ago you should spend more time with sarah then you and she would be echoing each other shes asleep back there doing the last set of bloods and getting the data back to houston took longer than she thought it wouldthat glitch showed up in the software again sarah levitt was an md who specialized in biochemistry but was out of med school recently enough not to have forgotten what people were all about either a natural for athena for that matter irv knew that being married to her had not hurt his own chances by now everyone on this ship sounds like everybody else frank said in a pigs ear we do emmett bragg glided through the cabin like a shark sliding through a tropical lagoon if ever a man was made for freefall irv thought for the hundredth time emmett bragg was the one the pilot was close to fifty a decade older than anyone else aboard athena and the only real astronaut on the crew before nasa he had flown phantoms in vietnam once he had stayed loose on the ground for three days until a chopper got him out after his plane went down south of haiphong frank laughed nobody wants to imitate that mouthful of grits you talk through emmett what do the russians think of it anyway still without a wasted motion bragg strapped himself into the commanders seat matter of fact the accent interests em one of em said to me once i sounded like i was from georgia i told him naw alabama frank snorted and pat giggled he meant stalin country emmett not where the braves play irv said i know bragg said calmly but it doesnt hurt any to have the boys on the other side take you for a natural born fool he checked the radar screen a blip was showing the tsiolkovsky coming up over the minervan horizon right on time levitt said bragg nodded they havent been playing with their orbit again anyhow he had worn a crew cut when it was stylish kept it through the years when it wasnt and still had it now that it was in again the only difference was that gray streaked it now he picked up the radio mike zdrastye tsiolkovsky he said and went on in russian that was accented but fluent all well aboard very well thank you brigadier bragg colonel sergei tolmasov sounded like an oxford don just as the americans used russian to talk to the soviet ship the crew of the tsiolkovsky always replied in english tolmasovs dry wit went well with the slightly fussy precision he brought to the language good to find you in your expected place old fellow we were thinking the same thing about you bragg said the tsiolkovsky had changed orbits several times in the week since it and athena had reached minerva had each burn not taken place on the far side of the planet from athena levitt would have been happier about believing the russians when they said the maneuvers were just to enhance their observations as things were he had not been sorry when bragg also started jinking let them worry too the pilot had said now tolmasov remarked i will be glad when we are all on the ground and this foolish maneuvering can cease agreed bragg said at once well be too busy cheating the natives to worry so much about each other ahquite tolmasov replied after a moments pause there are times brigadier when i must confess myself uncertain as to how facetious you are being tsiolkovsky out bragg chuckled sometimes i wonder myself sergei konstantinovich athena out when the mike was dead he fell back into english the other thing i wonder about is whether all this backandforth with the russians will end up making a fulltime liar out of me too busy cheating the natives tolmasov echoed i like that i only wish i could believe it we should send a recording of that remark back to baikonur said oleg lopatin the only other russian in the control room when tolmasov spoke to athena it shows how the americans are already planning to exploit the people of minerva he was just joking oleg borisovich tolmasov said his russian did not share the arid perfection of his english lopatins heavy eyebrows came down in a frown you did not seem so certain of that when you were talking with him never show all you know tolmasov said he did not bother pointing out that that also applied to his dealings with lopatin who was kgb tolmasov sighed things being as they were that was inevitable at least lopatin was also a perfectly able electronics engineer and by russian standards computer man that gave him some real use aboard tsiolkovsky aside from his value to moscow tolmasov looked around the control room and sighed again he knew that with its round analog dials instead of slick digital readouts it would have seemed oldfashioned to bragg the panels full of glowing green numbers he had seen in pictures and tapes of athena and other american spacecraft seemed what was the american slang glitzy to him all what youre used to he thought but he did envy his opposite number the computer power under those panels every one of tsiolkovskys orbitchanging burns had been calculated back on earth athena he was sure had figured its own partly that was a difference in approach ever since the earliest days the soviet space program had relied more heavily on ground control than the americans the technology gap did exist though the big russian boosters let tsiolkovsky carry a lot more weight to minerva than athena could the engineering on the lifesupport system was solid or he wouldnt be here worrying but bragg had a lot more data processing capacity than he did and down on minerva there would be nothing but data to process he worried some more while he was at it tolmasov spent a little while worrying about bragg envy mixed in with the worry there too the colonel was out of frontal aviation his flight experience before being tapped for cosmonaut training was all in migts and other attack aircraft without false modesty he knew he was good but he had never seen combat he had left his squadron a few months before they flew against the sixth fleets tomcats during the third beirut crisis he wondered how much difference that made not much he tried to tell himself he had done everything but still russian and english both had a word for somebody who had done everything but sleep with a girl the word was virgin that turned tolmasovs mind in another direction he smoothed his short light brown hair it was not as neatly trimmed of course as it had been when tsiolkovsky set out from earth orbit eight months of amateur barbering had left everyone on the ship a little ragged tolmasov knew though that ragged or not he still kept his good looks like so many russians he had a face that would somehow contrive to seem boyish and open until he was well into his fifties and those evil days fortunately were a good many years away yet he gave his attention back to lopatin im going aft for some rest oleg borisovich call me at once if anything unusual happens or if there is any unscheduled communication from earth of course lopatin said rest well his voice held no irony even with curtains even with a bigger ship than athena privacy hardly existed aboard tsiolkovsky tolmasov missed it less than most americans would have he had grown up with a brother and three sisters in a two bedroom apartment in smolensk and his father was not badly off it was he realized wryly as he pulled himself from handhold to handhold down the corridor to the laboratory good practice for the life of a cosmonaut he heard a centrifuge whir and looked into one of the chambers well doctor he said smiling as he glided in are we healthy the question was a way to start a conversation but also seriously meant if anything was wrong tolmasov needed to know about it right away dr zakharova checked a reading squinted checked again then nodded healthy enough after so much freefall the new calcium supplement seems better than the last one we tried thats good katerina fyodorovna im glad to hear it again tolmasov felt his words bearing two meanings he was not looking forward to being under gravity againeven less so if he and his comrades suffered more than they had to from the weakened bones brought on by prolonged weightlessness moreover have your tests reached a point where you can stop for a while the doctor raised an eyebrow and smiled a little i think so she said she was a small dark woman with startling blue eyes tolmasov was no longer sure whether she really was pretty as the only woman on tsiolkovsky by now she looked good to himand he was sure to the other four men in the crew afterward in his cabin they sat in midair her legs still wrapped around his back freefall did not have many advantages but sex was one of them tolmasov kept a grip on a handhold so he and katerina would not drift out through the curtain into the corridor a pleasant way to pass the time he said im glad you think so she raised that eyebrow again hed expected her to after so long few surprises were left between crew members it had to be a lot like being married he thought that brought athena always in the back of his mind up to the front the americans had tried to solve the problem of sexual tension by putting three married couples aboard they hailed it as a triumph of equality tolmasov could not see thathe doubted any combination of couples would get the americans best people to minerva and minerva was too important for anything less than the best the soviet selection boards had thought as he did if that meant life aboard tsiolkovsky sometimes got complicated too bad fortunately katerina was as fine a womanas fine a personas she was a physician he wondered if the boards had chosen her for that too probably not he decided otherwise they would never have come up with igor lopatin he grimaced had katerina been as crabbed and dour as the engineer life aboard tsiolkovsky would have been a lot worse than complicated it would have been intolerable and maybe dangerous he ran a grateful hand down the smooth skin of her back glad she favored him at the moment she stirred and detached herself from him now she said back to work she retrieved her underpants and coverall from the little bag where she had stowed them tolmasov used a tissue to mop liquid out of the air katerina chuckled to the head first then back to work she amended with a doctors practicality as soon as she was dressed she slipped out of the cubicle and away tolmasov put his clothes back on more slowly it was not animal lassitude he was too disciplined to let that affect him calculation played a much bigger part in it someone besides oleg lopatin he was sure had kgb connections that was the way things were katerina made the most obvious choice if anyone on the ship could find out everything that was going on she was the one of course the kgb did not have a reputation for being obvious tolmasov let out a snort of laughter if katerina was not what he suspected her to be she doubtless had suspicions about him a drop of water fell from the castle ceiling onto reaturs head he extended an eyestalk and stared balefully upward at the ice was it starting to drip already plainly it was summer was coming reatur was not happy about summer it would be too hot it always was most of the tools made of ice would melt they always did the domain master would have to see to getting the stone tools out of storage as he did toward the end of every spring he did not like stone tools they were hard to make and expensive to buy his peasants did not like them either they were heavier than ice and tiring to use in the fields he wished he lived in a land with a better climate where ice stayed ice the year around even his castles thick walls would drip and trickle all summer long he remembered the really scorching summerhow long ago was it seven years that was itwhen big chunks of the roof had melted and fallen in lucky his domain had been at peace then and lucky the collapse had killed only mates reaturs eldest son ternat came into the great hall breaking his chain of thought ternat thickened his body so the top of his head was lower than the top of reaturs you are respectful the domain master said pleased but i know you are taller than i yes clanfather ternat resumed his natural height a male from the great clan of skarmer waits outside he would have speech with you would he air hissed out through the breathing pores under reaturs eyestalks i wonder what he wants visits from the males who lived on the west side of the ervis gorge were never casual affairs the gorge was too hard to cross for anything but serious business to be worthwhile bring him in yes clanfather ternat hurried away he was eldest but he knew better than to do anything without his fathers leave one day if he outlived reatur he would be clanfather himself and domain master till then he was as much in his fathers power as a just budded mate he led the skarmer male up to the domain master the westerner politely widened himself before reatur though like most of his people he was already the shorter and rounder of the two that peculiar combination of plump body and long eyestalks always made the males from west of the gorge look sneaky to reatur still widened the skarmer male said in trade talk i bring my clanfather hograms greetings to you domain master and those of all the domains sprung from the skarmer bud i am named fralk i am eldest of eldest of hogram reatur felt like hissing again but refused to let this fralk see his surprise not only did the westerner have plenipotentiary powerreatur was not even sure how many domains there were on the far side of the gorgebut he was also in line to become clanfather of his domain i am pleased to receive such a prominent emissary reatur said more polite than ever then still without abandoning his manners he started to get down to business to what do i owe this privilege a moment if you please before i come to that fralk said i have heard from merchants and travelers of a curiouswell a curious thing that you keep here may i see it travelers tales are often wild but the ones that have come to me have enough substance to be intriguing i must confess odd you should mention the strange thing when ternat announced you i was just thinking about the summer i found it reatur said come this way in deference to your rank i will not even ask any price of you you are generous fralk widened again then trailed after reatur and ternat toward the side chamber where the domain master kept the strange thing that chambers outer wall had much less sand and gravel mixed with its ice than was true of the rest of the castle as reatur had intended more sunlight came through that way the room was almost as bright as day fralk walked all around the strange thing looking at it with four eyes and barely managing to keep a polite pair on his hosts reatur understood that when he had first found the strange thing he had stared with all six eyes at once lifting the stalk on the far side of his body over his head he remembered that that had only made matters worse he was so used to seeing all around him all the time that having a big part of his field of vision blank left him disoriented he had wanted to lean in the direction his eyes were pointing fralk was leaning a little himself he noticed and recovered at last he said this once the tales are less than truth i have never seen anything like that neither had i when i came across it nor have i since reatur said and meant it he looked at the strange thing almost every day and it still made no sense to him with all those sharp anglesmore than on any eighteen things he usually came acrossit did not seem as though it had any right to exist yet there it was how did you find it fralk asked the domain master had told the tale many times somehow though maybe because fralk was a male who displayed extraordinarily good manners it came out fresher than it had in years i was out hunting nosver ive heard of them fralk said we dont have them in the skarmer domains youre lucky theyre dreadful pests by the tracks a male and his whole band of mates had come down to raid the fields i trailed them back to the low hills east of the castle that summer was so hot that when i felt dry i couldnt find any ice or snow to pick up and put in my mouth i had to lie down fiat and dip my head in a puddle of water annoying fralk said sympathetically that always makes my gut itch mine too miserable stuff water the nosver curse em like it you know they splashed along a stream coming off a tongue of ice till i couldnt smell em anymore and i wasnt having any luck finding their prints on the far side either you can imagine how happy i was i dont blame you a bit fralk said he really was a fine fellow reatur thought the domain master went on so there i was grouchy as all get out and with the start of some really fierce indigestion i came round a boulder and almost bumped right intothat he pointed at the strange thing i looked at it and looked at it and then it moved it did what fralk said startled moved reatur insisted an arm came out of its bottom and stuck itself into the ground i tell you i almost voided where i stoodi daresay the damned water id drunk had something to do with that too i never imagined the strange thing could be alive i didnt stop to think i just took a whack at it with the stave i was carrying i would have done the same thing fralk said or else run i hit it over and over what a racket it made it was hard harder than anything alive has any right to be feel for yourself if you likeits like midwinter ice or even stone it didnt fight back and all i can say is that im glad i only quit hitting it when pieces came off if it wasnt dead then it never would be has it moved since fralk asked no i guess i did kill it my sons and grandsons and i spent days hauling it back here to the castle what a job that was ternat said whistling with remembered strain yes reatur agreed it made me wonder all over again how the strange thing could ever have been alive its as heavy as stone and as hard to get from place to place but it did move by itself fralk turned an extra couple of eyestalks on it again you could tell me it sang songs and i would not argue with you it might do anything it might do nothing its done nothing since its been here ternat said well not quite reatur said most travelers i charge food or tools to see it over the years now that i think its earned me a tidy sum that i do believe fralk said its worth traveling a long way to see a wellspoken young male indeed reatur thought guest with me tonight he said expansively my ice is yours i thank you fralk said then he proceeded to wreck the fine impression he had made for he took the old proverb literally he reached out a couple of arms used his fingerclaws to scrape a good handful of ice from the wall and put it in his mouth very nice he said reatur saw ternat turn yellow with anger the domain master glanced down at himself he was the same color and no wonder envoy of the skarmer domains you forget yourself he said his voice was stiff as glacier ice in midwinter no domain master i do not for this i was sent here fralk took more ice and put it in his mouth as calmly as if he were munching it from the walls of his own castle suddenly his politeness seemed something he had assumed at will not native to him this is insolence reatur said why should i not send you back to your clanfather without the arms you have used to prove it fralk spun round in a circle which arms are those he asked when he stopped yes he was mocking reatur any two will do the domain master growled he had to give fralk reluctant credit the skarmer envoy went neither blue from fear nor an angry yellow you would be unwise to take them fralk said he was the very odor of good manners again reatur whose moods ran fast and deep began to see why this young male had been chosen ambassador like smooth ice reflecting the sun and hiding whatever lay beneath he did his clanfathers bidding without revealing himself in the process we come down to it then reatur said still trying to provoke a reaction from him why should i not because i aim to inherit this domain from you fralk said that is why i treated it as my home to be the chamber with the strange thing had no weapons in it reatur knew that his encircling eyes glanced around it anyway just in case one of the things he saw was ternats eyestalks twisting in a similar search another was that fralk had turned blue he was afraid now if he had been standing on fralks claws reatur would have been more than afraid shall i think you have gone mad and set you free on that account he said i could almost believe it why else would you speak so in the presence of a domain master and his eldest fralk slowly regained his greenish tint because the domains that come from the first bud of skarmer grow straitened in their lands just as mates must bud skarmer must grow how reatur thought about what he knew of the lay of the land west of the ervis gorge not much but one piece of knowledge came to him are not all the domains in the west skarmer all the way to the next great gorge they are fralk said we will be coming to the east across the ervis gorge he lies ternat exclaimed what will the skarmer domains do send one male at a time across the rope bridge let them after we have slain the first warrior and the second and if need be the third they will grow bored with dying and all will be as it has been before we will be coming fralk said we will be coming in force i do not think you will stop us you may reckon me witstruck but a year from now the mastery of these lands will be walking on its eyestalks of that i assure you suppose for the sake of talk you are not witstruck reatur said slowly why come to me to announce what you intend why not simply fall on me one night when none of the moons is in the sky because your domain lies at the eastern edge of the ervis gorge fralk said we would have you aid us if you will we know you have no great love for either of your neighbors you know that do you as a matter of fact reatur thought fralk had a point as far as he was concerned dordal was an idiot and grebur a maniac and both of them disgraces to the name of domain master stillwhy should i like your clanfather hogram better or any other skarmer why do you have the arrogance to claim my domain will be your own i have an eldest and he an eldest after him this domain is ours and has belonged to great clan omalo since the first bud should i tamely yield it to males sprung from a different bud yield it tamely and you will stay on as domain master for your natural life your sons and grandsons will not suffer save that all mates henceforward will take no buds from them resist and i will become domain master here as soon as your castle has been melted to water you and all of yours will die the choice is yours fralk sounded very sure of himself reatur thought he thought the skarmer domains could do what he said they could do reatur was convinced of that fralk was no clanfather though he lacked the years to have learned the difference between what one wishes even what one is sure of and what turns out your choice is no choice reatur said either way my line fails i will defend it as long as i may thank you clanfather ternat said quietly then his voice turned savage shall i now deal with thisthis clankiller as he deserves he moved to put himself between fralk and the one exit the skarmer envoy went blue again the penalty i told you of will fall on you if i come to harm here he gabbled from what you say it will fall anyhow ternat said so how are we worse off for punishing your filthy words let him go eldest reatur said shall we make ourselves into hunting undit as the skarmer seem to be he turned all his eyestalks away from fralk denying that the young male deserved to exist still speaking to ternat the domain master went on if ever he shows himself on our side of the gorge again it will be the worse for him now take him out and send him on his way as you say clanfather that was as close to criticism as ternat would let himself come he escorted fralk out of the little chamber reatur still kept his eyes averted from the skarmer male ternat was a good eldest the domain master thought unlike so many he did not stand around waiting for his father to die or as also happened sometimes try to speed the process along a good eldest reatur thought again the domain master walked slowly back into the great hall ternat soon returned some of his hands still had claws out reatur guessed that he had not been gentle in escorting fralk away he did not blame him for that what now clanfather ternat asked i dont know the admission made reatur unhappy none of my eyes sees any way the skarmer could make fralks boasts good is it the same with you yes but he would not have been here boasting if they did not have something war across a great gorge ternats eyestalks wiggled in disgust reatur felt the same way wars against neighboring domains were rarely pushed to extremes in the end after all everyone hereabouts sprang from the first omalo bud but the skarmer would care nothing for that would be aiming to plant their own buds on the local matesfralk curse him had come right out and said as much we will have to set a watch on the gorge ternat said hmm oh yes eldest lost in gloomy musings reatur had almost missed ternats words the domain masters wits started moving again see to that at once and i suppose we will have to send word to the rest of the omalo domains warning them of what may be happening and if nothing does what a laughingstock ill be he paused i wonder if that isnt the purpose of this whole affair to split me off from the rest of the domains and leave me alone vulnerable to the skarmer he hissed i dare not take the chance do i clanfather the answer must come from you reatur knew his eldest was right so long as ternat was in his power the younger male had and could have no responsibility of his own the domain masters six arms had to bear that burden alone send the messengers he decided better to be ready for a danger that does not come than off our guard to one that does you tend to it in my name in your name clanfather ternat agreed proudly he hurried off reatur started to follow then changed his mind instead he walked down the corridor to the mates chambers as they always did they cried out with joy when he opened the door they never failed to be delighted to see him reatur they shouted hello reatur look what were doing hello lamra morna peri numar he said patting each one of them in turn he did not stop until he had named and caressed them all he made a point of remembering their names unlike some clanfathers he treated mates as people as much as he could they could not help it that the sardonic saying as likely as an old mate meant something that would never happen they had a directness of their own a beautiful openness males outgrew too soon look reatur look what i did numar proudly showed him some scribbles she had made with a soft crumbly red stone on a piece of cured hide thats very good he said gravely it looks just like morna numar said it certainly does he agreed with a certain amount of relief now he would not have to ask what the marks were supposed to be numar might have told him or she might have had a tantrum he did not feel like coping with a tantrum at the moment he wanted the mates to be their usual happy selves to salve his anger and worry after the encounter with fralk the mates were exactly as he wished them to be and even that did not help see how big biyals buds are getting reatur lamra exclaimed biyal stepped up to show the domain master the six bulges that ringed her body one not far above each foot i wonder which is the male she said so do i reatur said gently i want to have buds lamra said i know you do lamra in spite of himself reatur felt worse instead of better he knew that biyals buds would break free of her when they were ripe and that she would die when that happened she knew it too and so did lamra but it meant nothing to them they were too young that was the one consolation of the life of a mate now to reatur it did not seem enough i want to have buds lamra repeated reatur i want to have buds right now i know lamra the domain master let the air hiss out through his breathing pores come here she squealed with glee and came they pressed together the other mates cheered them on in a part of his mind the cheering made reatur sadder but the exquisite sensations running through his body pushed the sadness far away roger houston we are set for coded transmission as ordered emmett bragg said he clicked off the transmitter and looked around the athenas cabin first codes theyve sent us since we got here he remarked he sounded casual but even without weightlessness the words would have hung in the air irv levitt asked the obvious question what are they telling us that they dont want the russians to hear about secrets his wife sarah spoke the word as if it were obscene she pointed to minerva rolling by on the monitor thats the enemy not the people on tsiolkovsky compared to whatevers down there the russians are our next of kin she sounded absolutely certain she usually did her husband thought a lot of mds he knew were like thatthey needed arrogant confidence to deal with their patients problems and it spilled over into everything else they did bragg only shrugged secret is what they ordered sarah secret is what theyll get he glanced over at sarah levitt in his quieter way he was at least as stubborn as she was his voice though stayed mild i expect thats why they handed the mission commanders chair to somebody like me ive been a soldier a long timei can take orders not just give em irv saw a dark flush rise to sarahs cheeks saw her purse her lips for an angry retort before she could get it out louise bragg spoke suppose we see what they sent us before we get ourselves all in an uproar sensible her husband said sarah nodded a moment later her short curly brown hair fanning out around her face at the motion good louise said she was a large calm blond woman about fifteen years younger than emmett irv remembered that she was braggs second wife they had not been married long when the selection process for athena began would emmett bragg have dumped his ex and gone after an engineer to help himself get picked absolutely irv thought that didnt mean they didnt care for each other had they not the ship was too cramped to hide it speed of light to houston time to react there speed of light back a quarter of an hour went by before the message came in bragg transcribed the code groups one by one and taped them so he would have a backup roger houston we copy he said when the transmission was done he unstrapped himself excuse me folks he said and pushed himself out of the cabin and down the passageway toward his compartment irv saw him pull a key from a pocket on his coveralls the cubicle he shared with louise unlike the other two had a locked drawer louise did not have a key for it once she had asked her husband what was in there he had grinned a lopsided grin and replied my girlfriend nobody had asked since now they had at least part of the answer i hate having someone else in charge of my fate this way sarah said now you know how patients feel irv told her she glanced sharply at him then gave a rueful nod freefall was relaxing anyhow after the nausea went away and louise bragg contrived to look almost boneless as she stretched herself in midair when theres nothing to do but wait she said you might as well be comfortable they waited after a while irv pulled a folding chess set with magnetic pieces out of his hip pocket he opened it up then shook his head two pawns was too far to be down to sargon the computer program was going to clean his clock again he knew he ought to resign and have another try he knew he was too stubborn to do it he tried a knight move thought better of it and put the piece back lie was still tinkering and not getting anywhere much when he heard emmett call pat frank come forward for a bit if you could a moment later bragg came gliding into the cabin he stopped himself on the back of his chair within a minute pat and frank marquard had joined everyone else in the cabin whats up emmett frank asked he sounded casual but his expression belied his tone he and pat both could tell something was up bragg had the veteran officers knack for turning ordinary words into an unmistakable order the mission commander glanced down at the sheet paper in his hand he was also holding irv saw a map minerva compiled from mariner and viking photos interesting was all he said louise would not let him get by with that come on era out with it she told him suspense isnt funny all right he said a little sheepishly he held up the map weve all known since t where viking landed havent we here he pointed not far west of the jotun canyon sure irv said everyone else nodded not sure theyve just done a pile of new computer work on the viking data and it turns out the lander actually came down here about fifty miles east of where they thought well have to adjust our landing site to conform to the new data louise honey itll mean more time on the computer for you sorry i expect ill manage she said which for a minute or so was the only break in the silence that followed her husbands announcement how veryconvenient sarah levitt said at last now we know and the russians dont both missions had intended to land as close to the viking touchdown point as possible only there could they be sure they would find intelligent life there might be anything on the other side of that canyon irv said pat marquard nodded vigorously he knew they were thinking along the same lines minervas big canyons were wider and deeper than anything earth knew each spring they carried meltwater from the south polar cap to the seas and lakes of the southern tropicsthough on minerva the word tropics had a strictly geographic meaning the great gorges had to be formidable barriers to both ideas and genes i reckon the russians will tell us same as well tell them what we come across on our side emmett bragg said his drawl had gotten thicker that happened irv had noticed when bragg did not want to come out with everything that was on his mind i think we ought to pass the word on to tsiolkovsky sarah said bragg raised an eyebrow if houston had wanted tsiolkovsky to know they wouldnt have coded the information before they sent it he sounded as though that closed the subject for him and expected it to for everyone else it didnt houston is on earth umptyump million miles from here the russians are right here with us sarah said right now i have more in common with them than with a pack of chairwarmers back in texas really frank marquard agreed is there intelligent life in houston i think theyre right emmett irv said this is going to be tough enough even sharing what we have its too big for us not to he spoke with some hesitation he was anything but combative and did not relish the idea of getting into a shouting match when the mission commander blew a fuse but bragg surprised him instead of losing his temper or even pretending to for effect he looked over at his wife and asked honey how many coded transmissions has tsiolkovsky received since we assumed minerva orbit let me see she fiddled with the computer at least twentynine plus however many they got when we were on the far side of the planet and couldnt monitor them how many of those have they shared with us louise did not have to check that next one will be the first oh but thats the russians though thats just the way they pat marquard stumbled to a halt as she realized where her words were taking her do things she finished lamely irv shook his head bragg couldnt have had that turn out better for him if he had planned it for weeks and now the commander took the advantage saying if you allhe carefully made it two wordsthink im not sorry to put some distance between tsiolkovsky and us i wont say youre wrong minervas a big place why rub elbows with the russians when we dont have to what if we end up needing something they have and we dont or the other way round sarah had not given up canyon or no canyon we wont be that far from them bragg said if anybody needs anything that bad he can holler for it what if we need a ride home sarah asked softly frank marquard winced irv felt himself doing the same thing but bragg said fatly anybody who needs a ride home is dead unless he can make it on minerva until another expedition comes along athenas lifesupport wont take more than six people home and neither will tsiolkovskys for that folks we are on our own wed all best remember it too the words hit home irv had lived on athena long enough to have grown used to it as he would have to say an apartment being reminded of how fragile a place it was hurt but tsiolkovsky was just as fragile so the territory viking saw was really on the east side of jotun canyon then not the west irv asked at braggs nod the anthropologist went on what is the west side like then are the russians going to try to fly tsiolkovsky down into badlands if they are i say we call them and the hell with houston i wouldnt do that to anybody bragg frowned but then his face cleared as he thought it over thats fair he said well find out he folded the map and stuck it into a breast pocket of his coveralls it was not nearly detailed enough to show him what he needed he pulled the nasa photographic atlas of minerva off a shelf the velcro that held the book in place let go with a scratchy sound of protest the mission commander riffled through the pages till he found the plate he needed he held the book open five heads craned toward it looks to be flatland and low hills same as well be landing in none of the miles and miles of scree and boulders you see around the edges of the polar caps and no big erosion features they arent taking any worse chances than we are frank marquard studied the photo with a professionally appraising glance when he said hes right irv knew that any chance to overturn braggs decision was gone so did his wife all fight emmett sarah said but if they dont trust us once were all down on minerva theyll have reason now they dont trust us now bragg answered and you know what i dont trust them either thats all right the best way to deal with em is to keep one hand on your wallet that way you never lose track of where it is sarah snorted the marquards went back to the labs in the rear section of athena to return to whatever they had been doing and when tolmasov called from the tsiolkovsky nobody said anything about code groups when she and her husband were in the almost privacy of their cubicle though sarah levitt said i still dont like it irv not just that we didnt tell the russians but that word about the changed coordinates came through today the way it did it just seems too pat somehow i know what you mean he said that bothers me too its almost as if houstons known all along that the coordinates they gave out to everybody werent the right ones and just decided now to let us in on it he had meant the words as a joke but once out they had an appalling ring of probability to them he felt sarahs slim frame stiffen i wish you hadnt said that she told him i dont want to believe it likely it isnt true he said though he doubted that himself give me one good reason why not sarahs tone said she did not believe he could come up with one but he did when was the last time the united states was able to hang on to a secret for thirteen years a point she admitted at last not a very consoling one but a point you pick the oddest ways to make me feel better did you have something else in mind he asked hopefully no she said after a small pause im tired im grouchy i wouldnt enjoy it much now and i dont think i could make it much fun for you youre very annoying when you make sense you know he said that coaxed a small almost reluctant laugh from her but she went to sleep all the same after a while so did irv oleg lopatins face tolmasov thought unkindly was made for frowning those eyebrowsthe colonel still thought of them as brezhnev brows though the chairman was seven years dead and thoroughly discreditedcame down like clouds covering the sun you should have asked the americans about the coded message lopatin said i did not see how i could oleg borisovich they have never asked us about any we receive and besides tolmasov added unconsciously echoing emmett bragg i did not think they would tell us they would have sent it in clear if they did not care whether we heard it you should have asked them anyway valery bryusov said why do you say that valery aleksandrovich tolmasov asked more sharply than he had intended the linguist did not usually speak up for lopatin if he did he probably had a good reason tolmasov wondered if he had missed something bryusov tugged at his mustache the gesture had become a habit of his in the months since he had let it grow it was redblond with a few white hairs a startling contrast to the hair on his head which was about the color of tolmasovs he tugged again then said we send things in code because it is our habit to send things in code even oleg borisovich will agree i think that it would not matter much if the americans found out what was in a good many of them lopatins frown got deeper i suppose that may be true in a few cases he admitted grudgingly tolmasov knew it was true he was a trifle surprised the kgb man did too lopatin went on what of it though the crew of athena must know that too bryusov said ticking off the point on his finger like the academician he was they must have studied us as we studied them they though boast of how opento say nothing of prodigalthey are with information if they send in code then it must be something unusual and important and so worth asking about you may have something at that tolmasov said let me think it over perhaps next time we talk with athena i will put the question to bragg heating what he says could be interesting i suppose my congratulations valery aleksandrovich shota rustaveli said even a theologian would be proud of reasoning that convoluted here it may even have reached the truth always an unexpected bonus thank you so very much shota mikheilovich bryusov said always a privilege to assist such a distinguished scholar rustaveli replied dark eyes twinkling bryusov scowled and floated off to find something to do elsewhere tolmasov smiled at his retreating back if he didnt know better by this time than to get into a duel of ironies with the georgian biologist it was nobodys fault but his own you would talk with the americans too then shota mikheilovich and try to find out what houston sent them lopatin asked oh not me they find my english even worse than you do my russian rustaveli deliberately exaggerated his slight accent he hung in midair upside down relative to lopatin and tolmasov it did not seem to bother him at all will you ever be serious lopatin growled i doubt it whistling rustaveli sailed down the corridor after bryusov georgians lopatin said softly hes good at what he does tolmasov meant it as a reproof but was not sure it came out that way down deep he thought the kgb man had a point rustaveli was the only nonrussian on tsiolkovsky everyone else found him indolent and mercurial very much the stereotypical man of the south he found them stodgy and did not try to hide it let us see how well he does in minervan weather lopatin said him and the americans both he chuckled nastily and mimed a shiver tolmasov nodded after smolensk no winter held much in the way of terror for him but rustaveli had come back about the americans i do not know oleg borisovich he said exquisitely polite as always but i will do well enough if i should have trouble perhaps katerina will keep me warm it was tolmasovs turn to frown russians credited georgians with legendary success with women shota did nothing to downplay the legend and even though he and the doctor had quarreled the way her eyes followed him made tolmasov wish she looked at him like that she gave herself to tolmasov these days and he was sure she enjoyed what they did together still somehow it was not the same is your boasting all you want to tell us the pilot asked stiffly we have more important things to do than listening to it no no sergei konstantinovich rustaveli sounded wounded i just wanted to remind you that the odds are it will not matter in the long run whether you talk with athena or not and why not tolmasov fought for patience maybe once rustaveli got the jokes out of his system he would settle down for a while for the moment the georgian did not seem to be joking because very probably moscow has the code broken and will send us what it says hmm tolmasov and lopatin looked at each other something to that the kgb man said after a brief hesitation even here so many kilometers from home he wondered who might be listening i am glad you think so oleg borisovich rustaveli said he lifted a finger as if suddenly reminded of something i almost forgotyuri wants to see you me why lopatin sounded suspicious but only a little yuri ivanovich voroshilov spent as much time as he could in his laboratory the chemist tolmasov thought found things easier to deal with than people it was quite in character for him to treat rustaveli as nothing more than a biped carrier pigeon smiling the georgian sank his barb hes all out of ice and wants to borrow your heart for a few minutes why you lopatin grabbed for the buckle of the safety harness that held him in his seat tolmasov brought his hand down on top of the kgb mans no brawling he snapped lopatin kept struggling for a few seconds to open the harness then subsided tolmasov turned his glare on rustaveli i will log this incident you are reprimanded there will be no repetitions yes comrade colonel rustaveli clicked his heels a gesture only ludicrous in freefall reprimand all you like but it means nothing you will think differently when you get back to earth tolmasov ground out are you a mutineer he was a military man he could not think of anything worse to calm rustaveli no merely practical the biologist answered quite unruffled if we get back to earth i will be a hero of the soviet union reprimand or no if we dont the reprimand certainly will not matter to me truly sergei konstantinovich you should think things through more carefully the colonel gaped at him the worst of it was that rustaveli even made a twisted kind of sense there there the georgian said seeing his popeyed expression to please you i will even accept the reprimand provided you also log the kgb man for mocking my people lopatin let out a scornful laugh he knew how likely that was so did tolmasov under mikhail gorbachev the kgb might have been made to answer for misconduct too bad gorbachev had only lasted nine months tolmasov still wondered if his cerebral hemorrhage had been of the mm variety youve talked yourself out of your bloody reprimand the colonel told rustaveli i hope youre satisfied now go away grinning the biologist sailed off the male shoved fralk toward the bridge go on he said harshly never let us see you on this side again see me you shall fralk said but only to himself he stepped out onto the cables of the bridge once you are across we will cut it the male told him if you do not hurry we will not bother to wait fralk hurried his toes wrapped around the lower rope his fingerclaws gripped the upper one he walked out over empty space on the eastern side of the gorge the one he was leaving the males of reaturs clan grew smaller the western side though the lands of the skarmer clans did not seem any closer even down close to its bottom the gorge was too wide to yield him sight of progress so soon and with one wall visibly receding while the other appeared fixed in place fralk had the eerie feeling that the canyon was stretching itself like a live thing as he traveled that he might never reach the far side the wind whistled around above below over the heart of the gorge fralk let an eyestalk turn downward and another up the other four as usual looked all about only the thin lines of the rope bridge extending in the direction he had come and toward his destination gave his vision a clue he was not a mote suspended in the center of infinite space the sensation was so daunting that he stopped forgetting the males threat if the gorge were infinitely wide how could movement matter he looked down and down and down to the boulders far far below for a giddy moment he thought they were calling to him if he let go of the ropes for how long would he fall that reminded him he might indeed fall regardless of whether he let go the omalo males would know how long someone took to cross the bridge and surely would allow him no excess time not when they knew he and his wanted to supplant them telling that to reatur had perhaps been less than wise but then fralk had reckoned there was a fair chance the domain master would yield how little folk on one side of a gorge understood those on the other fralk hurried onward every tremor of the bridge in the wind set him to quivering with fright thinking he was about to be pitched into the abyss at last the far side of the gorge began to appear closer while the one from which he had come seemed frozen and distant in space the reverse of the stretching he had nervously imagined before the males he could see were his own solid skarmer budmates not scrawny easterners they helped pull him off the bridge and clustered around him what word eldest of eldest called niress the commander of the crossing fralk gave it to him war a moment later as if to underscore it the bridge jerked like a male who had just touched a stunbush then like that same imaginary male a moment later it went limp and hung down into the gorge fralk feared its stone supports would give way now that it was not attached to anything on the far side but they held niresss eyestalks wriggled with mirth as if cutting the bridge will stop us he said he and fralk began the long climb up to the top of the gorge the red numbers on the digital readout spun silently down to zero initiate separation sequence emmett bragg said initiating his wife flipped a toggle strapped in his seat irv levitt heard distant metallic bangs and rattles different from the ones he no longer consciously noticed after a while louise said separation sequence complete were on our own irv thought as if to emphasize the point athenas monitor gave him an image of the rocket motor package that had accompanied the ship to minerva while he watched the motors slowly grew smaller as they drifted away they would wait in orbit while the hypersonic transport that was athena proper went down to the planet andif everything worked exactly rightreturned to rejoin them for the trip back to earth he glanced over at his wife whose seat was next to his in the cabin sarahs answering smile was forced just another flight to a new research lab he said trying to cheer her by coming out with the most ridiculous thing he could think of i hate them all she said i dont like being in any situation where i dont have full control of things and i cant do that in an airlineror here she added pointedly once were down ill be all right he nodded a lot of doctors he knew felt that way some of them much more than sarah that was he supposed why so many of them flew their own planes he smiled sarah would get her chance at that athena thank you sergei konstantinovich bragg said the same to you and tsiolkovsky give our regards to comrade reguspatoff to whom puzzlement crept into the russian colonels precise voice nichevo bragg replied it doesnt matter as you wish tolmasov said an oral shrug we will see you on the ground then we also are about to uncouple expected as much bragg said well both be busy for a while so ill say goodbye now athena out he cut the transmission reguspatoff frank marquard asked he made a good straight man registeredus patent office bragg explained with a grin that looked more like a wolfs lollingtongued laugh than any gentler mirth or do you think tsiolkovsky looks so much like athena just by accident its bigger frank said why dont we copy their rockets i wish we would bragg said well we do what we can with what weve got not too bad i suppose well be down ahead of them his wife broke in or maybe we wont radar shows two images from tsiolkovsky id say that means they have uncoupled from their engine pack the mission commanders head jerked toward the screen son of a bitch he said softly he picked up the mike punched the transmit button and started speaking russian athena to tsiolkovsky tsiolkovsky here lopatin the engineers english was accented but easy to follow tell your boss hes a sandbagging bastard sandbagging i do not understand this word lopatin said bragg had left it in his own language a moment later colonel tolmasov came on he sounded like a man fighting laughter i do emmett that is uncultured you should talk you will excuse me if i lack time for casual conversation brigadier we are as you said rather busy at the moment tsiolkovsky out the radio crackled to life tolmasov here good luck athena thank you sergei konstantinovich bragg said the same to you and tsiolkovsky give our regards to comrade reguspatoff to whom puzzlement crept into the russian colonels precise voice nichevo bragg replied it doesnt matter as you wish tolmasov said an oral shrug we will see you on the ground then we also are about to uncouple expected as much bragg said well both be busy for a while so ill say goodbye now athena out he cut the transmission reguspatoff frank marquard asked he made a good

he picked up the mike punched the transmit button and started speaking russian athena to tsiolkovsky tsiolkovsky here lopatin the engineers english was accented but easy to follow tell your boss hes a sandbagging bastard sandbagging i do not understand this word lopatin said bragg had left it in his own language a moment later colonel tolmasov came on he sounded like a man fighting laughter i do emmett that is uncultured you should talk you will excuse me if i lack time for casual conversation brigadier we are as you said rather busy at the moment tsiolkovsky out temperature is up a little louise said were starting to get into the atmosphere her husband glanced at the gauge then at the radar altimeter still well inside specs the carbonfiber matrix can take more than shuttle tiles and having a machine with a skin all in one piece means we dont need to worry about spending our minerva time gluing those little suckers back into place now there irv thought was a really alarming notion a thin whistle began to fill the cabin and rose toward a shriek i thought by now i knew every noise athena could make pat marquard said nervously it isnt athena frank answered its minervathe wind of our passage his voice held awe irv understood why no one but theyand half a dozen russians some unknown number of miles awayhad heard the wind of another world his wife thought of something else i wonder what the minervans will make of our noise coming down when the shuttles landed at edwards wed hear the boom in la pat said and thats without the noise from the ramjet and turbojet sections of our motor emmett bragg chuckled theyll be hiding under their beds if they have beds and speaking of ramjets he checked the altimeter again and athenas velocity were low enough and slow enough to fire it up and save our liquid oxygen for the trip back up im shutting down the lox pump louise acknowledged she said a moment later she added first time i ever heard mach six called slow next to what weve been doing honey its just a mosey in the park irv sided with louise mach six was no mosey so far as he was concerned despite aggressive soundproofing the noise was up too the pump was no longer thumping and clacking away but the shriek of minervan air coming in through the ramjet inlet more than made up for that it reminded irv of a dentists drill the size of baltimore his teeth cringed at the very idea his seat was padded and contoured but he still felt as though he weighed tons are we really sure minervas gravity is only a couple of percent higher than ours he asked plaintively or are we still decelerating yes were sure and yes we are emmett replied but before irv had a chance to be relieved the mission commander went on but not enough to do anything about our weight he sounded amused irv groaned so did frank sarah felt strong enough to raise an arm and point to the monitor we just passed something big a castle a temple a barracks could be anything irv agreed i wish we knew more about where the minervans are technologically they dont have atomic energy and they dont have radio but theres a lot of difference between where we were in c and in or in bc emmett put in he enjoyed sticking pins in people to make them jump this time it didnt work irv had the facts to shoot him down no big buildings in bc he said smugly then he shut up as another whateveritwas went by on the screen clouds blurred the view but he still recognized the pattern on the ground surrounding the building those are fields down there youre right pat said you see those grooved circles in the middle of nowhere when you fly over irrigated farms in desert country but the linesplow marks would those be irv sarah said on earth sure here who knows he answered the lines arent straight she observed what does that mean maybe contour plowing maybe the minervans dont know what straight lines are thats what were here to find out emmett said yeah as athena flew over a pair of volcanoes with glaciers snaking down from their peaks those are smaug and ancalagon he added now i know where we are we need to head just a touch further east he made the adjustment they flew lower and lower slower and slower as they dropped below feet and mach one emmett cut in the turbines the engines went from a shriek to a fullthroated roar this is your pilot speaking bragg said thank you for flying minerva air the cabin attendants will be starting the movie shortly please keep your seat belts fastened athena does sound just like a tt now doesnt she irv said the mission commanders deadpan dead perfect delivery made him realize consciously what he had been feeling in his bones not even a firstclass seat on a big jet though had the padding and room this one did on the other hand airline passengers didnt need so much either hows she handle emmett frank asked he had flownlight planes before he went into astronaut training and t jet trainers since if anything happened to bragg he would try to get athena home neither he nor anyone else relished the prospect bragg thought for a moment before he answered depends on what youre comparing it to its no fighter but its a long way from being a mildly aerodynamic brick like the shuttle too more like fun or more like work marquard persisted in space its fun here its work but not pickandshovel work white collar you might say im not really dressed for it grinning he ran his hand down the front of the blue nasa coverall wheres tsiolkovsky pat asked louise bragg checked the radar well west of us and a couple of miles higher everyone in the cabin whoopednone of them wanted the russians to beat them down in baikonur our name is cursed when they find out we landed first irv sang mangling tom lehrer in a good cause i wonder what they think of our bearing louise said why arent they calling to ask us about it they figure we screwed up her husband guessed tolmasovs just gonna let us sitting in his chair id do the exact same thing sarah was still watching the monitor she gasped will you look at that other gasps followed shortly irv had seen plenty of pictures of jotun canyon taken from space he had flown over the grand canyon half a dozen times neither did anything to prepare him for what he was seeing jotun canyon was a great gouge on the face of the world three miles deep a dozen miles across even at jet speeds it took a minute and a half to cross thats my spot frank declared just start me at the edge give me plenty of rope and let me work my way down if jotun doesnt cut through a billion and a half years of stratigraphy ill eat my hat bragg flew athena south along the eastern rim of the canyon we swing inland when it jogs southwest he said then we start looking for a place to set down he laughed a couple of syllables worth of laugh after the shuttle that lookingaround time is a luxury they were down very low now low enough to see individual treesif those tall dark green stationary things were treesin the forests snow clung to them though summer was about to start the canyon changed direction bragg flew athena away fromit in a couple of minutes he flew over some little rolling hills seeing them made irv sit up even against gravitys new and unpleasant grip he was not the only one who recognized them thats where viking set down pat exclaimed sure does look that way bragg agreed he flew on before long he flew over another one of the large buildings and the fields that surrounded it hate to rip a half mile track in a fellows crop he said but i dont think were gonna do any better anybody really want to try talking me out of it irv thought about it but in the end he didnt athena he hoped would be strange enoughand big enoughto win the humans the benefit of the doubt nobody else said anything either all right bragg said im gonna do it lets go around for one more pass to kill some speed and get nice and lined up and then we land athena was so close to the ground that on the monitor irv saw things moving around down there things he felt the hair on his arms and the back of his neck tingle as the realization hit him those were not things those were minervans altitude feet speed louise said as her husband swung athena down three hundred feet speed feet speed arming the landing gear emmett said he lifted the switchs cover pushed it to the on position louises reading never paused a hundred fifty feet speed deploying landing gear emmett uncovered and pushed the switch next to the one he had just hit athena really seemed a plane to irv now the noises and bumps as the wheels came down were the same as the ones he knew from delta jets ninety feet speed landing gear down and locked bragg hesitated then bared his teeth in what was almost a smile we owe the russians this onethe undercarriage is borrowed from the ilyushin iit theres no better big plane in the world for getting in and out of unpaved fields fifty feet speed feet speed there was a jar down hot damn were down bragg said exultantly wheels locked he added a moment later he reached out with his left hand and slammed the speed brake all the way forward i hope you have something more historic than hot damn were down planned for when we step outside sarah remarked as they bounced along the ground did i say that bragg sounded amazed so was irv at how gentle the landing was he had experienced bumpier ones at dulles lets hear it for russian undercarriages he said they rolled to a stop pat was looking at an instrument cluster that had not had much to do since it was installed temperature degrees humidity percent wind out of the south at six knots a lovely almostsummer day she finished if youre an ice cube irv said emmett bragg was on the radio houston this is athena we contacted the surface of minerva at pm landing extremely nominal baby its cold outside athena out he got up and walked back to a panel just aft of the cabin he might have been on parade he conceded nothing to so many months of freefall irv watched admiringly soon enough he would have to start walking too he was in no hurry about it like the meteorology package the panel bragg opened had not been important while athena was in space now it was the mission commander started taking out parkas snow pants boots headgear and pistols and ammunition pouches just in case he said holding them up time to go meet the natives the scream in the sky faded a littleenough to let reatur hear other screams in the castle the mates and newbudded males were making an unholy racket so were a good many adults reatur did not blame them were he without a domain masters dignity to uphold he would have screamed himself the first thud had slapped against the walls like a boulder of ice when everything jumped reaturs first thought was quake he took an instinctive step toward the doorway while his eyestalks sprang upward to see if the roof was going to come down on him but only that one jolt came funny kind of quake he said out loud he started to go on about his business but then the roar started fear of a quake at least was a familiar kind of fear the bellow overhead kept getting louder and shriller until came out of its belly there was something worse to be said after all enoph said it its going to come down in our fields reatur had never seen legs like the monsters they ended in clumps of fat black round things like no claws or sucker pads or hooves the domain master knew the deliberate way the legs descended from its belly was new to him too or was it the arm that had come out of the strange thing had moved rather like that were they related he did not think the monster would be easy to kill as the strange thing had been too bad dust and crops and a little drifted snow flew as the monsters legs touched the ground behind it crops withered as if it voided raw heat perhaps it did even from some distance away reatur felt a lick of warm air as it went by the castle the monster moved ever more slowly at last not far from the edge of the cleared land it came to a stop the noise died reatur waited for the monster to notice him and his malesor at least his castle the only thing nearby of a size to compare to itand to approach but it did nothing of the kind it stayed where it was as if waiting for him to come to it the domain master wanted to run to hide he saw though that while half the eyestalks of his males were turned on the monster the other half pointed toward him these were his sons and sons of sons and sons of sons of sons they were under his power and would be as long as he lived a third son of a fifth son of a fourth son might dream of becoming clanfather and taking a clanfathers power one day and be safe in the dreaming knowing it would never turn true but reatur knew he was as much in his males power as they in his what he wanted meant nothing here he knew what he had to do lets go see what the cursed thing is he said he hefted his spear and started walking toward thethe thing he told himself firmly if he did not think of it as a monster maybe it would turn out not to be one pride flowed all the way out to the tips of his fingerclaws when he saw how many of his males followed him against an ordinary foeeven against the skarmer males curse them if fralk was not a liar since the moment he was budded reatur would have expected to find all his males coming after him here though he found he could not blame the few who hung back he muttered angrily as he came to the track of destruction the monno the thinghad left behind its round feet made grooved tracks that pressed the ground down how much did it weigh to do that he looked at shriveled sagging plant stems and muttered again how much of his crop had he lost why did the monster have to choose him why not the skarmer who really deserved a monsters attention thinking of it as a thing was not working he gave up shall i make a cast at it clanfather a very young male asked as long as its content to just sit there im willing to let it reatur said dryly what if you made it roar again he quivered at the very idea at such close range the noise would probably tear his eyestalks off the youngster who did not seem to have thought of that lowered his spear in a hurry surround it reatur said his males moved to obey unfortunately they reminded him of so many little runnerpests trying to surround a nosver male the monsters round feet alone were taller than any of his people its size was not the only curiousno more than curious alienthing about it every animal reatur had ever seen was arranged the same way males and mates were with limbs and appendages spaced evenly all around its body the monster was different its front end was nothing like its back the only pieces that matched each other were the ones that would have resulted from its being split down the middle lengthwise and even that limited symmetry was not absolute for on the far side of the creature ternat shouted clanfather a mouth is opening a moment later the domain masters eldest amended no its doorway beasts are coming out of it reatur saw no such doorway on his side on my way he yelled back greatly daring he ran under the monsters belly if it stooped he would only be a smear on the ground and ternat the new domain master it did not stoop breathing hard reatur emerged from its shadow only enoph and a couple more of the bolder males had followed him more were taking the long way around the monster as with those who had stayed back by the castle reatur did not blame them only when he was back in the sunlight did he let himself think on what a fool he had been fortunately he had no time to brood about it ternat and other males were pointing with eyestalks arms and weapons came out of its belly there was something worse to be said after all enoph said it its going to come down in our fields reatur had never seen legs like the monsters they ended in clumps of fat black round things like no claws or sucker pads or hooves the domain master knew the deliberate way the legs descended from its belly was new to him too or was it the arm that had come out of the strange thing had moved rather like that were they related he did not think the monster would be easy to kill as the strange thing had been too bad dust and crops and a little drifted snow flew as the monsters legs touched the ground behind it crops withered as if it voided raw heat perhaps it did even from some distance away reatur felt a lick of warm air as it went by the castle the monster moved ever more slowly at last not far from the edge of the cleared land it came to a stop the noise died reatur waited for the monster to notice him and his malesor at least his castle the nly thing nearby of a size to compare to itand to approach but it did nothing of the kind it stayed where it was as if waiting for him to come to it the domain master wanted to run to hide he saw though that while half the eyestalks of his males were turned on the monster the other half pointed toward him these were his sons and sons of sons and sons of sons of sons they were under his power and would be as long as he lived a third son of a fifth son of a fourth son might dream of becoming clanfather and taking a clanfathers power one day and be safe in the dreaming knowing it would never turn true but reatur knew he was as much in his males power as they in his what he wanted meant nothing here he knew what he had to do lets go see what the cursed thing is he said he hefted his spear and started walking toward thethe thing he told himself firmly

on what a fool he had been fortunately he had no time to brood about it ternat and other males were pointing with eyestalks arms and weapons there clanfather do you see them ternat cried arent they the oddest things you ever looked at they certainly are the domain master agreed absently he was too busy stating at the weird creatures to think much about what he said the things were a mottled green and brown all but one part of theirheads those were pinkish and had eyes that looked amazingly like peoples eyes except that they were not on stalks one of the creatures turned so reatur could see the other side of its head it had no eyes there it only had two arms too now that he had seen all the way around it and like its fellows only two absurdly long legs how he wondered did the things keep from falling over smoke is coming out of them shouted the young male who had wanted to spear the giant monster out of which these smaller beasts had come the worst of it was the youngster was right smoke streamed from the openings just below the creatures alarming eyes the young male waved his spear one of the creatures reached for something it carded near where that ridiculous pair of legs joined his body it held the thing in a pawno not a paw reatur saw a hand even if it had too many fingers and the thing that hand was holding whatever it was was no random stone or chunk of ice it had the purposeful shape of something made to carry out a specific task which meant or could mean dont throw that spear reatur shouted half an eighteen males had been ready to hurl their spearsthe creatures walking on the monster made far more tempting targets than that huge thing itself at the domain masters cry they all guiltily lowered their weapons each sure that reatur had shouted at him alone i think theyre people reatur went on had he not been clanfather he was sure the males would have hooted him down as it was they respected his rank but he knew they did not believe him even ternat who had a mind with more arms than most said theyre too ugly to be people ugly that had not even occurred to reatur the creatures were as far outside his criteria for judging such matters as was the strange thing back at the castle they arent ugly fralk now hes ugly that got eyestalks wiggling with mirth and brought the males back toward his way of thinking these things theyre justdifferent up above him the creatures were making noise of their own some had voices that sounded much like his others used deeper more rumbling tones none of their babble sounded like any language he knew but it did not sound like animal noises either quiet reatur said the crowd of excited males obeyed slowly when at last silence settled the domain master turned four of his eyes on the creatures above him i dont want any trouble with you he told them pointing first at himself and then at them to emphasize his words he set his spear on the ground as he had hoped his speaking when the rest of the males were quiet drew the strange creatures attention to him they turned their eyes his waywhich brought on another thought was that the only direction in which they could see he decided to worry about it laterit was just one more weirdness among so many meanwhile the creature that was holding the whateveritwas put it back in the pouch where it had come from reatur chose to take that as a good sign the creature held up an arm reatur did the same the creature stuck up one finger reatur did the same one he said the creatures rumbled a reply reatur tried to imitate the noise it made then said one again this time the creature came out with a rather blurry version of the same word you were fight clanfather ternat said they are people or they arent animals anyway no they arent reatur said this reminds me of the language lessons we go through whenever a traveler comes from so far away he hasnt picked up trade talk the domain master returned his attention to the creature above him he hoped the byplay with his eldest had not distracted the thing evidently notit was getting something out of an opening in its mottled hide something flat and square the side reatur could see was plain white the creature came to the edge of the monsters back it looked down at reatur then surprised himas if anything about it were anything but a surpriseby bending its legs and stooping it reached down holding the flat square out to him be careful clanfather it might be dangerous ternat said thank you for worrying reatur said he held up an arm just the same a goodly gap remained between his fingerclaws and the creatures hand he waved in invitation urging it to come down to join him and his males he wondered if it understood and wondered what it meant by shaking its head back and forth refusal evidently it did not come down but it did let the flat square fall the square thing flipped over and over in the air reatur saw that its other side was not just white there was some kind of design on it but the thing was turning too fast for him to tell what he grabbed for it and missed it fell to the ground naturally it landed with the plain white side on top he widened so that he could pick it up he turned it overand almost dropped it in amazement the strange thing he exclaimed holding it up so more males could see it was a picture of the thing he had killed the thing he and his males had dragged with so much labor back to the castle and what a picture he had never imagined an artist could draw with such detail with new respect he used two eyes to look up at the creatures still standing on the monster while he used two more to keep examining that incredible image the creatures had more abilities than monsterriding it seemed they were watching him too they were so peculiar he realized that they might not understand that he recgnized the strange thing he pointed at that unbelievable picture at himself back to the castle and at the picture again by their reaction they understood that they yelled leapt about and hugged one another so tightly reatur wondered if they were coupling then he laughed at himself for his foolishness they were all about the same size so they surely were all males that made sense he thought mates by their nature were not travelers travelers his thoughts abruptly turned practical travelers traveled for a reason if thesepeople he made himself thinkwere wandering artists he wondered how much they would want for a portrait of him no harm trying to find out tolmasov clicked off the radio with a snarl of frustrated rage not first he growled that damned uncultured old american son of a pig beat us down despair lay on him heavy as gravity they may have been first sergei konstantinovich but we were better valery bryusov said trying to console him they are eighty kilometers east of where they should be and across the chasm from us they will not have an easy time returning tolmasov only grunted he looked through the window seeing out only by way of monitors was one thing for which he emphatically did not envy athena television to him was not quite real it could lie so easily that even the truth became untrustworthy glass now a man could trust streaks smears and all to the eye the country reminded him of the siberian tundra where tsiolkovskys crew had trained it was gently rolling land with patches of snow here and there from a distance the plants looked like plants tolmasov was no botanist some were dark green some brown some yellow he did not see anything moving he had set tsiolkovsky down well away from the buildings he saw in the landing approach it was not that he wanted to or could keep the landing secretas well keep sunrise hidden but if the minervans came to him he would have an easier time meeting them on his terms he got out of his seat and walked over to the closet full of warm clothes whats the temperature outside katerina fyodorovna he asked she checked the thermometer one above brr shota rustaveli gave a theatrical shiver the five russians even quiet voroshilov laughed at him a degree above freezingthat was weather to be enjoyed not endured tolmasov thought it is early afternoon at a season that is the equivalent of may in a southern latitude that corresponds to havanas dr zakharova pointed out and tolmasov felt his mirth slip russian summer was brief but it was there on minerva the weather did not get a whole lot warmer than this thank you for coming to my defense katerina in these bleak circumstances rustaveli said the doctor murmured something so did tolmasov under his breath where had the georgian learned to sound like a courtier from some perfumed court and worse to do it so well the colonel drew calf length felt valenki over his feet and put his arms through the sleeves of his quilted telogreika the rest of the crew except for lopatin and voroshilov crowded around to do likewise next to the jackets boots and prosaic thermal underwear hung six fulllength sable coats for bad weather bryusov ran a loving hand down one of them here is something the americans cannot match he said and here is something else oleg lopatin added he had opened a locked cabinet not far from the protective gear he started passing out weapons and brown plastic magazines tolmasov took his gratefully even though it was the new model akt with small caliber high velocity ammunition and not the akt he had trained with a kalashnikov was a kalashnikov a good friend to have if the going got rough how long shall we wait for the natives to come to us before we start looking for them rustaveli asked as all of them but lopatin and voroshilov stood in front of the airlock doctrine was two people on tsiolkovsky at all times one of them able to fly the ship and lopatin was backup pilot they went through the lock two by two tolmasov and bryusov first the pilot stood on tsiolkovskys left wing and stared out at a world not his own the view was broader than the one from the windows but not much differentboring barren superficially familiar terrain a thrill ran through the colonel all the same he had been in his teens when buzz aldrin had first set foot on the moon well aldrin was envying him today the locks outer door came open behind him katerina and rustaveli emerged and looked around the georgian tugged his jacket tighter around him tolmasov smiled to himself rustaveli was carrying a chainlink ladder he fixed it to brackets on the edge of the wing and let it unroll the other end landed on the ground with a metallic whump the biologist cocked an eyebrow at tolmasov i suppose youd shoot me if i tried to go down ahead of you i would try not to hit anything vital tolmasov said rustaveli laughed bowed and stood aside with a sweeping gesture of invitation tolmasov slung his rifle stood and started down the ladder he was glad he had managed to keep his tone light the way his hands had tightened on the rifle at rustavelis impudent suggestion made him know he was only half joking the ground felt like ground under his feet he took a few steps away from the ship and away from the shadow of the wing he glanced up at the sun did it seem too small in the sky hard to tell the more so as he had got used to its shrinking as tsiolkovsky traveled outward he was sure though that nowhere on earth was the skyor what he could see of it through patchy cloudsquite this shade of greenish blue the ladder rattled and clanked katerina zakharova lowered herself down onto the minervan surface she took two heavy deliberate steps then looked at her footprints humanitys marks on a new world she murmured ah but the other question is what marks will it leave on us shota rustaveli came next tolmasov would have bet on that if bryusov had tried preceding the georgian the linguist likely would have arrived on minerva headfirst a moment later bryusov did join the other three he looked ill at ease and soon revealed why i am not of much use here until we actually meet the minervans that left him wide open to a sardonic retort from rustaveli but rather to tolmasovs surprise it did not come instead just as lopatin shouted in his earphone he heard the biologist say quietly i do not think you will be useless long valery aleksandrovich rustaveli was pointing tolmasovs eyes followed his finger a minervan had been hiding behind a stone big enough to make tolmasov glad tsiolkovskys undercarriage missed it now the native came out moving slowly toward the waiting humans it looked like its picture that should not have surprised tolmasov but somehow it did what he did next was as hard as anything else in his life he stepped aside saying valery aleksandrovich now i am not of much use you and shota mikheilovich must go forward from here the man who covers is as useful as the one who advances rustaveli said hearing an army phrase from him caught tolmasov off guard so did finding out the georgian meant it literally rustaveli set down his kalashnikov before he walked away from tsiolkovsky to meet the minervan after a moments hesitation so did bryusov the colonel automatically shuffled a few steps sideways so his companions would not be between him and the minervan he turned his head to tell katerina to do the same thing but she already had she nodded at him you see i was listening after all through those endless drills she said he dipped his head in acknowledgment their gloved hands open and empty before them bryusov and rustaveli stopped a couple of meters in front of the minervan it kept two eyes on each of them while its remaining pair refused to hold still on any target even tsiolkovsky for more than a couple of seconds at a time the spectacle was unsettling tolmasov wondered how the creature kept from tying its eyestalks in knots bryusov pointed to himself valery he pointed to rustaveli shota he pointed to the minervan and waited for this tolmasov thought we need a linguist it might have been simple but it worked the native pointed toward itself with three arms at once and said fralk its voice startled tolmasov againit was a smooth contralto to his way of thinking nothing taller than he was and unbelievably weird looking to boot had any business sounding like a woman a sexy woman at that get used to surprises the colonel told himself expect them after all you were just reminding yourself this is a whole different world he wondered how many times he would end up giving himself that order a great many he guessed bryusov was still talking at the minervan trying to pick up nouns the tape recorder in his pocket would save the replies he got for more study later tolmasov chuckled to himself the recorder was just as good as the americans both expeditions used sonys while the linguist worked rustaveli walked halfway around fralk so he could take some pictures of ithim her and bryusov but when he pulled out his cameraalso japanese again like the americansthe minervan sprang away from him and bryusov its body got short and plump so its arms could reach the ground a moment later it was tall again and it was holding stones in three hands hold still katerina shouted startling tolmasov and the minervan both a couple of fralks eyestalks whipped toward her the native did not put down the rocks it had seized but it made no move to throw them either at the same time fralk was watching katerina it was also keeping an eye on bryusov another on rustaveli and one more on tolmasov a minervan the colonel realized was a creature that had no behind any direction was as accessible to it as another he wondered how the natives chose which way to go worry about that some other time he told himself firmly first things first i think the photographs will have to wait shota mikheilovich he called at least until this fralk understands that your camera is no weapon the biologists thin mobile features twisted in a grimace but he lowered the camera moving slowly and ostentatiously the eyestalk fralk was using to watch him followed the motion the georgian signed you appear to be right he said mournfully i will go turn over some flat stones with luck nothing i find under them will want to slay me for taking its picture seeing rustaveli go off to do something that had nothing to do with it seemed to reassure fralk it staged giving long answers to bryusov it talked in fact at such length that the linguist threw his hands in the air this will be wonderful later when i and the computers back at moscow have a chance to analyze it he said plaintively but for now its only so much nonsense he had picked up a couple of rocks of his own a small white one and a larger gray one he held the white rock above the gray one then below it spatial relationships he explained to tolmasov then turned back to fralk who was saying something or other eventually the colonel thought he would have to learn minervan he ought to be just getting fluent in it when tsiolkovsky lifted off then he likely would never use it again things worked that way sometimes the thought he had had before occurred to him again how are you going to learn the native words for front and back valery aleksandrovich this fralk doesnt have either one for a moment bryusov looked scornful as he did whenever anyone presumed to comment about his specialty then he must have realized he had no impressively crushing rejoinder handy he tugged at his mustache a very good question sergei konstantinovich he admitted the alarm rang in the headsets of the crewfolk on the ground oleg lopatins voice followed it a large party of minervans heading this way out of the northeast they appear to be armed then we should have the one here on good terms with us to speak well of us to its companions rustaveli said he reached into a jacket pocket the motion made fralk turn an eye from bryusov to him the biologist pulled out a pocket knife and opened its blade fralk hefted the rocks it was holding you are not endearing yourself to the native shota katerina remarked that had comebacks obvious even to tolmasov but rustaveli was for once pure business hush was all he said he bent set the knife on the ground and stepped back from it then he pointed to it and to fralk and waved an invitation to the minervan go ahead its yours he said though fralk could not hope to understand his words the gestures got through though fralk moved toward the knife hesitantly at first but then with more confidence as rustaveli and bryusov backed farther away to show that it was all right the minervan grew short and wide and picked up the knifeby the handle tolmasov saw which meant it knew what a knife was well lopatin had as much as said that yes fralk knew what a knife was it held the blade in one hand and tested it with the fingers of another it must have approved of what it found it pointed to the knife then to itself and made a noise that tolmasov mentally translated as for me rustaveli must have read it the same way da da he said when he did not try to take away the pocket knife fralk must have gotten the idea tolmasov heard faint contralto cries in the distance the minervans sounded angry his face quirked into a smile almost against his will angry minervans sounded like angry sexy womenan unexpected perk of the job the american slang threatened to make his smile wider he forced himself to seriousness katerina also heard the locals approaching she took cover behind one of tsiolkovskys huge tires that made such good sense that tolmasov crouched behind another one he watched the minervans approach they were within a couple of hundred meters now carrying spears and stones and other things less easy to identify the kalashnikovs could make bloody hash of themand of the soviet mission if the americans made peaceful contact while he got into a firefight he shuddered he would not end up a hero of the soviet union when he got home he would end up begging for a bullet more likely bryusov did not seem to have noticed thearmy gang posse he gestured vehemently like a man in the grip of an overpowering itch maybe he was getting through to fralk though the native had three eyes on him for whatever that was worth i suggest you come to the point valery shota rustaveli was on his belly on the cold ground behind a stone that would give him some cover he knew the minervans were coming so did fralk who kept an eye on them evidently bryusov did come to the point fralk hurried out toward itscountrymen probably tolmasov thought if they were enemies it would have run the other way fralk shouted something the onrushing minervans came to a ragged halt a couple of natives emerged from the crowd and hurried up to fralk they made themselves short and wide then resumed their usual shape if bryusov had gone through contortions before they were not a patch on the ones fralk put on now of course having six arms and eyestalks gave it an unfair advantage there one of the natives who had approached fralk said something fralk broke in loudly the other native went short and wide again that must be a token of submission like a salute or a bow bryusov called fralk shouted to the whole group of minervans they set their weapons on the ground valery fralk called in that thrilling voice the linguist had put down his rifle when he started trying to communicate with fralk cover me he called to his companions and walked emptyhanded toward the minervans fralk widened himself as the human came up in delighted reply bryusov bowed from the waist that set the minervans off again theyre not used to anything that can bend that way katerina guessed no tolmasov agreed he knew he sounded absentminded and he did not care the relief washing through him was too great for that first contact was made and made without bloodshed history booksmaybe history books on two worlds he thought blinkingwould not bear his name as a curse no one with a lot of arms would try to ram a spear through his brisket either which also counted he stood up stepped out from behind tsiolkovskys immense tires and let the minervans see him he left his rifle at his side but did not put it down not yet for me hogram tested the knife blade with a fingerclaw and like fralk before him was amazed at its keenness a most generous gift eldest of eldest gift fralk held his eyestalks very still the picture of innocence how can such a thing be a gift when all the clan possesses is in the clanfathers keeping hogram turned a second eye on the young male who wondered if he had laid the flattery on too thick maybe he had there is a difference you know hogram said between being in my keeping and being in my hand but the domain masters eyestalks twitched he was more mused than anything else fralk did not take another chance he changed the subject at least to some degree saying thesestrangersmay be valuable to us clanfather strangers seemed a better word than monsters especially as he was trying to speak well of them if they have more knives such as this certainly hogram said or better yet if they can make them with longer blades those would help us when we cross the great gorge i would pay well for them of course clanfather fralk agreed the trouble is finding what the strange males want they are sodifferentfrom us that much of what we find valuable may be of no interest to them hograms eyestalks were more than twitching now they were wiggling with mirth that is the trouble with any trade eldest of eldest finding out what the other male wants and what its worth to him the clanfathers faded sagging skin and the continual wheezing of his breathing pores showed that he would never be young again but with his years had come shrewdness clan hogram prospered even among the skarmer clans where a trading blunder could put a clan up to its eyestalks in trouble fralk had learned a great deal just watching and listening to his grandfather now to apply some of that learning if he could clanfather have you chosen a male yet to work with the strangers learn their peculiar words and teach them ours why no hogram sounded a bit taken aback good fralk thought the domain master had not had a chance to work through all the implications of the strangers arrival while he himself had thought about little else since the skyboxno the skyboat he amended consciously using the lanuam word the skarmers had borrowed almost fell on top of him surely it would be better to have a single male handle such matters than to scatter them piecemeal among several he said so it would so it would hograms fingers twiddled as he thought you see to it if you care to fralk youve been dealing with the creatures since they came here so you know more about them than anyone else the domain master paused ive given you two hard tasks together now first dealing with the omalo domain master and now with these strangers you are still a young male if you decline here i will not think less of you i will try clanfather fralk did his best to put a doubtful tremor in his voice but had all he could do to keep from dancing with glee if he was the channel through which the strangers dealt with clan hogram some of what went by would stick to him just as debris littered the sides and bottom of ervis gorge after the summer floods passed he suspected the strangers had things much more interesting than the little knife no trader with even the tiniest sense gave away his best stock as an opening present and hogram the young male vowed to himself would not see everything the strangers had to offer some fralk would keep or dispose of for himself though clanfathers rights were as strong in theory among the skarmer clans as with the omalo across the gorge in practice a male still under his clanfathers power could also accumulate a limited amount of wealth for himself or even fralk thought not such a limited amount so long as he was careful his musing made him miss something hogram had said your pardon clanfather he said widening himself contritely i wonder where these strangerscreatureswhatever they arecome from hogram repeated weve not seen nor heard of nor smelled their like his arms waved in agitation imagine not having eyestalks being blind to half the world all the time imagine having only two legs and two hands imagine wanting to stay so hot that is unnerving fralk agreed the strangers had a device with fire somehow trapped inside it and had used it on the journey to the castle when night came they huddled around it though the evening was mild the heat had been so savage that no one wanted to go near them not even fralk who was curious about the fire he knew of few things that burned readily a new one would find a ready market among icesmiths and also could be useful in war when he got more words he would ask about that they follow strange gods too if what you and the others have told me of them is true hogram went on ive never heard of anyone worshiping the twinstar they do clanfather fralk insisted they roused a little before dawn this morning as did we and through clouds low in the east they spied the twinstar the bright blue one and its little faint companion as we watched them they pointed to it to themselves and to it again i cannot think of any reason for such a rite as that but worship for all we know of them they may have been trying to tell us theyre from the twinstar hogram said theyre weird enough fralks eyestalks started to twitch then he noticed that hogram was not laughing he thought about it it made as much sense as anything else he supposed he said so he was still thoughtful when he left the domain masters presence a little while later he was reminded he would have to be even more cautious in his dealings with the strangers than he had thought taking hogram for a fool would never do i hope they dont mind us watching as their young get born pat marquard said as she walked along behind reatur so do i irv said from the way they keep their females so restricted im afraid they might but i hope reatur will see were so different from his kind that we dont count though he had gloves on he kept his hands in his pockets he noticed himself doing that whenever he was inside reaturs castle just the idea of being in a building made largely of ice gave him goose bumps he glanced over at his wife she was doing the same thing do you think its being so restricted that makes the females here nothing like the males sarah asked him more likely just a universal constant he said which earned him a glare from his wife a snort from pat and at the noise the brief honor of a second eyeball on him from reatur if it was an honor he thought and not simply a reflex he wasnt really sure about that after two and a half weeks on minerva he wasnt really sure about much back on earth the people to whom athenas crew relayed data all sounded certain they knew what was going on irv would have had more confidence in them if the advice they sent agreed with itself more than two times in five as it was he was looking forward to the day when the earth slipped behind the sun being out of radio contact for a while was beginning to seem a delightful prospect reatur brought him back to the hereandnow by opening the door to the females part of the castle as always the din that came from the other side of the door when the females saw him was impressive reserved was not in the minervan female vocabulary the din redoubled when the females spotted the three humans behind thebaron chief irv still had no sure feel for the best rendering of reaturs title one of the few things minervan he did have a feel for was what the local females thought about humans they thought humans were hilarious they came crowding around staring falling over one another prodding poking pulling their arms back in amazement every time they directly touched warm human flesh then reaching out to do it again theyre like a bunch of berserk puppies pat said as the wave washed over her she was smiling it was hard not to smile around minervan females irv jerked his head back just in time to keep a females fingerclaw from poking him in the eye the female reached up and ran the finger under the top of his cap instead then let out an almost supersonic squeal reminds me even more of my twoyearold niece irv said the thought saddened him beth was three now not two and would be five when irv got back to earth she probably would not remember sarah or him they are like toddlers arent they sarah said slowly not the one named biyal pat said sarah and irv both had to nod no toddler on earth could have been so dramatically gravid as biyal the bulges above her legs made her instantly recognizable to the humans where even with reatur they had to pause and consider before they were sure who he was those bulges also made her move very slowly so she was the last female to come out and see the humans hello biyal irv said waving hello irv she answered and waved back with three arms at once except for that both words and gesture were eerily accurate echoes of what the anthropologist had said and done such a gift for mimicry was something young children often displayed irv thought his wife might have put a finger on an important truth biyal was still wading through the crowd of females toward the humans when she suddenly stopped reatur she called and followed the chieftains name with a stream of what was still gibberish despite nearly sleepless efforts on the part of everyone from athena reatur and the females understood though they all turned an extra eyestalk or two toward biyal the tippling motion reminded irv of a wind blowing through a forest of snakes reatur shouted something at the females between him and biyal they moved out of the way clearing a path for him to go to her the humans followed him sarahs hand tightened on irvs arm look she said the skin over that bud has split vertically reatur timed it wellshe must be right on the point of giving birth irv saw that his wife was right excitement ran through him learning how minervans were born surely would give him clues to other aspects of their culture to say nothing of the importance the knowledge held for sarah and pat reatur seemed like any other concerned fathertobe he took two of biyals hands in his own and helped her waddle backward toward the passage out of which she had come the other females did not go with them instead they called out biyals name and one of the few minervan words irv was certain he understood goodbye do we go on pat whispered to irv i want to lets he said after a moments thought if reatur or biyal dont want us along theyll let us know about it his first thought was that they would get far enough along behind reaturs back that the chieftain would let them continue instead of sending them away but of course reatur had no back to be behind with eyes all around he saw the humans first steps after him he hesitated then used one arm to wave them on this time sarah and pat both gave irv a squeeze you were right pat said her blue eyes glowing reatur led biyal into a small chamber it was crowded when the humans also came in there was no place to sit down except the floor minervans were not built for sitting all the humans stayed on their feet their boots were much better insulated than the seats of their pants biyal reached out with a fingerclaw scraped some ice from a wall and reached up to put it into her mouth reatur got her more he gently touched her while she crunched it up he takes good care of her sarah said approvingly she studied biyal she doesnt seem to be in much distress does she sarah laughed at herself of course i have no idea whether shes supposed to be it would be nice if she werent wouldnt it pat moved around as best she could in the cramped space taking picture after picture biyal pointed at the camera noise what she asked females always spoke more simply than males irv had noted biyal simplified still more to get her meaning across to humans autowinder pat said not an explanation but at least a name to give to the thing that whirred reatur by now was used to the noise then pat spoke to irv and sarah the splits in her skin above each bud are getting longer six babies born all at once irv shook his head my cousin and her husband have two little kids a couple of years apart and theyre ragged remembering the chaos at victorias house made him have trouble thinking like an anthropologist finally he managed musing an enormous extended family like the one reatur has here must make things a lot easier splits are longer still sarah said if things go on at this rate either those babies will be born very soon or biyals going to fall apart in so many segments like an orange and shes perfectly happy too when we send the data back to earth i think a lot of women are going to be jealous the splits were growing wider as well as longer minervans irv saw were born feet first six young each with six legs plus biyals six irv began figuring out how many legs that was and found himself thinking of the man with the wives and the cats and the rats all on their way to st ives adding in arms and then eyestalks as they appeared only brought the nursery puzzle more strongly to mind theyre connected to their mother by their mouths pat observed very neat they get their nourishment directly from her and never had to evolve anything fancy like a placenta i wonder how they do dispose of their wastes though sarah said there pat pointed see those little tubes around the central mouth the ones linking mother and infant ill bet they have something to do with it six of them of course that seems to be the pattern here yes sarah said she sounded curious eager to find out what would happen next trying to guess along how do you suppose the babies are going to separate from biyal pat i dont know but i think well find out pretty soon look the ring of little tubes has already come free shes bleeding a little from where they went into her do you see minervan blood is browner than ours isnt it yes sarah said again she leaned forward for a better look irv was watching reatur watch biyal when the bleeding began the male stepped closer to her he reached out to pat her on the side then said something to her irv thought he heard the word goodbye again he touched his pocket the tape recorder would tell him for sure here we go sarah said look patyou can see the muscles loosening around the babies mouths must be some sort of sphincter ring there yes like marsupial babies mouths have to keep them attached to the teat when theyre in their mothers pouch pat broke in here though id say the babies will just let go and fall plop on the floor the babies let go and fell plop on the floor biyals blood spurted after them six streams of it one from each inchandahalf wide circle where a baby had been attached with so much being lost so fast the streams quickly diminished less than a minute after she had given birth biyals arms and eyestalks went limp and flaccid she swayed and started to topple goodbye reatur said this time irv was certain he recognized the word the male eased biyal down making sure she would not fall on any of the newborn minervans shes dead pats voice was shocked indignant she certainly is sarah agreed grimly she lifted one foot minervan blood dripped from her boot it was all over the ground judging by this ill say giving birth for a minervan is just about the same as getting both carotids cut would be for one of us this cant be normal pat protested something must have gone wrong no irv said before his wife could answer she glanced at him sharply but he went on this must be what always happens look at reatur he knew exactly what to expect hes seen it before he may not be happy about it but hes going on about his business reatur was doing just that he was rounding up the six new little minervans which scurried about on the floor active as they were they reminded irv more of newly hatched lizards or turtles than of newborn human infants reatur caught them and picked them up one after another finally he had three in one hand two in another and the last separately in a hand on the other side of his body why apart irv asked him pointing at the last baby reatur had carefully transferred it away from the others as if he wanted to keep special track of it male reatur said he held up the other struggling squealing infants females he said something else that irv didnt quite catch the anthropologist spread his hands a gesture of confusion reatur had learned thebaron paused to think for a moment then lifted the females to show they were what he meant saying goodbye fast like he used a free hand to point to biyals still dead body thats all females do here sarahs back was stiff with horror and outrage get pregnant and then die but theyre intelligent beings too and could be as much as the males if if she could not get it out if they lived longer irv finished for her she nodded her head down she would not look at him or at reatur biologically it makes a certain amount of sense pat said reluctantly they reproduce then get out of the way for the next generation but who takes care of the babies sarah said pat watched them squirm in reaturs grip they look like theyre pretty much able to take care of themselves if they can find their own foodand ill bet they can then males could nurture as well as females irv broke in or maybe they leave the females in here with their own kind knowing uh knowing theyll not last long and take the one male out to train him up to be part of the bigger society thats disgusting sarah said she still was not looking his way i didnt say i liked it something else occurred to irv with force enough that he whacked himself in the forehead with a gloved hand wed better be careful about how we let reatur and the rest of the natives learn that we arent all males ourselves at that sarah looked at him and pat too wed better leave his wife said in a tight overcontrolled voice if i start laughing i dont think ill be able to stop irv waited until one of reaturs eyes found him then he bowed and said goodbye in the local language using the word after what he had just watched sent a chill through him that had nothing to do with the icy air in the room goodbye reatur said irv tried to read emotion in his voice and failed in reaturs grip the babies made noise reatur paid no attention to it so irv supposed it was the kind of noise baby minervans were supposed to make come on the anthropologist said the three humans left the females chambers through the room where most of reatursspouses again irv found himself stuck for a wordwere still amusing themselves the females came crowding round as full of curiosity as before irv was glad he could neither understand nor answer their questions outside reaturs castle stood three allterrain bicycles they could go places a fourwheeled vehicle could not and six of them weighed a lot less than a rover would have im going back to the ship pat said climbing aboard hers i want to get these pictures developed i just want to get away and think for a while sarah said she pedaled down the curved track that ran through reaturs fields her breath streamed out behind her like a frosty scarf irv hesitated which way are you heading pat asked want to ride along with me i think id better see to sarah shell be all right i know even so though he left the words hanging and started after his wife ah well see you later then pat called to his retreating back when he did not answer she slowly rode off toward athena i didnt understand that valery aleksandrovich tolmasov said ask fralk to say it again he said bryusov began the colonel raised a hand i thought you understood it i want to make sure i do too and if you translate for me all the time how can i having decided to learn minervan tolmasov was throwing himself into the project with his usual dogged persistence again please bryusov said in the best minervan he could muster slowly tolmasov added that was one word he had used often enough to feel confident about it you give me fralk pointed to the hatchets hammers and other tools the russians had brought for trade goods some l give hogram he the word that followed was unfamiliar to tolmasov he looked at bryusov trade i think the linguist said doubtfully maybe context will make it clearer he turned back to fralk go on hogram he that word again then he use what he get to get you things some things you give me i not give hogram iand againthem myself some of what i get for them i keep and save some i use to get other things them to get more things some i use to get you things you want not trade tolmasov exclaimed i know what that word meansit means sell fralk will sell some of what he gets from us use some of the profits to acquire more goods whether from us or his own people and invest the rest the colonel rubbed his eyes with the heels of his hands what does that make him a capitalist bryusov said in a small voice just what i was thinking tolmasov looked at fralk not altogether happily as an alien the minervan could be studied for his own sake without preconceptions thinking of him as a capitalist brought in a whole load of ideology the colonel suddenly laughed out loud what bryusov said he would look very strange driving a large american car so he would bryusov permitted himself a smile but it was a nervous one moscow will not find it funny he warned i doubt oleg borisovich will either there is that tolmasov said still he wanted to be there when lopatin got the news just to see his expression fralk made a noise that sounded amazingly like a woman clearing her throat when the two men with whom she is at dinner have spent too much time talking about their jobs and not enough with her tolmasov shook his head at the irony of that marvelous voice being wasted on an alien and the russians had learned a male alien at that the colonel bowed to fralk in polite apology for his woolgathering the minervan widened himself in turn want more he pointed at the hatchets and hammers again and also at a box of little batterypowered lamps shall we give him more of the axes bryusov asked well why not we brought them to trade and the local tools and books and specimens we get in return will be worth a lot more than their weight in diamonds back on earth still i suppose you have a point valery tolmasov tried to use his tiny minervan vocabulary these he pointed to the hatchets himself what you do with use for use on omalo tolmasov took a certain small pride in noticing fralk had chosen a preposition different from the one he had used the object of the preposition though remained obscure omalo omalo is what he asked fralk said something ervis gorge was all the colonel understood the local name for jotun canyon he turned to bryusov did you follow that the linguist frowned the omalo are something across ervis gorge tolmasov frowned too that was better than he had done but not enough to tell him much again please slowly he said to fralk the minervan pointed to himself skarmer he said he pointed to the castle where his king grandfather relived the castle that was much the biggest building in this settlement hogram skarmer a surname tolmasov asked weve seen no signs of such yet valery bryusov answered and while he might use an ax on hogram he would not use one on himself besides let him go oni dont believe hes finished the linguist was right seeing he had not yet made his point fralk said ervis gorgethis sideskarmerall he waved his six arms to emphasize his words ervis gorgeacrossomalo borezmoi tolmasov said softly he was afraid he did understand that valery i think hes trying to tell us these omalo on the other side of the canyon are another whole country i think we should think three times before we go arming these folk for war i think also sergei konstantinovich that we should consult with moscow bryusov said the colonel made a sour face bryusov wanted to consult with moscow to decide which pair of socks to put on in the morning then reluctantly tolmasov nodded i am afraid you are right the americans after all are also on the other side of jotun canyon war against them even by proxy would not be well received back home i suspect we came too close to falling off the big cliff the nuclear cliff in lebanon we need to learn more of the situation here as well bryusov said so we do they could not hope to learn enough either tolmasov thought not in the limited time they had on minerva in the end they might act anyway people did things like that shall we tell the americans bryusov asked well let moscow worry about that too tolmasov decided if it were my choice though id say no at least not yet reatur finished cleaning the chamber where the new budlings had burst into the world it was somber work that was one of the reasons he did not give it to the mates the other of course was simply that being as they were they would have done a bad job of it he dragged biyals corpse out of the room toward the door that kept the mates in their own part of the castle the evening was growing dark and he hoped the mates would be back in the little rooms where they slept seventeen evenings out of eighteen they would have been even tonight most of them were but numar and lamra were still chasing each other up and down the hall they came to a stumbling stop when they saw the domain master and his burden its biyal numar said how sad lamra echoed but she did not sound full of grief no more than if she were speaking of a broken pot or at most a dead animal she did not care much about one way or the other she was too young to grasp that biyals fate awaited her as well as if to underscore that she said feel me reatur i think im going to bud reatur ran fingers along her body sure enough the barest beginnings of bulges were there i think you are too lamra he said as gently as he could good lamra said no reatur thought she did not understand the connection between buds and death that so abridged mates lives sadness pressed on him lamra was a mate he cared for more than he had for any in years she was more uniquely herself than most mates ever got to be in their limited spans he would miss her when her time came maybe he thought a minstrel would be visiting the domain then and he could pay the fellow for a song by which to remember her while he was musing numar was getting bored and annoyed that no one was paying attention to her anymore she poked lamra with three arms at once then raced off down the hail letting out a squawk loud enough to wake half the mates who were sleeping lamra dashed after her reatur got biyal out of the mates quarters and barred the door behind him he was taking the corpse to the fields when he almost ran into enoph who was on his way back from the humans flying house more questions reatur supposed the humans asked more questions and poked their eyeseven without eyestalksinto more places than any people the domain master had ever known if they had not been so spectacularly strange looking he would have suspected them of being skarner spies enoph peered through the gloom when he recognized what reatur was dragging after him he asked would you like me to take care of that for you clanfather eh no thank you enoph mates get all too little in life i try to give them what i can and to honor them as i can after they die as well enoph opened and closed a hand in agreement yes i think you act rightly clanfather i have two mates in my booth and treat them as well as i can for one thing theyre more fun to be with that way than when you dont try to train them and just leave them like animals i certainly think so reatur said are the budlings well enoph asked the male is large and seems sturdy so do the five mates come to that reatur let air sigh through his breathing pores time will tell so many budlings died young if a male lasted five years he might well live a long life if many mate budlings never lived to receive buds themselves and those who did no matter how strong and healthy they were had only biyals fate to look forward to how many males is it for you now enoph asked reatur had to count on his fingers and was not quite sure even when he had finished i think this puts me within three of filling my fourth eighteen he said at last a goodly sum enoph said in the gathering darkness reatur could hardly see the younger males eyestalks ive had four myself only one still alive the mates budded with them have not done well either it was reaturs turn to open and close his hand few who arent domain masters have the food to spare to keep many mates alive even to budding age he said sympathetically i daresay wed run short of them if they didnt come five to our one something to that enoph widened himself ive kept you long enough from what you came out here for clanfather ill leave you to it now he started back toward the castles outwalls reatur let him go though he had been glad enough of the interruption saying farewell to a mate was not a task he approached eagerly he dragged biyals corpse to a part of the field where the humans flying house had seared the crops scavengers he knew would make off with most of it but the rest would decay and give fresh value to the soil farther north he had heard were folk who at least in summer dug holes in the ground as resting places for their dead that was practical there where the ground unfroze to a depth greater than a males height and stayed soft half the year in reaturs domain and those around him burial was more trouble than it was worth he murmured a prayer asking the gods to grant biyal the long life she had not been able to enjoy here he added a brief petition for the budlings health then widened himself in a last gesture of respect for their mother he was just returning to his full height when two of his eyes were suddenly blinded by a brilliant flash of violet light he almost jumped out of his skin glaring afterimages filled those eyes even after he shut them as if on a rare clear day he had looked straight at the sun before he had the sense to tell himself not to he had turned another eyestalk in the direction of the flash he saw a human pointing something at him i might have known he muttered a moment later the flash went off again putting that third eye out of commission enough he shouted what it was one of the humans with a voice that sounded like a personsthe small one reatur thought though without several humans together it was harder to be sure he noticed that the afterimages were fading from the first two eyes that had been flashed and opened them again yes they could see he was relieved to find he was not blind for good through a thirdno halfof his field of vision blind as a human he thought and through his annoyance knew a moments pity for the strange creatures what is that thing he asked walking toward the human and pointing at whatever he was holding the domain master spoke slowly and repeated himself several times reatur the human put the questionending on his name who else he said for the first time it occurred to him to wonder whether real people looked as strange to humans as humans did to real people he pointed again and asked again what is that thing the humanyes he decided it was the male called sarah finally understood camera he said in his own language then picturemaker in the omalo tongue ah reatur said he had no idea of how the humans picturemaking gadgets worked but he admired what they did some of them would spit out pictures right away pictures as marvelously detailed and accurate as the one of the strange thing the humans had shown him just after their house fell from the sky reatur had an image of himself one of ternat and another of his castle the humans to his surprise had not even charged him for them why the big light he asked sarah tried to explain reatur gave credit where it was due but he did not understand the explanation for one thing sarah did not have enough words for another the domain master suspected that some of the ideas were as strange as humans as best he could gather the picturemaking thing needed a lot of light to see by he supposed that made sense sarah put the picturemaker into one of the pockets of the coverings humans wore reatur had only gradually realized those were coverings not part of the humans skins from a different pocket sarah drew out something else reatur heard a click light streamed out of the thing not in a single blinding flash but steadily and at a lower more comfortable level flashlight sarah said reatur tried to remember the word his language had no equivalent for it sarah shone the light at reaturs feet courteously keeping it out of his eyes the light splashed over biyals body the budding female sarah asked well of course reatur said grufflyhumans had a gift for asking about the obvious at the budding female i close look it took several tries backed by a good deal of gesturing before reatur figured out what sarah meant the domain master hesitated he had cleared the chamber in the mates quarters by himself after biyal diedhe did not want other males to have anything to do with his mates or even to venture into that part of the castle but he had not kept the humans out of the mates quarters they were too odd to worry about their planting buds on his mates and poor biyal would never bud again that was certain look if you care to the domain master said at last yes he added a moment later humans needed things kept simple he started back toward the castle one of his eyes watched sarah bend over biyals corpse that peculiarly human motion still struck him as grotesque humans could not widen though he was sure of that they did the best they could with the weird bodies they had as did everyone else he thought that reminded him of the watch he was still posting on ervis gorge nothing whatever had happened there since fralkon whose eyestalks the domain master wished the purple rashwas urged to go back to his own side and stay there reatur wondered whether he was wasting his males time by keeping them at the gorge he decided to leave them in place a while longer up against a rogue like fralk fewest chances were best the male dropped the lamp at fralks feet in fact he almost dropped it on one of fralks feet whats all this about mountenc fralk asked he was both surprised and a little angry as eldest of eldest he was not often exposed to such rude behavior but mountenc was angry too this stinking thing didnt even live as long as a mate fralk he snapped it doesnt light up anymore and i want my eighteen stone blades back for it i never said how long it would last mountenc fralk pointed out four nights isnt long enough the other male retorted i kept it on all through the dark so i could see to work and now look he picked it up and used a fingerclaw to click the little switch that made the light come out no light came its dead mountenc said contemptuously and i want my blades back first let me see if i can make it live again fralk said he did not have the blades anymore he had traded them for something else at the moment he could not remember what but he had turned a profit from the way mountenc was glaring at him with three eyes at once he did not think the other male would care about that youd better mountenc said i will do what i can fralk was pleased to notice that none of his concern showed in his voice he was a good deal less pleased when he remembered how many little lamps he had sold if they all started dying he was liable to end up dead himself by the time fralk was done talking mountenc around though the other male was halfway polite again of course had someone given him the promises he had made mountenc he would have been happy too he wondered if he could make those promises good time to find out he thought as he carried the defunct lamp over to the humans tent next to the tent stood the thingfralk thought of it as a landboatthe humans used to travel about it rolled on the round contraptions humans seemed to prefer to skids thinking about the flying boat that had almost fallen on him fralk reflected that humans not only seemed to like traveling but also seemed very good at it that only made him wonder again why nobody had ever seen any of them before maybe they really did come from the twinstar as the humans liked he paused beside the tent and did not go straight in hello he called and then added the human word zdrastye nothing happened he hailed again still nothing he said something unhappy not quite out loud sometimes the humans went wandering through hograms town on foot he hoped they had not chosen today to do that today he really needed them he hailed again finally the entrance to the tent opened fralk was so relieved that he hardly minded the hot air that came blasting through the doorway the human who looked out was still adjusting the outer skins he and his kind wore brrr the human said a word whose exact meaning eluded fralk a moment later another human appeared beside the first this one was also playing with his outer skins and taking too long to do it for fralks taste having only two arms made humans clumsy he thought with a touch of scorn fralk yes the second human said he was the only male with a voice like a persons which made him easier for fralk to name he still found humans hard to tell apart by sight da katerina fyodorovna fralk said the name carefully he still stumbled when he used human speech he had learned though that the second part of each humans name was a memory of his father there amid so much strangeness was a something that made perfect sense back to the business in his claws fralk thought he asked is valery aleksandrovich here of all the humans he could speak with that one best the male katerina moved his head back and forth which fralk thought weird but had come to learn meant no shota me here katerina said valery sergei the human groped for a word gone gone looking make pictures shota said da fralk said to show he understood the humans were as curious about hograms domain as fralk was about them shota said something in his own language too fast and complex for fralk to follow he made fralk more nervous than any other human maybe it was a holdover from their first wary meeting when fralk had feared the humans picturemaking device was a weapon or maybe it was that shota made the alarming yip fralk had decided was human laughter more often than any of the others he was yipping now as he reached out to touch katerina in the area below the front of the other males head between the arms katerina knocked his hand away the smaller males face always pink turned a deeper shade of red humans colors did not mean nearly so much as his own folks but the change accompanied as it was by a hostilelooking gesture made fralk wonder if katerina and shota were about to fight but shota said something else that made both humans yip katerina turned his head back toward fralk as fralk might have turned a polite eyestalk on someone with whom he was talking you ah want what the human asked fralk held up the lamp that had failed mountenc he clicked the little fingerclaw sticking up out of it that was supposed to make it light then clicked it over and over back and forth no light he said dead can you fix it make it light again shota scrambled down from the tent give to me he said fralk put the lamp in his hand the act made him notice the humans two extra fingers they did not make up for his missing arms fralk thought shota shook the lamp fralk had done that too trying to make it work again he had heard nothing and asked the human if he did nyet shota said he bared the grinders in his mouth not hear is good not he made as if to throw the lamp on the ground broken fralk supplied if it is not broken why does it stay dark shota called something to katerina then he turned the lamp upside down so the part that lit was on the bottom he twisted the lamp in his hands to fralks surprise it came apart into two pieces fralk extended an eyestalk to peer at what shota was doing the human was trying to pull out part of the lamps guts and having trouble muttering he put down the lamp and drew off the outer skins from his hands brrr he said again he picked up the lamp moving quickly now and pulled out two cylinders under those outer skins fralk saw fascinated his fingers had claws after all though they were small and blunt katerina had gone back into the tent while shota worked with the lamp now the smaller male reappeared and tossed shota a pair of cylinders identical as far as fralk could see to the ones that had just come out shota put in the new ones and put the outer skins back on his hands this time he said ahh he twisted the two pieces of the lamp together and it was as if thy had never been apart he clicked the little fingerclaw the lamp lit he handed it back to fralk thank you fralk said relievedmountenc would be no trouble now shota picked up the cylinders he had removed from the lamp these dead he said use much they die not give he ran out of words halfway through his explanation fralk got the idea though somehow light was stored in the little cylinders and they held only so much mountenc had used his lamp all the time so it failed faster than any other they will all do this fralk demanded in horror the glow of the lamp he was holding caught one of his eyes he hastily clicked the lamp offwhy waste its precious life during the day all shota told him he felt as tenuously supported as he had crossing the bridge back from the omalo domains he pointed to the cylinders shota was still holding you have more of those i hope shotas yipping laughter had an odd quality to it one fralk had not heard before it sounded somehow ominous it was we have shota said what you pay no wonder shota made him nervous fralk thought as the bargaining began no matter how peculiar the human looked his stalkless eyes were as firmly on the main chance as fralks own or even hograms fralk knew no higher praise the prints emerged from the developer one after another as each came out sarah levitt pounced on it like a cat leaping onto a bird she had been impatiently pacing ever since she put in the roll of film three hours earlier any mall back home has a shop thatll run prints out in an hour fiat while im spending half my life waiting here she complained so much for high tech emmett bragg was the only other person awake inside athena the machines in those shops are about the size of a pickup truck too he said they got this one small enough for us to take along what difference does it make if its not quite as fast another picture came out even the roller was too slow to suit sarah she tugged the print free what if you need a picture sooner than in three hours she said the question was rhetorical but he answered it then you ought to think to bring a polaroid along she glared at him thinking he was being sarcastic or patronizing or both at once his face though was serious you mean it she said surprised well sure he looked at her across a mental gap perhaps as wide some ways as the one separating people from minervans get yourself good and ready beforehand and the run youre making is a piece of cake but sarah gave up emmett was a pilot first and then an astronaut of course his world revolved around checklists he even had a point she supposed but medicine was less predictable than fighters or spacecraft things happened all at once instead of sequentially and so many variables were running around loose together and bouncing off each other never mind bragg came around to look over her shoulder she heard him suck in a quick sharp breath of air all he said though was not pretty no sarah was almost disappointed that he had not reacted more strongly before she remembered that he had been through vietnam if anything could give him what was close to a doctors clinical detachment that was probably it the pictures were anything but pretty no matter how alien biyals body was what had happened to it was grimly obvious and the stark background of the field where reatur had left it only made it more pitiful this is how they get more minervans emmett asked then without waiting for an answer he went on not much in the way of obstetrics hereabouts is then no sarah said again then her helpless fury burst out theres not one goddamn bloody bit of obstetrics here and i dont know if there ever will be or even can be you see the big wounds her finger hovered over them first on one print then on another i see era bragg said thats where each baby is attached to the femaleattached by a big blood vessel when the babies reach term the skin over them splits and they let go and the mother bleeds out all over the floor she had cleaned her boots several times biyals blood was still in the crevices anything you could do to keep it from happening bragg sarah thought saw straight through to essentials as with she reluctantly admitted to herself his comeback about the polaroid such automatic competence wasdaunting she answered the only way she could i dont know i doubt it i wish i could but i dont know you want the chance to try dont you startled she swung around he was closer to her than she had thought well inside her personal space when they were facing each other how could you tell she asked she did not pull back right away way you talk the crows feet at the corners of his eyes crinkled in amusement but the eyes themselves were watchful as ever a flyers eyes or sarah thought a marksmans being u targeted like that was faintly unnerving but braggs voice was light you sound like a test pilot going into training with a new machine i guess i do she said laughing only with this one im not only not sure whether it will fly but whether it ought to fly the crows feet crinkled a different way sarah was not sure how it was different but it was why shouldnt it fly bragg kept with her metaphor because it looks for a variety of reasons sarah did not feel like going on but in the end she did it looks like minervan females are just designedevolved whatever to have one set of babies and then die pats trying to find out if it works that way with the animals here too not just the people and i think the females have those babies young really youngnone of them is much more than half as big as a male bragg pursed his lips sucked in air between them doesnt leave a whole lot of room for womens lib here does it its not funny emmett she said hotly i never said it was it was not an apology but it was close enough for sarah to let herself sag wearily as she said suppose i can save a few females while were here what happens then will they conceive again and just die next time will they live and not conceive again if they do that can the minervans handle the idea of adult females i dont think the question even arises here is it your business to turn their whole society upside down bragg asked thats what youd be doing sounds like i know she said unhappily but is it my business to watch peopleintelligent creatures anywaydie before they have to and die like this she held up the pictures as if to emphasize her words another one came out of the developer and lay in its tray mute evidence of horror maybe your business is just that minervans arent people arent humans bragg corrected himself before sarah could we get into enough trouble back home trying to ram our ways of doing things down our neighbors throats maybe you ought to just let these folks go to hellor even heaventheir own way maybe i should regretfully sarah let it go at that bragg as usual was straightforward logical probably even sensible and everything in her rebelled at what he was saying if she ever thought she had a way to keep minervan females from dying in childbirth she would try it and minervan society would just have to take its lumps bragg started for the galley im going to get something to munch on he said want to come along why not god knows whenor ifirvs coming back to night lies slept in reaturs castle a couple of times already this week even inside a sleeping bag thats a cold bed bragg finished for her she nodded and after looking at these pictures i dont think ill rest easy tonight anyhow i could use the company the pilot gave a thoughtful grunt at that in the galley he chose a packet of smoked salted almonds tearing open the aluminum foil he said i dont suppose the minervans have anything like beer he sounded wistful rather than hopeful you know perfectly well they dont she said rehydrating a tube of apricotsall the food on athena was in freefallsafe containers if you ever head away from the ship make sure you take rations along the local water or ice ought to be all right but dont try eating anything youd regret it thats what youve been saying he agreed crunching believe it she told him the more i find out about biochemistry here the more toxic it looks funny bragg said same basic chemicals right at sarahs nod he went on so how come they didnt work out the same way they did back home she held up a finger so he would wait while she swallowed back home life got started in the tropical seas you could call the water here a lot of different things but tropicals not any of them isnt that the sad and sorry truth braggs drawl thickened reminding her of where he was from a moment later he was focused again different conditions youre saying exactly back on earth everything is geared to functioning well at high temperatures even animals that live in weather not much better than minervaspolar bears and suchdo it by using a lot of insulation to keep warm but theres no such thing as warm weather on minerva and from the biochemistry there never has been instead all the adaptations have been to meeting the cold on its own terms minervan tissues are full of every different kind of antifreeze you can think of not tasty like drinking your radiator eh bragg chuckled sarah stayed serious just exactly the viking results suggested that but of course the biochemistry experiments were nowhere near done whenwhen reatur smashed it and now its in his trophy room thats pretty strange bragg shook his head i know sarah nodded slowly i was in my senior year when viking landed and i was heartbroken when the transmissions stopped i never thought then id meet theperson who stopped them something to that he admitted at the time she recalled i wanted to kill him you and nasa both bragg said the scientists any how i was just getting into the program then and i think the administrators all wanted to give reatur a big fat kiss for guaranteeing them all the budget they wanted from then on they saw farther down the road than the whitecoat boys that makes once sarah said tartly not being enamored of the nasa bureaucracy she added we could have got here three years faster if wed just piled up all our paperwork into one stack and walked from earth bragg let out a loud bray of laughter then half choked trying to swallow more got to keep quiet he reminded himself everybodys asleep now that weve got a world making day and night for us again no more sleeping by schedulenaturally soon as id finally got used to it sarah looked at her watch half past two she said i didnt know it was that late she yawned almost as if by reflex even the extra forty minutes a day we get here wont help much lets go to bed best offer ive had today so far sarah had been turning away now she glanced back at him sharply his tone had been easy but he was watching her too marksmans eyes she thought again discomfited to sleep she said ready to be really irritated if he made something of that he didnt but as she walked out of the galley she still imagined she felt his gaze on her back she did not turn around again she was just as glad not to know for sure the sun skipped in and out from behind clouds ternat felt its warmth as he slowly walked south back toward his fathers castle from the domain of dordal summer really was on its way he thought the warm weather fit in well with his sour mood reatur had said dordal was an idiot the domain masters eldest remembered if anything that had been generous of reatur dordal cared not a runnerpest voiding for the threat from across the ervis gorge his eyestalks had wiggled until ternat thoughthopedthey would fall off reaturs eldest was not used to being laughed at he did not care for it he did not care for anything about dordals domain its crops were scrubby and of varieties he did not like of its meat animals the massi were too fat and the eloca too thin half the herders chewed ompass rootgood luck to them if those scrawny eloca ever got loose and started running all over the landscape maybe ompass root was dordals problem too ternat thought his hands closed as he disagreed with himself he would have smelled the fumes from the root dordal was a happy fool all by himself he had not even cared to learn about humans though the bellow of their flying house had been heard in his domain some quiet questioning among the younger males in dordals castle had made that plain to ternat but dordal dismissed the roar as a freak storm and could not imagine humans as anything but ugly people ternat almost sympathized with that dordal was plenty ugly himself the sun came out again and stayed out the weather got warmer and warmereasily warm enough to melt ice ternat thought yes it was shaping up to be a miserably hot year the humans might enjoy itthey were and somehow stayed hotter than anything alive had a right to bebut the excess melt it would cause would only make trouble and work for people as if thinking of humans were enough to summon them into his presence ternat saw a couple of their traveling contraptions leaning against a large rock ternat envied them those gadgets he wished he had one but his legs were both too short and too many for the thing to do him any good but the round legs the gadget hadand come to think of it the humans flying house toolooked to be better for travel than skids at least when snow was not drifted deep behind the boulder ternat saw a humans foot to judge by the posture the human was lying down that might be interesting he thought except when sleeping humans were no fonder of being horizontal than people were and humans so far as ternat knew did not have the habit of sleeping at midday he stepped off the path so he could get a better view of what was going on back of the rock it was not one human back there he saw after a moment it was two well that made senseone for each traveling contraption on the other side of the boulder but they were lying together in such a tangle of arms and legs that he had to look with three eyes before he was sure under their outer layers he saw humans had the same pinkishtan skins they did on their facesat least their legs the uncovered parts did ternat wondered what they were doing humans did a lot of strange things but he had never seen them at anything so strange as this before they separated and got up off the square of woven stuff on which they had been lying they quickly began putting on the outer layers for their legs they were too engrossed in that to pay any attention to ternat and soon had the task done before they did though ternat noticed they were different the taller one had a dangling organ that reminded him a little of his own male parts though those only came out when he was with a mate he was sorry for the human for having only one and thought it ludicrous for the thing to be sticking out there all the time then he thought about the other human the male without the organ he suddenly stood stockstill in the field as the possible meaning of that sank in given what he had watched it made only too much sense he hurried back to the path and started home as fast as he could go reatur had to hear this news right away maybe he would know what to do about it pat marquard put on her long johns as fast as she could the skin on her thighs and calves wherever they had not pressed directly against franks was all over gooseflesh she pulled her pants over the thermal underwear and bent down to put her socks and boots back on that was when she saw the minervan weve been watched she told frank huh his head jerked up he had been tying his boots too oh its just a native he said in relief he grinned a lazy grin at her maybe he learned something maybe he did she rolled up the blanket shivering briefly at the idea of fooling around without it on this planet full of permafrost then carried it around the rock and strapped it behind her bicycle seat she wondered if the minervan would come over and try to talk with them but he seemed to have business of his own with a touch of regret she let him go on still she supposed irv had a point when he recommended against forcing contact on the natives things could get nasty if athenas crew made themselves unwelcome shall we get going again frank climbed onto his bicycle so did pat sure only way to keep warm is to keep moving frank said as he began to pedal he grinned again well almost the only way uhhuh pat looked at the ground instead of at her husband the alleged path they were riding on was rough enough that he saw nothing out of the ordinary there but while frank whistled cheerfully and his breath steamed out as if it were the traditional aftersex cigarette smoke pat was anything but satisfied frustration stretched her nerves taut she had been so sure a couple of miles worth of isolation would let her find the release she needed but it had not worked out that way now she didnt know what to do she knew exactly when things had begun to go wrong aboard athena she had always needed privacy to relax when she made love and a curtain spread in front of a cubicle was not enough every noise from outside made her tense up fearingirrationally she knew but no less powerfully on account of thatthat she and frank would be interrupted after most of a year failure became as ingrained as success had been before it wasnt she told herself that she didnt love frank she did she was sure of that but it had been a long time now since she had left clawmarks on his back she wondered if he still could turn her on she also rather wished she hadnt thought about irv just after yet another unsatisfactory time with frank from the noises she occasionally couldnt help noticing on athena irv had had no trouble keeping sarah happy sometimes she wondered if the secret was transferable reatur felt his claws dig into the smooth ice of the floor a mute sign of his disbelief youre sure he said for the third time no clanfather im not sure ternat repeated patiently but it looked to me as if the two humans were mating and one of them seemed to have male mating partsor rather a single male mating part does that not imply that the other human is a female i suppose so reatur said unwillingly he still had trouble taking in what his eldest was telling him a female that acts like a maleby the gods a female that has lived long enough to learn a males wisdom even from people as strange as humans are his voice trailed away why not just ask them ternat said would they tell the truth if i had that kind of female with me would i admit it its as unnatural asas reatur stopped at a loss for a comparison he thought for a while groping for a way to understand maybe it means these females have never mated then what were the two humans doing behind the rock ternat asked clanfather you know as well as i when the urge comes on you to mate you mate and if you are a female when you mate you bud and when you bud you die there is no other way with us with nosver even with runnerpests it is so how could it be different with humans ternat did not answer he had no good reply to make reatur had no answers either only endless questionsand the same hopeless hope he always felt when he thought of the sorrow of the mates what would lamra be like if somehow she could live on after the buds dropped from her reatur tried to imagine lamras wild and sunny nature transformed by say ternats years he gave up he could not make the mental leap then he had another thought as long as he was imagining lamra surviving one budding why not more than one what would it be like coupling with a mate who could appreciate the act with full wit as well as skin if the humans had that they may be luckier than any people dreamed of being he said softly clanfather ternat did not follow him never mind reaturs breath hissed out under his arms i suppose youre right eldest ill just have to ask them ternat walking after him reatur began looking for a human usually he could not go down a hallway without stumbling over three of them now that he wanted one they were nowhere to be found he finally saw one some ways off in the fields pointing his picturemaker at a male pulling weeds between crop plants the subject seemed uninspiring to reatur when the human heard the domain master coming he turned his head so his two poor trapped eyes would point the right way the human hesitated before asking reatur yes yes reatur was not offended he had trouble telling humans apart this was one of the three that rumbled irv he guessed his odds of being right were better than one in three he was certain neither the rumbler called emmett nor the one called frank cared about weeds yes irv said and reatur felt pleased with himself the domain master turned an extra eyestalk on the male who was weeding why dont you go do that someplace else gurtz when irv started to follow the male reatur muttered to himself you stay irv i need to speak with you reatur the human plainly did not yet understand why the domain master had come to talk with him you did well to get gurtz out of the way clanfather ternat said the fewer who know of this the better yes wouldnt the gossip fly reatur agreed he gave his attention back to irv who was not following the conversation between the domain master and his eldest reatur tried to find a way to get around to his question an eyestalk at a time but saw no way to do anything but ask it straight irv are you a male or a mate quick and unambiguous the answer came back a male reatur was surprised at how relieved he felt still finding out that one human was respectably male did not mean they all were the domain master thought about the two most often in company with irv and picked one of their names is sarah a male or a mate the long pause before irv answered told reatur what he had to know he felt his arms droop irv must have realized there was a problem for even when he did reply at last his voice was much softer than reatur was used to from him a mate he said i was right clanfather ternat said so you were eldest reaturs voice was as heavy as ternats intellectually imagining something was a long way from having it confirmed especially when it was something as hard to believe as this are any other humans mates the domain master asked irv he had to try that one a couple of times before he was sure irv understood it the answer he finally got rocked him from mouth to feet half the humans were mates sarah and pat and louise ternat echoed as stunned as reatur do you use them the domain master asked that required more explanations before irv saw what he meant and then even more as the human tried to respond human ideas of society left reatur even more confused than he had been he had not thought that possible he got the salient point though you do mate with them yes irv said reatur forgot his own earlier speculation how could you bring them along with you then to die far from more of their own kind he asked appalled at the humans callousness despite irvs growing fluency with his language reatur took a while to grasp that his wild guesses had been somewhere close to right from what the human said his peoples mates did not necessarily bud when they coupledwhats the point of coupling then ternat said reatur hushed himand did not die when they budded how can that be the domain master asked the blood we made different people and humans irv began a good thing too i wouldnt want to look like that ternat said though he privately agreed reatur waved his eldest to silence again luckily the interruption had not thrown irv far off stride different inside not just outside different how reatur persisted when buds fell from a mate they left holes blood had to gush through holes he thought maybe human mates did not drop six buds at a time but even ifwildly unlikely notionthey only dropped one that should be plenty ask sarah how different irv said sarah knows of bodies all right ill do that humans characters were still hard for reatur to gauge but sarah struck him as being a very straightforward and competent male the domain master flailed his armsnot a male ask a mate irv spread his hand a takeitorleaveit gesture humans used sarah knows he said sarah knows of bodies well and not well a doctor reatur said doctor irv repeated the word several times reatur used the same trick when he was trying to remember something he was glad to notice any point of similarity with humans now that this gaping gorge of difference had opened up the idea of learning from a mate still jolted him so he asked do any other humans know of bodies pat does irv said after a moments pause wondering at his hesitation didnt the fool human know what his friends were good for the domain master said all right ill ask him then he stoppedfrom what irv had said pat was no more male than sarah ill ask one of them reatur said lamely one of these days he added to himself irv you should have spoken sooner of thisdifference between humans and people ternat sounded accusing reatur had trouble blaming him but hoped irv could not read his tone if the human did he hid it well how he asked you thought us like you yes yes reatur said of course ternat agreed we thought you like us irv said till biyal we thought you like us after biyal the human stopped reatur wished humans really changed colors or did something he could gauge to show what they were feelin the movements of their strangely placed mouths told a bit but not enough at least not for him he would have given a lot right then to be inside irvs head to know which words the human was choosing and which he was casting aside irv finally resumed after biyal we knew you not like us we not know what you think when you know you not like us so we not say now you know now we talk yes ternat yes reaturs eldest said reluctantly the domain master made sure he did not let his eyestalks wiggle irv had done a neat job of turning things around on ternat however weird humans wereand the more he learned of them the weirder they gotthey were not stupid he would have to make sure he remembered that ternat got the point too from how far away do you come to be so strange he asked very far away it was all the humans ever said now that reatur was beginning to get a feel for both how odd and how closemouthed they were he wondered what surprises lurked behind those three selfevident words i believe it he said and for the moment let it go at that fralk one of the humans is outside a retainer said he wishes to speak with you do you know what he wants panjand fralk asked no eldest of eldest panjand said stolidly fralk suspected that the servant had not bothered to ask he felt the muscles around his mouth tightening in annoyance he did not have time for humans now even if he was hograms liaison with them the domain master had given him enough other things to do to keep any three males busy will you see him eldest of eldest or shall i send him away panjand asked ill see him fralk said mournfully he put his pen beside the cured hide on which he had been writing and stepped away from the table put a few more drops of porjuice into that bowl of isigot blood to keep it from clotting he told panjand ill finish up these notes in a while after im done with the human panjand widened himself yes eldest of eldest fralk meanwhile was gathering effusiveness around himself as if it were one of the outer skins humans wore he opened the door panjand had shut zdrastye he said and then peered with three eyes at the human standing in front of him sergei konstantinovich he finished after a barely perceptible pause hello fralk the human replied in the skarmer tongue how are you his accent fralk thought was improving well thank you what can i do for you today he discarded some of his expansive manner sergei was as businesslike as hogram the human proved his instinct right coming straight to the point you use axes knives from us to fight all omalo across ah j ervis gorge well of course fralk said i told ah shota all about that not use for that sergei said what fralk said though he understood the human perfectly well why not you traded them to us they are ours now what business do you have telling us what to do with them sergei hesitated then said humansmore humansacross ervis gorge fralk felt his arms flap limply against his body as he took that news in humans were so strange that he had never imagined there being more of them how many more humans he got out at last wondering if all the lands he knew were going to be overrun by the funny looking creatures it was not a pleasant idea he would not wish a plague of humans even on the omalo on second thought maybe he would six sergei held up fingers so fralk could not misunderstand him these humans are of your domain nyet sergei said surprising fralk of your clan then of the same first bud i mean nyet sergei said again exasperated fralk burst out well is your clan even friendly with theirs no sergei repeated after another pause then why in the name of the first skarmer bud do you care what happens to them fralks satisfaction at losing his temper quickly dissipated in the effort he needed to get meaning across to the human sergei replied as slowly groping for words and concepts my domain other humans domain not fight now we your friends other humans friends with people across gorge you they fight maybe my domain other humans domain fight too fralk opened and closed his hands several times he had not thought about humans having politics of their own either he brightened hows this he said we wont harm these other humans at all well just use your axes and hammers on the miserable omalo you get hammers axes from us what omalo get from other humans fralk wished he were back inside keeping records for a project that had nothing to do with humansat least he had thought it had nothing to do with humans humans had a gift for making difficulties all out of proportion to their numbers what do the omalo get from these other humans he asked not know sergei spread his hands wonderful along with the advantage surprise would give the skarmer fralk had hoped the males who crossed the gorge would carry with them the superior weapons he had obtained for them from the humans that would make him a hero as well as the rich male he was becoming but now do humans have weapons stronger than axes and hammers yes our lacking the word in fralks language sergei perforce used one from his own firearms stronger stronger a lot do these other humans also have firearms fralk echoed the strange sound as well as he could yes sergei said not as good as ours but yes fralk had a really appalling thought would the other humans give firearms to the omalo not know sergei said not think so that was something anyway fralk thought do they have hatchets and hammers would they give those to the omalo not know if have if yes they give i think as sergei did not have eyestalks fralk could not even vent his feelings by wishing the purple itch on them his dream of a quick easy conquest aided by marvelous new weapons he personally had helped obtain from the humans looked to be just thata dream he tried to find something to be optimistic about and finally did at least he said the omalo wont surprise us the reversal in the sentence left the human floundering and fralk was in no mood to help him along partially changing the subject sergei asked how you go across ervis gorge fight omalo he could not have found a better question to restore fralks good humor i was just keeping track of the frames involved when you got here he said were making them faster than we thought we could and we should have plenty when the time comes he repeated himself several times frames sergei said he did not know the word and context was not enough to give him its meaning that made fralk hope the skarmer plan was something even these ohsoclever humans had not thought of here ill show you he said come with me he led sergei toward a large shed not far from where they were standing as they walked fralk remarked you know of course that as spring turns to summer water flows through ervis gorge da was all sergei said disappointing fralk whose of course had been solely for effect then he reflected that humans being so beastly hot themselves would not find water as much a nuisance as people did he had already noticed that they preferred it to ice that he thought was their problem inside the shed half an eighteen of malesthree crews of threewere busy using vines and dried massi eyestalks to lash curved pieces into frames that looked like bowls bigger across than a male was tall well stretch hides over them and then he paused dramatically if we put them on water theyll stay on the top of it even with a couple of males inside we call them boats he used the borrowed lanuam word as if it were part of the skarmer tongue hoping sergei would think his people had had the idea for themselves boats the human repeated he was silent for some little while looking at the frames then he asked in ervis gorge ice water rocks all together da yes fralk agreed and yes he thought humans plainly knew plenty about water you use boats with ice water rocks all together these boats sergei pointed at the frames yes i told you theyll stay on top of the water bozhemoi sergei said when ice rocks ah touch boats then what fralk had not thought about that the lanuam from whom the skarmer clans had bought the concept of boats had never mentioned it maybe they would have if asked but the skarmer did not know the right questions having been on the other end of a few deals like that fralk admired the distant lanuam and resolved to pay them back if he ever got the chance now though he put the best appearance he could on things most will not be hit at all others will endure some damage and keep on we should not lose many bozhemoi sergei said again it was another of those annoying human words with no clear meaning but fralk did not think the human seemed enthusiastic hurry up sarah said hopping up and down im turning into an ice cube she was only wearing shoes shorts a tshirt and a bicycle helmet the temperature hovered right around freezing irv shoved the wide stepladder next to damselfly as soon as it was in place sarah bounded to the top hitting only every other rung irv climbed up beside her and helped her down into the cockpit when she was safely onto the seat he swung down the cockpit cover and latched it closed sarah held a checklist in her hand and went through it item by item just like emmett she said irv could hear her teeth chattering damselflys thin mylar skinglorified saran wrap irv thoughtdid nothing to block sound he got off the ladder carried it out of the way and went to his station at damselflys left wingtip radio check sarah announced through the little set that hung on his belt reading you fine he answered do you read me five by five im going to charge up my battery now she started pedaling furiously powering a small generator after a minute or two she said thank godim starting to warm up louise bragg was standing by the other wingtip battery holding its charge all right she asked irv saw sarahs head move as she checked the gauge looks real good she said im going to engage the prop now the big airfoil started to spin damsel fly rolled forward irv and louise went with it to hold the wing level first walking then at a run airborne sarah shouted so loudly that irv heard her both over the radio and straight from the cabin of the plane for which she was not only pilot but also engine thats always so smooth she added a moment later much more quietly the first time i did it i didnt even realize id gotten into the air till my ground crew started cheering then she fell silent once more concentrating on her pedaling damselfly gained altitude and began a slow turn toward reaturs castle it was almost silent in the sky only the clicking whir of the bicycle chain and the whoosh of air past the propeller revealed its presence and they faded past notice by the time it had flown a couple of hundred yards hows it handle irv called when he saw his wife was having no trouble keeping the ultraultralight in the air no problem sarah answered if anything its easier than flying it on earth the denser airs giving me more lift just like they thought it would back home her voice confirmed her words she did not sound as if she were straining the minervans working in the fields had not paid damselfly much attention while the humans brought its pieces out of athena and put them together the locals had no idea what it was for the only flying thing they had ever seen was the spacecraft itself and damselfly irv thought was about as much like athena as a feather duster was like a hawk but when the mylar and graphiteepoxy contraption got into the air the minervans stopped whatever they were doing they let out piercing hoots of amazement and pointed with arms and eyestalks both several came rushing over to irv and louise still pointing and shouting excited questions at the same time louise turned to irv in some alarm what are they saying she asked she and emmett spent more time on athena and less with the minervans than the other four americans and had picked up less of the local language i dont quite know myself irv said enough minervans were clustered around him that much of what they were asking came through only as babble he also saw that many more had come to him than to louise that made him give a mental sigh even exhilarated as they were the locals remained nervous of a mature female as he listened he finally began to catch on to what the minervans were saying about what he should have expected he supposed what is it how does it work can i ride on it can i get one he had trouble staying polite as he answered the last question his mental image of a minervan on a bicycle seat pedaling like a madman made him want to giggle but the natives kept after him athena and the capabilities it represented were beyond their comprehension but damselfly they could appreciate whew he said to louise when the minervans at last believed him when he insisted the ultraultralight could not carry passengers was not made for their shape and was the only one of its kind they never thought of flying so of course it looks easy to them i wonder what theyd think if we told them weve been to the moon and back eight years before anybody flew a personpowered plane around a one mile course louise was sarahs backup on damselfly and knew more about what had gone into its design than irv did in any case the anthropologist was more interested in the effect the plane had on the minervans than in its technology if the next ship here brought a dozen damselflies adapted for the nativesassuming you couldthey wouldnt need any other trade goods like the ones we brought and theyd come horns showing a profit louise let out a cynical snort that sounded very much like one of emmetts thats as good a reason as any for nasa not to let era do it and better than most i suppose so irv looked north and east damselfly cruising at not much more than a mans height off the ground was almost right down on the horizon irv thumbed the radio switch hows it going darling important discoveryit is possible to sweat on minerva who would have thunk it irv could hear the effort in her words and the way she spaced them so they would not interfere with her breathing hows damselfly going to do as a picture platform he asked suddenly fatigue was not the only thing putting pauses between her wordsexasperation was there too im busier than hell in here just trying to keep this beast flyingi havent had a lot of time for pictures she had a point by airliner standards her controls were crude to the point of starkness a stick a radio switch a prop control switch a prop pitch gauge an airspeed indicator a battery charge gauge and the camera button but no airline pilot had to make his plane go by himself still irv said on the return leg why not see how much altitude you can gain without wearing yourself out too badly and squeeze off a few shots theyre pictures we cant get any other way you knowthe main reason we brought damselfly along you mean its not just a special exercise bike for me thanks for the news irv felt his ears grow hot under the flaps of his cap but despite her sarcasm sarah pedaled harder until she got the ultraultralight a good thirty yards off the ground even with the battery and the denser air this is plenty she panted all right irv said mildly sarah was not quite appeased it had better be most crashes with this beast i could walk away from but im up high enough now to break my neck she clicked off a few seconds later she came back on sounding worn and sheepish at the same time the view from up here is spectacular i can see all the way over to jotun canyon just looking ought to be plenty as far as thats concerned louise said sharply i wouldnt want to fly over it not with the funny wind conditions its bound to have damselflys not exactly built to handle gusts you know seeing it and flying over it arent the same thing im going to let my altitude go now ive shot a whole rollthat ought to keep you happy irv so it should he agreed unembarrassed aerial photography had taught anthropologists and archaeologists a lot of things they had never noticed when they were stuck on the ground irv would have killed to get a piper cub onto athena that being in the dream category he would cheerfully settle for whatever damselfly could show him the ultraultralight slowly approached the prop fell silent as sarah stopped pedaling damselfly touched down as lightly as one of its namesakes sarah reached up and popped the catch on the canopy then opened it so vigorously that damselfly shook irv trotted up with the special stepladder he climbed to the top to help his wife emerge the sight of her flushed sweaty skinand of so much of itforcibly reminded him how little he had seen of her lately both in the figurative and literal senses of the word he thought unkind thoughts about minervas climate sarah had the weather on her mind too but in a different way for gods sake get me some clothes she said after much too brief an embrace if i let myself stiffen up ill be hobbling around for days as if to underscore that she started to shiver she jumped down from the ladder louise handed her the warm outerwear she scrambled into it while irv wished the engineer had been a little less efficient he could have done with another hug and now as medical officer i wish i could prescribe a good hot shower for myself unfortunately the closest i can come is to wipe myself down and bake under the heat lamp for a while have to do i suppose she started for athena irv and louise knocked down damselfly by themselves sarah after all had done plenty in flying it they stored the pieces aboard athena neither of them even thought about leaving the fragile ultraultralight out were the elements could touch it a hailstorm or even a windstorm would turn it to junk in a hurry as they were carrying the tail spar to which damselflys rudder and elevators were attached louise looked at her watch i think ill stay aboard when were done here we ought to be getting todays transmission from houston in about another twenty minutes i guess ill stay too irv patted the pocket where he had the roll of film he had extracted from damselflys camera ill wait for this to run through the developer so i can see just what weve got louise did not say anything but before she turned away irv saw her raise an eyebrow he silently swore at the developer for being so slow that it made obvious his real reason for hanging around athena he had every intention of warming up sarah a different way after she turned off the heat lamp that hopeful notion came to naught anyhow some of the males in the fields must have told reatur about damselfly for the chieftain walked up just as irv was carrying the last piece of the plane the propeller to athena reatur was full of questions and had trouble following irvs answers because he had not actually seen damselfly up in the air the only thing he had to compare to its flight was athenas thunderous arrival and irv had already thought once about how unlike were those two things covered under the umbrella of one word and so fascinated and confused at the same time reatur kept trying to understand he finally invited irv to the castle to explain further he was so polite about it that the anthropologist could not find any good way to say no no doubt irv thought sourly as they walked along a path through the fields reatur thought he was doing him a favor by the time he got back to athena sarah was asleep grumbling he went back and fed the roll of film into the developer even as he did though he knew his mind was not on what the prints would show the three males stood at the base of tsiolkovskys boarding ladder even to the inexperienced eyes of the two russians aboard they looked illkempt more seedy beggars oleg lopatin said curling his lip in distaste yes yuri voroshilov said from the chemist it almost counted as a major speech lopatin would have wondered had much more come from him if anyone could have stayed sane alone through a nearly threeyear minerva mission lopatin would have bet on voroshilov assuming the kgb man thought that he was sane now on which lopatin reserved judgment that yuri was competent counted for more beggars the minervans were in the most literal sense of the word they held out several arms apiece toward tsiolkovsky lopatin clicked on the outside mike he had not learned a lot of the local language but he had heard that phrase too often to mistake it give please give lopatin had no use for beggars had it been up to him he would have sent them packing and in a hurry too but the orders from moscow were clear do nothing to antagonize the natives lopatin obeyed orders all the same he did not care for them as he often did he said will you do the honors yuri ivanovich yes voroshilov said again he got some trade goods out of a box by the inner airlock door closed it after him opened and closed the outer one and started down the ladder lopatin trained a machine gun on the minervans below there had been no trouble with the locals but he stayed ready for a first time the minervans recoiled when they first saw voroshilov these newcomers might have heard about humans an amused lopatin thought but they had never set eyes on one before one male let out a contralto shriek that would have made any movie heroine proud you want what the chemist asked when he was on the ground the minervans pulled back again at the sound of his deep voice then one of them visibly gathering his courage stepped toward voroshilov again he repeated the sad chant all three males had been making give please give here voroshilov pulled out a pocket knife and briefly took off one glove so he could use his thumbnail to pull out a blade and show the male what the artifact was the minervan shrieked again this time if lopatin was any judge in delight seeing their comrade rewarded the other two males also came up to voroshilov he gave one of them another pocket knife the other a chisel with a transparent gold plastic handle hot yellow ice the minervan exclaimed as he held the chisel up to one eyestalk so he could peer through it all three males made themselves short and fat to thank voroshilov and were so happy they did not take fright when he bowed in return lopatin had seen other locals start running at what was to them a startling gesture as he always did voroshilov asked what you do with tools i give you and oleg lopatin not for the first time thought the chemist was much more animated dealing with the minervans than he ever had been with his fellow humans voroshilovs pale rather thin features lit up real expression came into his voice the answer he got was the one he and lopatin heard most of the time take them to hograms town to get what we can for them and after that voroshilov persisted again the reply was familiar we hope we will have enough then to pay hogram the back rent on our plots so we will not have to give them up and come to the town for good to try to make a living there good luck to you voroshilov said inside tsiolkovsky lopatin sardonically echoed good luck the minervan peasants would not earn as much as they thought for the trinkets voroshilov had given them too many such goods from earth were available around hograms castle almost every day the russians there reported another drop in price well the bumpkins would find that out soon enough he watched them trudge off toward the town each of them kept a couple of eyes trained on voroshilov as he climbed up into tsiolkovsky the locals would have a story for the rest of their lives lopatin thought what do you suppose theyll end up doing a few weeks from now he asked when his companion was back inside building boats voroshilov said promptly i expect youre right lopatin agreed building boats earning whatever wages fralk and hogram choose to grant them living wherever they can with only their labor to sell proletarians voroshilov said exactly so the revolution will come here one day just as it has on earth not now voroshilov said with what sounded like alarm lopatin made a mental note of that tone but only a small one because voroshilov was right the minervans here were just entering a capitalist economy not coming to its conclusion and from what lopatin had gathered from the americans reports the natives on the far side of jotun canyon were still frankly feudal barring the genius of a lenin then the time for the revolt of the proletariat was still far away lopatin had a very good opinion of himself but he knew he was no lenin back to work voroshilov said and headed off for his lab a strange one lopatin thought as the chemist walked down the passageway he had had the thought many times and still did not care for it he wantedhe needed people to be orderly and predictable anything he did not understand he mistrusted voroshilov for instance had gone far longer than any of the other men on tsiolkovsky before even trying to approach katerina he had gone so long in fact that lopatin began to wonder if he was a homosexual who had somehow escaped all the screening for that kind of criminal behavior lopatin would not have much minded if he was it would have given him a hold on the quiet chemist but it was not so as far as the kgb man could tell voroshilov was just painfully shy he waited until clanks and clatters told him that voroshilov was busy again then called up a computer index to which no one else on tsiolkovsky had access in it were his files on the other five crewfolk he recalled voroshilovs one of the documents was called poetryit was a transcription of the set of jottings lopatin had found on one of his periodic searches through the ship the scribbles themselves were back in their hiding place love songs the kgb man muttered under his breath as he read them again they were amazingly good amazingly sensuous and every one had katerinas name in it just glancing at them made lopatin wish she were there she had not warmed much in his embrace during the brief time she let him share her cubicle but he still savored the relief her body had brought men were not like women he thought thankfully remembering the old joke about the fellow who came into a tavern complaining that the lovemaking he had just had was the worst he had ever known when the man behind the bar asked him how he would describe it he grinned and said magnificent regretfully lopatin sent the poems back into the computers memory he also sent a sharp glance back toward where voroshilov was still working nobody with that unprepossessing an exterior had any business having all those fine words running around loose in his head lopatin doubted everyone on principle but felt real suspicion of anyone who concealed himself the way the chemist did tried to conceal himself the kgb man amended if he ever needed one he had a handle on voroshilov all right he smiled katerina was a very nicely shaped handle now that he thought of it the ball a hide cover over soft teagfiber flew past lamra she let out a frustrated squawk as she went after it she had thought she had an arm in the right place to catch it but somehow it got by her it usually did she widened herself so she could pick up the ball reatur always catches it she said its not fair throw it back to me peri said when lamra did not throw it back right away the other mates voice got louder throw it back to me throw it back to me lamra still did not throw it peri came over and took it away from her mine lamra snatched it back she used a couple of free hands to hit peri she was older and bigger than the other mate but that did not stop peri from hitting her too and poking her with a fingerclaw she yelled and threw the ball at peri as hard as she could she missed the ball bounced away neither mate cared about it anymore anyhow they were too busy fighting with each other other mates came running to watch and to add their shouts to lamras and peris lamra had taken control of the fight and was just about to tie three of peris arms into a knot when the door to the outside world came open and reatur walked in whats going on here he asked whats this racket all about she took my ball away peri said squirming away from lamra and pointing at her with the arms thattoo bad she hadnt got to knot up after all not your ball lamra said she gathered herself to grab peri again and really give her what for reatur turned an extra eyestalk her way and pointed at her with an arm that did not seem to have anything better to do regretfully she subsided she might have known he would notice back to what you were doing the rest of you reatur told the crowd of mates around peri and lamra they went thoughalmost all of them kept an eyestalk on what was going on even so lamra wished they would do what she told them to like that maybe being big like reatur helped he had been talking to peri filled with her own not quite happy thoughts lamra had paid no attention to whatever he was saying she was a little surprised when peri after squeaking i will hurried away several of the other mates were playing a game of tag peri joined them in a moment her trouble with lamra forgotten she was frisking about now you reatur said to lamra he had not forgotten even if silly peri had it wasnt her ball lamra said i know that reatur said you all play with everything here in the mates chambers so how could any of it belong especially to any one of you thats not what i wanted to talk with you about lamra then he did something lamra had never seen him do with any other mate though he had before with her once or twice he widened himself down very low so that he was hardly taller than she she still did not know what to make of thatshe felt proud and nervous at the same time you ought to know better than to squabble that way with peri he said its not fair lamra said she squabbled with me too she saw reaturs eyestalks start to wiggle saw him make them stop that was just one more thing she did not understand why would he want to make himself stop laughing laughing was fun so she was he said but shehe lowered his voice a little so the others could not hearis just an ordinary mate and you i think are something more so i expect more from you not fair lamra said again maybe not would you rather i expected less from you than you are able to give yes no wait lamra had to stop and work that one through reatur was talking to her as if she were another male his words were as badly tangled as she had hoped to make peris arms no she said at last good reatur said so youll behave yourself then yes lamra said then she wailed i dont want to behave myself the world suddenly seemed a more complicated place than she wanted it to be i know you dont reatur said gently doing it anyway is the hard part its called being responsible i dont want to be whatever you saidresponsible its silly like not laughing when you want to laugh lamra turned an eyestalk away from reatur to show she was not happy with him and like widening yourself so youre so short and fat that you look like a toy nosver do i reatur laughed then so hard that lamra doubted he could see straight he also resumed his regular height is this better yes lamra said though she could hear the doubt in her own voice all right reatur hesitated how are the buds lamra looked down at herself she was beginning to have a swelling above each foot but the buds did not inconvenience her yet and so she did not think about them very much theyre justthere she said which seemed to satisfy reatur how are biyals budlings she saw that she had startled reatur his eyestalks drew in then slowly extended themselves again one mate has died he said the others seem to be holding their own it wont be long before we bring them back to live in here the male is doing well i miss biyal she was fun to play withnot like peri who squawks all the time lamra added pointedly she let air hiss out from her breathing pores in quite a good imitation of reatur sighing i suppose the new ones will be even more foolish i suppose they will reatur turned an extra eye her way ive hardly ever heard a mate say she missed another one after that oneafter that one budded he said slowly you remember more than most dont you how can i tell that lamra asked there reatur went confusing her again i only know what i remember not what anyone else remembers thats true reatur was trying not to laugh again she saw he stopped for a while then went on in a musing tone what would you be like if you could hope for my years or even ternats dont be silly she told him who ever heard of an old mate who indeed he said and gave a sigh so much like hers that she could not help wiggling her eyestalks he reached out and awkwardly patted her between her eyestalks and her arms all i can tell you lamra is that i hope the male you bear takes after you having such wits around to grow would be precious lamra thought about it she was not used to taking such a long view being as they were mates did not have occasion to finally she said you know that would be nice but id rather it was me reatur looked at her with all six eyes at once for a moment something he had never done before so would i little one so would i then he said something she did not understand at all im beginning to envy humans curse me if im not he left the mates chambers very quickly after that ii several minervans kept an eye or two or three on frank marquard as he got ready to descend the lead male of the group was the one called enoph why are you going down he asked for the third time as marquard checked and rechecked the lashing of his line around the big boulder that would secure it tell me again in words i can understand i try the geologist said in halting omalo he knew he could not have explained even if he spoke the language fluently the minervans had not developed the concepts they needed to grasp what he was up to you know i walk on path down this far more than halfway down jtm he caught himself the human name for the canyon meant nothing to the locals down ervis gorge not just on the path enoph said with the sinuous wriggle of his arms that marquard mentally translated as a shudder away from it too how do you dare go where you might fall especially since you have only two arms and two legs to hold on with how i go carefully marquard sighed when enoph only opened and closed a couple of his hands in agreement so much for the old joke but see how i go when not on path always have ropehow you say tied to big rock if fall not fall far yes i grasp that enoph saida natural image for a sixarmed folk to use you humans are clever with ropes i suppose you have to be but why do you do what you do to learn from rocks marquard said that was as close as he had come to rendering geology into minervan a rock is a rock enoph had said that before now though he paused to think it over maybe not he amended some rocks are harder than others some better to chip at than others do you want to learn which ones are best for tools i could show you that no not for tools want to see how rocks change in time new rocks near top of ervis gorge rocks older down low enoph wiggled his eyestalks which meant he was laughing at frank i do better as a comedian when im not trying marquard thought all rocks are as old as the world how could one be older than another enoph asked marquard shook his head like other minervans who had spent a good deal of time with humans enoph understood the gesture think of two fossils i find in rocks the geologist said the key word was in english again though enoph followed the locals had not really started wondering about long ago life preserved in rocks but marquard had shown them the couple of specimens he had discovered and had found giving them a new word easier than the elaborate circumlocution he would have needed to say the same thing in minervan i remember enoph said one looked just like the foot of a nosver turned to stone how can a nosver turn to stone that marquard thought needed a longer and more complicated explanation than he could give fortunately it also was not quite relevant where that rock like nosver from not far from the top of the gorge as i recall enoph answered what of it now think on other fossil that weird creature enoph made the shuddery gesture again it looked like an eloc or rather a piece of an eloc but hardly bigger than a runnerpest even newbudded eloca are three times that size no animal like that now yes marquard asked enoph repeated his hand closing gesture the geologist went on then that rock old old old yes no animal like that left now yes and that rock from where enoph pointed an eyestalk at a spot halfway down the side of the canyon he suddenly turned four of his other eyes toward marquard the geologist smiled no minervan had ever shown him that much respect before he also realized enoph was no foolhe had not had to point out all the implications to the male with data presented the right way enoph was plenty smart enough to work out implications for himself you humans have the oddest notions he said i see this one is true but who would have thought rocks could have ages how does it help you to know this the minervan marquard thought unfairly sounded like a congressman about to vote against a research appropriation the more you know the more you can find out the geologist answered if you know nothing how find out anything know one thing this big rockhe pointed to the boulder to which he had lashed himselfcome down from up there he pointed to a level not far from the one the older fossil had come from minervans did not jump when they were surprised if they had enoph would have how can you know that i helped move itand a nasty job it wasto secure the bridge to the skarmer side of the gorge getting the idea of bridge across took a good deal of gesturing and guessing not least because there was no bridge for enoph to point at when frank marquard finally thought he understood he asked the minervan where bridge now not see that got a response from several of the males who had come down and not a polite one they turned all their eyestalks away from the western side of the canyon and extended sharp fingerclaws as far as they would go they also turned the bright yellow that marquard had learned to be the color of anger the stupid skarmer wanted to cross to this side of ervis gorge and take our land and our mates from us enoph said seeing them try with the rope bridge up would have been plenty funny how they propose to cross the gorge without it i cannot say anyone with the wit even of a mate would see it cant be done another male said there was loud agreement from his companions marquard looked toward the western horizon which was in essence the distanceblurred western wall of jotun canyon he had not thought his minervan vocabulary would need to include terms like invasion he looked again like enoph he had no idea how the skarmer would get across the canyon if the people on this side did not feel like letting them they say they do this he asked at last the skarmer say all manner of foolish things enoph said scornfully i think that comes down to them from the first skarmer bud what they can do is something else again i hope you right marquard said all the same he remembered and rather wished he hadnt something he had read or heard so long before that he had forgotten just where son if a man comes up to you in a bar and wants to bet he can make the jack of spades leap out of the deck and spit apple cider in your ear never bet with that man because son if you do sure as hell youll end up with an earful of cider he snorted imagining the fun he would have translating that into minervan his breath steamed out what he did say was you watch ah skarmer side of gorge to know skarmer not come aye we watch enoph said a waste of time but we watchthe domain master would have it so like you when you check your rope so carefully he takes few chances thank you marquard said being compared to reatur had to be a compliment the geologist gave the line another yank though now he was convinced it would holdif that boulder had supported a rope long enough to stretch across jotun canyon his relatively tiny weight would not send it tumbling into the abyss he made the check just the same it was after all his neck moving slowly and cautiously he began to descend the going was still a long way from extreme he did not need to think to pick hand and footholds he thought about the skarmer in stead jotun canyon struck him as a handy sort of thing to have between oneself and unfriendly neighbors at least he muttered till they figure out how to shoot across it he reminded himself to tell irv about what enoph had saidand emmett bragg too come to think of it assessing threats was part of braggs job as he lowered himself he began concentrating more and more on his own job the wall of jotun canyon was like an enormous geological layer cake with him the tiniest of ants nibbling data from it in more literal terms the canyon wall was sandstone alternating with conglomerate with an occasional thin layer of igneous rock telling of a time of vulcanism frank felt like cheering every time he came across one of those he collected igneous specimens with special care potassiumargon dating from them would give him absolute dates on which to hang the relative dates of the stratigraphy he was developing thought about another way the conglomerates might have been even more impressive than granite or basalt the rocks accreted in the sandy matrix ranged up from pea sized to bigger than a vw bus when the glacier melt off got rolling it did not care what it moved anything in the way went for the moment though marquard was scrambling over neither pragmatically valuable igneous rock nor aweinspiring conglomerates this layer was just rather weathered yellowbrown sandstone he got out his geologists hammer and took several small specimens he grinned wryly as he wrote up a data tag for each one if he had taken all the specimens he wanted athena would have ended up too heavy to get them back to earth his eyes flicked over an oddly shaped shadow and he bent down for a closer look only remembering that he would alarm the minervans above kept him from shouting out loud finding a fossil was always good for a rush the thing was not very big and was built on the same radial pattern dominant all over minerva aside from that it didnt look like anything with which frank was familiar no reason it should he thought it was a couple of hundred million years old if it was a day maybe pat would have some idea of what it was related to he photographed the fossil in situ then using hammer and chisel he freed the stone in which it was embedded from the canyon wall he was glad it was small that way he could get it all out which would make his wife happy he wondered what pat would have done had he stumbled over the minervan equivalent of say brachiosaurus he had a picture of her holding a gun on the rest of athenas crew and as many locals as possible until they dug out the whole specimen when pat set her mind on something she generally got it she would have nothing to complain about this time he thought as he wrapped the fossil in bubbled plastic and stuck it in the bag he carried on his belt just for such lucky finds minervan fossils frank thought fondly were the most fun pat had out of bed tolmasov pulled off the headphones both the static of the scrambled transmission and lopatins furious shouts were giving his ears a workout calmly oleg borisovich calmly he urged the devils grandmother take calmly lopatin yelled across the kilometers from tsiolkovsky tolmasov scowled when a kgb man started calling on the devil and his relations something really had gone wrong somewhere the oath was a surer sign of trouble than lopatins using the scrambler as a matter of fact give a security man a scrambled circuit and of course he will use it at least stop swearing long enough to tell me what youre swearing about the pilot suggested the americans those deceiving sons of what about them tolmasov broke in sharply though lopatin seemed ready to go on in that vein for some time yet what about the americans the colonel repeated letting the snap of command enter his voice sergei konstantinovich the americans deceitfully concealed the true location where their viking came down when athena landed east of jotun canyon it was no navigational error they knew where their spacecraft was and went there all the data they published over the last decade and a half were false and deliberately false at that tolmasov rubbed his chin as he thought how can you be certain of this the whole thing struck him as a ploy more in character for the kgb than the americans who were usually too naive to come up with such ideas we have people in nasa lopatin reminded him tolmasov would have been surprised if the americans did not know that too as if reading his mind lopatin went on no sergei konstantinovich this is not disinformation fed our folk by the cia athenas crew has sent word back to houston that they are in contact with the very male who wrecked the viking do you think any navigational error would have been likely to put them so precisely on the spot nyet tolmasov said flatly more to himself than to the kgb man he mused how best to use the information beat them over the heads with it lopatin answered at once the american hypocrites always embarrass us for not blabbing everything to the heavens as they do now we can pay them back and let us see how they enjoy it you know oleg borisovich i like that tolmasov could not keep the surprise from his voice he was not used to liking lopatins suggestions he let out an anticipatory laugh i will enjoy seeing the good brigadier bragg embarrassed till this moment i had not thought such a thing possible what i really would enjoy tolmasov thought is seeing braggs fighter in the center of my radar screen and hearing the tone that tells me my missile has locked on to his tailpipe he sighed even in a fantasy it was all too easy to imagine bragg somehow evading him the man was good the colonel blinked lopatin had said something and he had missed it im sorry oleg borisovich i was woolgathering i said is katerina fyodorovna still occupied with her researches at the town perhaps she should return to tsiolkovsky for a time to perform data analysis and transmit some concrete results to moscow i will inquire oleg borisovich tolmasov said blandly out he knew how delighted katerina was with lopatin when the rover came back tolmasov decided he would send it off to tsiolkovsky with katerina aboard she would want to examine rustaveli and bryusov before she left the colonels mouth twitched wryly and he sighed ever since the rover had left he had had the only woman on this part of the planet all to himselfand made love with her exactly once they were both too busy sighing again tolmasov killed the scrambler circuit he switched frequencies to the one the soviets and americans used to talk back and forth he felt his blood heat dueling with emmett bragg brought its own excitement reatur walked down the spiral ramp into the cellars the flashlights he carried in two of his hands gave much more light than the ice globes full of glitterers set into the wall every so often the domain master was glad to be carrying the twin bright beams more than once he had almost stumbled off the edge of the ramp and reached the bottom faster than he wanted to come to that the glitterers were not shedding as much light as they should have reatur made a mental note to get after a couple of the younger males to feed them more often nothing he thought resentfully ever got done unless he turned an eyestalk toward it himself the cellars might have been dim but at least they were cool down half a males height below the surface there was always ice in the groundnever any risk of the cellar collapsing as there was in very hot weather with the parts of the castle aboveground if it werent for the lighting problem reatur would have been just as happy living underground he did not like summer never hurts to have something to complain about he said aloud especially something i cant help he listened to his voice echoing back from the gloomy corridors there was no help for breaking out the stone tools either not any more as the weather grew warm small pieces of worked ice like hoe blades got soft and brittle and started to melt so unfortunately did swordblades hardly anyone made war during high summer swinging weapons of stone and timber was usually reckoned more trouble than it was worth usually reatur kept remembering fralks threats nobody could tell what the skarmer would do they were so sneaky the domain master thought they likely could not even tell themselves he paused did that mean they took themselves by surprise he chased the thought around his arms a couple of times then gave it up as a bad job the miserable skarmer would do whatever they did and he would deal with it that was what a domain master was for a domain master was also for making sure the crops stayed tended no matter what the skarmer did a fine thing it would be if those wretches stayed on their own side of ervis gorge and the domain went hungry because everyone had forgotten the crops from worry over them reatur got to the threshold of the chamber where the stone farm tools had been stored after good weather had returned last fall he shone one of the flashlights into the underground room the furious hoot he let out rang through the cellar turning the other flashlight on himself he saw he was as yellow as the sun and no wonder he had every right to be furious the tools which should have been grouped in neat rows by type were dumped in a higgledypiggledy pile the domain master stormed up the ramp males who spied his yellow color got out of his path as fast as they could he let them go until he saw ternat almost literally by main force he took his eldest back down to the cellar with him this was your job the domain master shouted look at the mess you made of it did you let a herd of massi run through here or what curse it lamra could have done better than thiseighteen times better how do you propose to run this domain one day if you cant do the simplest things properly he turned the second flashlight on his eldest to see how he was taking it ternats eyestalks drooped with shame but he was as yellow as reatur im going to tear an arm off gurtz or maybe two that worthless matebudling of a nosver he said he would see it was taken care of and sounded as though he knew how to do it after a while none of the stone tools were left above ground so i assumed hed dealt with things as ternats fury grew reaturs abated he let air hiss out through his breathing pores so thats how it was then by the first omalo bud yes clanfather that gurtz ill reel his yes do but hes taught you a lesson too hasnt he eldest reatur watched ternats eyestalks lengthen and shrink k surprise and confusion simple enough if you give a male something to do always check to make sure hes done it yot may sleep less on account of it but youll sleep better ternat thought that over he slowly began to regain his usual color i think youve found truth here clanfather yes i remember and now he added grimly ill go and deal with gurtz dont leave him too sore to work was all reatur said after all having made this mess who better than he to set it right again and i will want it set right again and soon if we lose any time cultivating the crops because of gurtzs blundering what you do to him wont be enough ill settle the slacker myself even if he is a bud i planted ill tell him you said so yes do reatur and ternat went up the ramp together the domain master lighting the way while his eldest hurried off to deal with the luckless gurtz reatur went to check on how the infant male budded from biyal was doing he will be a fine one clanfather said the budlingkeeper a male named sittep he is the youngest here of course but already tries to take food away from males a quarter of a season older than he is bring him out let me turn three eyes on him sittep returned with the young male a few moments later wriggling in his grasp it was blue with fear it tried to bite him then voided on the two hands that were holding it a spirited budling sittep said his eyestalks gave the slow wiggle of resigned amusement yes reatur said admiring the budlingkeepers patience he stepped closer to give the budling the careful examination he had promised it lashed out with the three sharp fingerclaws of one tiny hand the domain master jerked an eyestalk back just in time he moves quickly enough thats certain you said hes been eating well yes clanfathernothing shy about him at all as youve seen usually with the very small ones i have to make sure they get their fair share but this one has no troubles there hes fast hes strong good well set him to running down vermin in the halls reatur said sitteps eyestalks started to quiver again then stopped as if he were not quite sure the domain master was joking never mind reatur told him seeing the new budling reminds me life goes on thats all with the humans being here tying everyones eyestalks in knots sometimes thats hard to remember i understand clanfather the combination of the humans and the skarmer would be plenty to make anyone worry sittep said sympathetically aye sometimes it all seems too much reatur broke off embarrassed to have shown his mind so clearly to one of his males not even ternat should have to listen to him maundering on so let alone the budlingkeeper whose biggest responsibility was making sure his charges did not kill one another before they understood that they were not supposed to just then the budling did managed to break loose from sittep it scuttled around like a berserk runnerpest until the budlingkeeper and reatur managed to catch it again in that undignified process it clawed reatur twice and bit him once with your permission clanfather ill put him back now sittep said holding the squirming squalling budling a good deal tighter than he had a moment before go ahead reatur was still working the hand the budling had bitten trying to squeeze out the pain youd think the idiot little thing would know whod planted its bud he grumbled or at least that you and i were the same sort of creature it was not a couple of clemor out to run it down and eat it its still very young the budlingkeeper reminded him i know i know all the same reatur thought as sittep returned the budling to its chamber the foolish creature should have had more sensebut then biyal had never had much sense even for a mate somehow reatur was sure the budlings from lamra male and mates would behave better he could only see if he was right though after lamra was dead he hated the idea of that more than he had for any other mate he had known air hissed out through his breathing pores even without the humans he would have had plenty to keep his eyestalks all knotted up the boats are coming along excellently clanfather fralk told hogram we have plenty of workers to put frames together and stretch hides over them as you foretold the prospect of work has drawn males from many straggling farms a little flattery never hurt fralk thought especially when what he was saying also happened to be true hogram though had been hearingand discountingflattery longer than fralk had been alive by the time ervis gorge fills i presume we will have made enough boats to send across as many males as we have planned yes fralk said confidently again he was telling the truthno point to lying about something hogram could so easily check and something where failure would make itself so obvious come the day good hograms voice was dry fralk had to remind himself that the domain master was smart enough to think along with him after a pause perhaps intended to let the younger male remember just that hogram went on will the cursed things actually stay on top of the water once our males are in them float you mean fralk brought out the lanuam technical term as if it belonged in his mouth he could see he had impressed his overlord he beckoned with the arm opposite hogram and called panjand iverc bring up the basin and model im ready to show them to the domain master now the two males slowly came up from the back of hograms reception hall they carried the heavy stone basin between them holding on with three arms apiece one of ivercs hands slipped the basin tilted until he could regain his grip water sloshed over the edge ah hogram said extending another eyestalk toward the advancing males id wondered why they werent using a vessel made of ice now i see his eyestalks wiggled put water in ice and you wont keep either one long no fralk agreed as respectfully as if hogram had said something clever rather than coming out with a clich set it down here the younger male added when panjand and iverc brought the big stone bowl up to him the two males widened themselves to do as he asked and stayed in the posture of respect until a wave from hogram released them in one of his free hands panjand was carrying a small boat he passed it to fralk fralk gently set it on the water you see clanfather it doesfloat so it does by itself hogram said but will it bear weight and still stay on top there the domain master might reject the fancy foreign word with which fralk enjoyed showing off but he knew what questions to ask lverc fralk said the male handed him the stickwork cage he had been holding in the hand away from hograms eyes a halftame runnerpest scurried about inside fralk undid the lashings that held the cage closed he reached in and picked up the runnerpest its tiny arms flailed at him but it did not really try to claw the runnerpests weight clanfather is about the same in proportion to this small boats capacity as that of a load of our males will be to a fullsized boat fralk said he set the little animal down in the boat the unfamiliar sensation of moving on water made the runnerpest chitter with terror but also made it freeze in place where fralk had put it hogram peered at the laden boat with three eyes turning another on fralk very interesting eldest of eldest he said at last you seem to have most of the answers we need coming from hogram that was highest praise the runnerpest of course chose that exact moment to try running away instead of holding still the boat overbalanced water began pouring in there was a fancy foreign word for what happened when something that had been floating abruptly ceased to do so fralk could not have thought of it to save his eyestalks he stared in numb dismay as the runnerpest all its appendages writhing frantically went down through the water to the bottom of the stone bowl as befitted his years hogram kept his selfpossession he pulled the runnerpest out of the basin and set it on the floor it scuttled off with the speed that had given its kind their name fralk watched it go wondering if his hopes were fleeing with it i presume our males will be instructed not to leap over the walls of their boats while crossing ervis gorge hogram said drily what yes clanfather certainly clanfather fralk realized he was babbling and did not care the domain masters sarcasm was a small enough price to pay for a botched demonstration hogram could have canceled the whole boatbuilding effort or put another male in charge in his relief fralk missed something hogram had said he contritely widened himself im sorry i was wondering eldest of eldest if the humans know anything about these boats theyre such hot creatures that tricks with water should come as naturally to them as those with ice do to us they have said one or two things clanfather fralk answered cautiously but as i am still only a budling in such matters myself i am not certain how much help they can be i also have not shown them the fullness of my ignorance lest they demand more for what they know good enough hogram said and fralk had to fight to keep from changing color in reliefhe had dreaded that question and been sure hogram would ask it the domain master went on i was wise it seems to set you over both the building of the boats and dealing with the humans if the two enterprises have the links they appear to no male of your clan has ever doubted your wisdom fralk said that was true enough and politer than saying that no male himself very much includedexpected hogram to go so much as a fingerclaws width against his own advantage keep at it then eldest of eldest the domain master said be sure i shall be watching with six eyes what you accomplish the notice you grant me is more than i deserve fralkwidened himself he had already suspected that some of the males who helped build boats also passed word on to hogram had he been domain master he would have kept an eyestalk or two on that project himself as he had thought a moment before hogram was too clever not to protect his interest so after a few more polite exchanges fralk took his leave a little while later he unrolled a hide in front of one of the leading town merchants small red rectangles each decorated with a white cross spilled out and what are these asked the trader whose name was cutur something new from the humans fralk answered lookan eighteen of tools in onea knifeblade a rasper an awl he used a fingerclaw to pull each tiny claw out of the case as he named it and they are all of this hard shiny stone the humans use see not of ice so theyre good winter and summer but so small and light that no one will mind using them interestingsome anyway cutur never sounded more bored than at the start of a dicker iii this time though fralk had the edge he had gotten the humans to promise not to give out the little redcased tools through any other male a similar promise from him to cutur made the price the merchant paid hefty enough to suit him of course a good part of that price would go back to the humans in exchange for the little cylinders that kept some of their gadgets alive hogram would get a fair chunk himself as was the domain masters right even fralk though had little about which to complain over what was left before long he thought he would be the richest male who was not a domain master throughout all the skarmer lands the humans taken as a group would not be much poorer although fralk was convinced he was cheating them outrageously their trade goods were not only unlike any that had ever come into the skarmer domains but did things fralk had never imagined tools doing they could have demanded eighteen times as much for them as they got but as long as they stayed satisfied with perfectly ordinary local products in exchange for their unique ones fralk was not about to argue with them no one held a knife to their eyestalks to make them deal as they did and no one fralk thought had to hold a knife to his eyestalks to make him turn a profit none of the males sprung from hograms buds was that kind of fool irv was at the control board when the shiptoship light went on he picked up the mike athena here levitt speaking he said in fairly good russian go ahead tsiolkovsky thank you so much irving samuelovich colonel tolmasov here be so good as to fetch brigadier bragg if you please what i have to say must be discussed at the command level hold please frowning a little levitt cut the mike tolmasovs english always sounded starchy but this was worse than usual irv hit the intercom switch bragg he knew was in his cabin going over computer printouts when the pilot answered levitt said tolmasovs callingsays he wont talk with anyone but you somethings hit the fan sounds like doesnt it just as usual bragg sounded calm unhurried irv was reasonably sure that behind his cool facade he had the same worries and fears as any other man but if so he did a hell of a job of hiding them be right there bragg finished out levitt opened the channel to tsiolkovsky again tolmasov replied at once sergei konstantinovich here is my commander the anthropologist said as bragg came in and sat down beside him what do you have to say to me that you cannot tell my crew the pilot demanded the blunt question sounded even ruder in russian than it would have in english brigadier bragg i am calling to convey to you a formal protest over your concealment of the true landing site of the viking and over your cynical exploitation of this concealed knowledge to contact the natives who encountered that spacecraft after it touched down protest all you like sergei konstantinovich bragg said we got new landing coordinates just a little before we set downwe had to recompute our burn to get down where the boys in houston told us to the new coordinates were contained in the coded message you received you know better than to expect an answer to a question like that perhaps i do tolmasovs chuckle fell into place as if it had been included in stage directions he went on reprovingly the cultured thing brigadier bragg would have been to share your new information with us your failure to do so naturally makes us doubt your cooperative spirit the cultured thing sergei konstantinovich would have been to tell us the minervans on your side of jotun canyon were thinking about mounting an invasion of this side braggs voice went hard since you didnt bother doing that i dont see how you have any cause for complaint silence stretched the natives here are not under our control brigadier bragg tolmasov said finally whatever they intend they had it in mind long before our arrival i never said they didnt i only said it was uncultured not to warn us about it which it is bragg out the mission commander broke the connection he leaned back in his chair pleased with himself irv levitt did not blame him that hit tolmasov where he lived call a russian uncultured and then take away his chance to say anything back mmhmm bragg steepled his fingertips have to remember to thank frank for picking up on thatit let me embarrass tolmasov instead of the other way around he ought to be about ready to chew nails the pilot blinked you know what irv i wish i had a cigarette i quit fifteen years ago but the urge still comes back sometimes sneaks up on me i guess irv had a tough time imagining anything sneaking up on emmett bragg picturing him through a haze of tobacco smoke was much easier no wonder levitt thought with one of those odd bursts of insight that are at once crazy and illuminating bragg looked like nothing so much as the original marlboro man the mission commander got up and stretched that was fun but im going back to work now off to paint a hammer and sickle under the window irv asked innocently bragg snorted you know i just might only trouble is sergeis got hisselfhimselfa yankee star or two under his just stayin even with that one is nothing to be ashamed of he turned serious them and us weve been saying that about each other since the end of the second world war now and each usin the other to push himself along and here we both are on minerva not too shabby is it he was gone before irv came up with an answer even after a year bragg had depths that could take him by surprise lamra scratched herself in four places at once the skin that stretched over her growing buds itched sarah pointed a picturemaker at her it clicked give me a picture of me please lamra asked she held out the two hands that were not busy not that kind of picturemaker sarah said after lamra had repeated herself two or three times embarrassed lamra pushed in her eyestalks thats right i forgot the one that lets you give pictures right away voids them out of its bottom this is the other kind the one that holds them in yes lamra pat stooped beside her that made the mate nervous the same way she had felt funny when reatur widened himself to her the human went on other mates not see that some males not see that i have eyes eyes are for seeing with lamra shut all of them at once sure enough the world went away she opened them and it came back both of sarahs eyes were pointed at her how can you stand only seeing half of things sarahs body made the jerky motion that meant the human was not sure what to say finally sarah answered humans like this no humans differenthumans not think what different like how sad lamra said the place where sarahs arms and body were joined jerked again some ways you people not think what different like too lamra turned a third eyestalk toward the humansthis was the kind of talk she loved and she got it too seldom none of the other mates cared about it even reatur did not talk that way with her every time he visited the mates chambers it was as if he had to remind himself to take her seriously while sarah always seemed to what could be different about us lamra asked were only people after all people are just people arent they sarah did not say anything tell me whats different about us lamra persisted tell me tell me in her eagerness to find out what sarah was talking about she hopped up and down how you different sarah said at last something had changed in the humans voice lamra could hear that but she did not know enough of humans to be sure what the change meant sarah hesitated again then went on lamra you know what happens afterafter you bud after i bud im over of course lamra answered who ever heard of an old mate humans not like that not male memate sarah pointed at himselfno herself lamra thought through roaring confusion i oldold like any other human mateshuman mates who uh bud not die then can live on live on from her tone lamra might have been talking about one of the three moons coming down from the sky and dancing in the fields she did not so much disbelieve sarah as find her words beyond comprehension live on she repeated who ever heard of an old mate the proverb helped anchor her to the familiar the here and now she had never needed such an anchor beforethis was much stranger than reaturs turning all his eyes on her who ever heard of humans sarah asked lamra had no answer to that the humanthe human mate continued because a thing is does that mean it must be heno she said that several different ways working hard to get the meaning across to lamra even so it was a struggle too hard lamra complained she hadnt liked it when reatur asked that sort of question either all fight question not so hard you want to have buds live on after sarah asked it as if it could only have one possible answer lamra did not see it so what would i do she wailed who ever heard of an old mate this time the saying truly reflected how perplexed she was not want to live on sarah pressed want to die like biyal put blood over whole floor lamra had never really thought about not dying until the human raised the question in her mind now that she turned a couple of eyestalks on it the prospect of spilling her blood out all over the floor did seem unpleasant if another choice was available will you make my buds go away she asked i dont think i want you to do that not know how sarah said what will you do then sarah muttered something to himselfno herself lamra would be a long time getting used to thatin her own language then dipped her head to the mate in the human motion that meant the same as widening herself after a moment the human started talking people talk again you know fight question to ask sarah sounded like reatur lamra thought the mate realized that was true in a couple of wayssarahs voice was like a males how could she be a mate that whole tangle of eyestalks would just have to keep you didnt answer me lamra said accusingly not know good answer sarahs sigh was just like a persons try to stop blood when buds fall from you not know how now not even know if able try if you want i dont know i dont know i dont know lamra again thought how much sarah sounded like a male both in the timbre of her voice and in the complex way her mind worked that thought helped the mate find a reply at last ask reatur she said if reatur says its all fight then its all fight with me too your body sarah said your life ask reatur sarah threw her hands in the air lamra had never seen a human do that and did not know what it meant all sarah said though was all fight ask reatur ask reatur now she stood up and started out of the mates chambers lamra watched her go she scratched the itchy skin over her buds again the notion of not ending when the buds dropped off was still a long way from real to her for that matter the time when the buds would drop still seemed a very long way off to a mate anything further away than tomorrow seemed a long way off morea came rushing in lamra was so lost in her own thoughts that the other mate managed to grab two of her arms and almost pull her over that roused lamra she squealed straightened up and tugged back morea jerked free she ran away squealing herself eyestalks wiggling happily lamra dashed after her the rover purred along until the right front wheel hit a big rock hidden by a snowdrift the tough little vehicle climbed over the stone but came down with a jolt that rattled its two ridersit did not have much in the way of springs or padding for the seats every possible gram of weight had been left off shota rustavelis teeth came together with a click that effectively served as a period to the song he had been singing he clutched at his kidneys with a theatrical groan so this is what its like to serve in the tank corps he said valery bryusov did not reply for a moment he was busy wrestling the rover back on course i would not mind having a few tons of steel around me to smooth out the ride he said as the machine finally straightened out nor would i rustaveli shivered a few tons of steel would also enclose a space which could be heated the georgian went on wistfully only a windscreen and a roll cage separated him from the cold all around not enough he thought but again it saved weight he did not think well of saving weight not after nine days in the chilly drafty rover snow spattered off the windscreen some blew over and spattered off rustavelis face he swore and wiped it away it was blowing on bryusov too but the russian paid it no mind like everyone aboard tsiolkovsky but the georgian he seemed perfectly comfortable on minerva and wore his coat and fur hat as if he had thrown them on only as an afterthought i want something warm rustaveli said a woman by choice sorry i cant oblige you there bryusov grunted will you settle for some tea without waiting for an answer he pulled to a stop so rustaveli could pour from the vacuum flask without spilling tea all over himself the georgian drank quickly had he hesitated he would have been taking iced tea by the time he got to the bottom of his glass he savored the warmth not a woman he said but it will have to do i wouldnt mind a glass myself bryusov said i could use a break rustaveli felt his cheeks grow hotnot the kind of warmth he had been looking for im sorry valery aleksandrovich that was thoughtless of me he poured for the linguist baiting bryusov was enjoyable when he did it on purpose being accidentally rude was something else again despite the snow flurries the day did seem less grimly chill without the wind of the rovers motion rustaveli looked around good enough for some pictures he decided and reached for the camera beside him through the spattering snow the countryside was much more rockribbed than it was around tsiolkovskys landing site of course by now the ship was kilometers to the southwest jotun canyon lay only a few kilometers eastward if the land hereabouts was rockribbed rustaveli thought the canyon madea gash big enough for a heart transplant something moved that was not snow rustaveli and bryusov saw it at the same time the linguist grabbed for binoculars rustaveli for a long lens for his nikon not a minervan bryusov said after a moment not one of their domestic animals either or not one weve seen before no rustaveli watched the animal through the cameras viewfinder it doesnt move like a domestic animal the more the georgian studied the beast the greater the unease that flowered in him he held the camera in one hand while making sure with the other that he knew where the kalashnikov was the minervan animal did not move like anything domesticated it moved like a tiger as nearly as could a creature built on this planets lines like all minervan beasts the soviets knew about it was radially symmetrical with six legs six arms and six eyestalks above them but where minervans ambled and their domestic animals plodded this creature stalked its legs were long and graceful its arms by contrast relatively short but thick with muscle and appended with talons that put minervans fingerclaws to shame even its eyestalks had a purposeful motion different from anything rustaveli had seen before somehow they reminded him of so many poisonous snakes three of those eyestalks fixed on the rover its spotted us bryusov said dismay in his voice a moment later he sounded unhappier yet its coming this way l noticed that myself thank you rustaveli was pleased he was able to make light banter when he would sooner have jumped off the rover and fled that was what his body was screaming he ought to do though his brain had a nasty suspicion the animal would be faster than he was instead of running he set down the nikon and picked up the assault rifle the minervan animal drew closer even when less than a hundred meters away it was not easy to see its mottling of brown and dirty white made it blend into the background the same way a tigers stripes camouflage it in tall grass the parallel rustaveli thought was probably no coincidence the georgians head swiveled as the beast prowled around the rover peering at itand its occupantsfrom all sides maybe we ought to get moving again bryusov said nervously i have a feeling the beast can go faster than twenty kilometers an hour and i know quite well the rover cant rustaveli said or were you planning to outmaneuver the thing bryusov did not bother answering that with their six equally spaced legs minervans were more agile than earthly beasts or machines the linguist slipped out of his safety harness and stood up so he could take a picture of the creature without also including a view of the back of rustavelis head maybe the motion set the beast off things happened too quickly for rustaveli to be certain afterward of cause and effect he was sure that bryusov had not got all the way to his feet when the minervan animal let out a shriekan unearthly shriek he would think later and then reject the word how else was a minervan animal supposed to sound and sprang at the rover reflex screamed attack the kalashnikov was hammering against rustavelis shoulder before he realized he had raised it hot brass cartridge cases spit backward the assault rifles staccato bark drowned the squall of the minervan beast that squall cut off abruptly as a moment later did the akt rustaveli grabbed for another magazine and slapped it into place he did not fire again thoughno need he was sure he had missed as often as he had hit but even part of the clip of high velocity mm bullets had been plenty to knock down the minervan creature it was still twitching and thrashing but it was not going anywhere not anymore bryusov sat down with a thump that made the rover shake then he half rose again and used a gloved hand to brush spent cartridges off the seat he cut in power to the wheels the rover silently rolled toward the dying animal lets see what we have the linguist said we have at least one person valery aleksandrovich who is glad these beasts dont hunt in packs bryusov thought about that and gave a shiver that had nothing to do with the weather make that two shota mikheilovich my old grandmother always used to go on about the wolves that would come out of the deep woods to raid the farms around her village when she was a girl the only wolves ive ever seen are the ones in the moscow zoo and that suits me just fine me too for once rustaveli agreed completely with his companion the minervan animal had fallen over giving the two humans a good view of the mouth in the center of its circle of eyestalks the needlelike teeth inside were plenty to cancel any lingering doubts about its nature one of the beasts arms lashed out and smacked against the side of the rover hard enough for the two riders to feel the jolt rustaveli swore and put a couple more bullets into it carefully aimed to pierce the nerve centers minervan creatures had under their eyestalks the big carnivore convulsed one last time and lay still bryusov took more photos rustaveli got down from the rover and used a gloved hand to dig through snow till he found a few pebbles he tossed one at the beast when it did not stir he moved closer and threw another pebble hard this time only then was he satisfied that the beast was dead its claws were too big to fit into a specimen bottle he took one anyway if all else failed he thought he could have it mounted on a chain and wear it around his neck he took other more conventional specimens too katerina would never have forgiven him for failing there the stink of alien body fluids made him cough the dead minervan beast still had one twitch left rustaveli gave a backward leap any russian folk dancer would have been proud of he came down next to his kalashnikov and had it pointed at the carnivore in essentially the same instant the beast was inert again he shook his head in selfreproach jumpy he muttered in the most literal sense of the word bryusov said admiringly had you thought about the olympics the georgian really looked for the first time at the distance he had put between himself and the animal he whistled softly talents you had not dreamed of bryusov asked rustaveli was not one to stay shaken for long grinning he switched to english ive always been good at the broad jump ask katerina why what does she know about your ath bryusov made a sour face as he finally caught on yes she was once one of my chief athletic supporters rustaveli went on blithely still in english this time bryusov did not respond at all calls himself a linguist rustaveli thought scornfullyhes only a dictionary that walks like a man sighing the georgian went back to hacking bits off the animal he had killed when he was sure he had enough to keep katerina happy he got up lets go back valery aleksandrovich so long as we dont exactly retrace our way every kilometer we cover is a new one true enough bryusov pulled his fur cap down a little farther on his forehead it was starting to snow harder i wont be sorry to get back to our comrades i wont be sorry to get back to heating rustaveli knew he was repeating himself and did not care he climbed onto the rover and buckled on his shoulder belt the machine glided away leaving the dead beast to whatever passed for scavengers on minerva the snow began falling heavilythick wet flakes that clung to the rovers windscreen and made bryusov slow down springtime on minerva the linguist grunted yes rustaveli agreed as sardonically the southern latitude equivalent to havana katerina said and at a season much like may i wonder how our ally comrade castro would enjoy the weatherabout as much as i do i daresay bryusov slowed still more i dont like this at all i cant see what im doing if it gets worse we can stop and put tent fabric over the rovers frame till it blows itself out i hate to do that though when were on the way back no matter how much id like to be warm i feel the same way besides the heater uses a lot of energy and the solar panels arent putting out much in this weather even so though we may have to if the linguist never got his if out the rovers front wheels went into an enormous hole filled with drifted snow the rover was not supposed to flip over no matter what happened it flipped over anyhow bryusov and rustaveli shouted as the world turned upside down both shouts cut off abruptly the georgian had the wind jerked from him as his shoulder harness brought him up short the linguist was less fortunate he had not bothered to strap himself in after standing up to photograph the minervan carnivore his head smacked a bar of the rovers roll cage when he could breathe again rustaveli made several choice comments in his own language after a moment he noticed that bryusov was not answeringthe linguist lay unmoving in the snow rustaveli wished he had not wasted his curses before he reached out to kill power to the wheels then holding on to the frame of the rover with one hand he unbuckled his safety belt with the other olga korbut he thought would have spun around in midair to land gracefully he was happy enough not to have dislocated his shoulder bryusov was breathing rustaveli muttered silent thanks for that the linguist remained unconscious though with blood on his face and the side of his head none of the cautious things rustaveli did to try rousing him had any effect the georgian tried the radio and got only static for an answer that sent panic shooting through him he certainly wasnt getting any incoming signal if he wasnt getting out either the rest of the crew would not even know that bryusov and he were in trouble until they missed their next scheduled ca lland even then what could they do assuming they could find the rover at all they were several days forced march from it and bryusoy might not have several days knowing that he had to think straight for his companions sake helped bring rustaveli out of his fright he scrambled out of the rover turning it back over unfortunately proved more than a oneperson job another design flaw he thought and immediately filed the idea away no time to worry about it now the radio was the pressing concern the most obvious reason for its failure was damage from the accident rustaveli could do nothing about that but he reasoned crash damage should have silenced the radio not left it flatulent the antenna he said out loud it would hardly do much good buried in a snowdrift he had to bend a kink in the springy wire to make it go up past the body of the rover even then it was less than half as tall as it should have been that was the best he could do though he crawled back under the rovers chassis and tried the radio again rustaveli calling rustaveli calling do you read emergency do you read the repetition was very much like prayer shota whats wrong katerina zakharovas voice sounded as if she were talking from behind a waterfall but it was the most welcome thing rustaveli had ever heard katya he exclaimed then went on more calmly weve had an accidentthis damned buggy overturned valerys hurt hurt how how badly even through the roaring static the georgian could hear katerina turning into dr zakharova how badly i dont know he told her hes unconscious hit his head this was fifteen minutes ago maybe more and he hasnt come to yet i havent tried moving him good she broke in dont not unless you have to i know that i also didnt much fancy the idea of undressing him to check for anything else wrong not while its snowing as it always did his wry sense of humor reasserted itself so much for springtime in havana rustaveli that was colonel tolmasov doing his best to mask the concern in his voice give me your exact position the panel connected to the gyrocompass was hard to read upside down but rustaveli managed distance t kilometers bearing o there was silence for a moment from the radio rustaveli could picture tolmasov drawing a line on a map near jotun canyon the colonel said at last da sergei konstantinovich somehow rustaveli managed a chuckle a good deal closer to the americans than to you as a matter of fact only one tiny obstacle in the way he laughed againonly a gorge that dwarfed anything earth knew tolmasov was businesslike as usual can you right your vehicle not by myself ive tried if valery comes around as if on cue bryusov moved and groaned rustaveli out shota said he bent by his companion valery are you all right do you know who i am head bryusov muttered he started to lift his left hand to his head then stopped with another louder groan under the blood that splashed it his face was gray katerina and tolmasov were both screaming at rustaveli on the radio he ignored them until bryusov drifted away from consciousness again this time though the linguist seemed less deeply out he was also rustaveli saw with much relief able to move his legs and right arm although he whimpered whenever his left arm so much as twitched the georgian relayed the news no broken back or neck then katerina said thats something exactly what i was thinking but that arm and he has no idea of where he is or what hes doing he took a nasty shot in the head do you think he can hold out until dr zakharova and i can reach you tolmasov asked still sounding very official comrade colonel i do not know rustaveli said with equal formality what choice has he however i am coming to that now something was in tolmasovs voice distaste whatever he was about to say rustaveli thought he was not happy about it then tolmasov went on and the georgian understood why shota mikheilovich you were facetious when you said the americans were nearer to you than we are but you were also right they have some sort of very light aircraft with them if i ask they may be able to cross the gorge and treat valery if i ask do you want me to ask rustaveli knew the colonel wanted to hear a no tolmasov had been ready to bite nails in half when the americans proved as able as he to throw around charges of deception begging help from them had to be the last thing he wanted to do or almost the last thinghe couldnt be eager to have bryusov die either to say nothing of the linguist himself news of a death on minerva would hurt the soviet space program the same way one would damage the americans effort it all came down to how badly bryusov was hurt if he just had a knock on the head and say a broken wrist rustaveli knew enough first aid to patch him up if on the other hand he had managed to do something nasty like rupturing his spleen the georgian would never know it till too late you better call athena he said there was a long silence from tolmasov followed by an even longer sigh damnation very well rustaveli could tell he had just lost points with the colonel sergei konstantinovich think of it this way if valery dies after we summon the american doctor of if the doctor refuses to come and he dies whose fault is that not ours certainly but if we do not call a point tolmasov admitted after another pause he was sounding official again which rustaveli took as a good sign i will call the americans how do i know what would happen if a mate survived budding reatur demanded they come to ripeness they mate and then they die always that is what it is to be a mate but what if one doesdidlive sarah levitt persisted if mates grow up too what they like then she wished her grammar were better and her vocabulary bigger she needed to be persuasive whathow muchof lives you waste when mates not live die young reatur did not just order her to shut up and go away as a medieval english baron might have dealt with someone proposing revolutionary social change sarah had to give him that much baron was about as close as anyone had come to translating the minervan word that literally meant domain master but sarah knew it lacked meanings that were there in the minervan and added connotations missing from it and reaturs domain was a long long way from medieval england the domain master turned a third eyestalk her way he began to sing something or perhaps to declaim since he had no music to accompany the words sarah was not sure which whichever it was he used his arms to help her follow the rhythm of his words the meaning was something else again with an obviously memorized piece like this one reatur could not pause and explain himself as he went along sarah gathered it was a sadsong but that was about all eventually reatur realized she could not fully understand he broke off and started speaking simply again it is about a domain master who has had three of his mates bud all on the same day and about his sorrow as he gives the last of them to the scavengers every male who has brought a mate to budding knows this sorrow how could we not we are not beasts and mates are not beasts no but mates not people not nowdie too soon let mates be people too i try to let lamra live after budding let her be person let her grow to be person yes sarah watched reatur intently she wanted nothing in the worldnothing in two worldsmore than the chance to try to save lamra she could feel her face twisting into a frown of concentration as she cast about for the words to make him see things her way at last she found the very phrase she needed the radio on her belt squawked she jumped that perfect phrase vanished from her head reatur was startled too startled enough to jerk in his eyestalks you read me sarah emmett bragg asked from the tinny little speaker acknowledge please im here emmettat the castle talking with reatur come back to the ship please right away even with the please it was an order five minutes she pleaded maybe those right words would come back this second emmett said flatly emergency on my way sarahs hands folded into fists wearing gloves she did not even get the painful release of nails biting flesh she turned back to reatur must go now talk more of lamra later yes i suppose we may reatur said sarah had to be content with that damn damn damn she muttered under her breath as she trotted down the hallway toward her bicycle the timing could not have been worse reatur had been weakening she was sure of it she leapt onto the bicycle and worked out some of her frustration by fairly flying back to the ship she braked so violently that she almost went headfirst over the handlebars if this wasnt a genuine life or death emergency she thought she was going to peel some paint off the corridor walls but it was she could see that on emmett braggs face then she hesitated emmett was in the control room and so was irv she breathed silent thanks that the emergency had nothing to do with himand so were louise and frank and pat nobody looked damaged though everyone was as somber as emmett somber to sarahs way of thinking did not constitute an emergency she set hands on hips what the hells going on she snapped wheres the beef hon its on the other side of jotun canyon irv said she stared at him the russian rovers had an accident emmett said one of their people is down and outhead and arm injuries at the very least maybe more whats that got to do with me she demanded they have a doctor of their own who is at the moment almost seventy miles from the rover and stuck on foot without it bragg said whereas we have bikes to get to the edge of the canyon fast and damselfly to get over itthe rovers only a mile or so away from the far edge of the canyon he held up a map with a red dot felt tipped in to show the location this mess happened an hour ago tops you could be there before sunset but their doc is three days away get damselfly over jotun canyon sarah said faintly any kind of nasty wind and i could be several miles straight down too bragg nodded i know that i told tolmasov i wouldnt give you any orders and im not but he asked for our help and if there is any youre it youre the doctor and youre the pilot here too its up to you sarah no hard feelings if you say no except to the hurt russian she pointed out if he lives to have them there is that bragg said sarah irv began and then shut up she knew a moments gratitude that he recognized the decision was not his to make let me see the map she said emmett bragg passed it to her she studied it how wide is the canyon fight here it seems to be one of the narrower stretches is it less than ten miles it looks like it bragg took the map back he pulled a clear plastic ruler from one of his coverall pockets and applied it to the image of the gap and then to the scale of miles at the bottom lefthand comer of the sheet good eyeballing he said its just under nine as a matter of fact bryan allen flew gossamer albatross across the english channel thats twice as far and then some and ive got a better plane than the albatross ever dreamed of being sarah said im going if the gossamer albatross came apart all whatshisname would have got was wet irv said if something goes wrong with damselfly or if you get the winds you know perfectly well you could sarah did not want to think about that jotun canyon was deep enough that if the worst did happen she would have plenty of time to reflect on her folly as she fell irv if you were hurt on this side of the canyon and the russians had a plane i hope theyd try to help frank marquard had been quiet till now how high are the canyon walls on either side relative to each other he asked abruptly if the land west of the canyon is a quartermile higher than it is on this side you wont be able to climb up to it if its a quartermile lower youll never get back everyone crowded around to peer at the map either upside down or over emmett braggs shoulder seems all right sarah said after a long hard look call tolmasov emmett tell him im on my way find out what first aid supplies their rover has too ill save weight with my kit that way because i wont carry anything they already have right bragg turned to his wife and irv yall heard the lady break out the pieces of damselfly and get em onto the towing carts pulling em to the edge of the canyon i expect youll be working near as hard as sarah will going over louise simply nodded and left irv followed a moment later shaking his head and muttering under his breath theres nothing i can do about it sarah wanted to call after him but he knew that as well as she did knowing and accepting were two different thingsall she needed to do was think of lamra to see the truth there ill get my bike too pat marquard said what for sarah emmett and frank all spoke together so you can ride behind me pat said to sarah as if the two men were not there you should be fresh when you get into damselfly not worn out from spending half a day pedaling that made such plain good sense that sarah could only nod her thanks and hug pat who returned the embrace emmett bragg lifted the radio microphone athena calling soviet expedition the reply was immediate tolmasov here go ahead old man sergei konstantinovich our doctor will try repeat try to fly damselfly across jotun canyon to help your injured crewman thank you very much brigadier bragg we are in your debt you dont thank me you thank the lady and i just may call in that debt one day if i see a way to do it er yes tolmasov sounded wary again sarah thought frowning emmett never let up he saw everything as a confrontation as if to belie that the mission commander went on for now though we only need to know what your rover has in the way of medical gear so we can avoid duplication with athenas computers any of the americans could have called up the answer to that as fast as he typed in the question tolmasovs promised one moment please stretched to sew eral minutes at least he had what sarah needed when he finally did come back on the air that she supposed counted for something mist and distance shrouded the land on the western side of jotun canyon sarah did stretching exercises to work out the kinks of a morning and early afternoon spent riding behind pat marquard after a moment sarah turned her back on the canyon she did not want to think about it before she had to instead she watched her husband and louise bragg reassemble damselfly irv was whistling something as he made sure every wingnut was tight sarah took longer than she should have to recognize santa claus is coming to town she started to let out a snort then stopped abruptly if using a silly song helped remind him to be careful that was all right with her ready when you are louise said a little later pat who had been reduced to a spectator once they got to the edge of the canyon made herself useful by carrying the special wide stepladder to damselfly lets do it sarah got out of her jacket and insulated pants and immediately started to shiver jogging over to damselfly did nothing to warm her up irv waited at the top of the stepladder to help her down into the ultraultralight when she was seated he handed her the clear plastic bag in which she had put her suppliesit was a pound or more lighter than her regular medical bag she secured it to a spar behind her with duct tape be careful irv said i love you i know i love you too she strapped the biking helmet under her chin when she was done she reached up to touch his cheek this is what you get for marrying a doctor ill be all right you i wouldnt worry about but this damn contraption isnt made for the kind of air you may get over the canyon she shrugged people arent made for banging their heads either checking to be sure the prop was not engaged she started pedaling furiously to charge the batteryand to stop her teeth from chattering she hardly noticed irv lowering the canopy over her and dogging it in place radio check louise said testing one two three read you five by five sarah answered how do you read me they went through the rest of the preflight checklist making sure all the controls worked sarah watched the charge gauge climb by the time the battery was all the way up she was no longer freezing she glanced to either side irv and louise were standing by at damselflys wingtips she waved to show them she was ready when they waved back she flicked the propellercontrol switch the big airfoil taller than she was began to spin damselfly rolled bumpily forward the two wingpersonsa word sarah formed and rejected in the same instantrunning alongside to hold it level airborne irv yelled as the ultraultralight lifted off the ground roger sarah said to let him and louise know she knew as always damselfly was painfully slow gaining altitude even so after less than a minute the ground dropped away as if the plane had a rocket in its tail watch that first step she murmured to herself as she peered down and down and down into jotun canyon its a mother say again damselfly louise quested never mind sarah said embarrassed then she gave all her attention back to pedaling and to watching the little compass irv had glued to the control stick the far wall of the canyon was too far away to give her any landmarks toward which to steer and the sun was invisible through thick gray clouds she laughed a little damselfly had not been designed for instrument night some of the clouds were underneath her jotun canyon was plenty big enough to have weather of its own sarah was just glad the clouds didnt altogether block the western wall from view seeing it loom out of the fog too late to dodge was the stuff of nightmares everything all fight hon irv sounded as if he expected her to go spiraling down into the canyon any second now no problems she answered taking her left hand off the stick to flick on the radios send switch im even getting warm exercise and all that keeping damselfly in the air was hard work closer to running than to bicycling on the ground i should be across in less than half an hour off i go into the wild gray yonder oh shut up irv said chuckling sarah switched off her husband would be too busy fuming to worry about her for a while she pedaled on the breeze from the fresh air tube began to feel delicious not icy looking down between her busy feet sarah saw she was above the deepest part of the jotun canyon something moving down there caught her eye she could not tell what sort of beast it was any more than a jetliner passenger can name the makes of cars he sees from feet just with level flight between the canyons walls she was half that high over the bottom herself she wondered what lived down there whatever it was it was not a fulltime resident not unless it nailed itself to the biggest rock it could find when the yearly floods came through maybe not then either then all such mental busywork blew away with the gusting tailwind that swept damselfly along with it and threatened to make the ultraultralight stall sarah gasped pedaled harder and hit the prop control switch to make the propeller grab more air a moment later she also turned on the planes little electric motor to add its power to hers for a few queasy seconds she thought none of that would do any good gusts were the worst problem with humanpowered aircraft one of five miles an hour gave damselfly as much of a jolt as a mph gust did to a cessna the flimsy little craft did not want to answer its controls from the way the spars creaked sarah wondered if it was going to break up in midair dont you dare you bastard she said fiercely as if that would do any good at all damsel fly held together sarah brought the planes nose down her legs were blurs on the pedals she never knew whether her efforts saved her or the gust simply subsided what she did know was that all the sweat on her body had turned cold when she was sure the ultraultralightand her voicewere in full control again she thumbed the radios send switch hello back there she said before i was worrying about whether the russians would have blankets and such for me now all i care about is a change of underwear she was surprised at how easily she could joke about what had just happened no one she thought really believes in the possibility of her own death while irv and louise exclaimed tinnily through damselflys speaker sarah shook her head annoyed at herself philosophizing after the fact was all very well but the cold sweat still coated her and her joke had almost been no joke at all but literally true she had believed in death all right the western edge of jotun canyon grew closer sarah resisted the temptation to put on another mad burst of effort so she could reach it fifteen seconds before she would have otherwise as in distance running staying within herself counted she could feel how much the one emergency had taken out of her at last she had land under her once more at a distance to be measured in feet rather than miles she hit the radio switch again the russians could not reply on the frequency damselfly used but they were supposed to be listening damselfly calling the soviet rover she said in slow careful russian i am on your side of the canyon please send up a flare to show me your location she repeated herself several times all the while she was scanning the horizon if her navigation had been good the flare would rise straight ahead of her no sign of it there no sign of it anywhere in fact what was sarah frowned groping for the namerustavelis problem there the brilliant crimson spark hung in the air it was north of where she had expected it the gust over the canyon must have thrown her off worse than she thought she twisted the control stick working first ailerons and then rudder to go into the long slow turn that was the best damselfly could do the flare slowly sank while she approached now she eyed the ground instead of the sky motion drew her gaze that was no minervan down there that was a man soviet rover i have you visually she said triumphantly coming in to land rustaveli waved her on snap crackle popreally bad came out of the radio irv didnt think it was haunted by rice krispies what he did think was than no one had planned for damsel fly to be on the ground ten miles from the nearest receiver the transmitter was not made to carry that far no wonder the signal had static in it say again sarah he urged more kelloggs noises then not really bad she said broken ulna concussion nasty cut maybestatic again cracked ribs but no sign of internal bleeding hell get sarahs voice vanished once more say again irv repeated and kept on repeating it until the static cleared hell get better sarah said almost as clearly as if she were standing beside him with louise and pat grinning louise clasped her gloved hands over her head as if to say the winnab and still champion nodding irv asked the question that was even more important to him and how are you hon tired otherwise okay she answered i wont try to come back today i need the rest and its too close to sunset to make me want to risk any funny winds the change from day to night might bring on over the canyon once was too f the signal broke up again but irv had no trouble filling in the participial phrase he had not actually heard concur louise said over and over till sarah acknowledged wait at least till midmorning let the air settle as much as its going to will you be warm enough tonight irv worried even when minervan days got above freezing nights stayed in the teens or colder plenty thank you grandmother sarah answered which made pat giggle and irvs ears turn hot under the flaps of his cap you can all be jealous of me too because im eating something that doesnt come off our ration list the russians have this very nice little smoked lamb sausage called ah damlama khasip an accented male voice supplied shota rustaveli nobody wants to hear about it irv said he was jealous and so were pat and louise if the lean and hungry looks on their faces meant anything the food they had with them which they would have eaten without much thinking about it suddenly seemed too dull for words smoked lamb sausage irv felt his mouth watering pat touched his arm and held out her hand for the radio when he gave it to her she said sarah ill bet theyre as sick of that as we are of freezedried waffles you are only too right rustaveli said under the rueful amusement in his voice the russianno georgiansounded perfectly serious a pity we have no better way to meet than this damselfly of yours who knows what i might do for a freezedried waffle louise bragg grabbed the radio sarah did you check that one for brain damage too the humans on both sides of tun canyon laughed together people i think the best thing we all could do now is rest sarah said weve had a long day and another one is coming up tomorrow she switched from pragmatic physician to wife but only for a moment love you irv out love you too out irv fired up the portable stove to melt snow and then boil water for the dinner packs he pat and louise had brought along the chicken h la king he knew wasnt really bad but that was the troublehe knew it damlama khasipsuch an exotic name what would it taste like he was intrigued enough to wonder out loud like making love with a stranger after being married for years pat suggested she dug a spoon into her own food tasted it and sadly shook her head married to somebody boring she amended no one argued with her it was nearly dark by the time they were done wed better keep watch through the night irv said or your husband louise who i hope is not boringshe stuck out her tongue at himwill have our hides when we get back to athena he tore three scraps of paper off a notebook page kept one and handed the others to the women write a number between one and ten he said and then show it he scrawled a himself louise revealed an pat a all right im odd man out ill stay awake a while who shall i roust when i sack out pat and louise looked at each other after a few seconds pat said ill take the middle watch if youre silly enough to volunteer im silly enough to let you louise said at once i hate sleeping in shifts yawning she unrolled her sleeping bag and i am beat she climbed in and zipped the bag up so little more than her nose showed gnight pat got into her sleeping bag too ill wake you about ten minervan standard wristwatch time irv said she nodded louise was already breathing slowly and regularly irv walked around wishing for a big blazing campfire as night fell the horizon seemed to close in on him until the unknown lay hardly farther away than his outstretched fingertips city boys like me dont really realize how dark night can be without street lights and such he thought it took all of his will not to turn on his flashlight and wave it for the sake of something to see stars would have helped at least to ease his mind but the clouds wrapped them away in cotton wool once for a moment he saw a wan smudge of light in the skyone of the three little minervan moons though without a set of tables he had no idea which thicker clouds soon drifted over it and made it disappear that left irv his ears and nose left him a wolf pacing a prairie not his own he was not evolved to know which little innocuous night noises were not innocuous after all which of the scents on the chilly breeze would have sent any sensible minervan beast running for its life the local odors reminded him of nothing so much as how an organic chemistry lab smelled from a good way down the hall something crunched behind him he whirled one hand grabbing for the flashlight the other for the on his belt its only me pat said softly i cant sleep jesus irv felt himself getting angry he knew it was his adrenaline all dressed up with no place to go but knowing that did not make the anger any less real good thing you didnt try sneaking up on emmett like that he said inhibited in volume because he did not want to wake louise hedve handed you your head instead of going into palpitations like me his heart was still thumping in his chest sorry pat made her whisper sound contrite she stepped closer to him i just figured id wander over and keep you company for a while thats all if you want ill go away again no never mind now that youre here im glad youre herebut damn pat they both laughed remembering his earlier thought irv went on well have to keep it down so we dont bother louise sure but i dont think itll be a problem she sleeps like a stonemust be a clear conscience or something was that bitterness there hard to be sure with only a whisper to go on hard to imagine anyone having anything against louise too irvs brain finally paid attention to what his nose had been telling him he scratched his head odds were knowing him that he had just missed it before but still did you have perfume on while we were biking up the sweet muskiness cut through the strange minervan odors and struck deep into his senses no she said he scratched his head again dont tell me you put it on just for me im flattered but pat interrupted him but not with words her mouth was soft against his and clung with something close to desperation when he started to pull away she was almost as tall as he and just about as strong ive wanted to do that for a long time she murmured have you irv said amazed even through his protective clothing and hers he could feel her breasts press against him his gloved hand found itself at the curve of her waist youve done a good job of hiding it then ive done a good job of hiding lots of things the worst part is frank doesnt even notice her low voiced laugh had knives in it and dont tell me youve been getting all you want from sarah either there isnt enough privacy on athena to let you get away with a lie there isnt enough privacy on athena for anything she made it into a curse what she said was true enough he thought dizzily as pat kissed him again no privacy he knew for instance that she had a tiny brown mole just under her fight nipple that the hair between her legs was a couple of shades darker than the tarnished gold curls of her head till this moment he had not spent much time thinking about any of that but he knew he also knew that sarah had told him no more times lately than he had been happy with it was hard to think of sarah right now with pats tongue agile as a snake trailing warmly over his cheek and under his cap to tease his ear he felt his body respond her hand pressed him through his trousers for a moment his hands pressed too the firm flesh of her buttocks yielded beneath his fingers she arched her back thrusting her hips against him at last their mouths separated the chill of the long breath of air irv gulped in helped him bring his body partly back under the control of his will trying to make light of what was happening he said shakily god pat if i were twentyone again id haul your pants down and screw you fight here even if we both froze our asses off do it she said i want you to she was still rubbing him stroking him trying to goad him to action pat this is foolish he said as gently as he could reaching down to take her hand away and suppressing a spasm of regret almost before he knew it was there im not twentyone anymore i dont let my cock do all my thinking for me youre not twentyone either dont you think were too far from home to do anything that would hurt any of us i hurt now pat retorted you would too if youd been faking it all the way out from earth orbit and the only way sarahd be hurt is if she found out she would im a lousy liar about that kind of thing not irv thought that ive ever had much to lie about his one brush with infidelity had come at a drunken party a few years back he and a girlgod hed forgotten her namewere fooling around in a walkin closet when he passed out between second and third base he had always reckoned the next days killer hangover punishment to fit the crime he had not been seriously tempted to wander since come to think of it he had not been seriously drunk since either you dont want me pats voice was fiat despairing you know better than thatyou damn well ought to though subsiding irv still stirred at the memory of her touch but what i want and what im going to do are two different things pat jumping on you is tempting as hell but its just more trouble than its worthfor me for sarah for frank and for you for louise too if she happens to get up to pee at the wrong moment she wont pat said but irv saw her sag he nodded slowly to himself if privacy was her hangup reminding her she didnt have it seemed like a good idea assuming of course that he really didnt feel like getting laid well that was the assumption he had made and he still thought it was the right one pat if what you need is being alone you should have had a good time on the collecting trips you took with frank i hoped that too she said bleakly didnt work not for me anyway frank nowfrank had lots of fun its easy for a manyou get your jollies every time frank doesnt know you dont he asked she shook her head maybe you ought to let him know maybe i ought to shut up too he thought a marriage counselor im not how am i supposed to do that she demanded setting her hands on her hips gosh im so sorry honey but for the last year you havent turned me on at all her voice was a dangerous parody of sweetness irv winced definitely i ought to shut up he thought there are probably better ways he said carefully to his surprise she started to laugh and even sounded as though she meant it do you know irv you may be too sensible for your own good its hard to be sensible when youre horny tell me about it he said its hard to be sensible when a finelooking wench tries to kick your feet out from under you too hmm i didnt think of that you suppose it would have worked pat leaned toward him no dont run away she said when he started to pull back now the only question is should i kiss you or punch your lights out she ended up doing a little of both pecking his cheek and tromping on his foot hard enough to hurt there thatll keep you guessing now what time has it gotten to be he blinked at the change of subject then pulled back his sleeve so he could check his watch a little before nine go to sleep she told him im too wound up to sleep now so i may as well start my stretch early are you sure yes go on will you ill be fine okay thanks irv took a couple of steps then looked back doubtfully pat sent him on with an impatient wave he got out of his shoes climbed quickly into his sleeping bag and zipped it up sleep took a while coming though louise lay a few feet away from the way she was snoring she was out like a light irv suspected that he could have led a brass band past her without waking her up let alone playing slap and tickle with pat suddenly he wanted her more than he had when she was in his arms he shook his head turning down a woman who offered herself like that was not one of the easier things he had done he laughed at himself its not as if ive had a lot of practice he said under his breath whats that pat asked nothing just brainfuzz he rolled over and eventually went to sleep adin dva tri rustaveli shouted at three he and the american doctor pushed on the rover with all their might she was even smaller than katerina but determination and no little strength made up for her lack of size grunting and sweating she and rustaveli fought the rovers weight until it overbalanced and flipped back onto its wheels it jounced a couple of times then sat still well done valery bryusov cheered from a few meters away his left arm was splinted and in a sling rigged from a piece of blanket he made a rueful gesture with his good hand i wish i could have helped never mind valery aleksandrovich rustaveli sprang onto the rover and tried the motor the vehicle rolled ahead he stopped it and grinned thanks to sarah ah davidovna you are fixed now it is fixed and we will be going back to our comrades carefully i hope sarah said she picked up the blankets she used to supplement the flimsy costume that was all she wore inside her pedal powered plane and started to redrape them bryusov stepped forward to help her but rustaveli beat him there after so long with just katerina to think about he was astonished at how much the mere sight of a different woman excited him but when his hands accidentally started to slide down from her shoulders the flinty look she gave him stopped him in his tracks excuse me he muttered surprised at how embarrassed he was all right then she said but her voice did not imply that it was all right her voice warned him not to try it again this he thought could be one seriously stubborn woman maybe he should be just as well pleased not to be spending three years of his life in close company with her nevertheless sarah davidovna we are in your debt he said i especially bryusov agreed the more so as you had tomake a journey dangerous to yourself to help me and our nations are not the best of friends under the awkward blankets she shrugged there arent any nations here just peopleand not very many of us compared to anyone or anything else on minerva were all closer than brothers if we dont help each other who will you are right rustaveli said though he knew oleg lopatin would have hurt himself laughing at such a notionand perhaps colonel tolmasov too for that matter he doubted that all the americans on minerva were as altruistic as this dr levitt otherwise for instance tolmasov would have been happier dealing with emmett bragg while rustaveli was working through that chain of thought bryusov asked what the georgian should have how may we help you now sarah davidovna you valery aleksandrovich can help best by staying out of the way and not risking any further harm to yourself she said firmly shota mikheilovich if you would you could help me swing damselfly around so that it faces back toward jotun canyon once more that will save me the trouble of flying around in a long slow semicircle before i can head back to my own people so much for the brotherhood of all men on minerva rustaveli thought still the request was entirely reasonable show me what to do he walked over to the ultraultralight with her very simple she said you take one wingtip ill take the other then we walk around till the plane points the way we want it to just be careful not to poke your fingers through the plastic skin da he said absently he was amazed at how easily the plane moved this ah damselfly cannot weigh even as much as i do not even close the american doctor agreed the aircraft soon pointed east but she still looked discontented rustaveli understood why when she said as much to herself as to him now how am i supposed to get into the blasted thing he saw the problem at once the canopy opened at the top and there was no way to clamber up without tearing the plastic film of the fuselage to ribbons he rubbed his chin whiskers rasped under his gloves as he thought finally he snapped his fingers or tried tothe gloves effectively muffled the noise suppose i drive the rover alongside your plane here you could climb on top of the roll cage and i will help you down onto the seat inside the plane after his try at feeling her up he wondered if she would hesitate she didnt not even for a second fine she said lets do it the rover purred up to damsel fly rustaveli turned off the engine and set the brakes on all four wheels then he scrambled up onto the top of the machine sarah levitt came swarming after him you do that very well he said i havent been on a jungle gym since i was nine years old but its not the sort of thing you forget sarah undid the canopy and sat on the metal bars of the roll cage with her feet dangling down intowhat would one call it the pilots compartment the engine room wondering that rustaveli was almost caught by surprise when the american doctor said lower me rustaveli hooked his feet at the corners of intersecting bars and took a firm grip on sarah levitts waist he was glad she was a small woman it made her weight easier to control as she slid into damselfly although his arms traveled up her torso as she descended he took no undue liberties thank you she said in a way that thanked him for that as well as for his help he backed the rover out of the way and walked around to the other side of damselfly so he could close the canopy when it was latched he asked now what no need to shout she said the skin is too thin to cut down on sound she was already pedaling hard though the propeller had not yet begun to spin her legs did not slow down as she went on go to the end of one wing and run along with me holding it level when i start to taxi he sprang to attention and snapped off a salute sharper than any tolmasov would ever wring from him i am yours to command under her white plastic helmet the american doctors eyes twinkled you are a very silly man shota mikheilovich how did you manage to sneak past all the selection boards he winked at her simple i did not tell them he was whistling as he walked out to the wingtip the big propeller tall as he was revolved slowly at first then faster and faster now sarah levitt shouted damselfly rolled forward startlingly fast rustaveli was into a trot almost at once then he was running and running for all he was worth for a moment it seemed to him that he was the one on the point of becoming airborne then damselfly wheels lifted clear of the ground the plane was going faster than the georgian could match he pulled to a stop and stood panting his breath a cloud of fog around his head the american doctor briefly took one hand off the control stick to wave to him and bryusov they both waved back the linguist walked up to rustaveli as damselfly skimmed eastward toward jotun canyon im sorry you will have to do all the driving as we return to our comrades bryusov said rustaveli was still watching the ultraultralight diminish in the distance nichevo he said it doesnt matter at least i wont have to pedal home there louise bragg shouted she slapped irv on the back he staggered straightened and followed her pointing finger with his eyes at first he could make out nothing through the mist but then he too spied the moving speck he held the radio to his mouth honeyuh damselflywe have you visually good i dont see you yet now shut up and let me work sarahs voice came in panting gasps irv picked up the video camera and kicked in the zoom lens damselfly seemed to leap toward him though it was still well out over jotun canyon no gusts not now he thoughtas close to a prayer as a secular man would let himself come beside him he heard pat saying come on dammit come on over and over to herself he nodded which made the image he was taping jump somehow the way pat was pulling for sarah made him easier about what had happenedand what had almost happenedthe night before then he could hear the props whoosh and the rattle of the bicycle chain that fed the power of sarahs legs to the ultraultralight she was above level ground now on this side of the canyon irv switched off the camcorder and set it down so he could jump and yell damselfly has landed sarah said touching down only a few feet from where she had taken off her ribs were heaving with exhaustion she sat slumped over the control stick she managed a tired wave for irv as he set the wide stepladder beside damselfly he undid the latches to the canopy flung it open and leaned over to help her climb out thanks she said when she stood beside him all i can say is the next time the russians want my services they can jolly well come see me he sadly shook his head i knew it had to happenall that exercise has made your brain atrophy not to the point where i cant feel cold she poked him in the ribs with an elbow help me into my gear will you he did saying im glad youre back you and me both she agreed feelingly there were a few seconds on the way over when i doubtedbut lets not talk about that i dont even want to think about it neither do i why dont you just relax and let louise and me knock down damselfly so we can take it back to athena if i sit still too soon ill stiffen up sarah walked around while irv and louise attacked the ultraultralight with wrenches pat fell into step beside her irv felt a nervous twinge whenever they happened to look his way stupid he told himselfnothing happened the only time sarah said anything even remotely sexual on the way back though was just after she emerged from behind a boulder where she had gone to answer a call of nature i have stiffened up she grumbled then she grinned wryly at irv better not ask me to get on top anytime in the next few days damn just when i was hoping to break out the trampoline he said so innocently that she almost forgot to glare they got back to athena a little before sunset emmett bragg took the mm cassette from the video camera as if it were worth its weight in diamonds and handed it to his wife we transmit this first thing tomorrow he told her why she demanded itll tie up the link wouldnt you rather send data than pretty pictures most of the time sure with this id sooner be on the network news and we will tootape of the american doctor flying back after saving the russians bacon theyll show that all over the world when you think about what itll do for our program the data can wait they all looked at each other no one argued with him reatur had grown used to having humans around he did not realize ithe would have indignantly denied ituntil four of the six strange creatures went away on their traveling contraptions and the other two stayed close by the building that had fallen from the sky without their poking their stalkless eyes into every comer of his domain and throwing questions at him like snowballs he found himself bored now they were back and sarah just as though heshe curse ithad never been away was pestering him about lamra he did not want to think about lamra right now to keep from having to do so he changed the subject why did the four of you leave so suddenly the other day to help a hurt human ah reatur said then he brought himself up short wait four of you went away none of you was hurt am i right at sarahs headwag he went on the two who stayed were not hurt either true again the human wagged her head that accounts for all the humans there are doesnt it he asked so where did the hurt one come from he from domain called russia sarah replied which told reatur nothing not same domain as ours he hurt on far side of ervis gorge more humans more domains of humans the idea disconcerted reatur as badly as it had fralk the domain master started to ask about it then stopped something else sarah had said was of more immediate concern to him you went across ervis gorge he asked hoping he had misunderstood but sarah was moving her head up and down once more how reatur asked faintly in small machine that goes through air sarah spread her single pair of arms to mimic wings and moved her two legs as she did when she was inside the contraption reatur felt brief relief then had another unsettling thought these other humans from the other domainhe did not try to pronounce itdo they also have one of these machines for moving through the air no sarahs answer was quick and positive then they couldnt give one to the skarmer the idea of humans dropping out of the sky was quite bad enough thinking of armed westerners crossing ervis gorge through the air was simply horrifying but sarah said no again reatur turned an eyestalk on himself goodhe had not been alarmed enough to turn blue showing fear to any human would have been embarrassing showing fear to a human mate did not bear thinking about mates had enough trouble in their poor short lives that they should never be burdened with a males concerns as well intellectually reatur knew the three human mates were not like those of his kind emotionally that still had not sunk in sarah helped drive the point home though about lamra she resumed more stubborn than any of reaturs males would have been when the domain master was so plainly unwilling to discuss the matter we will talk about lamra another time not now reatur declared that should have settled the matter but sarah rudely refused to let it stay settled what you do now instead what more important than lamra you not talk of lamra lamra die what more important than lamra not dying he had to think for a moment to come up with an answer but at last he did i am going to check with the watchers i have placed at the edges of ervis gorge if the skarmer somehow manage to root themselves on this side lamra will not be the only one who dies he started to leave you run from me sarah said reatur watched himself start to go yellow that it was partly true only made him angrier the human went on how skarmerhow anyonecross ervis gorge how should i know reatur yelled so loud that sarah stepped back a pace and a male stuck an eyestalk around a corner to make sure everything was all fight the domain master was a person who if poked by one fingerclaw hit back with three he kept fight on shouting until you told me sarah i didnt think anyone could cross it through the air for all i know the sneaky westerners may come by way of water when the gorge fills up that was the most ridiculous thing he could think of but he was cursed if he would admit it since i dont know what theyll do i have to point my eyestalks every which way at once dont i yes the human mate conceded reluctantly reatur had not intimidated her though for she continued we talk of lamra later yes later yes not now this time when the domain master walked past sarah she let him go but her voice pursued him maybe skarmer doesdouse water humans go by water sometimes reatur kept walking his color slowly faded he decided he preferred being bored to being harassed he had grown so used to being harassed by humans that it had taken some time without them to remind him how things had been not so very long ago a drop of water hit him in an eye as he walked out of his castle summer was close now everything was starting to melt dealing with humans gave the domain master the same feeling as that splash they melted all his certainties just as the summer sun worked on his home the males working in the fields he saw were not working very hard he started to shout at them then decided he would be wasting his temper stone tools made everyone slow at least the males were accomplishing more with those than they would have with ice which grew more frangible day by day some of the males were working in the very shadow of athena and not turning so much as a single eyestalk toward the huge strange structure they were used to humans too reatur wondered if that was good or bad good he supposed nothing at all would have gotten done if everyone was still as bemused as at first but finding a human as normal as an eloc did not seem right either havingjust had that thought reatur had to wiggle his eyestalks at himself when he passed the human called frank who was on his way back from ervis gorge without even stopping to chat and this frank had shown enoph that rocks of all the crazy ideas had ages just like people that was a notion deserving of days of talk but reatur had other things on his mind at the moment frank after all would be here tomorrow and the day after too reatur had watchers posted along the entire stretch of ervis gorge that marked the western frontier of his domain but most of them clustered close to the castle that was where most of his people lived and also where the bridge across the gorge had been ternat was one of the watchers he carded three javelins as if he expected a horde of skarmer males to come roaring across the gorge at any moment he widened himself when he saw reatur approaching never mind that eldest reatur said impatiently and ternat resumed his normal height im glad to see you so alert one day the domain will be mine clanfather unless the skarmer steal it from me i do not intend to let them well said i came to ask you to spread word to your fellow watchers use one eyestalk to look at the sky from time to time the sky clanfather no one can go through the sky no one save humans i mean ternat amended as he would not have before athena came down aye humans reatur saidno escaping the creatures not anymore i learn there are humans on the western side of ervis gorge too humans of a different clan from the ones here who knows what treacherous tricks they may have taught the skarmer the skarmer need no one to teach them treachery ternat said butmore humans i dont like the thought any better than you eldest but pulling in my eyestalks wont make it go away solook to the sky ternat let the air sigh out through his breathing pores the sky clanfather he sounded as happy as reatur felt the two males bored in on fralk each of them carded two spears and two light spears as did he each watched him with three eyestalks and used a fourth to see what the other was doing the smooth way they moved together told of how often they had done this beforeto them fralk was just another victim to be dispatched he sprang at one of the males hoping to put him out of action and make the fight even but though he shifted his own spears to the hands near the male he had chosen that warrior blocked his blows with almost bored ease and fralk who needed a shield of his own to protect himself against that males counterthrusts had but a single shield to withstand the onslaught of the fellows comrade that sort of fight could not last long fralk knew a brief moment of triumph when he managed to deflect a couple of thrusts from the second male but all too soon one got home fralk let out a highpitched squeal of pain eldest of eldest you are as dead as a strip of sundried massi meat declared the drill leader a skinny cynical male named juksal or you would be if we were fighting with spears with real points and the rest of you he called to the crowd of males watching the fight what does this teach you not to get caught between two males his audience chorused juksal feigned deafness did i hear some runnerpests chirping i asked what does this teach you not to get caught between two males this time it was a shout all right juksal said grudgingly you budlings know what to say anyhow do you know what to do so that wont happen form circle the males shouted fralk yelled with the rest but all the while was thinking that what he really wanted to do was kill the accursed drill leader any other time any other place juksal would have widened himself the instant he saw fralk and stayed widened till the younger male was gone not fralk added to himself that juksal frequented places where he would be likely to see him but here on this practice field because he had managed to live through a few brawls juksal had clanfathers authority over the group of males in which fralk found himself he used it too and seemed to take special delight in making fralk the object of his lessons fralk ached after every one of them he knew he had to learn to fight as the male in charge of the boats he would be going across in one of the very first ones he did not think the omalo on the other side of the gorge would greet him with hoots of delight he even realized that being singled out this way by juksal might earn him his comrades sympathy and make them more inclined to protect him than if they thought of him as a pampered noble maybe juksal thought he was doing him a favor maybe in fact juksal was doing him a favor that did not make him hurt any less or like the drill leader any more all right juksal suddenly screamed youve just spotted eighteen eighteens of omalo all running toward you dont justtalk about your stinking circlemake it or youre dead males now now now predictably a good deal of waste motion and rushing to and fro followed the band of males got into their double ring a lot faster than they had the first time they tried it though then juksal had been screaming that they should have brought along a tray of relishes so the omalo would have something to eat them with now all he did was turn yellow since he seemed to be yellow about half the time fralk doubted he was very angry all right the drill leader swept out an arm theyre that way and there arent as many of them as you thought at first matter of fact theres more of you go poke holes in em a few of fralks companions were veterans of border clashes with other skarmer clansthe two who had set on him were of that sort more like he had never seen action they shook themselves out into a crescentshaped skirmish line and rushed in the direction juksal had shown yell curse it the drill leader shouted at his warriors make em want to void right where theyre standing fralk yelled as loud as he could feeling foolish all the while soldiers were necessary things for a clan to have but as eldest of eldest he had never expected to be one himself but then he had never expected hogram to conceive of planting a new skarmer subclan east of ervis gorge every time he was tempted to imagine himself wilier than the clanfather he broke a mental fingerclaw on the hard ice of that fact the great gorges had been barriers between great clans as long as there had been great clans thinking of one as anything else required a leap of imagination beside which fralks own schemes were as so many tiny runnerpest budlings come back the lot of you juksal called breaking into the younger males musings the band reversed itself all right enough for the day fling your spears at the targets and then knock off as if suddenly remembering to be harsh the drill leader added try to scare em if you cant hit em neither of fralks casts hit the leaf stuffed massihide target neither missed by much though he consoled himself with the thought that if the target had been a male caught in a volley maybe he would have dodged someone elses spear and been brought down by one of these he was also glad none of the humans had been watching they did watch the skarmer males drill fairly often the sound of their picturemakers clicking away had become a familiar part of the exercises at first fralk thought they were filled with awe at the might and savagery of the skarmer forces most of the males still thought that juksal certainly did whenever a human came around he urged his warriors to show the strange creatures how fierce they were but fralk unlike his fellows had learned to read expressions on the humans strange boringly colored features when the corners of their odd mouths curved up they were amused fralk did not know why the skarmer drills amused them but he was sure they did well he thought still feeling the ache under one arm hed like to see how a human would fare attacked by four spears at once attack a human on the side where he had no eyes and he was yourshe wouldnt even know he was in trouble until he was dead fralk stopped a couple of human concepts he had been having trouble with suddenly made sense right and left had given him no problems they were just opposites of one another what he thought of as three arms apart but behind behind was the direction where humans had no eyes the hidden direction made as they were poor strange creatures no wonder they needed a special word for it behind it even had a weird kind of logic to it or at least economy which to fralks mercantile mind was about the same thing like those of any reasonable language skarmer prepositions classified objects through their relative distance outward from oneself sometimes that led to clumsy ways of thinking and of speaking juksal for instance was closer to fralk than the male named ising but farther from fralk than the one called kattom how much easier to sayand to thinkthat juksal was behind kattom and how much easier to wish the miserable drill leader were behind ising and behind a good many more males as well so he could neither see nor bother fralk anymore fralk knew what wishes were worth if wishes were all that mattered every starving tenant farmer would become a clanfather overnight most times fralk knew that too well to need to remind himself of it but wishing juksal would disappear was too pleasant a thought to slap down fralks eyestalks quivered with guilty pleasure as he walked back toward hograms town iv reatur had left a piece of hide with some writing on it in the mates quarters it had been there a few days most of the mates paid no attention to it a couple scribbled on the blank parts then lamra rescued it she could not read not really but she did know that the written signs had sounds that went with them and knew what some of those were if you made one sound and then the next one right after it why youd just said ice that was what those two signs had to mean ice lamra was so excited at her discovery that she stared at the hide with all six eyes at once paying no attention to anything going on around her she might have heard the door to the mates chambers opening but if she did she ignored that too she was taken by surprise then when reatur asked from right beside her what do you have there three eyestalks jerked up from the hide not only was reatur standing there but sarah the human as well how had they managed to sneak up on her well no matter she was glad they were here reatur especially look lamra said pointing to the signs she knew this means ice doesnt it none of the mates cared about anything like that reatur bent an eyestalk down to see what she was talking about why yes it does he said slowly how did you know that he kept one eyestalk on the word she had figured out and moved another around so he could see what was going on the remaining four peered straight at lamra if you say the sounds of these two signs together they make the word she explained reatur did not answer he just kept looking at her with those four intent eyestalks she began to worry am i in trouble she asked she had never heard of mates knowing what writing meant maybe they werent supposed to after a long pause that made lamra worry even more reatur said no youre not in trouble she watched herself go from alarmed blue to the green of relief and happiness what sarah asked the talk had passed her by i know what these two signs say lamra told the human proudly showing which ones with a fingerclaw she pronounced them separately then together ice do you understand yes understand sarah said she beat her two hands together again and again the noise startled lamra who pulled her eyestalks in halfway no no sarah said quickly with humans noise means good for you humans were very strange lamra thought not for the first time trust them to scare someone when all they meant was good for you the mate let her eyestalks come out again though she watched sarah turn her head so her eyes pointed at reatur you see the human said if a person had been talking lamra would have thought that was triumph in her voice maybe it was reaturs grunt lay between annoyance and resignation i told you once already did i not he said sharply the human bent her head downa person would have widened himself instead you see about what reatur lamra asked about you the domain master said seeing that lamra did not follow him he went on the human will try to see that you dont die when your time comes to bud oh lamra said and then louder oh she still did not know what to think about that and was surprised that reatur would even let sarah try are you sure she asked him no he said i dont know if i should be doing this at all i dont know if sarah can keep you alive but i do know i dont want you to die if it turns out you dont have to good if not the sorrow of the mates if reatur thought things might turn out all right lamra was willing to accept that the same curiosity that had helped her begin to figure out written signs made her turn a couple of eyestalks on sarah and ask how will you go about keeping my blood inside me it comes out very quickly she had never watched a budding reatur didnt let mates do that but once or twice she had seen the chamber afterward before it was cleaned and she had picked up ideas from overheard snatches of talk she more or less knew what happened in there sarah turned her head back to lamra not know try to find out then the humans head swung toward reatur again mate knows good questions to ask yes that she does the domain master said she always has ever since she learned what words are for its one of the reasons i would like to see her stay alive i wish the two of you wouldnt talk about me like that as if i werent there lamra said indignantly reatur and the human both stood quite still for a moment then sarah started making the odd noise humans used instead of honest eyestalkwriggling laughter while reatur widened himself as if he were a mate and lamra the domain master i humbly crave your pardon clanfah clanmother he said dont you make jokes at me now lamra really was angry angry enough to turn yellow reaturs voice changed im sorry little one i didnt mean to tease well all right of their own accord lamras eyestalks started to twitch imagine her telling off the domain master better yet imagine her getting away with it she remembered that sarah had not answered her question she asked it a new way if you dont know how to keep me from ending yet how will you find out good question again sarah said lamra felt herself yellowing up once moreshe wanted an answer that was an answer not just words that sounded nice but didnt tell her anything finally she got one try with animals budding the human said see if animal mates live after what i do if yes i do with you if no i do new thing with another animal mate see if live after that lamra thought it over that sounds like it might work she admitted what if none of the animal mates lives though sarah opened her mouth then closed it again without saying anything then you wont either lamra reatur said thats what i thought thats whats supposed to happen though so i dont need to worry about it do i of course not he answered at once ill do all the worrying thats one of the things a domain master is supposed to do i worry so other people dont have to all right lamra said relieved im not much good at worryingyou need to think about one thing for a long time to do it right and i have trouble with that there are so many interesting things to think about that sticking to just one is hard all mates like this sarah asked reatur again as though lamra were somewhere else no was all he answered then i see why you want this one to save yes reatur said the way they talked made lamra feel foolish she was just herself and could not imagine being any different from what she was her only perception that she was in any way remarkable was that she found other mates boring some of the time and since they often did not seem to know what to make of her either that worked both ways sarah if you do find out how to keep me from ending when my buds drop will it be something only humans can do or will reatur be able to do the same thing with other mates later on other mates reatur exclaimed i hadnt even begun to think about that he started to turn blue which startled lamrawhat had frightened him until he went on if all our mates and all their budlings and all their mate budlings lived to grow up how would we feed them all this domain just raises enough for the folk it has now he and lamra both turned anxious extra eyestalks toward sarah all the humanthe human mate lamra reminded herself somehow humans dealt with the problem that worried the domain mastersaid though was not know fair enough reatur said worry about one thing at a time if lamra lives after budding then we will see what to do next yes sarah said good sense lamra had not thought so far ahead when she asked her question but she recognized the trouble once reatur showed her it was there if this harms the domain clanfather you dont have to let sarah do it the sacrifice seemed small to her she had been going to end when her buds dropped and the time that might come after still did not feel as though it belonged to her sarah started to say something then stopped with her mouth half open as was fitting she looked toward reaturthe choice was his i dont suppose one fullgrown mate will eat up all the spare food in the domain he said go on sarah i said yes before and i say yes again no matter what happens later lamra is worth it lamra widened herself to the domain master she had done that countless times before but only because she had been taught to for the first time it was the gesture of conscious respect and gratitude it was meant to benow she understood why she did it sarah bent from the middle toward lamrathe human gesture that meant the same as widening i try hard to save you she said thank you still strongly feeling the ceremony inherent in the gesture lamra widened herself in return sarah bent again they could have gone on saluting each other for some time but reatur chose that moment to leave and sarah walked away with him the mates chambers were always boisterous with mates chasing one another and yelling at one another all through the day to lamra the place seemed empty without reatur and sarah she did not feel like playing with her friends even if she had the growing buds were starting to make her too slow to keep up another mate came up to her peri was left out of games a lot too as she was also growing buds what did the domain master and thethe funny thing want with you she asked awe in her voice why did reatur keep spending time with a mere mate especially one with whom he had already mated reatur and the human lamra said flaunting her superior knowledge are working on ways to keep mates alive after budding youre teasing me peri said shrilly nobody can do that im not either they are so dont be silly peri said you cant fool me lamra not this time who ever heard of an old mate something moved down in the bottom of jotun canyon the motion was tiny but anything visible at all from down there had to be goodsized shota rustaveli swung up binoculars for a closer look having the depths of the canyon suddenly seem to jump seven times closer always unnerved him it was as if he were flinging himself down into the abyss what is it asked yuri voroshilov who did not have field glasses with him yuri ivanovich i dont know rustaveli could feel his forehead crinkle in a puzzled frown i cant figure it out maybe it was just the sun flashing off water down there bozhemoi voroshilov said softly rustaveli did not follow him for a moment then the biologist echoed that my god himself yesterday the bottom of the canyon had been dry if it had water in it today it would have more tomorrow and as for the day after that forty days and forty nights and then some he said da voroshilov laughed softly strange is it not how after three generations of a godless society we still have the biblical images in the back of our minds ready to call up when we need them ask the devils mother why thats so rustaveli suggested they both laughed then such impudence if oleg lopatin had said that rustaveli would have bridled voroshilov only sounded amused then sighing the chemist grew more serious the flood is upon us shota mikheilovich in more ways than one eh whats that rustavelis mind was elsewhere he wanted to get down to the water there might bethere likely wereplants and animals down in the canyon that stayed dormant until the yearly floods came and then burst into feverish activity plenty of earthly creatures did things like that but who could guess what variations on the theme minerva might offer no one could guessthat was why they were here to find out but voroshilov was thinking along very different lines we will have trouble for one thing if lopatin does not leave katerina alone i know because i will cause it that got rustavelis attention his head snapped toward voroshilov the chemist was such a quiet fellow that he even announced insurrection as if it were no more important than a glass of tea he meant what he said though the georgian could see that slowly my friend slowly rustaveli urged wondering howor whetherto head off voroshilov he had no use for lopatin but still the chekist is also a man yuri ivanovich he said carefully i suppose he has the right to try his luck with her this i know voroshilov said heavily to approach her is one thing but he has hit her shota mikheilovich i have seen the marks that is something else again that i will not stand even if he has made her too afraid to speak up for herself rustaveli scowled unfortunately that sounded all too much like lopatin and katerina had been down to tsiolkovsky lately she and voroshilov had just come back to the environs of hograms town the chemist probably knew whereof he spoke what will you do rustaveli asked give him a taste of his own when he rotates up here next week i was hoping you would join meon the left of course a blackmarket beating eh though not a native russian speaker rustaveli understood the slang expression everyone who lived in the soviet union dealt on the left some more often some less had the georgian caught lopatin cuffing katerina around he was sure he would cheerfully have pummeled him doing it in cold blood planning it well in advance was not the same thing lopatin is a pig da but should we not see first if tolmasov can bring him to heel a pig and a snake both voroshilov growled not only does he abuse katya he paws through my cabin and types my poems into his computer file for evidence evidence of what i do not knowperhaps only that no matter how i try i am no akhmatova or yevtushenko the chemists broad fair face darkened with anger his gloved hands folded into fists had lopatin been there at that moment he would have had a bad time of it rustaveli knew that the chekist snooped anything he wanted to keep to himself he wrote in georgianlet lopatin make what he could of that but then snooping was part of lopatins job let us talk to tolmasov rustaveli repeated voroshilov gave him a sour look you southerners are supposed to be men of spirit so much for folk legends you russians are supposed to be steady and unflappable rustaveli retorted he did not add and boring as he might have if we go home we will be heroes so nothing may happen to us but what of our families i for one do not care to have the kgb know i assaulted one of theirs or do you think we could disguise ourselves as minervan hooligans he had hoped to make the chemist laugh but voroshilov was still scowling they walked on a while in silence finally voroshilov grunted very well we will speak with tolmasov once as always rustaveli rejoiced at the warmth inside the tent as always his valenki squelched on mud keeping the tent heated to a temperature humans found bearable meant that the frozen ground underfoot thawed out by luck tolmasov was there and katerina was not the colonel glanced up from the report he was writing he set aside his pen at once why the long faces comrades he asked rustaveli nodded to himself he might have known tolmasov would notice something was wrong voroshilov did the talking he was more fluent than rustaveli expected more fluent in fact than the georgian had ever heard himjust as he had been all day come to that anger lent him words he could not normally command tolmasov held his face impassive as he listened finally he said i have seen the mark you mean i think the bruise that runs close by her left breast and along her ribs de sergei konstantinovich that is the one voroshilov nodded katerina said it came from a fall tolmasovs features clouded if that is not so yes what then rustaveli deliberately made his tone mocking what do you dare to do to a man with such ah influence the only way he saw to make tolmasov take real action was to suggest he could not i command here not lopatin the pilots words might have been graven in stone rustaveli made sure he did not smile i shall inquire further of dr zakharova and shall take whatever action i find appropriate the colonel went on thank you for bringing this matter to my attention he turned his eyes back to the report in its way a dismissal as formal as were his last couple of sentences spoken for the record he will do nothing voroshilov predicted as soon as they were far enough from the tent to speak without tolmasovs hearing rustaveli shook his head tolmasov disdains to use his strength against the weak but i should not care to be in his way after having done so myself he rubbed his gloved hands in anticipation of lopatins comeuppance but the comeuppance did not come rustaveli waited for tolmasov to travel down to tsiolkovsky for lopatin to be peremptorily summoned to the tent for orders or warnings to come from earth nothing happened day followed day busily yes but otherwise routinely voroshilov waited too with growing unhappiness he was always quiet now he turned downright taciturndangerously so if rustaveli was any judge he tried to draw out the chemist and failed voroshilov answered only in grunts those were more than he gave either tolmasov or katerina but they were not enough fearing a brewing explosion under that silent mask rustaveli finally did what he had told himself not to he talked with katerina about the trouble yuri worries about you he said as they walked through the marketplace of hograms town why she asked i am a grown woman shota mikheilovich and quite able to care for myself that gave the georgian the opening he had hoped for can you he countered quietly what of your ribs she stopped so suddenly that a minervan behind her had to swerve to keep from running into her the male angrily waved arms and eyestalks as he went past katerina paid no attention not you too she said sergei was after me about that last week theyre almost healedwhy make a fuss now because i worry about you too katya her eyes challenging a moment before softened sweet of you shota but truly no need im hardly even sore anymore a bruise is a bruise rustaveli shrugged where it comes from is something else again sergei went on the same way katerina tossed her head it came from my own clumsiness nowhere elsei tripped over my own feet and fell against the edge of a lab table lucky i didnt break a rib if she was dissembling rustaveli thought she had talent to go on stage i begin to think i have made a fool of myself he said slowly he grinned not for the first time i fear he did not win an answering smile from katerina will you please talk sense she snapped did you think we would go through the whole mission without accidents even if you did hasnt valerys arm taught you better without accidents of course not without other things what other things she was starting to sound angry tolmasov rustaveli realized must have been so circumspect that katerina had no idea what he was driving at that made sense in case voroshilovs accusation happened to be wrong rustaveli had not thought it was it fit too well with what he knewwell what he thought he knewof lopatin the georgian sighed he wished he had been more discreet himself actually he wished he had kept his mouth shut but since he hadnt he had to ask it straight out then the chekist truly did not hit you her eyes widenedsuddenly he saw all the roundabout questions fit together oleg no he is her grimace made her lack of enthusiasm plain but she went on in his own way he has discipline too shota mikheilovich what he might like to do i would sooner not think but he values the mission and holds himself in one can tell such things she spoke calmly dispassionately then grew more urgent i value the mission too i want no trouble rising over me do you understand shota da rustaveli said a little regretfully but youd better let yuri know he is not thinking kindly thoughts of oleg borisovich lopatin yuri he is so quiet one never knows what he thinks if he were to let loose of his temperand isnt lopatin due up here tonight yuri she said again in an entirely different tone of voice bozhemoi she turned and ran in the direction of the tent as if she had forgotten rustaveli was beside her and so he thought as he watched her sidestep minervans she likely had he supposed he should have felt virtuous having saved the mission from what might well have been serious trouble he did not feel virtuous he was thinking of his grandfather instead the old bandit was dead now but he would have boxed rustavelis ears if he ever found out his grandson had saved a kgb man a beating the georgian laughed and swatted himself lightly on the earflaps of his cap penance paid he followed katerina back toward the tent the noise was so loud it did not let frank marquard think a few days before he had looked down into jotun canyon observed the flood taken some pictures and gone back to athena conscious of nothing more than a job well done now he was a half a mile from the edge of the canyon but the roar and boom coming up out of it were enough to stun and the flood was just beginning he lifted the flaps of his cap and stuck in earplugs they helped but only somewhat as at a rock concert he still felt the noise through his feet through his skin and through his soft palate when he opened his mouth to breathe and with the earplugs in place he could not talk to enoph he took them out and tried to yell above drumroll and thunder how you stand noise the minervan spoke through the din rather than over it not raising his voice but talking more slowly so each word came out distinctly it happens every year he said we can get used to it or we can go mad getting used to it is easier i suppose so frank tried speaking as enoph had and found to his surprise that it worked he had heard stories of men talking in normal tones under factory racket but had never believed them now he did the vibration of the ground grew more severe as he got closer and closer to the edge of the canyon until it was like walking during a moderate earthquake being a los angeles native frank had done that more times than he cared to remember here though the shaking went on and on he consoled himself by thinking that anything that could have shaken loose would have done so millions of years before that reassured the rational part of him the rest still wanted to find a doorway to stand in he crawled the last few feet to the edge of the canyon not wanting to be pitched over it if a slab of ice or a boulder happened to smash into the side especially hard as he looked down though awe cast away fear the mist above the waters was thick and sparkling like a sundappled fogbank viewed from above that was exactly what it was frank realized it would have concealed a great deal on earth but it could not hide the minervan floods water thundered roared bellowed cast itself upward off obstacles or off itself and flung iceberg fragments and great stones into the air with mindless abandon frank squeezed off several pictures knowing none of them could convey the sheer scale of what he was seeing it was like watching gray whales mate in deep water he had done that once off the california coast he stuck an infrared filter on his lens after that the color values on his shots went south but they did a better job of piercing the mist to show the watery fury that rampaged beneath it grows steadier later in the season enoph said more of the gorge is filled and a more regular flow replaces this first rush of water marquard nodded that was as computer models had predicted the models had even warned of the mist above the water what they had not done could not do was prepare him for the wonder the spectacle brought flood ever rise to top of canyon spill out he asked the computer had said that might happen if everything went exactly rightexactly wrong he supposed from the minervans point of view v enoph turned blue with fear at the very idea you humans have terrible thoughts what would be left of a domain not much frank thought not when the main local building stone was ice for enophs sake he was glad the simulation had been on the extravagant side the geologist took two more pictures which finished off the roll he decided against reloading better to wait a couple of days and come back that would tell him something about how fast the water was rising in the canyon he walked back toward athena he wanted to feed the roll into the developer now so that he could see how it came out when he got back to the ship he found one roll processing and another in the ln bin with a postit note from sarah attached bump yours ahead of this and you die knowing sarah she meant it frank sighed and stuck his film behind the other waiting roll he heard his wifes voice from the front cabin no one else seemed to be aboard even emmett and louise who hardly ever went away were off doing something or other with reatur he had seen them by the castle frank grinned to himself such chances were not to be wasted he walked forward whistling to let pat know he was coming she turned around in her seat waved so he could tell she saw him then went back to speaking russian i had hoped the creature lived on your side of the canyon too shota mikheilovich or had relatives there but if not not athena out rustaveli also signed off with a discontented grunt pat complained to her husband he doesnt have any idea about whats related to what hes just thinking in terms of this species or that not genera or families or orders hell end up hauling all his data home so the bigwigs in moscow can try to make sense of it whyd he bother to come he doesnt have the computers we do frank answered he scratched his head trying to remember what she had toldhim a couple of days before succeeding made him smile if hed found that little burrowing thing hed never have guessed it was related to the one the minervans call a runnerpest they dont look anything alike pat smiled too oh you were listening after all youre right that burrower is so adapted to underground life that without computer extrapolation of what its ancestors used to look like thered be no telling which order it belonged to mmhmm frank paused a moment quiet in here it is isnt it pats gaze swung back to him is that a hint more than a hint you might say call it an invitation something passed over pats face and was gone before frank was sure he had seen it then her eyes went to the floppy she had been using while she talked with her russian opposite number finally though she shrugged and said why not not the most enthusiastic response in the world frank thought but it would do he slipped his arm around her waist as she got up they walked back to their cubicle afterward he leaned up on his elbow in the narrow bottom bunk pat lay beside him not moving not talking looking up at the foam rubber mattress pad over their heads all right he asked more hesitantly than he had expected i guess im just tired she said shrugging again bare as she was that should have been enchanting somehow it was not shell said that more than once lately times when shed been less responsive than he had hoped and she still did not look at him he thought for a while over the years he had grown used to pleasing pat and pleasing himself thereby he took things as he found them but this failure was something he would sooner not find again anything i can do to help he said hesitantly now her eyes turned his way this is the first time youve offered that she said curiosity mingled withaccusation in her voice didnt think i needed to before hmm she was studying him as dispassionately as if he were one of her specimens well maybe her tone was judicious too is that well maybe i didnt think so or well maybe i can he pantomimed the confusion he was feeling she laughed now the jiggles that produced excited frank he could not have said why unless it was relief at no longer being studied like a runnerpest well maybeshe paused wickedlya little of both her hand took his and guided it better he asked some time later she bit him on the arm it wasnt the answer he had looked for but he did not complain fralk and hogram let thunder wash over them as they watched the flood a boulder the size of hograms castle slammed into the side of ervis gorge the ground quivered like the skin of a massi with an itch you propose to send our boat through that the domain master demanded stabbing a fingerclaw at the chaos far below invading the omalo lands wasnt my idea fralk wanted to say he had too much sense to yield to temptation hogram appreciated frankness but he did not appreciate males showing how clever they were at his expense the flood is still new clanfather the younger male said carefully and is sweeping along the debris that has accumulated in the gorge since last summer it will grow calmer it had better hogram snapped he turned an eyestalk from the flood to fralk how would that runnerpest in the toy boat you showed me have fared if you dropped half my roof on it eh thats what the trash in the water will be doing to the boats trying to go across isnt it i suppose there may be a few accidents accidents hogram echoed is that all you can say accidents can you be sure any of these boatsthe way he stressed the word emphasized that it was foreignwill get across ervis gorge at all or will the folk far north of here picking corpses from the gorge after the flood subsides be surprised at how many foolish males got themselves killed in the water anger burst inside fralk clanfather are you pulling in your eyestalks if so tell me plainly so i can free the males who are building boats for more productive duty i also suggest that you release your males from weapons training if you do not intend to use us as warriors after being so blunt fralk wondered whether hogram would turn all eyestalks toward or away from him how many males he thought could claim total rejection by their own domain master and his omalo counterpart it was not a distinction fralk craved but hogram with the perspective age brings was not infuriated by the younger males presumption if he was amused he was too canny to let his eyestalks show it we must press on he said think of the profit wasted if we let that labor go for naught but i still turn blue whenever i think of trusting myself to one of the contraptions those males are building you wont be in one of them fralk thought but that was not something even he dared say aloud instead he answered clanfather we will succeed the skarmer will be the only great clan to straddle a flood gorge one day our domains will fill the eastern lands hograms eyestalks quivered now may you prove right that day however is not one i will live to see nor you either worry about planting our first bud not the ones that may spring from it as you say clanfather no denying that hogram made sense but fralks ambition ran further than he would admit to anyone especially to the domain master whose position only made his already suspicious nature more so if fralk established a new domain on the far side of ervis gorge and if his descendants kept pushing back the omalo and setting up new domains of their own might they not eventually prefer to style themselves after their first domain master great clan fralk the young male had repeated that to himself often enough when he was sure no other male could hear he liked the sound of it hello athena houston here irv levitt thumbed on the recorder the mission controller back home would not pause for acknowledgment not with backandforth transmission time near twenty minutes irv was about to go on about his business most of what houston had to say was emmett braggs problem not hiswhen the controller as if reading his mind continued we have some new instructions for you irv his voice came in scratchy across the millions of miles but was perfectly understandable now that the mission controllerhis name was jesse dozier was talking to him irv said me whats up just as if the man could hear him catching himself the anthropologist laughed at his own foolishness he had only talked over a sentence or so and that not directly relevant to him or so he thought continued excellent response to the assistance you folks gave the soviets both here and in the states and from around the world dozier was saying interest in the minerva mission hasnt been so highor so favorablesince just after athena touched down the polls are running strongly for continued contact and exploration polls irv felt his mouth twist he half wished polling had never been invented these days no politicians dared moved half an inch past what their polls told them they followed so closely that most of them had forgotten how to lead again doziers words ran parallel to his thoughts were preparing to have the new appropriation submitted while things look so good and to help nail it down we it like to be able to show congress another major success thats where you come in irv levitt blinked me dozier of course took no notice irv shut up and listened from the data you folks and tsiolkovsky have sent back it seems likely that the two groups in whose lands you find yourselves will soon be at war we want you to arrange a radio hookup with the soviets so that the leader on your side of jotun canyon can confer with the ruler on the western side think what a feather in your caps it will be if you can mediate a dispute between rival factions of an alien species louisethe mission controller changed the subjectwe have some new subroutines to speed up your number crunching first dozier you are stoned out of your gourd irv said now he didnt care if he missed some of the feed from houston he wished he hadnt heard any of what dozier had just finished saying what did they think back home that reatur and the domain master across the canyon were a couple of third world dictators to be brought into line by threatening to cut off their weapons shipments sounds like it emmett bragg said when irv throwing his hands in the air for extra emphasis shouted that question at him but we dont have anything like that kind of leverage on them irv said still loudly tolmasov had it rightthey were going to fight whether we were here or not the other fellows want to cross reatur doesnt want to let them wheres the room for discussion good question bragg laughed two syllables of a humorless laugh maybe if were real lucky the russians wont cooperate thatd get us off the hook maybe irv was as skeptical of that as emmett sounded the russians spent even more time beating their breasts about how peace loving they were than the united states did they would have to linkhogram irv wasnt sure he remembered the western chieftains nameup with reatur assuming reatur was willing to talk do you suppose houston would let me beg off if i told them the domain master would feed me to the crows for bringing up the idea at all you could try i suppose but i dont think itll fly trouble is houston already knows reaturs got an open mind because if he didnt hed never have gone along with your wifes trying to save that female if hes game for that chances are hed be willing to talk peace too you have this disgusting habit of being right irv sighed of course just because hell talk doesnt mean hell agree to anything i wouldnt in his shoes neither would i not that he wears shoes and somehow i dont think the art of negotiations come as far here as it has back home which is to say that reaturs more likely to call the westerner every name in the book than talk turkey with him bragg grinned crookedly which is what you said a while ago you know it i know it the russians here know it im sure the minervans know it too what do you think the odds are of convincing houston slim irv slim after all they have the experts there just ask em thanks a lot valery aleksandrovich do you seriously believe hogram will make peace with the clans east of jotun canyon oleg lopatin demanded he has been preparing for war since we landed and for some time before that you are right oleg borisovich valery bryusov agreed the linguist did not like admitting lopatin was right about anything he consoled himself by mentally sneering at the way the kgb man pronounced hograms name he said it as if it started with a g as most russians did with foreign words that began with the sound of rough breathing still bryusov went on we must make the effort moscow would not be pleased if we let the americans brand us as warmongers no lopatin growled dragging out the word as if it pained him but moscow will not be pleased if we forfeit the position of trust we have earned here either and asking hogram to do something he manifestly does not wish to do may well bring that fate down on our heads you are right bryusov said again this second admission hurt twice as much as the first one had bryusov scratched at his arm his fingers clicked on the plaster of his cast he knew it was there but reflex made him scratch every so often anyhow both longunwashed skin and healing bone itched ferociously now i wish i were up at the tent by hograms town instead of here on tsiolkovsky lopatin grumbled we must tread carefully subtly colonel tolmasov will do well bryusov slightly stressed the pilots rank to remind the chekist who was in charge all lopatin knew of subtlety the linguist thought was how to knock on a door at midnight sergei will make hogram understand that the request to confer with the eastern chieftain comes from our own domain masters he continued and as dutiful males we have no choice but to convey it to him i suppose so lopatin said in a tone that supposed anything but negotiations have their uses like any other tool but once these failand fail they will quite without help from uswe must be prepared to extend our full support to hogram and his males bryusov frowned wondering if he had heard the kgb man correctly he saw he had coughing he reminded lopatin oleg borisovich these are capitalists about whom you speak in such glowing terms alien capitalists da but capitalists even so had it been the end of the sixteenth century rather than the end of the twentieth he would have been accusing lopatin of devilworship but the chekist was no mean marxistleninist theologian himself there is nothing wrong with capitalism as it emerges valery aleksandrovich only when in its decadence it stands in the way of the arrival of true socialism as it does on earth here on minerva capitalism is the progressive ideology and economic structure to the east of the canyon the domains are feudal in organization is it not so bozhemoi bryusov was not used to eyeing the kgb man with respect carefully veiled contempt was what he usually felt for him but he had to confess that is a very pretty argument oleg borisovich yes i know lopatin said complacently a clever chekist is still a chekist bryusov reminded himself interesting also i think lopatin went on how here as well as on earth the americans find themselves aligned with the forces of reaction while we stand with those of progress most interesting the linguist agreed the more he thought through the implications of what lopatin had said the less he liked them he held up his healing arm dont forget how the americans helped ushelped meat great risk to themselves here on minerva if nowhere else we truly have a classless society of humans of humans perhaps lopatin said as if making a great concession but not of intelligent beings and what we do here will also be closely observed by peoples movements all over the world back home and by the americans and their friends now bryusov was genuinely alarmed bringing quarrels from earth to minerva was bad enough but letting a minervan quarrel create trouble on earth struck him as worse moscow will instruct us as to our proper course lopatin said he sounded as if he were trying to reassure the linguist but bryusov remained unassured the apparatchiks back home were as rigid as lopatin i would sooner let us make our decisions on the spot bryusov said surely we have a better feel for the minervans than do men who have never seen one even the americans with their prattling of liberty are not so foolish as that lopatin said when houston gives an order as it did about these talksthe crew of athena simply obeys oleg borisovich this is the first time i have ever heard you argue that we can do no better than imitating the americans bryusov answered mildly he cherished the glower the chekist gave him reatur glowered at the box irv held in one of his large strange hands the domain master had come to accept and eventually to ignore such boxes in humans hands even when the voices of other humans came out of them he had never imagined a persons voice might also travel in such fashionespecially not if the person was a skarmer he wont be able to see as well as hear will he reatur asked for the third time no irv answered you see into skarmer lands no reatur admitted unhappily let me listen to his lies then and have done so i can go on working to keep my domain safe from his greed when humans sighed the domain master thought they sounded eerily like people irv pressed the box here and there and then spoke into it a rumbling voicea human males voicereplied at once it belonged to neither emmett nor frank reatur recognized the way they sounded so there truly were more humans than he had seen despite everything the weird creatures had said he had wondered irv brought him out of his eyestalktwiddling by handing him the box talk into it the human said hogram hears you reatur underhanded in trade talk how should i know hogram used the same clipped simplified speech he sounded old reatur thought the omalo domain master had known that it had to be so if hograms eldest of eldest was a male who could be entrusted with responsibility but heating hograms voice made the knowledge real in a way it had not been before why are you talking to me then reatur said because thehogram used a word reatur did not knowasked me to the who the two legged two armed creatures who make strange things like the box we are using to talk now thats what they call themselves in their own language oh the ones here call themselves humans and so we use that name for them too call them whatever you like they are strange enough and strong enough that i do not care to tell them no without some truly pressing reasonnor do you i notice never mind what i do reatur snapped the humans here say that if we talk perhaps we can find a way not to fight stay on your side of ervis gorge and you will prove them right if i could i would but we have too many males too many mates for our land to feed if you peaceably yield your domain perhaps we can work out a fate for your males less drastic than the one fralk first proposed to you some of your budlings might be allowed to live on to plant buds themselves and to work with us toward building a new land what do you mean work with you reatur did not trust the sound of that smoothsounding phrase as what you know that many of us are traders rather than farmers or herders hogram said we could i suppose use some males whose talents lie in those directions rage tipped through reatur use them as slaves you mean without even right of appeal to clanfather for theyd not be of the same clan as your precious young fralk now would they you skarmer arent traders hogram youre cheats and thieves he was deliberately insulting trying to infuriate hogram as he had been infuriated the skarmer domain master though seemed armored against insult in your obstinacy omalo you have made me become more generous cherish that not many may boast of it imagine my delight reatur made his voice as hot with scorn as the meltwater that brawled through ervis gorge save such praise for dealings with your fellow skarmer who can properly appreciate it he shortened his eyestalks in surprise as he thought of something new why even think of crossing the gorge hogram why not seize the domains of your neighbors if you need land so badly surely that would be simpler for you i wish you had been budded a fool my life would be easier this time hogram sounded as though he really was giving a compliment not sardonic as he had been before in truth though all the skarmer domains hereabouts find themselves in the same straits as do i too many folk not enough food my domain might be bigger were i to conquer them but no better off that made sense to reatur he almost wished it had not he had not expected to be able to see out of hograms eyestalks thinking of the skarmer domain master as a male with problems of his own was less comfortable than simply thinking of him as the enemy it could be useful though if it gave him clues about how hogram would plot as if changing the subject reatur asked do your humans come in two kinds one with a deep rumbling voice and the other that sounds like a person hogram reatur thought was sharp or at least suspicious the skarmer domain masters voice turned cautious at once as he answered yes they do what of it the reply was innocuous enough but reatur felt like hooting with glee instead as casually as before he asked have they told you that the ones who sound like people are mates and the others males by hograms response he already knew that the humans on the skarmer side of the gorge had not and if hogram suddenly learned something as unsettling as that it might help drive him apart from his humans reatur was convinced that such a rift would prove useful he still wasnt sure what powers humans had but keeping those powers estranged from the skarmer had to be a good idea i know what you are thinking you want to make me fear the hogram used his own word for humans yes he was sharp but who ever heard of an old mate so the skarmer had that cliche too did they i waggle my eyestalks at you and your deception both hogram finished reatur would have thought it funny too had he not known the truth he thought of lamra for a moment but made himself dismiss her from his mind hogram demanded all his attention if you think am lying ask your humans for yourself bluff all you like reatur i will ask them and afterward know you for the liar you are that will be remembered when we cross to the east side of the gorge do you think your boasts make me blue with fright if you are foolish enough to come we will be ready for you butreatur rememberedthe humans asked us to talk so we would not fight not so we would quarrel more with words can we find a way to keep you on your side of the gorge where you belong and to keep our domains at peace there is no way to keep us on this side of the gorge alone hogram declared as for peace i have offered to let males of yours survive if you do not resist us obviously more will live we would not be deliberately harsh you offer less than i and mine have already you know i will not accept as he sparred reatur had been thinking of what he could propose to hogram now he set it forth if we knew you were not planning to invade we might rebuild the bridge across the gorge then in years when we had good crops we could trade our surplus to you rather than to one of our omalo neighbors who was less lucky that would let you support more people on your domain how many more how often do you have that kind of good year if it were more than one year in three i would be surprised and try to buy your secret from you is it no reatur said after thinking over and rejecting a lie melting the truth a little might save him trouble now but would earn more later you bargain strangely omalo but i accept your word well then if in one of those rare good years you do sell us food how much do you suppose we could haul over the bridge enough for a few eighteens of males perhaps but not much more that does not suffice reatur let the air hiss out through his breathing pores which leaves us where we began so it does hogram also sighed for a moment there i had hope but you are right i could wish you sprang from a skarmer bud reatur but that is not so as is since you will not give us what we need we shall take it from you you may try hogram but you will fail if a skarmer wants a thing omalo be assured he will have it and pay less than the former owner would like reatur i want your domain and i tell you will not keep it the day your eyestalks turn away from our direction we will come you lie past that i have nothing more to say to you nor i to you hogram said our actions will speak reatur sighed again for the first time since he and hogram had confronted each other with their voices he paid attention to the human who had made the confrontation possible take your box away irv he said suddenly so weary his arms and eyestalks felt like drooping we are finished the human touched a button the box which had been letting out a quiet hiss became completely silent you hogram make peace irv asked not follow all wordsyou hogram not use same words you me use trade talk has omalo words skarmer words and words from other great clans all mixed together males from different great clans use it when neither speaks the others language reatur explained he was glad to blather on about trade talk while he was doing that he would not have to think about everything hogram had said lingua franca irv muttered then as if noticing that meant nothing to reatur he did some explaining himself humans with words not same do same thing sometimes ah reatur said politely interesting how every once in a while humans acted very much like people but no male of his domain would have been so rude as to ask again as irv did you hogram make peace no reatur said i didnt think we would i told you we wouldnt and yet curse it you kept at me making me waste time i could have spent helping my domain get ready for whatever the miserable skarmer have in their sneaking minds irv spread his hands in the human gesture that meant it wasnt his fault my domain masters tell me what to do i must go in direction they point your males do that for you then irv bent at the middle and stayed bent had he been a person reatur realized he would have been widening himself in apology the domain master gestured for him to resume his usual height irv didyes apology was what he had meant you are rightyou should obey your domain masters reatur conceded although the plural puzzled him this time though they were wrong hogram and i had nothing to say to each other not about peace irv spread his hands once more reatur hardly noticed he was thinking about hogram now like it or not and about how confident the skarmer had sounded if hograms males could not cross ervis gorge he had no business sounding like that but how could they with the yearly flood rising day by day reatur could hear the waters booming and could feel their pounding through his feet he turned his mental eyestalks in all directions but could not see how the skarmer might best the flood but hogram could reatur was sure of that it frightened him vi the female eloc saw sarah coming of course it did she thought in some annoyancewith eyes that looked every which way at once minervan creatures were next to impossible to sneak up on the eloc had seen sarah before it did its best to run away its best was not good enough it was so very gravid that it could scarcely waddle to the far end of its little pen she hurried after it it was right on the point of dropping its buds and she wanted to see what she could do to keep it from bleeding to death immediately afterward the female eloc unfortunately knew nothing about that as far as it was concerned sarah was weird probably a predator and certainly dangerous it made a brief rush at her trying to stick her with one of the horns that projected out from its body below each arm she skipped backward faster than the eloc could come after her the horns were not very long anyhow the minervans who had to herd eloca had sensibly bred them so they were less formidably equipped than their wild relatives its all right sarah crooned as if to a spooked horse back on earth maybe that had some effect maybe the eloc decided that making the little charge satisfied its honor at any rate it stood quiet and let her come up to it though the four eyes it kept turned her way showed that it still did not trust her she crooned some more she needed the beast relaxed it was not much shorter than she and a lot thicker and this was a female an animal sure to die young male eloca were the size of a cow even if they looked more like what would happen if a squid seduced the jolly green giants hockey puck the female flinched from sarahs hand although she wore gloves her flesh was warm enough to disturb the minervan animal she moved slowly and carefully at last the eloc let her stroke and prod the tight stretched skin over one of its buds was that the beginning of a split or was she only feeling what she wished she would she stooped to take a good look sure enough the females skin had begun to crack all right sarah breathed she had been irrationally certain that the eloc would drop its budlings when she was sound asleep or worse when she was just on her way back from athena for another peek at it maybe luck was with her after all as poor biyal had the female eloc grew calm as the budding process advancedalmost sarah thought as if it knew it would soon have nothing more to worry about she hoped to change that all the same she doubted she would succeed not with this first try surely some minervan somewhere would have thought ofwould have triedpacking the cavities from which the budlings dropped to keep the inevitable flood of blood from following but if so reatur was ignorant of it did that mean the effort had earlier been discarded as useless or that minervans could not see what seemed obvious to her before long she would find out the budding proceeded much as biyals had it seemed uneventful all that happened was that the split over each bud steadily grew wider and longer knowing how it would end sarah was not lulled as she had been before she used the time she had before the crisis to prepare for it from her backpack she drew out six gauze pads each stuffed into one of her socks her last couple of pairs would just have to do till she got home she slapped a strip of duct tape onto each sock to hold it in place on the clots hide as she set each makeshift bandage on the ground she shook her head in wry amusement these were not the instruments she was used to working with i never thought id be a vet either she said out loud the eloc steadied at the sound of her voice she suddenly realized that sounding like a male minervan had its advantages the eloc had the habit of obeying voices much like hers she laughed at herself she also was not used to feeling macho she could see the budlings feet now they wiggled and thrashed though the baby eloca were still attached to the female the budlings were the size of terriers sarah hoped they would not get in her way when she tried to work on the female why she wondered did she think of these things too late to do anything about them then such bits of irrelevance vanished from her mind the budlings grew to be entirely visible she could see how they were joined to the females circulatory system by their mouths they dropped off all of them at once sarah never noticed whether they got in her way or not she was too busy with the female as biyal had it simply stood bleeding its life away it did not try to gore her or strike at her when she began slapping her bandage packs over its spurting wounds streams of its cold blood drenched her parka and trousers she ignored that too two bandages were in place now the hemorrhaging from those orifices reduced to a trickle she shoved a third plug into place pressing hard on the duct tape so that it would cling to the elocs skin she grabbed for the fourth bandage about then she noticed how limp the elocs arms and eyestalks had gone she also noticed that the stream of blood from the fourth orifice was less than it had been from the first three even as she watched the flow grew slower still and then stopped the female eloc was dead oh hell sarah said surprised at how disappointed she was she had not expected to succeed with this first try but her hopes had risen when she saw that her bandages seemed to do some good the eloc though lost enough blood through the orifices she had not plugged to kill it before she could get to them two things occurred to her one was the most ancient medical joke around the operation was a success but the patient died the joke was old of course exactly because it was rooted in human fallibility ever since the first medicine man every doctor in the world had seen his best fall short of being good enough her second thought sounded frivolous but wasnt what would the little dutch boy have done if he had had to stick his finger into six holes in the dike at once hedve got help or drowned she answered herself out loud only then did she realize what a mess she was she might have been working in an alien abattoir for the elocs blood dripped from her hands and arms and was splashed over the rest of her clothes the fabrics were all supposed to repel moisture but they hadnt been designed for a workout like this neither had athenas laundry facilities she picked up the socks and gauze packs that were still clean after taking a step away from the female eloc she went back to salvage the three she had used the gauze would never be the same but her goresoaked socks might come clean and even if they didnt she could use them again the next time she tried to save an animal nothing from earth was automatically disposable on minerva the eloca budlings scattered as sarah walked toward the gate of the pen she did not look like any minervan creature that ate eloca but she was bigger than they were and that was plenty to set off the alarms evolution had built into them a couple of budlings got out before she could slam the gate shut a minervan caught one of them after a brief chase and shouted for other males farther away to run down the other while they were pursuing it the first minervan still holding the squawking eloc budling said to sarah you shouldnt have let them get loose like that they might have been lost for good sorry she studied the local one reason she found minervans harder to tell apart than humans was that they did not always keep the same side of their bodies to her still this one both looked and sounded familiar sorry ternat never mind now just remember for next time reaturs eldest sarah thought seemed a good deal like the domain master he turned a couple of eyestalks toward the dead female eloc you didnt have much luck there no not much she admitted reatur wants you to succeed that sounded like an accusation but was ternat condemning her for failure or reatur for hoping for something else she answered carefully this first try here learn some try again maybe learn enough so lamra lives try what if you cannot learn enough before lamras budlings drop then i fail not say to reatur i do only i try make something of it if youre going to she added but only to herself but ternats reply was mild that makes me think you are honest people who give wild promises generally cannot live up to them i suppose it must be the same with you humans he turned an eyestalk toward the newly budded eloc he was holding i will take this one to the herd so it can get used to being among its own kind if i delay too long the foolish thing will grow up thinking it is a person and fall easy prey to wild animals because it will stray too far from the big males who could protect it sarahs gloves left unpleasant smears on the notebook she pulled from a pocket ignoring them she scrawled imprinting tell pat on the first blank page she found humans knew so little about minerva that even casual conversation like this gave important new data ternat was already moving away what you do with dead eloc mate she called after him thank you for reminding me he said without stopping ill make sure someone sees to the butchering it was she reminded herself only a domestic animal she knew the minervans did not treat their own mates so all the same she had a vision of bright funny little lamra hacked apart by stone knives and served up with the local equivalent of brussels sprouts it made her more determined than ever to save the mate sighing she walked back toward athena she wished for a shower even more than she did after a turn in damselfly wishing however kept failing to equip the spacecraft with the requisite plumbing she stripped off her outer clothing just inside the air lock and walked down the hall to the lavatory and mini washerdryer in her long johns minervan body fluids smelled stronger and nastier in athenas heated air than they had outside where the mercury reached an alltimesince the landing anywayhigh of o emmett bragg stuck his head out of his cubicle to see who was going by his eyes flicked to the parka and pants slung on sarahs arm no luck eh he asked adding youre dripping on the floor i know and on my sleeve too one more thing to wash no no luck emmett the damned female bled right on out on me i might as well not have been there how do you plug six holes at once with just two hands three times two is he let the words hang in the air too much manpower to commit she finished for him then she stopped emmett did not say things by accident or is it would you let me train a couple of peopleirv and pat i guess because they know most about the minervansto be ready to try to save lamra all at once itd take a lot of time to practice with me on animals time they may not have because theyll be busy with other things have em make the time can you think of anything more important were doing here for us or the minervans no but i know im not objective about it thanks for seeing things the same way she leaned forward and kissed him on the cheek for a moment the look he gave her made her feel more naked under her long johns than she had during any of the whoknewhowmany times before when hed happened to see her wearing a lot less she also realized she didnt dislike the feeling she rather wished irv looked at her that way more often telling herself it would be purely in the nature of an experiment she thought about kissing emmett again and making a proper job of it this time just then though from behind the privacy curtain louise called come on emmett get back here and help me make sense of this latest weirdness from houston be fight with youhave to make sure the decks get swabbed though he said sarah snapped off a parody of a salute and made a face at him as he disappeared aye aye captain bligh saved by the bell she thought as he went back to the rear of athena she sternly told herself not to wonder whether she had been saved or thwarted as if to put that question to rest she waylaid irv when he got back to the ship all but dragging him to their cubicle she had no complaints once they were there even if irv took her for granted out of bed she liked what he did in it finding that that was still so relieved her more than a little well he said as she slid off him what brought that on what do you mean she asked hoping her guilty start did not show evidently it didnt youve been too busy to be interested almost since we landed irv said and now you go and rape me dont get me wrongi kind of like it ive missed you if you know what i mean mmhmm she said wondering who had been taking whom for granted i do know im sorry its just that were busy all the damned time yeah i know he poked her in the fibs she yelped what was that for for not answering my question oh she tried to keep things light does it really matter where you get your appetite so long as you eat at home when irv didnt answer right away she was afraid she had made things worse instead of better she could not tell what was going on behind his eyes that worried her too back on earth shed never had trouble reading him when had she stopped being able to and why hadnt she noticed then his face took on an expression she recognized mischief he rearranged her on the mattress pad best idea youve had in a while he said of themselves her fingers tightened on the back of his head tolmasov took a skipping half step to stay up with fralk comfortable minervan walking pace was a little faster than what was comfortable for him you building all boats you need he asked da sergei konstantinovich we will have enough fralk answered his russian was better than tolmasovs command of the local language knowing he needed the practice the pilot tried to get his thoughts across in the skarmer tongue anyway you having all males you need to go in boats da fralk said again his threearmed wave encompassed the camp growing outside hograms town he and the human were a couple of kilometers away walking and talking as tolmasov might have with a friend back on earth something made a noise in the bushes off to one side of the path things had been making noises in the bushes all along by now the russian paid no attention to them fralk also had ignored themtill now now he turned blue and started moving away from the bushes that hid whatever was making the noise tolmasov backed off too what is that he asked pointing to the animal he faintly glimpsed through foliage a krong fralk said it was not a word tolmasov had heard before i did not know they came so close to the town anymore the minervan went on with luck it will have just fed and not be interested in eating anything else when the pilot heard that he unslung his kalaslmikov and clicked the change lever down from safe to full automatic whatever a krong was it didnt sound like a household pet the beast emerged from the undergrowth tolmasov was surprised to discover that he recognized it he doubted there could he many kinds of brown and white longlegged bigclawed large predators in the minervan ecology this had to be the same sort of animal as the one that had attacked valery and shota in the rover fralk was getting bluer and bluer tolmasov did not blame him had he been facing this monster unarmed he would have been frightened too even with a rifle in his hands he wished for zoo bars between the krong and him the animal let out a low growling squall almost what the pilot would have expected from an angry leopard the krong did not charge at once though it slowly sidled forward it kept more eyestalks on tolmasov than on fralk minervans it knew he was an unknown quantity its cry rose to a shriek even if tolmasov did not fralk knew what that meant run he shouted here it comes the krongs first bound showed it was faster than a minervan it went straight after fralk either it had decided tolmasov was not dangerous or it hoped to deal with him after it had slain the more familiar prey the bark of the akt rose above the krongs screams as the first bullets slammed into it the animal changed direction with the agility of most minervan beasts it rushed at its new tormentor tolmasov fired in short bursts watched blood and tissue spray from the wounds he made he was wishing for something heavier than a kalashnikovsay an antitank missile when less than five meters from him the krong went down at last fralk had stopped fleeing as soon as he saw the krong was no longer after him now he slowly came back toward tolmasov and the dead beast his eyestalks kept shifting from it to the russian and back again as if he could not choose which was more important to look at he was still bright blue more krongii around tolmasov demanded he was trying to figure out how many rounds were left in his magazine and swearing at himself for not carrying a spare but fralk answered no they hunt alone he spoke his own language he was still too rattled to use russian several of his eyes went toward the krong again you killed it green began to take the place of blue on his skin da tolmasov said shakily he was doing his best not to think about how close the krong had come to making it mutual big game hunting which he had always slighted suddenly looked a lot more like work you killed it fralk repeated now his eyestalks turned toward the pilotor rather tolmasov saw in a moment toward his kalashnikov the minervan said still in his own speech you spoke of this weapon before i am sorry but i have forgotten its name firearm tolmasov supplied automatically rifle to be exact rifle spasebo fralk was pretty much himself again if he could remember to say thank you in russian he went on in that language what we have to give you so you give us rifle you say once firearms more strong than ax hammer now see much more strong what we give to get rifle damnation tolmasov thought so far as he knew none of the russians had ever fired a shot where the locals could hear itshota and valery met their krong away from what passed for civilization here but now fralk knew what bullets could do sure enough he was staring with four eyes at the chewed up carcass by his feet what we give to get rifle he said again fralk i am sorry but i do not think we can sell you a rifle tolmasov said why only want to use rifle on omalo fill omalo full of holes like krong here full of holes tolmasov sighed fralk i told you before that there are other humans on the omalo side of the canyon if you used a rifle to fight the omalo you might also hurt or kill one of these other humans that could bring their domain and ours to war and in our homelands we have weapons much much worse than rifles weve used some of them on each other too he thought and as much by luck as anything else not the worst ones what if other humans give omalo rifles fill us full of holes the minervan asked you leave us so we not fight back the pilot frowned i will find out he promised fralk had asked before whether the americans would give firearms to the minervans east of jotun canyon that had been before he knew what bullets could do though now he was really worried tolmasov still could not imagine emmett bragg being so stupid as to arm the natives with weapons dangerous to humans but he could not overlook the possibility either helping the skarmer would not look good back on earth but neither would standing idly by while they got slaughtered tolmasov felt the wish that came over every commander now and then the wish to be safely back in the ranks again with nothing to worry about and nothing to do but what somebody else told him to do as every commander must he strangled that wish in its cradle he would have had scant time to indulge it in any case for fralk was going on in a mixture of russian and the skarmer tongue we will give you whatever you want if you give us one of these rifles to take across the gorge and use against the omalo anything no price could be too great the minervan abruptly stopped realizing no sensible merchant said things like that fralk if i gave a rifle to your people i would not only have to worry about your hurting the humans east of the canyon i would also fear for the safety of my own crew here tolmasov spoke first in russian then as best he could in fralks language he needed the minervan to understand nyet sergei konstantinovich nyet fralk said urgently never hurt youyou our friends give you he used a skarmer word the pilot could not follow tolmasov raised a hand to show that males you keep so you hurt them if we do any bad thing to you fralk explained ah hostages tolmasov gave him the russian word hostages fralk repeated thank you yes i am sure hogram would agree to give you hostageshe politely dropped the human term into a sentence in his own tongueso you could trust us with one of your rifles tolmasov knew he ought to say no and walk away what the minervans did to each other was their business if humans meddled in it only trouble would result but he didnt know what the americans had done on their side of jotun canyon and fralk was so eager he would have been too in the minervans place the pilot decided to temporize i talk with my domain masters he said if they say yes then we trade rifle if no we cannot he was confident even the blockheads back in moscow had better sense than to authorize letting the natives get their threefingered hands on an akt from the way fralks appendages were quivering he was confident tolmasov had in effect just said yes thank you sergei konstantinovich we would have beaten the omalo anyhow now we will surely smash themthey will widen themselves before us forevermore hmm was all tolmasov said fralk made a more enthusiastic wouldbe conqueror than he quite liked maybe changing the subject would calm the minervan down tolmasov pointed at the krongs carcass we leave this here yes i suppose sothe meat is vile fralk answered long ago there was a bounty on their claws but since none has been seen this near town in a good many years i suppose that offer has melted he did not want to talk about the krong he wanted to talk about tolmasovs rifle from how far away can it kill farther than you can throw a stone the pilot answered he did not want to tell fralk the kalashnikov was accurate out to three or four hundred meters and could kill from a kilometer away if a round happened to hit what he did say was plenty wonderful fralk exclaimed wonderful tolmasov had never heard a minervan burbling before hogram will be as excited as i am at the prospect of doing away with the wretched omalo while at the same time keeping our males safe remember what i say tolmasov warned him my domain masters may not let us sell you rifle they say no we not sell he started walking away from the dead krong back toward hograms town maybe if fralk could not see the beast anymore he would stop being so heated not really the right word to apply to a minervan the pilot thoughtabout what the kalashnikov could do no such luck the minervan went right on babbling until tolmasov rudely left him outside the humans tent and went in alone oleg lopatin looked up from the radio handset he was checking ive seen you looking happier sergei konstantinovich he said tolmasov was so frazzled he did not even mind unburdening himself to the kgb man i almost wish id let the miserable creature eat us he finished that might have ended up doing the mission less harm than letting the locals find out about firearms possibly not comrade colonel lopatin said tolmasov grew alert lopatin only used formal address when he had something on his mind would it not accord well with marxistleninist principles to render fraternal assistance to this advanced society in its struggle against the oppressive feudal aristocrats on the eastern side of jotun canyon the dialectic of history supports the skarmer how can we not do the same two good reasons this is minerva not earth and there are people on the other side of the canyon i have more loyalty to my own kind than i do to dialectical materialism the moment the words were out of his mouth tolmasov knew he had said too much and words were never unsayable not to a chekist but lopatins response was mild marxistleninist principles hold universally sergei konstantinovich you know that as well as i tell me what had you planned to do about fralks request nothing tolmasov answered honestly or rather say i had consulted with moscow and they told me he could not have his rifle a little discreet checking with bragg will let me make sure he isnt giving the omalo firearms yes by all means check with bragg lopatin said but perhaps you also really should ask moscow about this question then there can be no room for misunderstanding this is only a suggestion of course but it wasnt only a suggestion as tolmasov knew that was what he got for leaving himself open to the kgb man let me talk with bragg first the pilot said dickering now if i have his clear assurance that he is not giving guns to the locals a decision from moscow is unnecessary otherwise good enough lopatin said to tolmasovs surprise and relief call now why dont you even i will admit sergei konstantinovich that our colleagues back on earth are not always as timely as they might be the longer the opportunity we give them the better he said that with the air of a man making a great concession perhaps so he could act as if he were repaying tolmasov for his slip of a few minutes before but the pilot like most men on the frontier already had a low opinion of the alleged experts back home not only were they slow in making up their minds they were sadly disconnected from the reality he was living that scheme for peace talks between hogram and the eastern chieftain for instance tolmasov could have told themdid tell themit was a waste of time they had forced him to go ahead with it anyway and proven him right so who knew what moscow would instruct now they might well order him to let the minervans have an akt that would leave the whole expedition vulnerable in a way it had not been before as a soldier he hated the idea of making himself more vulnerable well odds were bragg would bail him out he thought as he went over to the radio the american mission commander was an enemy but never a stupid one he had to have better sense than to go arming the natives tolmasov turned a dial to get the frequency he needed soviet minerva base calling athena he said in english the answer came promptly enough in russian athena here sergei konstantinovich a womans voice more heavily accented than his when speaking her language pat marquard here hello patricia grigorovna i need to ask a question of brigadier bragg if i may wait please she said he did but not long bragg came on the other end of the hookup hello sergei konstantinovich not your usual time for a call whats up the shrill american flavor he gave his words and the lazy way he drawled them out should have made him sound like a fool when he spoke russian tolmasov wished they did unfortunately he could not imagine bragg sounding like a fool no matter what language he used swallowing a sigh the colonel got on with it i was ah wondering brigadier whether youve traded any firearms to the minervans on your side of jotun canyon only the faint pop of static came from the circuit brigadier bragg tolmasov said at last im here bragg answered at once why do you want to know hard suspicion filled his voice because if you havent gone and done something idiotic then theres no chance ill have to either tolmasov wanted to say he could not not with a soviet tape recorder and an american one preserving his every word i was curious about how theyve adapted to them he replied instead not what the natives are used to at all dont you know no i dont bragg said flatly i dont believe you either sergei konstantinovich you sound more like someone sniffing around to find out what his little friends will be up against if they manage to get across the canyon and that comrade colonelthe contempt with which he loaded tolmasovs rank was stingingis exactly none of your damned business athena out tolmasov found himself staring in numb dismay at a silent microphone he made himself look up from it and saw oleg lopatin aiming his best itoldyouso smirk at him moscow the kgb man said moscow tolmasov echoed dully you should have seen it clanfather fralk exulted the krong was nearly on me but then the riflehe pronounced the human word with careroared louder than half an eighteen of klongii and put holes in it it turned on sergei but he made the rifle roar again and again till the krong fell over dead a krong so close to town hograms fingers opened and closed in distress ill send out some males to make sure none of its mates can drop her buds anywhere near here i thought wed hunted them out long ago im glad you werent hurt eldest of eldest not an eighteenth so glad as i am fralk thought but it was not like hogram to miss the main point so completely aye send out the hunters clanfather fralk said but get one of those rifles for us no matter what it costs if it fills a krong full of holes think what it would do to the omalo hmm i suppose so yes the humans are careful with them arent they they never left one lying around so we could ah borrow it to see how it works that always made me think the things were valuable valuable the younger male was still so excited he could hardly contain himself clanfather listen to me sergei said that if his own domain masters refused his permission he could not yield one to us no matter what we paid for it did he that piqued hograms interest fralk thought he did he also said the humans on the other side of ervis gorge may have these firearms for the omalo did he now hogram was roused all right fralk thought and these humansour humanswould refuse them to us no matter what we paid fralk agreed the humans take our goods aye but i have not seen them go wild over anything nor use it as we use the tools and trinkets we get from them hogram said that says to me they are what they claim explorers seeing the kinds of things we have rather than merchants in the same sense as ourselves fralk had not worked that through for himself but it made sense hograms gift for pointing an eyestalk toward such subtle points had helped lift his clan to the status it enjoyed among the skarmer these days if they do not truly need anything we have it weakens us fralk remarked how can we make them reach out with the arm that is turned in the direction best for us they have only two arms apiece but they turn them every which way hogram said were they not so strange in seeming i would take them for spies if i were to order them to stay in their own tent and their skyboat until they do as we desire i think that might persuade them to obey after all eldest of eldest what good are explorers who are not allowed to explore none quite without calculation fralk widened himself before hogram the domain masters gift for subterfuge had not diminished as his years grew long it grew with them instead until even creatures as weird as the humans held few mysteries for him fralk was used to believing his own machinations hidden from hogram suddenly he suspected that what he had imagined to be a wall of solid earth was in fact but a thin pane of clear ice a motion of hograms arms recalled the younger male to himself you said our humans will be talking with those on the other side of ervis gorge and with their own domain masters yes clanfather fralk slowly resumed his usual height that will take some time lets give them oh half an eighteen of days if after that time they still refuse to sell us one of these whatevertheycallthems we will find out how they enjoy exploring the hot muddy inside of that gaudy orange tentthe cursed thing reminds me of the color a presap mate takes on when its ripe for budding it is ugly isnt it fralks eyestalks quivered a little hideous is a better word hogram changed the subject the boats are now ready i take it yes clanfather fralk never would have come where hograms eyestalks could spy him were that not so we have the boats we have the males to fill them now we are only waiting for the waters to grow calmer as you yourself said we do not want accidents while we are crossing the gorge he knew there would be accidents anyway if they waited for the waters in ervis gorge to be completely calm they would wait until the flood had drained away the odor of resignation hogram exuded said he knew the same thing the domain master asked a different question how will our males react to being in these boats on the water they will never have done anything like that before if they are all blue with fright when they get across they will prove nothing but prey for the omalo clanfather i think i am more afraid of juksal than i could be of any water fralk blurted this time hograms eyestalks wiggled and not a little laugh all you like the younger male went on but i dont think im the only male who feels that way good hogram was still laughing its good to know our veteran warriors can inspire fright if they do the same to reaturs males as to our own we will surely triumph the domain master paused his eyestalks stopped moving reatur he worries me he is able clanfather fralk said remembering that reatur had scared him a good deal more than juksal ever managed to do but he is not as able as you hmm well maybe hograms skin turned a deeper green fralks flattery had pleased him flattered or not though he was still hogram let me point out to you eldest of eldest that i will not be east of ervis gorge meeting reatur you will fralk knew that was true he would just as soon not have been reminded of it though they did what reatur shouted all the males who could hear himwhich meant a lot of malesturned a couple of extra eyestalks in his direction that shout meant trouble what kind they would find out later but the trouble was already here they ran a whole herd of massi back into dordals domain clanfather the male named garro repeated the domain master did not need to look down at himself to know he was turning yellow dordal has gone mad if he thinks he can get away with that he said furiously he knows we outweigh him two to one and hes a lazy piece of runnerpest voiding to begin with what stirred his eyestalks up all of a sudden to let him think he can go raiding without our tying them in knots for him ill take a band of warriors that will garro interrupted to answer reaturs rhetorical question a couple of his males were wiggling their eyestalks and jeering that we couldnt do anything about it because we were too busy worrying about imaginary dangers from across ervis gorge ervis reatur felt his breathing pores tightening up as if they were trying to keep out a bad smell unfortunately he knew the threat from west of the gorge was not imaginary that limited what he could do his first angry vision of arming all the males in the domain and leading them up to smash dordals castle melted like ice in a hot summer his skin went back to its usual green as calculation ousted rage i cant let him keep those massi he said slowly if i do his males will steal more not only that grebur will think he can nibble at my domain too between them curse it they could prove more trouble than the skarmer could and probably will clanfather garro agreed i still dont see how anyone can cross ervis gorge when its full of water neither do i but hogram does reatur said the humans magic or machine or whatever it was let me talk with him dont forget he thinks he can cross if he didnt why would he try to turn my domain topsyturvy who can tell why a skarmer does anything garro said scornfully hogram is sly but not stupid reatur said i wish he were the domain master paused a while in thought and then gave his orders find ternat tell him to march eightno nineeighteens of males into dordals domain they are to take more animals than were stolen from us and to bring them back to our land tell him to move fast too no one knows when the skarmer are coming and to beat them back we may need every male we can find garro repeated the orders until reatur was satisfied he had them all then the younger male hurried away reatur watched him go he wished dordals eldest would overthrow him not the sort of thing a domain master often wished even on an enemy such wishes had a way of coming back to bite the male who made them reatur abruptly repented of his wish not because he feared overthrowternat was the best eldest a domain master could hope forbut because dordals replacement might prove competent having a competent domain master on his northern border was not something reatur needed having an incompetent one there was quite bad enough what he really ought to do one of these years he told himself was topple dordal and install a loyal male of his own budding someone like enoph sayas domain master up there that would solve the problem once for all or at least until enophs eldest succeeded him which presumably would be ternats problem and not reaturs and if i set enoph in dordals place reatur asked himself how is that any different from hograms wanting to put fralk in mine for one thing he thought enoph and dordal were both from the first omalo bud not foreigners like the skarmer for another reatur would be doing the overthrowing not having it done to him he doubted whether dordal would appreciate that part of the argument too bad for dordal one of these years his plans for doing unpleasant things to his neighbor melted as he saw a male hurrying toward him in a way that could only mean something else had gone wrong he wanted to turn all six of his eyestalks away from the male to pretend the fellow did not exist that sadly was not what being domain master was about what is it apbajur he asked letting the air sigh through his breathing pores were beginning to get enough melting on the northern walls of the castle to be a nuisance clanfather apbajur told him reatur sighed again that was a nuisance every summer and in a hot oneas this one was looking to bea major nuisance well just have to start spreading dirt i suppose the domain master said a good layer of dirt on the roof and walls helped shield the ice beneath from the heat of the sun i thought so too clanfather apbajur said he was a master watermolder and icecarver and had a good feel for such matters but i wanted to get your permission before i started pulling males from the fields for the work youd best do it reatur said though he felt like cursing instead first males to watch ervis gorge for the skarmer then more to deal with dordal and now this the crops would suffer because of it of course they would suffer a good deal more if the skarmer invasion succeeded or if dordals males kept raiding and reatur did not want to live in a castle falling down around him taken by itself any one thing was always easy to justify weighing that one thing against all the others going on at the same time though was not so simple two males came rushing toward reatur from different directions one was shouting clanfather the eloca are at the same time the other cried clanfather the nosver have got into the reatur felt like pulling in all his eyestalks and pretending to be a stump he might have done so had he thought onditi and venotsor even one of themwould let him get away with it sadly he knew better one at a time please he said wearily onditi had got to him before venots so the domain master pointed to him first what have the cursed miserable stupid eloca gone and done now are you sure you should have brushed tolmasov off that way irv asked emmett bragg after listening to the tape of the conversation between the two pilots bragg bristled damn straight im sure when he swore irv knew he was both angry and in earnest long as the russians keep to their side of jotun canyon none o their business what we do over here besides if they even think weve given guns to the minervans here maybe theyll get serious about keeping hograms gang on their own side where they belong or maybe theyll give them guns too to keep things balanced irv pointed out hadnt thought of that bragg frowned but his face cleared after a moment i dont believe it tolmasovs not that dumb no matter what he thinks of us no way hed let the natives have the drop on him i wouldnt not in his long johns i suppose not irv said if we started shooting at each other here it could even touch off a war back home yeah bragg nodded like i said tolmasovs not that dumb but hes no friend of ours eithergood for his digestion to get stirred up every once in a while let him stew all right emmett somewhat reassured irv went back to work he had spoken his piece and emmett hadnt gone along fair enough braggs judgment had been good so far he told himself likely it was this time too he didnt necessarily trust the russians that far himself either tolmasov listened to the tape from earth once more he shook his head he wasnt used to getting orders this simple use your own best judgment regarding firearms for the minervans he repeated who would have thought moscow could be so generous and what is your best judgment o mighty boyar shota rustaveli asked if i were a boyar my best judgment would be to clip the tongue of such an impudent subject tolmasov retorted but he could not help smiling rustaveli reveled in being impossible more seriously the pilot went on my best judgment is to be very sorry that i have to tell fralk my domain masters will not let us sell them any kalashnikovs rustaveli wore gloves even inside the tent he clapped just the same that is an excellent best judgment to have i think da katerina said looking up from a microscope oleg lopatin did not say anything his wide shoulders jerked in a shrug tolmasov did not think lopatin was pleased he did not much care if the kgb man knew what was good for him he would follow orders to give lopatin his due something the pilot did only reluctantly he had been obeying tolmasov with military exactness let him keep right on doing it tolmasov thought as he went out to find fralk as he explained himself he watched the minervan turn yellow he had seen them do that among themselves but rarely at him humans and minervans tried to stay on best behavior around each other he knew it was not a good sign your domain masters do not understand that we need these rifles fralk said they are far away you are here let us buy a rifle and the success we have with it will float above their orders as ice floats on water i am sorry tolmasov spread his hands even though they are far i cannot disobey my domain masters any more than you can hogram cannot fralk said now resembling nothing so much as an outraged banana with a great many arms will not i think comes nearer the truth an outraged sarcastic banana tolmasov thought he shook his head to try to drive away the mental imagethis was what he got for spending so much time with rustaveli the real problem was that fralk had it right tolmasov did not like lying to the minervan he did not hesitate either do you go against hograms wishes as soon as he cannot see you my domain masters would punish my disobedience when we got home this is your final word fralk demanded i am sorry but it is you will be sorrier had fralk been a human he would have turned on his heel and stomped off instead he averted all his eyestalks from tolmasov as he left that got the same message across the pilot thought glumly he walked through one of the market areas that ringed hograms town if he shut his eyes the racket there reminded him of the little stalls in smolenskand every other russian town where farm women sold city housewives the beets and chickens they raised on their private plots of land minervan males high voices only made the resemblance closer two males came up to tolmasov one on either side one carried a spear the other a sovietmade hatchet please go back to your cloth house now human the male with the spear said it did not sound like a request why tolmasov asked doubting whether either male spoke any russian past the word human he went on in their language many times i people like me come here not do harm not bother hograms males just look why not look now because fralk demands it in hograms name that male replied he lifted the spear to block the pilots path go back to your cloth house now i go tolmasov said thinking fralk had wasted no time in starting his petty revenge when he got back to the tent he found the revenge was not petty more armed males surrounded the orange nylon bubble one of them was laying down the law to oleg lopatinthe minervans had never heard of the kgb lucky them tolmasov thought then he got close enough to hear what the minervan was saying and things abruptly stopped being even a little bit funny you strange creatures have interesting devices and for their sake we have let you do and go as you would the male told lopatin now you will not share one of these devices with us so why should we keep extending to you the privileges you earned only with good behavior he sounded like a soldier repeating a memorized message tolmasov suspected that was partly because lopatins grasp of the skarmer language was still weak and he would not have understood everything on the first try only want to go out look lopatin protested you strange creatures have interesting devices the male went through his routine again as far as tolmasov could tell he used just the same words he had before someone had given him those words hogram or fralk the pilot thought disquieted they were ready for us to say no shedding his own escort he strode over to the male who was keeping lopatin just outside the tent lopatin actually gave him a grateful look something he had never before earned from the chekist the minervan of course used a spare eyestalk to see tolmasov comingno chance of taking a native by surprise as he might have a human guard what you do here tolmasov asked in his sternest tones when the male started to go into his routine once more the pilot cut him off i hear this before what you do with us humans the minervan had more than one groove to his record after all from now on you stay here inside this ugly house you do not go out for any reason if you do not do what we want the domain master says we will not let you do what you want he is a trader not a giver we only do what our domain masters order tolmasov said and i only do what my domain master orders of me the male retorted tolmasov tried a new tack we show we hograms friends many times many ways why so angry now at one small thing in warmer weather he would have been sweating this house arrestwould wreck the missions ability to gather data he had the bad feeling hogram knew that being manipulated by the natives was not something the pilot had anticipated their technology was too primitive to let him think of them as equals but that did not worse luck mean they were stupid for that matter they knew more about humans than tolmasov had suspected one small thing is it the male said then why did you conceal the fact that one of you is of all the disgusting notions a grownup mate did you know it would only make us reckon you more monstrous than we do already not hide tolmasov insisted he shared an appalled glance with lopatin they had known about minervan females short lives for some time now and had slowly gotten used to the idea this was not earth expecting everything to work the same way would have been foolish so evidently would have been expecting the minervans to understand that tolmasov fell back on the only answer that might do some good no one ask us ah and so you said nothing a merchants reply we call that the male said relief flowed through tolmasov he had helped himself rather than hurt but the male went on if you are merchants too you will see that we do what we must to make you deal as we want when you do all your privileges will be restored till then you stay in here now go in how long we stay tolmasov asked till you show us what we need to know i told you that how long it is depends on you cannot do what you want the pilot said then youll stay in there a long time the male answered we dont have the food to withstand a long siege lopatin said in russian we dont have anything to withstand a long siege tolmasov answered in the same language that waswhat was the fine american phrase a selfevident truth go in now the minervan male said in no mood to let the two humans chatter away in a speech he could not follow at his gesture his followers raised their weapons short of opening fire tolmasov and lopatin had no choice but to obey inside the tent shota rustaveli and katerina had been listening to everything that was going on rustaveli greeted lopatin with an ironic bow good day oleg borisovich and welcome to the gulag thats enough from you you georgian lopatin growled before tolmasov followed him in thats enough from both of you the pilot said sharply i cannot command us to like one another but we will treat each other with respect all the more so in this tight space think of it as spaceship discipline if you must everyone nodded then katerina said think of it as living in a tworoom apartment with four generations of your family this time everyone laughed da tolmasov said he had lived like that himself everyone had lived that way in smolensk when he was small in one of the stalingothic apartment blocks that had gone up like ugly toadstools after the great patriotic war afterward he had never thought those memories would be funny now he was grateful to katerina for using them to break the tension of the moment the resemblance will grow even closer when the chemical toilet clogs up rustaveli said he sounded sardonic as usual but he looked serious he was right too after a few daysa week at mostwith four people in permanent residence the tent would be a decidedly unpleasant place to live the heater will need another charge of gas before long too katerina said and the stove afterward well have no way to make tea or to make our concentrates into hot food come to that we may not even have water tolmasov grimaced maybe the minervans would let them go out to gather ice and snow maybe not if not the siege would end in a hurry if the natives want our kalashnikovs so badly maybe we should give them a good taste lopatin said then before anyone could shout at him he shook his head no it would not do like it or not we live in the age of media regardless of what a few well placed bullets might accomplish here they would do more damage back on earth imperialism is easier when word of what it takes to build an empire never leaks out rustaveli said georgia has learned that all too well from underneath for a moment the brooding expression in his dark hooded eyes the way the shadows sat on his narrow cheeks made him seem almost as alien to the three great russians in the tent with him as did the minervans outside a real fight might have sprung from his words maybe he intended that just then though a minervan called sergei konstantinovich come out please come alone he spoke russian fralk tolmasov mouthed silently not seeing what other choice he had he went zdrastye he said somberly what do you aim to do with us do with you fralk returned to his own language he sounded altogether innocent a good enough reason tolmasov thought to suspect he wasnt nothing at all we will merely keep you here and at your skyboat his pause again was perfectlytoo perfectlycontrived the machine that goes back and forth between here and your skyboat may continue to do so provided it goes by the same route it always uses other than that you humans may not leave the skyboat either males are on the way to enforce hograms command there thank you for letting us eat and stay warm at any rate tolmasov did his best to stay polite he was seething inside sure enough the locals had spotted the humans weakness being on minerva without exploring was like sharing a bed with a beautifuland expensive oh so expensive trollop without making love we have no wish to harm you humans in any way fralk assured him as you know i owe you my life but hogram wanting many other males to be preserved thanks to your rifle can no longer cooperate with you when you do not cooperate with us you should write for pravda tolmasov muttered which meant nothing to fralk but the minervan was doing a good job of reproducing the moreinsorrowthanimagine itsforyour owngood tone the paper often took the pilot went on my domain masters are far away fralk interrupted hogram is here and so are you you would do well to remember it tolmasov waved at the spearcarrying males hard to forget think of them as being here to protect you if you like fralk said tolmasov did not know how to say hypocrite in the skarmer tongue and fralk did not understand the russian word the conversation accordingly lagged tolmasov went back into the tent fralks voice pursued him think on what you do sergei konstantinovich bah the pilot flung himself into the chair in front of the radio he worked off some of his fury by profanely embellishing the warning he sent to bryusov and voroshilov in tsiolkovsky after the sparks stopped shooting from tolmasovs mouth the two men on the ship did not reply for some little while at last timidly valery bryusov asked do i understand that you want us to obey the minervan males when they arrive yes curse it the pilot growled if they keep letting the rover travel back and forth i dont see what else we can do we cannot fight them unless they attack us firstas oleg borisovich has said public opinion back home would never support it we will just have to see just who can be more stubborn us or the minervans over the next ten days tolmasov developed a rankling hatred for the color orange he had never been fond of oleg lopatin although the kgb man did his best to be selfeffacing something he could not have found easytolmasov began to despise him in earnest shota rustavelis jokes wore very thin even katerina started getting on the pilots nerves and he was grimly certain everyone crowded into the tent with him was sick of him too then voroshilov called from tsiolkovsky moscow wonders why we arent sending them data based on new journeys just analysis of what wed done a while ago screw moscow yuri ivanovich tolmasov said no one had said anything to moscow about their confinement hoping the standoff would resolve itself before they had to thank you no the chemist answered what though do you propose to tell them back home i cannot see us avoiding the issue any longer tolmasov sighed i fear we will have to tell them the truth voroshilov was a quiet patient man when he started chiding however gentlythe pilot knew he could not sit on his hands any longer the message that came back to tsiolkovsky was circumspect but not ambiguous use whatever means necessary to stay on good terms with the natives and continue your scheduled program of exploration which of us becomes drillmaster shota rustaveli asked when bryusov relayed the word from earth that tolmasov thought gloomily about summed things up fralk watched with five eyes as the human opened a catch and clicked a curved brown box into place on the bottom of the rifle this holds bullets oleg said bullets fralk repeatedso many new words to learn all of them were necessarily in the human language too his own lacked the concepts for easy translation bullets bullets bullets da khoroshogood the bullets come out of the muzzle when you pull the trigger muzzle trigger fralk said the words while oleg holding the rifle in one manyfingered hand pointed out the parts with the other the human held out the rifle go ahead pull the trigger what fralk watched himself turn blue with alarm you said uh bullets would come out he had seen what bullets had done to the krong he didnt know how to make them go where he wanted and didnt want them to do that to oleg or him go ahead pull oleg insisted hesitantly fralk reached out with a fingerclaw the trigger was hard as stone but smooth as ice he pulled nothing happened no bullets he said relieved no no bullets oleg agreed he took back the rifle then touched part of it above and to one side of the trigger fralk had not realized it was a separate piece but the front end of it the end toward the muzzle moved this is the change lever oleg said change lever fralk repeated dutifully da when the front of the change lever is here at the top you cannot pull the trigger always carry the rifle with the change lever like that so it does not shoot by accident at the top fralk echoed the idea of a rifle that could shoot by accident tempted him to turn blue again a spear or an ax did what it did because some male made it work if no one was around it would just lie there the rifle sounded as though it had a mind of its own fralk wondered if he could trust it away from its human masters oleg did not give him time to dwell on that he moved the change lever with it here in the center position the rifle will shoot many bullets one after the other he moved it again with it here at the bottom the rifle will shoot one bullet at a time why the choice fralk asked if enemy is close you use up fewer bullets and save them for other foes oh fralk said that made sense of a sort so many things to think about vii the wind howled out of the south blowing the snow it carried along almost horizontally reatur stood in the middle of his field with all his arms happily stretched out a spell of decent weather at last he said i was sick of all that heat all what heat the human beside him muttered louise was bundled in even more false skins than humans usually wore shereatur hardly had to remind himself of that anymore something he could not have imagined a few eighteens of days agoeven had a coveting for her eyes transparent as ice but harder to melt the domain master gestured expansively we often get a few stretches of nice southerly breeze he said im particularly glad to have this one because it will help keep the castle walls solid nice southerly breeze louise echoed then she sighed a sound that when human mates made it was eerily like the one people used in the same situation glad cold good for something its not cold reatur protested only to have louise sigh again one thing about which people and humans would never agree was what constituted good weather never mind louise saidshe realized that too much ice melting at edge of land where all icemakes storms come blow even here reatur started to answer but stopped not for the first time one of the ideas a human casually tossed out made him look at the world in a different way it had never occurred to him that what happened in one place could affect weather somewhere else is the weather across ervis gorge the same as it is here he asked after a moments thought not much different why the one bad thing about snow is that it makes things far away harder to see if its snowing on the skarmer side of the gorge they made decide to hit us now because the males i have watching wont know theyre coming till too late louises wrappings made trying to read her expression always a tricky business with humans a waste of time now but when she said one more thing to worry about reaturs eyestalks could not help twitching no matter how strange they looked in some ways humans thought very much like domain masters as if thinking about humans had conjured up more of them three came into sight trudging along the new path that led from the castle to their flying house or perhaps reatur thought on seeing irv pat and sarah together it was louises mention of one more thing to worry about that made them appear when they did the newcomers had their heads down they were talking among themselves in their own language they all jerked in surprise when reatur called any luck they turned toward him he saw how splattered with elocs blood they were the wind brought its sharp scent to him budding and death intermingled in the odor with that smell so thick he hardly needed to hear sarahs glum reply not much some pat corrected budding far along when we get to elocs pen not have much time to get ready do better next try the humans had been saying that since sarahs first go at saving an eloc mate they had yet to keep one alive reatur thought gloomily as if picking his thought from the air like a snowflake sarah said not enough luck not yet if eloc was lamra lamra dead now how much longer till lamra buds irv asked by dint of endless work he was starting to speak the omalo language quite well after a moments thought reatur answered an eighteen of days an eighteen and a half at the outside when the humans first put forth the idea of saving lamra he had been of two minds about wishing them success now though hope of that success looked as far away as ever he knew how downcast he would be if they failed that made no sense to him but he was getting used to common sense collapsing whenever humans touched it what pat touched was the goresplashed front of her false skins go get clean she said to reatur and started to walk on toward the flying house then she added wish i had hot water which left him almost as confused as when he had realized how his feelings about lamras survival had changed one of waters few virtues to reaturs way of thinking was being better for washing than ice or snow but hot water hot water was a weapon of war good for shooting at a foe from a distance or undermining the thick hard ice of his walls did pat mean she was going to wash herself in it the domain master knew humans loved heat but that was taking things altogether too far he never thought to wonder how pat felt about his living in a castle made mostly of ice the boats bumped down the path toward jotun canyon the path meant only for occasional travelers was not nearly wide enough to accommodate so much traffic minervans and their beasts of burden slogged eastward using the roadway more as a sign of the direction in which they should go than as a means of travel in itself oleg lopatin marched along with them he was whistling cheerfully something which had they heard it would have filled the rest of the crew of tsiolkovsky with disbelief but he thought he had every reason to be happy for one thing he was doing conspicuously less than the warriors all around him true his akt was slung over his shoulder and he had a heavy pack on his back but he was not hauling boats on ropes like the minervans nothing satisfies the soul like watching others work harder than oneself for another he was doing actually doing something every soviet officer dreamed of and planned for he was marching to war against the americans in a place where they had no nuclear weapons to make life difficult so he whistled fralk turned an eyestalk toward him how do you make that peculiar noise oleg borisovich the minervan asked in good russian you just pucker your lips and lopatin began in the same language then he remembered whoand whathe was talking to never mind he said lamely switching to the skarmer tongue your mouth mine not same fralk sighed no i suppose not even so a minute or so later he sent air hissing up and out through his mouth it did not sound like whistling it sounded like a steam valve with a leak lopatin thought the sight of fralks breath smoking out would have completed the illusion but fralks breath did not smoke it was too cold the kgb man found another reason to be glad he was marchinghe stayed warmer this way he passed minervans practicing their paddling on boats set down by the side of the road they were none too efficient at best when they turned three or four eyestalksand their concentrationon the human instead of their job they grew positively ragged unlike lopatin they would not freeze in moments if their coracles flipped them into the icy water now rushing through jotun canyon also unlike him though none of them could swim a stroke he expected a good many to drown on the way across that was too bad but it could not be helped fralk and hogram he knew felt the same way or they never would have tried crossing the canyon in the first place and fralk was also forethoughtful enough to have got the best paddlers in the whole force for his boat had fralk not come up with that idea for himself lopatin would have suggested it he was going into that coracle too but fralk was no ones fool when it came to selfinterest minervans and humans thought very much alike the roar of the torrent in jotun canyon had filled lopatins ears all day he was starting to screen it out as he did the city noise of moscow now he let himself hear it again the irregular grind of ice on ice that was part of the racket made him frown even the best paddlers might not save him that thought came back to haunt him as he peered down from the rim of the canyon and saw through swirling snow the cakes of ice flowing by he wondered whether fralk was also full of second thoughts more likely the minervan was too busy to have time for them gangs of males had been laboring to smooth and widen the path down to the water since before the flood began even so it was none too smooth and none too wide it was also steep and icy getting warriors down to where they could cross the stream was no easy job getting the boats down there was worse lopatin was glad all that was fralks problem not his to give him his due fralk was as ready as anyone trying something for the first time could be the changeovers of the rope crews had been planned with almost balletic precision moving the boats along was not the problem it had been on the trek from hograms town keeping them from taking off on their own and sliding into the water without any warriors in them however presented problems of its own though his own engineering talents were electronic rather than mechanical lopatin admired the solution fralk and his comrades had come up with at the top of the canyon most of the boatpullers abruptly turned into boatholders moving behind their burdens to control them and stop them from running away the kgb man clicked off several pictures fast as the autowinder would let him he wished he had tsiolkovskys video camera with him but understood why tolmasov had said no both in the water and across it he was going into realserious dangertaking the precious camera along would have risked it as well but the stills he was getting could only suggest the smooth discipline of the maneuvers the warriors were carrying out ballet was not quite the right comparison after all lopatin decided after watching for a few minutes the groups of males working together reminded him more of public komsomol displays of mass exercises one of fralks constantly twisting eyestalks happened to light on lopatin oleg borisovich you should be on your way down not gawking up here the minervan scolded the russian felt his face grow hot snow flurries or no you are right eldest of eldest he said formally i apologize hoping the spiked soles of his boots would hold he started down the slope careful there he heard fralk yell behind him no no no dont foul the ropes you spawn of a spavined eloc come around this way therebetter isnt it the general as traffic cop lopatin thought smiling in spite of wearing spikes he soon came to envy the minervan males their six legs they could slip the claws on their toes into the tiniest cracks in the roadway to anchor themselves and even if they fell they had six arms with which to reach out and grab something dont fall he told himself grimly and tramped on fralk hurried past him instead of shouting at males getting ready to maneuver boats down the path now the minervan was shouting at the males who were starting to put boats into the water no you idiot keep the rope attached keep it too late the boat was already sliding downstream the warriors who had let it get away stared at it with a couple of eyestalks and apprehensively back at fralk with the rest he screamed abuse at them lopatin chuckled he did not understand even half of what fralk was yelling but anyone who had ever soldiered recognized the tone one of the males past whom lopatin was marching wiggled his eyestalks at the human even in an alien species lopatin could tell this was a veteran his spears and shields were old and battered not shiny new ones like those most of the warriors carried and pale scars seamed his hide taught that little budling everything he knows about fighting i did me juksal the male said even sounds like a warrior now doesnt he yes and a leader of warriors lopatin agreed taught him everything he knows about fighting juksal repeated the minervan boasted like a veteran too the kgb man thought lopatin had listened to more stories about the great patriotic war than he ever wanted to remember almost all of them a security mans automatic cynicism told him were lies he was drawing near the boats at the makeshift landing when he happened to recall a piece of a war story he had thought long forgotten the fellow who told it was a stalingrad survivor and had the campaign ribbon to prove it the worst of the worst times he had said was when the germans had us pinned back against the volga and the drift ice on the river made it damn near impossible to get supplies across to us lopatin looked at the chunks of ice floating by looked at the coracle to which he was about to entrust his precious irreplaceable neck he wishedoh how he wished he had never remembered that story emmet bragg frowned as he examined the latest photo from one of the weather and mapping satellites athena had left in orbit around minerva emmet had a whole spectrum of frowns irv thoughtthis one went with real live serious problems whats hit the fan irv asked im not quite sure emmett answered the frown changed shape to reflect his uncertainty here see what you make of this he leaned over to show irv the picture pointing with a ballpoint pen at the part that was troubling him this dark line here irv asked emmet nodded thats the one nothing like it on any earlier pictures o that area thats the country just west of jotun canyon from here you know i recognized it irv peered at the picture now he was frowning too what do you suppose this is a lousy picture for one thing through scattered clouds and without enough resolution i wish we had a defense department special instead of these miserable terrainmappersthatd tell us what was what back when we set out whod have thought wed need to be able to kibitz at card games from space irv asked reasonably nobody worse luck emmett answered but i wish somebody had because one of the things that line could be is the skarmer army headed out to do its thing irv felt his frown deepen till it matched the one emmet was wearing yeah it could couldnt it they could be doing something else just as easily too though or it might not be minervans at all i know i know i know bragg looked unhappy a spy bird would tell us one way or the other as is all i can do is guess and i hate that the mission commander sat brooding for a minute or so then snatched at the radio set who are you calling irv asked frank emmett said he spoke into the microphone frank you there answer please a moment later frank marquard did your humble canyoncrawler is here humbly crawling his canyon found another fossil about twenty minutes ago too whats up emmett i dont know for sure but i think maybe the skarmer are coming if they are theyll be heading up our side of jotun canyon i dont think you want to be there when they do are you certain theyre coming frank asked im further north than ive been before and ive found some interesting strata here things that dont poke through down by athena i dont want to leave if i dont have to im not sure bragg said looking as though the admission pained him he always looked that way when certainty eluded him irv thought then im not leaving frank said bragg made a fist pounded it against his knee he glanced over toward irv order him back the anthropologist thought but before he could speak bragg turned back to the microphone you be alert out there you hear me he said sure i will frank said we need more lerts not a good time for jokes bragg said with a snort i mean it athena out he was shaking his head as he put down the mike lerts if its not fight there in front of him frank doesnt worry about it irv said he thought of pats bitter words the night after sarah had flown across jotun canyon he had done his best to avoid thinking of that night ever since or thinking of pat in anything but a purely professional way most of the time that worked pretty well for a moment though even his skin remembered how she had felt in his arms yeah i know emmett said bringing irv back to the hereandnow but i cant make him come in just on account of my vapors hes got his job to do down there in the canyon i suppose so irv said he sounded halfhearted even to himself bragg looked at him you too huh yeah logically though youre fight dont misunderstand me emmett walking in front of a train was surer trouble than getting on emmett braggs bad side offhand irv could not think of much else yeah logically bragg grunted then why dont i like it the kgb studied disneyland because visiting soviet dignitaries liked to go there one of the attractions lopatin had learned from a friend was something called mr toads wild ride never having read the wind in the willows lopatin did not know much about this mr toad but he was sure the fide he was taking was wild enough to horrify any amphibian ever hatched the coracle tossed in the surge like a toy boat in a bathtub with a rambunctious threeyearold all the minervans in it were blue with fright could lopatin have changed color he would have been blue too he wondered if tolmasov had let him go along in the hope he would drown and thought of ways he could get revenge even on a hero of the soviet union when he got back to earth if he got back to earth at the moment he would not have given a counterfeit kopeck for his chances of making it to the far side of jotun canyon let alone home again two boulders of ice had already missed the boat by a lot less than he cared to think about he had fended off another one fortunately smaller with a pole and his coracle was luckier than many one of the chunks of iceberg that just missed it smashed a boat a little further downstream minervans splashed into the water as the coracle instantly turned to kindling a couple of warriors managed to hang on to floating debris the rest simply disappeared even if he managed to grab something lopatin knew he would quickly perish this temporary river was frigid as the waters around vladivostok in december there at least the minervans had the advantage on him to them any liquid water was warm they might drown but they would not freeze a dubious distinction he thought the spray blowing in his face had already left his nose numb and when he bent down to scoop water from the bottom of the coracle the cold bit into his fingers through the heavy gloves he was wearing his feet had also started to freeze lopatin was bending to bail again when fralk screamed paddle paddle hard for your lives the kgb man jerked erect a veritable ice mountain was bearing down on the boat mother of god lopatin shouted he had called on the devils relatives often enough in his career but could not remember the last time he had named any of the deitys luckily the minervans unlike his comrades would not notice he grabbed a paddle from one of the males jammed it into the water again and again he did not know whether he was a better paddler than the warrior but could not bear to depend only on the efforts of others for his survival slowly so slowly the coracle moved ahead the bluewhite slab of ice sailing along as majestically as a dowager queen took no notice of the artificial insect in its path the minervan whose paddle lopatin had taken let out a shrill scream of terror and leapt overboard the rest of the locals along with the kgb man dug in even harder lopatin refused to look up he would risk nothing that might distract him from his desperate rhythm were they gaining he almost tried not to believe it for fear of slacking but surely that mass of ice was not headed straight at the coracle anymore surely the wave the ice mountain pushed ahead of itself lifted up the boats stern lopatin tried to tell himself he was imagining the wind of its passage then it was past and some other boats problem heart pounding lopatin rested for a moment a few more like that he thought shakily and the whole fleet would be someone elses problemprobably the virgins in whose existence he did not believe after angrily telling himself that he wondered whether minervans had souls is water like this all the time fralk asked if he did have a soul he had been nearly frightened out of it the blue of his skin was the next thing to purple i hope not lopatin answered no sailor himself in the aftermath of shared fright he felt closer to the minervan than he ever had even during weapons training which reminded him the only way fralk would ever get his hands on the kalashnikov was from lopatins dead body that didnt necessarily mean he would not get off a few shots of his own though when the time came the eastern wall of jotun canyon filled more and more of the sky ahead fralk saw it too and began to drift back toward his usual green we are doing it oleg borisovich he said lopatin did not think he was reading surprise into the minervans voice nevertheless he answered da fralk we are doing it that was no small feat either not when the skarmer were inventing watergoing technology from scratch he peered upstream downstream the water was still full of boats in spite of the dreadful swath that enormous hunk of ice had cut through them so are most of the rest able to look in both directions at the same time fralk had already decided the same thing enough of us will get across to fight well he said if we can assemble quickly once were there lopatin nodded after a while the coracle was close enough to the eastern shore for him to look for landing sites there he said pointing steer that way looks like good sheltered anchorage he spoke the skarmer tongue so the paddlers could understand him but the key word as happened so often came out in russian like a good what oleg borisovich fralk asked tell me what that means a good place to put up a boat lopatin answered he pointed again that piece of rock that juts out into the water shields the part behind it from the worst flow of the stream oh fralk did a token job of widening himself a good thought it never would have occurred to me that something like that could make a difference im glad youve come along that lopatin decided made one of them a problem with new technology human or minervan was that it didnt have all the answers not least because the people putting it together hadnt asked all the fight questions fralk would have been perfectly happy to land any old place on the eastern shore he hadnt refined his goals enough to see one place as better than another that would be fineuntil he needed his boat to get back to the other side and discovered it wasnt where hed left it anymore the kgb mans mental grumbling did not keep him from helping to guide the coracle into the anchorage he had spotted fralk climbed out of the boat and tied it to a boulder i am back omalo as i said i would be he declared the rest of the males in the coracle waved their arms and hooted lopatin did not join the celebration though he was as relieved as any of the minervans to have made it to the other side he was also a thoroughly practical man instead of wasting time cheering he scrambled after fralk out onto dry land a few hundred meters away juksal was already heading upslope like lopatin he saw no point in staying in his boat an instant longer than he had to he felt the same way about ervis gorge as a whole the omalo could do all sorts of hideous things to the skarmer if they kept them trapped down here getting the warriors up to the flatlands was what needed doing the veteran thought warriors juksals hands tightened around the spears he was carrying till his fingerclaws bit into the shafts calling a bunch of peasants and clerks warriors didnt make them such nor did giving them spears just getting them to stay in their groups and do as they were told would be a fairsized miracle juksal wished he knew more about the omalo if they all got their eyestalks pointing the fight way fast enough the skarmer might be in for a very unpleasant time but who would believe anyone could cross a great gorge in the middle of the summer flood a year ago juksal would not have believed it himself with luck the omalo would not believe it either not until too late a spatter of snow blew past the warrior he hoped for more it would help hide the boatsand the skarmer males as they climbed the side of ervis gorge unless the omalo were complete idiots they would have watchers out no one ever lived to be old by assuming his enemies were idiots juksal was no idiot as if thinking of watchers had made them spring into being something moved far above him swearing to himself he dove behind a rock he stuck a cautious eyestalk around it to make sure of what he had just glimpsed with luck it would be an animal not a male now the snow hindered him he could not tell what the thing up ahead was he swore again then paused to take stock of things if i have trouble seeing it itll have trouble seeing me too he whispered and he carried two spears long and sharp enough to make even a krong think twice keeping himself widened as if before hogram juksal dashed for the cover of another boulder again he poked an eyestalk around it and again found himself able to see little if that was a male up there though he had not raised the alarm more likely a beast juksal decided then through the muttering of the wind he heard a sound that came from no beast the poundpoundpound of a hammer on stone that was a male then and by the racket he was making he had no idea juksal was anywhere close the warrior scuttled forward quiet as a zosid sneaking up on a runnerpest shota rustaveli looked nervously back over his shoulder as he stepped into tsiolkovskys control room he could have had a dozen legitimate reasons for coming forward and in any case yuri voroshilov was as usual preoccupied in his lab at the other end of the spacecraft rustaveli was nervous anyhow and im not even a soldier he murmured to himself surprised at the way his heart was pounding the murmur was in georgian so that even if someone had been standing right beside him it would have been only a meaningless noise cant be too careful he thoughtsoldier or no the idea of disobeying orders was seriously scary he glanced around again still no sign of yuri of course not he told himself angrily he walked over to the radio turned it on found the frequency he needed hello athena tsiolkovsky calling he held the mike close to his lips spoke very softly hello athena athena here louise bragg the reply was likewise a whisper for rustaveli had turned the volume control down as far as he could and still hear the tape would still be there to damn him later but that was later now now curiosity rode louises voice your call is unscheduled tsiolkovsky whats going on the skarmer fleet is crossing jotun canyon thats what and oleg lopatin with them he has his friend kalashnikov along as i suggest you remember when you go to tell him hello thats all tsiolkovsky out he reached out to switch off the set his hand stopped just above the switch the dials had already gone dark by themselves his jaw clenched until his teeth ground against one another of all the times for a malfunction then he heard footsteps coming up the passageway voroshilov paused at the entrance to the control room he was shaking his head that was stupid shota mikheilovich he said stupid what was if rustaveli could brazen it out he would this damned radio seems to have gone out on us i was just checking it by calling the americans voroshilov was not asking a question rustaveli sagged i should have known the timing of the breakdown was too good yes you should have voroshilov agreed i hope i managed to kill the circuit before you blabbed too much but im not certain you did surprise me shota im so glad rustaveli muttered then one by one the implications of what had happened began to sink in you were monitoring me he said slowly with a dignity curious for one admitting such a thing voroshilov nodded which means rustaveli went on he had not really needed the nod you re kgb voroshilov nodded again but you will not mention that to anyone else shota mikheilovich not to anyone it is not relevant i would do this no matter what i was if i came by and found you at the radio why you hate lopatin rustaveli blurted he wondered how that was possible if they were both kgb he also wondered if it was even true or just a cover the two snoops used lopatin is a pig voroshilov said flatly that answered that rustaveli thought or at least proved yuri an actor as well as a chemist and a spy after a moment picking his words carefully voroshilov went on but he is also following the orders he received both from colonel tolmasov and from the rodina the motherland you have no business meddling with his mission no what if he or his pet minervan starts shooting at the americans yuri ivanovich one of them risked her neck to fly the canyon and help valery shall i repay that by not even warning them danger is coming their way voroshilov frowned he still looked as he always had quiet studious a little boyish and underneath it he was a chekist rustaveli thought he swore to himself never to judge by appearances again he may be going into danger too the chemist answered bragg would not tell sergei konstantinovich whether he was giving firearms to the minervans on the far side of jotun canyon had we been sure he isnt maybe lopatin could have stayed here as it is no would katya have wanted you to cut me off before this moment rustaveli would never have imagined kgb men susceptible to appeals to their feelings he could not imagine a chekist going home to a wife he loved to children perhaps and plopping down in a chair to complain about the hard day hed had but yuri was different damn it he had lived almost inside yuris socks for a lot more than a year now maybe he was a chekist but he was not a bad fellow and rustaveli would have bet anything anyone cared to name that he did love katerina i dont know he said now he was troubled rustaveli could see that but then he nodded toward the silent radio too late to worry about it at the moment though he walked back toward his laboratoryand presumably rustaveli thought toward his microphones and secret switches shit the georgian said he slammed a fist against the back of a chair the thing was padded and did not hurt shit he said again chip chip chip frank marquard went down on his knees so he could use his geologists hammer with greater precision he had not seen a conglomerate quite this finegrained before anything new and interesting deserved to be a specimen even through padding his knees began to freeze he sighed he was so sick of being cold as a lifelong inhabitant of los angeles he had had no practice living in a refrigerator he remembered somebody on the selection panel asking about that and remembered answering that it would not bother him he had known he was lying even then luckily the people on the panel had not pat was as californian as he but the cold didnt bother her as much or if it did frank thought frowning she didnt let on not so long ago that would not have occurred to him now he wasnt so sure what pat could hold back he hopedhe thoughthe was warming her up again in a very different sense of the word but he wasnt sure as he usually did he tried to make the best of that he supposed it was all to the good that he wasnt taking her for granted anymore boredom lay down that road out of the comer of his eye he saw something move he looked up where had the minervan come from what do you here male of reaturs clan he asked in the omalo tongue the male did not answer it came closer how frank wondered had it got below him without his noticing then he saw the spears in the minervans hands frank louise shouted over and over in athenas control room are you there come in frank bozhemoi oleg lopatin said softly when he saw the stained spears juksal was displaying the warrior was proud of himself he had a little hammer with him but he hardly even got it up before i struck him he raised the hand on the far side of his body showed the russian the geologists tool he had taken from the man hed slain bozhemoi lopatin said again the idea of going to war had been attractive in the abstract having a fellow human killed by a minervan though was not really what he had had in mind no matter how socially advanced the skarmer were dont let your eyestalks droop oleg borisovich fralk said youve told us how the humans on this side of the gorge are enemies to your great clan yes but sudden ghastly consequences flowered in lopatins mind the americans would assume he had killed their comrade with the situation reversed he would have jumped to the same conclusion when a man with a rifle was around who would think twice about natives and their spears scowling he thought furiously though the habit of secrecy was deeply grained into him he decided it could not serve him here he would have to let tsiolkovsky know what had happened and that he had had nothing to do with it he could not guess how far that would go toward mollifying the americans but nothing now could be worse than silence he thumbed the on switch of his radio brought it to his lips calling tsiolkovsky calling he began then he noticed the send light had not gone on when he switched to mwave no carrier wave hum no static came from the speaker hopelessly he peeled off the back of the set water gleamed on the integrated circuits inside he had tried to keep the radio dry crossing jotun canyon but its case was not waterproof who would have thought on frozen minerva it would have to be he dried the works as best he could tried again to send the radio was still dead of course it had taken a good many bangs too as he scrambled up toward the top of the canyon without tools he did not have he could not tell what was wrong with the cursed gadget if nothing obvious like a loose wire leapt out at him he could not fix anything more complicated than a loose wire either and this he asked himself bitterly makes you a modem electronic engineer the trouble was it did but that at the moment was the least of the trouble he was in and he knew it emmett bragg would be wild when he found out about his countrymans death and even tolmasov was leery of bragg you get him on the radio and you find out what the hell hes playing at do you hear me sergei konstantinovich bragg sounded like an angry tiger tolmasov thought he did not blame his american opposite number either i am calling brigadier bragg calling repeatedly i assure you but he does not reply neither does frank marquard what does that say to you nothing i like tolmasov admitted me either bragg growled near as i can see it says your mans gone rogue on this side of the canyon i dont like that sergei konstantinovich not one little bit you better believe ill do anything i need to to protect the rest of my crew anything dont say you werent warned i understand if tolmasov could have got lopatin in his sights he might have dealt with him himself youd better bragg out silence crashed down in the tent outside hograms town tolmasov sat storing at the radio for a minute or two before he got up the mission had gone so well for so long but when it decided to come apart it didnt fool around someone on tsiolkovskyrustaveli or voroshilov that had to becalling the americans and whoever had not called cutting him off in midsentence the pilot did not know whether to be angrier at caller or cutter and lopatin tolmasov still did not know what to make of that he did not want to think even a chekist could go out of control the moment he got off on his own but he did not know what else to think either the fools stubborn refusal to start or accept communication did not speak well of him the pilot turned to valery bryusov and katerina who had listened to his exchange with bragg with as much shock and dismay as he had felt comments he asked maybe just maybe one of them had seen something he had missed sergei we have a major problem katerina said bryusov nodded solemnly so after a moment did tolmasov the only trouble was he already knew that irv peered down into jotun canyon hed had the weight of a pistol on his hip before but now he really felt it the idea of using the gun on a minervan horrified him the idea of using it against an akt horrified him too for a different reasonhe was glad he had made a will before leaving earth by rights he thought trying to blend into the bushes this was emmett braggs job emmett was a soldier not an anthropologist playing pretend but emmett was also the pilotthe number one pilot and if the worst had happened to frank the only pilot he was not expendable as a scout the minervans down in the canyon did not look any different from reaturs males irv knew though that none of reaturs males were there these had to be the enemy thenthe skarmer the russians called them and oleg lopatin without the frantic call from tsiolkovsky irv would not have know which russian accompanied the skarmer over jotun canyon but a human beings jointed jerky motions were instantly recognizable against a backdrop of waving minervan arms and tentacles for one giddy moment irv hoped the human down there was frank but the americans did not wear fur hats how had the skarmer crossed anyhow irv let his binoculars sweep past the knot of natives to waters edge at first the round bowlshapes he saw there meant nothing to him then he realized they had to be boats they looked dreadfully small and flimsy to stack against the current in the canyon let alone the drift ice there maybe he thought the skarmer had not known the risk they were taking when they set out being too ignorant to worry about trouble had fueled a lot of human enterprises too too bad this one was aimed in his direction some of the skarmer began moving upslope seen through lenses the motion was magnified menacing irv scuttled backward even while the rational part of his mind insisted he was in no danger that did not stop his retreat it did make him keep the binoculars trained as he backed away the tight knot of minervans he had been watching broke up in the advance he saw what they had been gathered around frank marquards crumpled corpse the sight came as no surprise but it was like a kick in the belly all the same irv scrambled onto his bike and raced back toward athena ternat wished dordal had been budded as a mate so heno she he would have been this was almost as complicated as remembering half the humans were matescould have died young while budding six offspring as idiotic as himself reaturs eldest refused to perform the mental gymnastics he knew he needed to make the last arm of that sentence point in the same direction as the rest is this still our domain eldest or is it dordals one of the males with him asked ternat considered he had come this way earlier in the year trying to convince dordal that the skarmer threat was real all he had succeeded in doing was convincing dordal that reatur thought it was real and so could be raided with impunity still ours phelig he answered hoping he would make a better warleader than he had an envoy the males eyestalks drooped in disappointment then we have to leave that fence alone im afraid so ternat had had an eye or three on the enclosure too until he decided where they were dont worry it wont be long that proved even truer than he had expected the sun was falling west through clouds toward ervis gorge when the war band came upon a pen that had been thrown down snow had fallen since then to cover any tracks but ternat still caught the rancid stink of massi voidings he did not have to see to follow the trail it led north anything from here on we can take back with us either dordals males stole it from us or well steal it from them ternat shouted his comrades cheered no formal post marked the border between reaturs domain and dordals on either side of the border that was not marked though males knew who their clanfather was the ones on dordals side knew to run away when a large band of strangers came up from the south the scent trail grew stronger ternat began to wonder if he and his males were walking into a trap he doubted whether dordal had the wit to set one but one of the northern domain masters bright young malessay a male much like ternat might sure enough not long after the idea crossed ternats mind a male pointed casually toward a large boulder off to the side of the path just as casually reaturs eldest turned an eyestalk in that direction someone was peeking out at them lets go on a little ways and then rush back ternat said after a moments thought that way well stand between the spy and his friends so he wont be able to run to them as if unaware the males ambled past the boulder ternat swung an arm down shrieking brandishing their spears the raiding party reversed themselves and ran to catch the male who had been watching them take him alive ternat yelled we need answers had the spying male fled he would not have got far not with nine eighteens of warriors after him but he did not flee indeed ternat wondered if he could flee even after he widened himself in submission he was one of the thinnest males reaturs eldest had ever seen and one of the filthiest as well he was not blue with fear under his dirt though and ternat understood why a moment later when he cried out hurrah youve come to get the beasts back anticlimax ternat thought having been all keyed up to fight or pursue here he was greeted as a savior lowering his spearssurely there could be no harm in one starveling male he said back youre one of reaturs herders that i amelanti the massiherder at your service im glad you fellows came at last i was getting right hungry skulking around here sos i could keep one eyestalk on the animals i believe that ternat said phelig give him something to eat while elanti fed with every sign of ecstasy ternat quietly asked the warriors does anyone know if hes truly ours eyestalks writhed as the males stared at elanti and at one another a male named ollect whom fralk knew to be from the northern part of the domain said hes ours eldest hes been herding massi up here near the border for a long time a couple of other males spoke up in agreement elanti stopped gobbling for a moment and said reproachfully eldest eh reaturd know who i was without asking that ternat thought was probably true the domain master knows all sorts of things i must learn one day he answered hmm not stuck up about it anyway elanti popped yet another chunk of dried meat into his mouth when it was gone he said dordals thieves have my massi well suppose youd say reaturs massi but im the one herds emin a little valley not far from here along with some herds of their own theyve also got males posted on both sides of the trail there sos they can jump on anybody coming straight up to take them home again sounds like the cursed robbers ternat said forgetting he had been thinking it would take someone much like him to set an ambush theres more elanti said ive had a lot of eyestalks on the land hereabouts lately and a bit before then too ternat suspected he meant he had done some smuggling over the border he turned all his eyes away from elanti for a moment to show he did not care the herder sounded relieved as he went on happens i know a way that gets you round the far side of one of those bands you hit em from a direction theyre not expecting nip in and grab the beasts then deal with the other band yes ternat said slowly liking the scheme if youre right elanti the clanfather will make you rich for this and if youre wrong he did not add youll never betray anyone else again the herder ought to be able to figure that out for himself evidently he could dont much care about being rich he answered getting my massi back thats the important thing them and maybe a few of dordals better ones to pay me back for the trouble ive had maybe even more than a few youll get them ternat promised carefully not wiggling his eyestalks at the greed in elantis voice after all this was over he told himself detailing someone to watch the herder for a while would be a good idea elanti might have more stashed away somewhere than reatur did under the clan castle but all that was for later now he and the war band followed elanti away from the plain inviting trail of the massi toward the other path the herder said he had found lamra looked down at herself all around half the time she thought the six big bulges that almost hid her feet looked ridiculous the other half of the time she hardly noticed them they had been part of her so long that she was used to them she tried to remember what she had looked like before the budlings began to grow like any other mate she supposed it was hard to believe that when she stopped peering at herself she could see several nearby it was even harder to imagine she would ever look so straightupanddown again the humans kept saying she might but then humans were pretty hard to imagine too she had trouble playing now she who had once been among the swiftest and most agile mates because she had grown so clumsy and slow the others hardly tried to include her in their games anymore she wondered if the idea that she would probably not be around much longer also made them want to stay away from her she doubted it few mates could think far enough ahead to conceive of death as anything but a word she had trouble doing so herself she was not aware of a time when she had not been so would she not always be but she knew that no matter how things seemed the reality was that reatur unchanged so far as she could tell in the time she had been alive had been about the same long before that and she knew mates many mates had ended in the time since she had started paying attention to the world around her she could die too she looked at the piece of cured hide she held in one hand and at the marks written on it reatur knew she had this piece and did not mind more of the marks were beginning to make sense to her each one she learned made the rest easier to understand if she lived one day she would be able to read the door to the mates chambers opened reatur came through he looked fired lamra thoughthis eyestalks even his arms drooped he had not come to see the mates so often lately as before and when he did he was always tired the mates swarmed around him he had kind words for all of them as he usually did praise for peris scribbleswhich lamra thought did not look a thing like real writingan eyestalk wiggle of glee when some other mate in the crowdlamra could not see whothrew a ball that actually went in his direction lamra tried to wait for him to notice her she was at the edge of the group because she could not move quickly anymore and a lot of mates had dashed by to be with the domain master that made her angry and she was not very patient anyhow when she could not wait any longer she shouted reatur as loud as she could two of his eyestalks looked in her direction your turn will come little one he said and went on with what he was doing the promise kept her quiet a while longer then she shouted for him again soon reatur said more sharply this time lamra shifted from foot to foot to foot to foot to foot to foot finally when the domain master had talked with or cuddled the rest of the mates he turned his eyestalks toward her again now little one come with me and we will talk he led her off to one of the smaller chambers the other mates dispersed at first they had resented the special attention reatur gave lamra but now they were used to it they quickly got used to things that had once been strangehumans for instance lamra was much like her companions in that respect well little one reatur said what have you been doing since i saw you last she waved her piece of hide ive learned a lot more marks look this says that was the year so much ice melted that the roofdid something i dont know what this part means she pointed at the words that had defeated her heturned an eyestalk toward it fell in he told her thats very good lamra youve been working hard so have you she retorted or youd have come around more often to see me air hissed out of his breathing pores youre righti have and i would its he paused as if wondering whether to go on but at last he did its been difficult lamra responded more to his tone than to his words why are you sad reatur among other reasons because the humans still havent had any luck with mates from the herds and your budding time draws near he said i never wanted you to die lamra but finding hope that you might not and then seeing it fade is hard i dont want to die either reatur maybe i wont still but if i do well dont say it the domain master said and so lamra did not repeat the old saying about old mates after a moment the domain master went on aside from that dordals males have stolen some of our massi the skarmer have crossed ervis gorge in things the humans call boats and they or another different kind of human killed one of the ones we know and aside from that everything is fine lamra did not always recognize sarcasm it escaped her this time even had she caught it she would have paid it no mind not when it came along with reaturs other news a human dead she had not even been sure humans could die which one is dead she asked anxiously three of the strange creatures had become closer friends of hers than anybody save reatur the one called frank he answered lamra knew relief she had hardly even seen that one still she said how sad for the humans there were so few of them even before reatur angrily jerked his arms he started to turn yellow it will be sad for us if we cant push the cursed skarmer back down the gorge if this domain gets a new master a skarmer master your budlings will never live to grow up and youif you do live but we lose what would a skarmer chieftain make of you nothing good i tell you that lamra tried to keep herself from turning blue she hadnt thought about any of the things reatur had said and they all sounded terrifying we have to win then she said at last we will we have you and the skarmer dont even as she said that she saw herself greening up again reatur she was convinced could handle anything i wish it were that simple the domain master sighed i came to see you to get away from my worries and here ive given them to you instead youre brave for not fussing about them he widened himself to her then left before she could figure out how to respond the boom of the door closing after him sounded very final pat marquard stumbled as she walked toward the latest pennedeloc mate on the point of budding careful irv said he had said it several times alreadywherever her eyes were focused it was not on the ground under her feet sorry she answered her voice sounded far away she did not look at him sarah said gently its all right if you want to go back to the ship pat irv nodded thinking about how to reply brought pat back toward the hereandnow she shook her head if i dont have anything to do ill go even crazier than i am now id rather try to work than just sit and brood sarah glanced toward irv he nodded againhe would have said the same thing his wife shrugged they walked on irv wondered how much they were going to accomplish for one thing they hadnt kept a mate alive yet for another if the invaders from the west won the future for which they were trying to save lamra would prove depressingly short irv also thought about oleg lopatin tolmasov sounded as anxious to be rid of him as was everyone on athena he must have flipped out irv thought for the umptyumpth time that was very bad especially if some of the russians had been worried enough about him to try to warn the american ship and especially since he had his rifle with him irv did not want to go up against a kalashnikov not even with six pistolsno five now how are we going to fight back he asked sarah quietly so pat would not notice sarah only shook her head irv wondered whether that meant she didnt know or she didnt want to think about it now probably both the eloc mate in the pen was used enough to humans that it did not try to attack or waddle away as the three of them came up it only turned one extra eyestalk in their direction now we wait sarah said grimly by the look of things irv thought they would not have to wait long the eloc mate bulged like a fat lady trying to explode out of a spandex suit irv had learned though that as with pregnant women appearances could be deceiving once they had spent three cold days waiting for a mate to drop her budlings only to come back the next morning to find the small eloca scampering about the pen and the mate dead waiting had been easier then beforebefore frank died irv told himself firmly he did not know oleg lopatin had killed him it was however a lot likelier than anything else he could think of and no matter how frank had died he was dead now and pat no longer the bantering companion she had been she kept pacing back and forth in the pen with that distant look in her eyes sometimes she answered when irv or sarah spoke to her sometimes she didnt the other two couldnt just talk with each other either not with her there time stretched endlessly after what seemed like six weeks but was in fact two and a half hours sarah who had been peering and poking at the eloc mate so often it wasnt even resentful anymore abruptly stood up straight the skin is starting to split lets get ready irv squatted next to the eloc mate two arms around it on sarahs left pat came more slowly and squatted with two arms around the eloc on sarahs fight so the three humans were equally spaced around it well try it a little differently this time sarah said reminding them of what they were about instead of just trying to bandage those bleeders were going to shut em off here she passed two large surgical clamps to irv two more to pat as soon as the budlings drop off clamp the protruding blood vessel stumps youll need both hands for the job so dont try to do em both at once do one then the other quick as you can without making a mistake the way the blood comes gushing out a whole lot of fumbling and youll be too late to do much good remembering how biyal had bled out remembering how he had watched several eloc and massi mates pour their blood onto the groundand onto himirv knew his wife was fight he opened and closed a clamp several times the eloc grew placidresigned was the other word that crossed irvs mind though he knew that was anthropomorphizingas the budding process went on the split in the skin above each bud grew longer and longer soon irv saw the wet legs and bottoms of the two budlings in front of him the legs were already wiggling as if the newborn eloc were preparing to hit the ground running soon now sarah breathed irv glanced over at her for a split second suppressing a grinshe was nervously opening and closing a clamp too veterinary ob was not what she had studied in med school she did not notice him soon she said again irv saw she was right now just about all of each budling was visible he could see the blood vessels between their eyestalks that connected them to the mate could see the much bigger vessels around which their mouths were sealed the big ones were the ones he had to worry about the bleeding from the others could be handled sarah thought so anyhow and irv had nothing but respect for his wifes judgment as it had before the moment came without warning one instant the budlings were still attached to the mate the next they were at irvs feet doing their best to get in his way the mates blood fountained out irv had practiced what he was going to do countless times back on athena grabbing and clamping a piece of rubber tube though was not nearly enough like reaching for a blood vessel when spurting gore not only made it hard for him to see what he was doing but also froze his fingers as it splashed over and between them the last time he had done such blind groping he thought he had been fifteen and had gotten slapped for it he let out a grunt of triumph as his left hand closed round the big soft pulsing vessel he squeezed hard the flow slowed he slapped on the clamp he felt like shoutingthe vessel was sealed but no time for shouts how much blood had the mate already lost where the other budling had dropped free too much only one way to find out he leaned grabbed and after a few desperate fumbling seconds clamped then he had a chance to look up sarah had finished her part of the task just seconds before him that made him feel proud he was very much an amateur at this sort of thing but then with minervans so was everyone seeing him finished sarah said nice and quick good we just may get a live mama out of this yet she raised her voice a little how you doing pat again hesitation then pat answered ive got the first one just about clamped ill go to the other as fast as i can oh hell sarah exclaimed she scrambled over to pats side give me that irv went around the eloc mate to see if he could do anything to help his face fell when he saw the size of the pool of blood under the vessel sarah was finally clamping he could not imagine how any animal earthly or minervan could lose so much and live and sure enough the eloc mate was sagging its arms and eyestalks going limp in a pattern he had seen too many times before sarah recognized that too she looked at the elocthe dead elocand at the clamp in her hand she threw the clamp down hard on the frozen ground it bounced away im sorry pat said miserably i just cant i know sarah said nothing to be done about it but she could not help adding really had hopes for this though now we may not get another chance to test it beforebefore the real thing having a success behind us would have been nice oh well she looked around to see where the clamp had gone walked over to it picked it up irv undid the five they had managed to place on the eloc mate only a few more drops of blood dribbled out as he freed each one the mate was empty he said we might as well head back to athena head down pat walked a few paces apart from her two companions sarah said low voiced maybe i should show a minervan what to do a male would probably be more reliable than pat is right now i dont blame her but i know irv thought about it after a few seconds he shook his head not a good idea he said as quietly as sarah as far as i can tell none of the males but reatur and maybe ternat would react well to the idea of helping mates survive too far outside their mental horizons if he didnt think lamra was special i doubt reatur would let us go on either and right now ternat isnt here and reatur has problems of his own sarah finished for him she sighed dont we all viii minervan summer days were not bad not for someone used to moscow weather as oleg lopatin was minervan nights were something else again almost always ten below celsius or worse every night reminded lopatin of his military snowsurvival course that he was in the middle of an armed camp now only brought the memory into sharper focus fralks forces battered and scattered by the crossing of jotun canyon were back together now as much as they ever would be the omalo had not struck at them tomorrow with luck the skarmer would be out of the immense canyon altogether and up onto fiat ground lopatin did not plan to be with them helping the skarmer win the war against their neighbors to the east maybe squeezing off half a clip at any americans foolish enough to try to help the feudal omalo resist the ineluctable logic of the historical dialectic all that would be wonderful so long as he did it step by step in contact with tsiolkovsky then he would be not only one of the instruments through which the dialectic unfolded but also carrying out soviet policy as defined before he headed east with fralks army losing his radio changed everything any soviet officer who took matters into his own hands asked for trouble and usually got it if he showed hostility toward athenas crew without being hooked into the chain of command that could authorize such behavior he knew exactly what would happen the americans would scream bloody murder they were probably screaming bloody murder already about frank marquard moscow would say would have to say that lopatin had been sent across jotun canyon purely as an observer all the blame would land right on his shoulders he could see it coming just as he had seen that mountain of ice bearing down on his coracle as he had done in the coracle he intended to get away now he only saw one course that might let that happen and he hated it but if he yielded himself up to the americans and told them how marquard had died he might put out for his own benefit the line he expected from moscow as far as his actions went all he needed to do was tell the truth unfortunately though as a kgb man he knew for how little the truth often counted the skarmer slept all around him in an earthly camp fires would have lit his wayand let sentries see him the minervans had no fires they liked the weather fine lopatin knew they had set sentries with luck he could evade them in the dark he slid out of his sleeping bag quietly rolled it up and stuffed in into his pack he slung his rifle over his shoulder he wanted to carry it but knew he might need both hands free shooting his way to freedom would surely fail anyhow even if it didnt it would wreck the soviet mission but he missed the comfort of having the kalashnikov ready to fire he slipped through the slumbering natives going in the right direction was easy even in the darkness any way uphill was right he wondered how he would ever get back across jotun canyon to return to tsiolkovskyafter abandoning the skarmer here he would not be popular among them perhaps it would not matter with marquard dead the americans would have the supplies to let him fly home aboard athena home no to fly back to earth he doubted he could ever go home again times had changed since the great patriotic war when so many soviet soldiers earned time in the gulag merely for seeing what western europe was like they had not changed so much however that a kgb man could expect to be greeted with open arms after being debriefed by the cia as lopatin knew he would be he wanted to laugh he wanted to cry he wanted to swear he was a good party man and a loyal soviet citizen and he knew he would have to defect very slowly he kept creeping out of the skarmer camp finally after what seemed forever the skarmer began to thin out lopatin no longer had to pay attention to his every footstep for fear of falling over a native he could move faster now the wind picked up clouds scudded by one of the minervanmoonslopatin had no idea which oneshone through a break in the cover overhead far fainter than earthly moonlight it was better than the nearblackness he had known before he picked up the pace again the moonlight also let a skarmer sentry spot motion he might otherwise have missed halt the male called who goes lopatin froze too latethe sentry had already picked up the alien quality of the way he moved the human the human is running away the minervan screamed that did it lopatin thought hearing hubbub break out behind him as the outcry jerked warriors from sleep this way this way the sentry shouted swearing now in good earnest the kgb man ran that way dont panic he told himself the terrain gave him plenty of cover he dashed from boulder to boulder keeping low trying not to give that cursed sentry another glimpse of him the minervan moon stayed visible where moments before he had been glad to see it now he wished it into the hottest pits of hell he scuttled over to yet another rock and paused listening most of what he heard from the camp was chaos but not all some males were moving purposefully after him calling as they came he shivered in his latest hiding place not even his darkest nightmares included pursuit by a pack of screaming maenads they were getting closer too terrifyingly fast that alarmed him in a way different from their banshee crieshe had swerved away from his earlier direction of travel away from where the sentry spied him yet the minervans somehow still tracked him he found out how a moment later when the warriors drew close enough for him to make sense of some of their shouts no fool one male yelled to another the scent trail leads this way scent lopatin was up and running again in an instant hiding would do him no good if the minervans did not need to see him to find him the kgb had cooked up a dozen stenches to throw dogs off the track they would have been of more use to lopatin had they been on the same planet as he was he was tempted to turn around and fire a couple of clips into the warriors behind him that would drive them off he knew what he did not know was what would happen to his crewmates ifno whensomeone from here got back across jotun canyon with word that he had opened fire and so he hesitated and suffered the usual fate of those who hesitate a minervan sprang out from in back of a rock either fralk had shouted orders at the beginning of the chase or the warrior was uncommonly wise about firearms the first thing he did was smash the rifle out of lopatins hand with a spear it clattered to the ground and rolled away lopatin dove after it the minervan jumped on him the spear had fallen too even so it was not much of a fight lopatin got in a kick that made the warrior wail but the minervans fingerclaws stabbed through clothes to pierce the kgb mans flesh one scored his cheek and missed his eye by only a couple of centimeters by then other males were rushing up human we all have spears one shouted we will use them if you do not yield lopatin went limp the male he had been wrestling with cautiously disengaged good idea he said when he was convinced the fight was gone from his foe you almost kicked my insides outthose cursed funny big legs you humans have he sounded more professionally interested than angry after a moment lopatin recognized juksals voice here is his strange weapon a male said from a few meters away good juksal said hang on to that we need it we need it more than we need him without their fancy tools these humans arent so dangerous if any minervan had the right to say that lopatin thought dully juksal did he wished none of them had the right wishing did not help prodding him along with spears the warriors led him back toward the camp they met fralk before they got there oleg borisovich have you gone mad the minervan demanded hearing the question in russian only made lopatin feel worse nyet was all he said then what excited or upset people waved their arms in the air so did excited or upset minervans having three times as many arms as a human being fralk looked three times as excited or upset he sounded that way too politics human politics i am sorry fralk but i cannot help you anymore against the omalo or the americans the kgb man expected fralk to get even more upset perhaps to threaten all sorts of torture he would have standing where fralk was instead the minervan wiggled his eyestalks with a peculiar rhythm lopatin had not seen before he said just what juksal had oleg borisovich it no longer matters whether or not you help us we have your rifle we have your bullets we do not need you he was still speaking russian for the benefit of the warriors standing around he translated his words into the skarmer tongue they all wiggled their eyestalks that same strange way so now lopatin thought i know how minervans laugh a nasty laugh it was one bit of knowledge he would just as soon have been without reatur had never seen more than half an eighteen of skarmer at one time before if he never saw even another one again that would suit him fine altogether too many of them were coming up to the rim of ervis gorge now straight at him he peered down at them the gorges slope grew shallower at the top the warriors were approaching almost as quickly as if they had been on flat ground but the ground was not fiat as soon as the skarmer drew a little nearer they would find out why he had let them come so close to getting out of the gorge before he dealt with them which one was fralk the domain master wanted to smash him personally but he decided reluctantly he could not let the skarmer get close enough for him to tell them apart they were still well out of spear range especially uphill that was fine with reatur he did not need spears to smash them ready warriors he called up and down his line males shouted and waved their arms to show they were then shove the domain master yelled the omalo had spent the last few days dragging as many large stones as they could to the edge of ervis gorge now by ones twos threes sixes they stood behind the stones at reaturs command they strained against them pushed them down into the gorge the slope was shallow some of the boulders just skidded briefly others turned over one or twice then fetched up against rocks sticking up from the ground and stopped but still others picked up speed crashed into the ranks of the skarmer the omalo shouted again watching row upon row of their enemies go down in writhing heaps dont just stand there reatur shouted more stones but as the males swarmed back to the next piles of stones something dreadful happened it was so far outside the domain masters experience that at first he did not fully grasp it he saw flashes of light coming from a male in the front rank of the skarmer heard a loud barking roar unlike anything he had known before something went craaack past an arm and somewhere not far away males reaturs males were falling down and screaming he and his warriors all of whom were seeing and hearing the same things took a long terrible moment to understand that all those strange terrible things were eyestalks of the same beast for reatur the realization came when he saw a human near the male from whom the flashes of light and the terrible noise were coming he had never seen the humans he knew using anything like thisweapon he supposed it wasbut it was too strange to have come from his own people or even from the skarmer compared to humans he thought surprised at himself the skarmer were closest kin if humans had weapons they would be strange too strange and deadly a male not two steps from reatur was on the ground thrashing the domain master saw that he had a hole in him the sort a spear might give between two of his arms as reatur watched the male voided bloodily and stopped moving craaack anotherwhatever it waswhizzed by reatur he heard a wet slapping noise a male behind him started to shriek it all happened in the same instant the domain master pointed to the skarmer with the weapon get him he shouted get him more stones rumbled down one just missed the human another would have smashed the male with the weapon had it not kicked up and flown over his eyestalks the skarmer kept right on wielding it though and reaturs males kept going down more stones reatur yelled more more his males heaved against a few more boulders others though stayed where they were for the omalo who should have pushed them into ervis gorge were running back toward reaturs castle in a way the domain master did not blame them he wanted to run away too especially since a male died or was horribly wounded almost every time the strange weapon flashed and barked and now the rest of the skarmer encouraged both because of their foes dismay and because they were no longer being pelted so heavily reached the rim of the gorge they were eager reaturs males even the ones who had not fled were wavering off to one side the skarmer who had already gained the flatlands were starting to swing round to cut reaturs males off from the way back if they could manage that they could surround and destroy them at their leisure even without their cursed weapon with it reatur did not like to think about what would happen with it back he shouted hating himself for it but seeing no better course he quickly added another command he hoped his males would obey keep your order as you go most of them did and to his relief the skarmer let them escape why not the domain master thought bitterly theyll already done what they needed to do reatur tried to stay optimistic he thought about how much his avalanche had battered the invaders enoph tramped by he said just what reatur was thinking we hurt them aye the domain master sighed he could not afford the luxury of wishful thinking not now but they hurt us worse they beat us enoph and right now i have no idea how to keep them from beating us again what are we going to do sarah hated having to rely on emmett bragg making a career soldier mission commander had always struck her as part and parcel of the washington mindset about extraterrestrial intelligence which she was convinced had been formed by too many bad science fiction moviesaliens had to be enemies therefore had to be fought therefore a soldier should be in charge simple simpleminded too but now the crew of athena found itself in the middle of a war the aliens werent all enemies some of them had become good friends they were better friends certainly than oleg lopatin ever would be and oleg lopatins akt had killed and maimed more of them than she liked to think about her medical training had not prepared her for war wounds they were as ghastly on minervans as on people not just for themselves but because they were deliberately inflicted so she turned to emmett having him in charge suddenly looked like a good idea after all the trouble was instead of instantly coming up with an answer that would solve their problems he only scowled and said what are we going to do i dont see too much we can do right now maybe the best thing to hope for is that old oleg didnt bring that many spare clips for his rifle sarah felt her lips tighten that wasnt what she wanted to hear she said in your cubicle he grinned at her put her offstride what do you know about that havent hardly coaxed you in there will you shut up the heat of her fury amazed her picking her words carefully saying them even more carefully she went on in your cubicle there is a cabinet you keep locked i thought that perhaps i had an armalite stashed away therea rifle he amended quickly seeing that she did not follow she gave him reluctant credit for being all business once more or maybe a crate of grenades trouble is i dont sarah set hands on hips well what the hell do you keep in there then she was furious at him all over again this time for having her hopes dashed this and that he said she thought that meant he wasnt going to tell her but he did a little some real special codes for one thing the kind you hope you never have to usei mean theres a lot worse things could go wrong than one crazy russian like for instance sarah asked genuinely curious like the whole crew of tsiolkovsky attackin us on purpose when we set out remember we didnt know how far apart we were from them or like the natives bein hightech after all just without radio on account of theyre telepaths or some stupid thing and overrunnin athena theyd have to be ready back home then in case we had somethin happen out of invaders from minerva in spite of herself sarah giggled stupid damn movie she said having watched it on tv at least two dozen times since she was a kid a latefifties lowbudget scifi classic turkey it featured minervanswho looked nothing like real minervansremarkable chiefly because the zippers in their costumes were visible in several scenes every so often coming up with something silly like that emmett could surprise her and remind her that he was human too isnt it he said now quietly laughing himself ill tell you what i wish i had in there and its got nothin to do with guns and such he waited for sarah to raise an eyebrow then went on i wish i had a couple o bottles o good sippin whiskey put away for celebrating gettin down here gettin back home he paused studied her in that way she found alarming and attractive at the same time maybe sharin a little now and again hmm was all she said she was damned if she would encourage him doesnt matter anyhow he said when he decided that was the only response hed get nasa doesnt understand that sippin whiskey is for sippin if you know what i mean when i put the idea to em they just reckoned i wanted to get lit when you what there was about as much likelihood of nasa bureaucrats okaying a couple of fifths of jim beam she thought as there was of dying of heatstroke on minerva my god the manifest might leak out one day and then somebody could kiss a career goodbye if anybody could see that it was emmett he had boundless contempt for all bureaucracies save the military for all sarah knew he had asked about the bourbon just to give the threepiecesuit boys fits that was his style she expected him to chuckle and own up to twisting nasas tail just for the fun of it instead she saw with a thrill of alarm that he had what she thought of as his snipers face back on behind his eyes he was taking dead aim at something after a moment she realized it wasnt her or was it get lit he said dreamily that just might work now he was focused on her sharply what might work she demanded i hate it when people think through things and then leave out all the interesting parts when they start talking its like she started to say sex without foreplay but decided that might not be a good idea i hate it she finished bragg nodded cant say i blame you he spent the next several minutes explaining by the time he was done sarah wished she hadnt asked she knew that was stupid as soon as emmett got this brainstorm he would have come to her with it the real trouble was it made too much sense for her to tell him he was crazy but when he said you know im jealous as hell she had all she could do not to reach up and bust him fight in his grinning chops she probably would have had it not been so obvious that he meant it fralk watched the latest raiding party come in from the north they were leading enough massi and eloca to keep the skarmer army fed for a couple of days well squeeze the omalo domain until reaturs eyes pop off their stalks fralk declared grandly his warriors cheered as the beasts complaining every step of the way passed through the gaps in the barricade of frozen snow other males highranking by virtue of their closeness to hogrambut none so close as fralk spoke up in loud and prompt agreement then someone said may the domain come down with the purple itch when are we going to take out the cursed omalo army sudden silence fell the officers edged away from the male who had spoken as if they wanted to show they had nothing to do with his words it was juksal fralk saw what rank he had sprang only from his ability to fight and fight and fight and stay alive still he had a great deal of that abilityand he had kept the human from escaping thus fralk spoke firmly but politely by plundering the domain juksal we also weaken the army you know juksal grunted beat the army and the domain is ours no matter what we do to the domain the omalo army can take it back if they beat us we should have crushed them just as soon as we fought our way out of the gorge do you recall the state we were in when we made it out of the gorge fralk asked indignantly those accursed boulders almost wrecked us altogether in spite of the rifle he pulled in arms and eyestalks at the memory the omalo were worse juksal retorted otherwise they wouldnt have run from us we should have chased em and slaughtered em instead of letting em get away to have another chance at us all in good time fralk saw his skin begin to take on the yellow tint of anger with an effort of will he made himself turn green again he would not let juksal make him angry now that the warrior was under his command instead of the other way aroundthat ghastly endless series of drills with spears and shields he could listen or ignore as he pleased and now he was pleased to ignore in a few more days when we are fed rested and otherwise recovered from the ordeal just past we will sally forth and put an end to the omalo once and for all juksal had the stubborn rudeness fralk would have expected from someone who could find nothing better than fighting with which to make his way through life the omalo will be feeding and resting and recovering too eldest of eldest in his mouth fralks title was a reproach when fralk started to turn yellow this time he did nothing to try to hide his feelings yes juksal i am eldest of eldest he said proudly i am also commander of this army remember that please moreover as commander i have just won a victory remember that too you may have won it juksal said but you dont know what to do with it warrior juksal you are dismissed fralk shouted he was yellow as the sun now juksal widened himself a salute as sardonic as his use of fralks title still widened the veteran waddled away but he could not resist having the last word theres humans here too remember he shouted back what if they have rifles too what then commander resuming his full height he tramped off what then fralk did not like to think about that but lopatin had said the humans over here probably did not have rifles the human juksal had killed certainly was without one or the warrior never would have gotten close enough to use a spear still fralk trusted lopatins word much less than he had before the human tried to escape and probably was a far more reassuring word on the other side of ervis gorge than here here being wrong would kill a lot of males all the more reason then for proceeding slowly and carefully fralk thought otherwise he might run the army into a krongs nest before he found out the beast was there he remembered how tolmasovs rifle had riddled the krong back on the west side of ervis gorge what would have happened though had the krong had a rifle too hit them now ternat shouted his males cried reatur and rushed through the brush toward dordals waiting warriors they yelled back the snorts and whistles of the massi ternats band had already freed only added to the din this time ternat thought as he drew near the enemy his warriors lacked the advantage of surprise they had just finished smashing one half of dordals wouldbe ambush and sent the survivors fleeing to warn the other half ternat wished dordals warriors were like humans blind to half the world around them were that so none of the first batch of males might have escaped as it was reaturs eldest was happy enough with himself because people were as they were surprise attacks were hard to pull off but dordals males had been surprised sure enough when the war band came crashing through the undergrowth at them a good three out of every eighteen had turned blue and thrown down their spears ternats warriors had some of them back with the massi even the ones who hadnt turned craven also had not fought well most of them then ternat had no more time for reflection spears were flying out toward his males and from them back at dordals this second band was larger than the one his warriors had already smashed and better situated too with several large boulders giving dordals males almost the protection of a wall if they stayed back there they would have an edge some did more did not as was true of the band ternat led most of dordals warriors were young males with more temper than sense they charged to do battle with their southern neighbors along with reaturs name the war band also shouted thieves dordals males screamed insults back at them why arent you hiding in the chambers under your castle waiting for the skarmer one of them yelled ternat froze and almost took a spear in the gut because of it but he had heard that voice before thats dordal himself he cried get him and we bring a lot more than massi home the warriors surged forward now fewer spears were in the air and more clutched tight between males fingerclaws one of dordals warriors thrust at ternat he turned the stroke aside with his shield tilting it upward as he had been drilled he thrust back low the male managed to get a shield down to block that spear but left himself open for ternats other one he wailed as reaturs eldest drove it home and bled like a mate when ternat pulled it free ternat and another warrior engaged one of dordals males from three arms apart the beset male was good but not good enough to resist for long two foes attacking from opposite directions he went down briefly yammering a rock grazed ternat just below one arm he swore twisted an eyestalk so he could look down at himself he wasnt bleeding or swelling up too badly he decided he would live he looked around for another male to take on there werent any not close the bravado that had fed that first rush from dordals warriors faded as they found ternats war band meant businessand had more males than their own force even the chance to gain glory by excelling where the domain master could see them was not enough the northern males gave ground this is harder work than stealing massi that cant fight back isnt it ternat shouted dordals males were less interested in returning taunts now more concerned with finding safety behind their heap of boulders for a moment they made a stand there but the rocks proved an insufficient barricade one of ternats malesphelig he saw it waskilled a warrior in the gap between two stones and then took control of it for himself his fellows swarmed after him into the breach then ternats warriors forced their way through another opening that proved too much for their foes some surrendered others fled dordal was one of those who tried to run when three of ternats males dragged him to the ground the last fight went out of his warriors get their spears and other weapons and see to the wounded ternat said as his warriors began to obey he walked slowly over to dordal that bruise he had taken started to hurt he had forgotten all about it till now as reaturs eldest had remembered dordal was a large imposinglooking male very much the opposite of elanti the massiherder even standing tall he was so well fed he looked widened his eyestalks however were at the moment drooping dispiritedly he raised one eye a little to see who was coming up he did not widen himself though ternat saw that he recognized him domain master you made a mistake he said giving dordal the courtesy of a title he knew his captive might not enjoy much longer what are you doing here ternat dordals voice was still proud but confusedhe hadnt changed much since the embassy ternat thought i would think that was obvious domain masterwe are taking back what is ours if you hadnt crossed the border we wouldnt have come since you did reaturs eldest let dordal draw his own conclusions those as was characteristic of the northern domain master were bizarre i think you were lying about the skarmer this whole time to lure me into raiding you without enough males dordal sounded thoroughly indignant ternat thought dordal was a fool but then he had thought that for a long while im afraid your greed made you stretch your eyestalks further than your arms would reach he said dordal started to turn yellow ternats eyestalks twitched dordal quickly greened up again even he was not so stupid as to show his captor he was angry what will you do with me he asked take the lot of you back to our domain i suppose ternat said he hadnt thought much about that he hadnt expected to win such a complete victory reatur will decide in the end if i had to guess ill say hes likely to let you go back home after your eldest pays enough ransom to remind you not to trifle with us again he waited for dordals reaction it did not disappoint him this time dordal turned yellow in earnest my eldest he shouted grevil wont pay a strip of dried meat for me let that grabby budling loose among my treasures and mates and hell want to keep everything for himself maybe dordal did have some sense that confirmed ternats impression of the northern domain masters eldest it also confirmed that grevil was his fathers budling dordal ternat was certain would have done exactly the same thing in grevils place well well just let reatur sort that out ternat said perhaps if grevil doesnt grant you the respect and obedience a clanfather deserves reatur will send some males north to help you reclaim your domainafter the skarmer are settled of course i dont care a threedayold massi voiding about the skarmer dordal howled and if i get my domain back with help from reaturs males there will be cords running from his arms to mine forever after yes there will wont there ternat agreed cheerfully maybe you should have thought about that before you decided to go massiraiding as it is youll have some lovely threedayold voidings to look at as we travel back to my clanfathers domain dordal twisted all his eyestalks away from ternat reaturs eldest did not care how petulant dordal felt while the northern domain master was not looking he walked away dordal started to talk again he abruptly fell silent when he turned one eyestalk back and noticed that no one was listening to him ternat didnt care about that either he was shouting to his own warriors now getting them back into some kind of order so they could lead their prisoners and the rec aptured beasts home without half escaping in the process ternat did not have three eighteens of plans for overthrowing his clanfather his time would come one day until then he was content to wait and that he supposed only went to show that he was reaturs budling good enough he said out loud sergei tolmasov watched rustaveli lean back in his chair as usual the georgian was wearing a mischievous expression he said i doubt much work is getting done aboard tsiolkovsky at the momentnot much that involves the brain anyway unless yuri is reading katya some of his poetry he had just brought the rover back to hograms town after katerina drove it down to the ship not much work getting done here either tolmasov said not rising to the bait you my friend are entirely too serious as ive said at least a hundred times at least tolmasov agreed rustaveli snorted that does not mean he is wrong shota mikheilovich valery bryusov put in he often had trouble recognizing a joke no it doesnt the pilot said because there isnt much getting done here he had never imagined he could become irrelevant during the minerva mission but he had he didnt like it one bit damn oleg lopatin athena was screaming at washington and almost incidentally now at tolmasov washington was screaming at moscow and moscow not incidentally at all was screaming at tolmasov he could not even blame any of them had he been any place in the loop but where he was he would have been screaming too but he had no one to scream at not when lopatin wouldnt use his cursed radio he couldnt even ask hogram to send on a written message for one thing the local domain master was barely in communication with his army on the far side of jotun canyon crossing that stream was almost as hard for the minervans as getting to minerva had been for the soviet union and united states for another problems between people meant nothing to hogram because hogram had talked with the omalo domain master on the radio he had to acknowledge there were more humans than the ones he had met but he simply did not believe in a whole planet full of them all at each others throats because one man had gone berserk given what hogram knew tolmasov wouldnt have believed it either unfortunately it was true and so the crew of tsiolkovsky went through the motions of doing more research bryusov comparing country and town dialects rustaveli working on his rocks katerina and voroshilov joining together on a biochemical study none of it seemed to mean much now yuri isnt sorry lopatins gone and got himself in this mess rustaveli observed then why did he cut you off when you called the americans tolmasov answered his own question because his head might roll too i suppose if anyone back homeas polite a euphemism as he had ever come up with for the kgbthought hed overhead you and done nothing but i daresay youre right because of katya if for no other reason there are others rustaveli said slowly the pilot glanced over at him he rarely sounded so serious seeing he had tolmasovs attention the geologist went on yuri complained that lopatin snooped through the poems he wrote for her and stored them in his secret computer file evidence i imagine but only a chekist could say of what id hate a man for that too tolmasov said and i bryusov agreed though tolmasov had trouble imagining bryusov worked up enough about anything to hate the man who did it maybe if an academician from arkhmolinsk stole something from one of his papers and published it first anyone would be furious over that kind of pilfering then the full meaning of rustavelis words got through to the pilot wait a minute he said how does yuri know theyre in lopatins secure file how else rustaveli put a flippant shrug in his voice he read them thats impossible tolmasov had tried to access lopatins secure file tried and failed if the pilot of a mission was not trusted with the passwords he needed to get into a kgb mans files what were the odds a chemist would be there was no way no there was one rustaveli was waiting when tolmasov looked up the geolgian nodded thats right he said but you will notice i have not told you any such thing like that eh no of course you havent shota mikheilovich but yuri who ever would have thought that about yuri shota hasnt what bryusov asked who would have thought what about yuri the linguist sounded as confused as if his companions had started speaking navajo never mind valery aleksandrovich nothing important tolmasov said kindly some people he thought were really too innocent to be running around loose his feeling of smug superiority lasted not quite two minutes then he remembered he had thought the same thing about yuri voroshilov he shook his head sometimes you just couldnt tell are you all right reatur lamra asked when the domain master finally got around to paying attention to her them though she had little to complain about he hurried through his hellos to the rest of the mates so he could spend uninterrupted time with her if he had looked tired before now he looked tired and battered one of his arms jerked when he sighed a wince that showed he had been hurt ive been better little one he answered the domain has been better come to that the skarmer beat us beat us badly she saw herself start to turn blue and tried to stop but couldnt what will we do she said we reatur asked gently lamra right now there isnt much you can do i wish there were as for me i am going to fight them again maybe here closer to the castle closer to where most of my males live they will make a better showing what if they dont the domain master pulled in arms and eyestalks released them a shrug then we wont have to fight a third time thats certain do you understand what i mean lamra thought about it well have lost she didnt want to say that she didnt even want to think it but reatur seemed to approve thats right he said your thoughts should always be thin clear ice lamra so you can use them to see through to whats there no matter what it is if you dont think clearly its like trying to look through muddy ice oh lamra said she wanted to show reatur she could use what he was telling her then are you going to show me why you havent opened one of your hands since you came into the mates chambers do you have something in there is it for me his eyestalks wiggledslowly but they wiggled thin clear ice indeed little one yes i have something for you in that hand he turned so it was in front of her she held out a hand of her own he gave her the present she peered down at it with three eyestalks at once its a runnerpest she exclaimed a little runnerpest carved all out of wood its wonderful reatur thank you she felt proud for remembering to say that where did you get it did you carve it yourself yes he said he hesitated as if unsure whether to go on but after a moment he did i wanted you to have something to remember me by even ifthe worst happens ill keep it always lamra promised then wanting him to know she was still thinking clearly she amended for as long as i have anyhow for you thats always reatur said firmly i suppose so lamra kept looking at the little runnerpest im going to poke this around a corner and scare peri silly with it not that she isnt silly already that is no matter how hard she worked at it staying serious was never easy this time reaturs laugh was unrestrained im glad i came to see you little one one way or another you always make me feel better he turned an eyestalk down toward her bulges do you want to hear something foolish lamra i dont think you can be foolish clanfather she declared that only shows how young and foolish you are still reatur said i was just thinking its a shame youre carrying budlings id like to plant them on you now that is foolish lamra agreed once reatur had succeeded in planting budlings on her her interest in mating once so intense disappeared she did her best to think like a male altogether unsure how well she was succeeding she said there are lots of other mates here i know reatur said it wouldnt be the same somehow planting buds on you now would be like likethe domain master sounded like someone groping after an idealike mating with a friend he stopped in surprise that must be what the humans do with their mates who live as long as males it would be comforting i think especially in bad times i suppose so lamra said indifferently but the notion reatur had presented was so strange she couldnt help thinking about it if the humans keep me alive after my budlings drop will i want to mate with you again that seemed to surprise reatur all over again i truly dont know lamra if were all very very lucky maybe well find out sometimes you just cant tell pat irv felt like an idiot the moment the words were out of his mouth but he was lucky pat wasnt listening to him she was off in that disconnected place where she had spent so much time since frank hadnt answered his last radio call his wife glanced toward him and pat toward athena toward reaturs castle i dont think that eloc mate is ever going to drop its budlings sarah said they had checked the mate five times in the last two days it looked ready but it wasnt doing anything im going over to the castle to examine lamra again sarah went on i just keep hoping she can hang on until we know we have some real chance of doing her some good irv shrugged i think ill head back to the ship im hungry okay sarah and irv both paused waiting for pat to decide what she was going to do she paused too as if rerunning a tape of the last few seconds in her head so that she could catch up with what was going on then she said i guess ill go back to the ship too make sure she eats something sarah told irv he thought about asking her whether she was speaking as doctor or jewish mother but keeping his mouth shut seemed smarter a nod couldnt land him in trouble but his big mouth had many times already sarah headed for the castle pausing once to wave before she trudged on again come on irv said to pat again there was that delayed response but less this time than before she followed him to athena emmett bragg met them just inside the airlock bout time somebody showed up here he grumbled his pistol was belted on irv would have bet he had been pacing the corridor dont want to leave the ship empty and i need to go out and scout the route the skarmerll be using when they finally decide to get moving again wont be long now i suspect wheres louise irv asked braggs eyes flicked to pat shesout he said irv thought unkind thoughts about his mouth as he remembered louise was out because she was doing some seismographic work that wouldshouldhave been franks pat luckily didnt make the connection dont get too close to the skarmeror to oleg lopatin irv said dont forget youre our ride home emmett grimaced dont remind me i know i have to be a good boy but i dont have to like it he hurried out through the airlock not bothering to hide his impatience to be gone things had been dull for him since athena landed irv thought air force pilots were adrenaline junkies from the word go well emmett had his fix now irv turned back to pat lets see what we can find to eat all right she said indifferently the freezedried beef stew irv thought after he poured hot water into the package tasted almost like what mother used to make but not quite hed been eating it for so long that he had trouble defining the difference but he knew it was there real food was one of the things he looked forward to about going home he rinsed the plastic tray tossed it in the trash pat had only pushed her food around hardly any of it was gone come on eat irv said he felt as if he were coaxing a reluctant toddler pat took a couple of forkfuls then put the package of stew down i dont feel much like eating i dont feel much like anything she would not look at irv she kept her eyes on her hands in her lap you really should pat we need you he hesitated as strong as you can be he hated himself for that little pause even more than the polite words it had been intended to replace it called attention to what had happened pat didnt answer for a moment irv thought she was disconnected from the hereandnow again then he saw her shoulders shaking saw two tears splash onto the backs of her wrists before she jerked up her arms to cover her face she hadnt cried before not when irv was there to see it and not so far as he knew any other time either thats right he urged standing next to her itll help you feel better its all right its notall right a gasped hitching breath broke the sentence in half its never going to be all right what do i say to that irv wondered especially when its true except for two of his grandparents he had never lost anyone he loved he knew how lucky he was because he was so lucky he did not know firsthand how pat felt but he knew it was bad worse now he supposed because she was letting what she had blocked away come out he bent down on one knee and put an awkward arm around her she started to shake him off then twisted in the chair until her head found the hollow of his shoulder his other arm wrapped around her her tears were hot on the side of his neck he held her while she cried herself out she looked ghastly when she finally raised her headall the more so in the harsh bluewhite glow of the fluorescent tube in the ceiling her blotched wetstreaked face reminded irv again of the toddler he had thought about a few minutes before but the feel of her against him was like no toddlers he shook his head at the distracting thought and reached out and snagged a paper towel off the tabletop here he said blow pat did noisily and dabbed at her eyes thank you she said and then again in a different tone of voice thank you its all right he was still holding her with one arm when he started to pull back she clung to him dont let go not yet please she said i wasnt havent been able to feel anything since irv thought she was going to let that hang but she made herself go on since frank got killed its like most of mes been stuck inside a glass specimen jar i see things hear things but they dont connect they just bounce off the glass thisi really know youre here with me okay that was one way of dealing with shock irv knew if nothing got through the glass nothing could hurt give me that paper towel again would you pat wiped at her face crumpled the towel and threw it away i must look like hell frankly yes she let out a strangled snort that might have beenirv hoped it wasthe first laugh from her since her husband died you always say the sweetest things irv i try he kept his tone deliberately light but pats reply was serious i know thanks one more time she held on to him too as if afraid to stop so good to feel something anything again good thats good pat irvs brain was handling mixed signals consciously he was glad he was able to do as a friend should able to help pat begin to accept her loss through his hands through his skin he picked up another message he was very much aware that for some time he had been holding a woman in his arms more than anything else he was annoyed with his physical response to that not the time or place he thought for a crazy moment he felt seventeen again walking from class to class with his books held awkwardly in front of him to hide an incongruous erection the pat leaned close and kissed him on the cheek it was not meant to be a passionate kiss thinking back later irv was sure of that nor was the one he intended to give back but instead of her cheek his mouth found hers with a sound half sigh half groan she clutched him to her there must have been some time in the minutes that followed when their lips were separated long enough for irv to say no or stop or something of the sort afterward that seemed logically certain but he never could figure out when it might have been even when they were helping each other pull off boots and trousers their mouths stayed glued together and his still covered hers and helped quiet her moan soon after a moment later he made noises of his own and was similarly muffled coming back to himself was nothing like the afterglow he cherished it felt more like breaking a fever what had just ended seemed strange and unreal as if it had happened to someone else but pats smooth thighs still gripped him he still looked into her face from only a couple of inches away im sorry was the first thing that occurred to him to say that he knew was wrong he levered himself with his arms and pushed off against the floor so he sat back on his knees i think weve been stupid he said slowly pat sat up too and reached for her pants youre probably right she said as she started to put them on this isnt like the last time iwanted you though i didnt expect it to happen i didnt even particularly want it to happen it just did yeah irv said he started getting dressed too t know and what the hell am i going to do about it he wondered at the moment he had no idea i didnt expect it to happen either i was just trying to comfort you any way i could he pulled on socks one didnt fit it was pats he tossed it to her she was nodding mand god knows i was looking for comfort any place i could find it you want to call it shared battle fatigue or something and let it go at that that might be the best thing to do that way irv thought we can pretendi can pretendit never happened at all he wished it never had happened at all wishing did just as much good as usual okay pat said i know what you were trying to do maybe you even did it i guess i have to make myself go on figure out how to go on without frank she stood up right now im going off to the john for a minute irv winced pat saw it all right she said i wont talk about it anymore but this once happening like it did wasnt the same as it would have been a lot of other ways yeah irv said he watched pat walk out then climbed into a chair what she said was true it even helped trouble was it didnt help enough he got up looked at himself in the glass of the microwaves door it wasnt much of a mirror but he doubted he could look at himself in much of a mirror stupid he told his reflection it didnt argue with him he heard the airlock doors open first the outer then the inner anybody home sarah called irv was not an adrenaline junkie the sound of his wifes voice almost made him jump out of his skin anybody home sarah said again back here he answered his voice he thought came out as a hoarse croak he discovered another reason why he hadnt cheated on sarah before he didnt seem to be very good at it sarah came walking down the passageway what took you so long she asked sticking her head into the galley sorry she shrugged took off her gloves rubbed her hands together im going to make myself some coffee want any maybe he was only imagining how he sounded sarah didnt seem to notice anything wrong sure he said thanks sarah put two cups of water in the microwave pat came in sarah glanced up irv waited for the world to fall to pieces sarah said in im making coffee shall i put another cup in for you would you pat said i could use some sure sarah filled a third cup the microwave started its soft whir over it sarah said to pat you sound a little better pat nodded i think maybe i am finally ive got towe all have toget on with things no matter whats happened im sorry ive been so useless i just needed some time i guess of course you did sarah said the microwave chimed she got out the boiling water poured in instant coffee passed around the cups here you go folks caffeinated mud real coffee is another thing ill want lots of when we get home amen irv agreed could be worse thoughdont the russians have instant tea the idea of that drew groans from everyone hows lamra pat asked you are better sarah said sounding pleased thats the first time in a good long while youve cared about whats going on as for lamra shes very much herself only more so if you know what i mean she has this new wooden toy runnerpest maybe reatur made it for her i dont know it that she carries around everywhere wont let go of it for hell she doesnt try to mother it though the way a little girl would with a doll not much call for learning to be a mommy on minerva that comment extinguished smiles from the faces of pat and irv not much longer now irv said nowe have to keep those clamps and bandage packs handy sarah said we may need era any time i just hope theyll do some good we give it our best shot thats all we can do having pat he did not look at her and picked his words carefully feeling more like herself cant do anything but help i hope so pat said irvs right we might make this work yet sarah looked happier at the prospect than she had for a while herself irv finished his coffee relief almost drowned guilt evidently he didnt have a large scarlet a tattooed on his forehead after all he couldnt forget those few incandescent minutes with pat but maybe just maybe he could convince himself they didnt matter very much and maybe he couldnt too while sarah slept quietly beside him her warm breath sometimes tickling his ear he lay awake himself most of the night a conscience is a useless piece of baggage he whispered his however wasnt listening for that matter not even the rest of him believed it ix theyre turning it was anything but the best news in the world reatur thought as he heard the messengers shout that he had been expecting it did not make it any easier to take his males heard it too some peered over the barricade of ice and snow on which they had been working frantically for the last few days the skarmer were not yet in sight reatur was glad the weather was staying right around the place where ice melted so he and the males could work with both snow and water to create a sturdy barrier against the invaders had it been too hot to keep snow on the ground they would have had to try to build the rampart of earth which would have taken impossibly long the domain master poked an eyestalk over the barrier him self turned another on emmett beside him soon we will see them reatur said and then the human jerked the places where his arms met his body in his kinds gesture of uncertainty and then we do what we do he said he had less of the omalo tongue than the other humans you will use your noiseweapon too reatur asked worriedly it did not look like much emmetts big hand almost swallowed it but the human had demonstrated it once with lots of reaturs warriors to see and hear the roar the flash had been much like the ones that worked such ruin on them at the edge of ervis gorge the males will be braver knowing we can match the skarmer not match emmett said sharply but quietly so the warriors close by would not hear skarmer weapon shoot more shoot farther yes i know that you explained it before reatur spoke as softly as the human but my males do not so they will be braver and the skarmer do not so they may take fright when you thunder at them good plan emmett agreed that pleased reatur no matter how weird humans were this one seemed to know a good deal about fighting now he was talking into the box that carried voices reatur wished he understood what emmett was saying he had only learned a few words of human speech now he had to ask is all well back beyond the castle all well emmett said they wait so do we reatur said most times he would sooner have acted than paused here to let the skarmer descend on him but if he attacked them in the open he would be like a fat massi coming up to a male too stupid to know it was about to be speared the noiseweapon made that certain thus he waited on ground of his own choosing his warriors babble changed tone the eyestalk that was looking northwest over the barrier told him why the males emerging from in back of some gentle high ground could only be the enemy some of them stopped short when they saw the obstacle the omalo had thrown up in their path the skarmer could not go around it it stretched from one patch of woods to another if they wanted to fight reaturs warriors they would have to come straight at them more and more skarmer came out they began to deploy forming into fighting clusters the omalo yelled abuse at them though they did not understand the local tongue and were still too far away to hear much anyhow fralk has a funny way of arranging his warriors reatur said poking up another couple of eyestalks so he could take in the whole picture at once why that gap in the center more of his males should be there to meet us where we are strongest but there are only an eighteen or so with one of the eyes that wasnt looking out at the skarmer army the domain master saw emmett looking over the rampart too the human had a gadget over his own eyesnot the noiseweapon but something else help me see farther emmett explained lowering the device i see human there in center always deep and to reatur fierce sounding his voice was frighteningly grim now a human after a moments thought the domain master realized what that meant oh that is where the noiseweapon will be yes and he doesnt have his own males there so he wont hit them with the stones or whatever it is that the noiseweapon spits yes emmett said again he made his mouth twist into the shape humans used to show amusement now he had his weapon again we give fralk new thing to think about yes yes the word felt good to reatur fralk had been pulling him around by the eyestalks ever since the skarmer forced their way out of ervis gorge he had been reacting to what his enemy did let fralk react for a change go ahead emmett the human aimed the noiseweapon over the rampart made it roar having it go off next to reatur was like taking up residence in the middle of a thunderstorm the domain master did not care see how you like it coming your way fralk he yelled a flash a boomfralk froze in horror turning four eyestalks toward oleg he screamed lbu told me they didnt have rifles he was too shaken to bother with the human language oleg followed the skarmer speech not a rifle he answered in the same language he also followed fralk literally a guard jerked him along by a cord tied around him between his arms and head what do you mean not a rifle fralk shouted still frantic flash boomanother shot punctuated his words with the couple of eyes that werent on the human he saw his males begin to waver they hadnt expected the omalo to have a weapon to match theirs not a rifle oleg repeated that is pistora human word fralk hadnt heard before but one oleg went on to explainlike rifle but not as good not shoot so far not shoot so fast not hurt us where we are here oh that made fralk feel a little better but not much flash boomhis warriors were definitely having second thoughts now they didnt know the pistol was too far away for its bullets to reach them fralk thought furiously can i kill whoever has the pistol from here he asked maybe oleg said that was all fralk needed to hear he pointed his rifle in the direction from which the omalo had shot set the change lever to full automatic and fired a long satisfying burst ice splashed from the omalo barrier do you think i got him he asked maybe oleg said again this time in his own language as for what i think nichevo soon enough you will know if he does not shoot back you got him if he does you did not flash boomfralk cursed emmet bragg was having fun only slightly hampered by the fact that as irv had reminded him a couple of days before he couldnt afford to do anything stupid had only his own neck been on the line he would have worried a lot less but four other people were depending on him to get them back to earth with frank dead he didnt even have a well trained backup so he threw himself flat on his belly the second the kalashnikov started barking and stayed there till well after the burst was done the wisdom might have been forced on him but it was wisdom nonetheless a couple of rounds punched through the barrier to wound minervans behind it one might have got him and he not hit the deck when he didthe snow and ice it kicked out froze the back of his neck more males fell from bullets that had clipped them above the level of the rampart still bragg thought most of the rounds from the burst had gone high that was bad shooting worse than he had expected from the russian maybe it was because lopatin was kgb and hadnt got proper training isnt that too bad for him bragg muttered he was just glad sergei tolmasov was on the far side of jotun canyon tolmasov he was grimly certain would not have used the akt like an amateur staying low bragg scrambled twenty yard to his right jumped up for a quick shot over the barrier then dove onto his stomach again a short burst chewed up the ice and snow almost at once followed a few seconds later by a long one changed clips again did you good bragg said as if he were playing poker not soldier against the man with the rifle now how many do you have left that was a question all right lopatin he thought was shooting as though he had brought along a truckload this time bragg crawled a couple of hundred feet to his left almost to the trees anchoring that end of the line he popped up for three shots at fralks right wing they might even have done some damage the minervans there werent much more than a hundred yards away now and they made a big target bragg didnt stay up long enough to look which was just as wellthe answering fusillade came hard on the heels of his last shot reloading while on his belly was not a skill he had practiced much since basic training days but he managed still down there he pulled out his radio and called his wife you all ready there ready as well ever be louises voice emerged tinnily is that that damn gun i hear emmett watch yourself now he chuckled i intend to hon love you next time i call ill really need you out he started making his way back toward the center of the line and quickly forgot about louise he did love her as he had said but he loved what he was doing more he had loved carleen too come to that but he had figured out early on he was never going to make it to minerva married to a historian of ancient rome crazy the stuff that goes through your mind he thought carleen hadnt certainly not since athena touched down he dismissed the memory of her once more as he got back to reatur the domain master said well done theyre still coming but with arms and eyestalks pulled in partway they dont like being on the wrong side of your human noiseweapons any more than my warriors do bragg jabbed a thumb at himself not like either he said reaturs eyestalks wiggled bragg went on now try to kill their human male with noiseweapon then we winskarmer lose courage when that male fall a human does not have their noiseweapon reatur said it is the eldest of eldest of the skarmer domain master the male called fralk is it bragg wondered what the hell lopatin was playing at whatever it was it explained the bad shooting from the other side the mission commander shrugged maybe it made his job easier try to kill fralk then i want to tell you no reatur said bragg looked at him in surprise the domain master explained i want to kill him myself but you are right emmett slay him now if you can reatur was a soldier like none america had known since the war between the states bragg thoughthe took his fighting personally the pilot readied himself he wished he had been a cop some work with the popup targets the police used would have come in handy now he bounced up and shot with a two hand grip one round after another aiming at the kalashnikov his attention focused so completely on the rifle that he had fired several times before he even noticed oleg lopatin a few paces away and twice after that before he saw the rope around the russians neck so things werent all going lopatins way he thought well tough luck oleg borisovichserves you right the hammer clicked the pistol was empty again bragg hit the dirt to reload a moment after he did the kalashnikov started chewing away at the barrier in front of him shit he said he was just glad fralk couldnt shoot for beans reaturs guess was a good one fralk did not care at all for being shot at a bullet kicked up snow and dirt at his feet another two zipped past him closer than he ever wanted to think about and two more struck a male close by fralk he did not even scream before he fell get back out of range you idiot before you get killed and get me killed with you oleg yelled fralk needed a moment to understand the human another to figure out that he made good sense back fralk called several males in his small band had not waited for the order he would deal with them later how far can that cursed pistol shoot he asked oleg when they had retreated a good way this should be far enough the human said adding unless the man with the pistol there gets very lucky fralk thought about retreating some more but enough males around him understood human speech to make that look like cowardice he fired several rounds in the direction from which the shots had come but doubted they would do much good the human on the other side of that frozen wall seemed to have a knack for surviving what i will do fralk decided is stay here and use the rifle to help our warriors on the flanks i can reach the whole field from this place and the pistol cannot that still leaves us with the advantage khorosho fralk ochen khorosho oleg said you are beginning to understand how to use your firepower if you have more range than your enemy you set up where you can hurt him and he cannot hurt you that made sense to fralk but he still felt peculiar standing off in the distance while his males and the omalo first flung spears at each other and then began using those spearsand every other weapon on which they could lay their handsat close quarters as the skarmer tried to force their foes back from the barricade several omalo warriors stood very tall to thrust at fralks warriors he fired a short burst one of the enemy males tumbled away from the barrier the upper part of his body a chewed bloody ruin the other omalo warriors flinched away a couple of skarmer started to climb over the frozen wall fralk shifted his aim from one end of the line to the other squeezed the trigger again he was not sure he hit anyone this time but the omalo flinched anyhow skarmer males started trying to get over the barrier there too if they can make it to the far side in any numbers we have them fralk declared da lopatin agreed after the fighting was done fralk knew he would have to figure out what to do with the human but now he valued his thoughts fralk felt pleased at regaining his equanimity this was the first time since that other human had shot at him that he found himself able to plan for what would happen after the fighting was done reatur flung a spear at one of the skarmer scrambling over the rampart it missed his target but might have hit a warrior further onthe enemy was tightly packed at that part of the barrier the domain master shouted and waved his arms when one of his males killed the skarmer with an ax but for every skarmer who died anotheroften more than onedid his best to climb over if they make it to this side in any numbers were done for reatur said i know emmett dodged a spear his long legs made him extraordinarily nimble reatur thought off in the distance too far away for emmett to strike back fralks noiseweapon began its deadly chatter once more one omalo male shrieked then another then another they fight good emmett said sometimesoften human warriors run away from noiseweapons first time see hear them your males brave reatur the praise pleased the domain master where would they run he asked if they lose here they lose everything they know it buthe let his deepest fear come outi doubt even they can hold against terror forever you right i think emmett took out his talkingbox spoke urgently into it in his own language he put it away dipped his head to reatur we do what we can irv stuffed the radio back into his pocket you heard the man he said louise bragg nodded so did sarah she had been limbering up every few minutes ever since the battle started a few miles northwest now she started stretching in earnest lets give it one last check louise said to irv good plan they walked over to damselfly together and went over it strut by strut wire by wire joining by joining they checked the thin plastic skin of wings tail and cabin to make sure it hadnt developed any holes that could rip wide open in the air they didnt find anything irv started checking again are we good sarah demanded she was peeling off parka and long pants hopping up and down to stay warm in the minervan summer sun if we are we dont have time to waste were good irv said reluctantly he gave his wife a fierce hug be careful i love you ending up in bedor rather on the floorwith pat hadnt done anything to change that it just made him feel like a hypocritical bastard when he said that to sarah love you too she answered now he wondered what she would say if she ever found out he was full of scientific curiosity but that was one thing he did not want to know he set the wide stepladder by damselfly helped sarah climb in then lowered the canopy the sound of the hooksandeyes snapping it closed shutting sarah away from him seemed dreadfully final shaking his head he got down from the stepladder and carried it out of the way then he went over and took hold of a wingtip louise had the other one she also had her radio out irv took his out too testing he heard louise say one two three four how do you read damselfly read you five by five sarah answered irv heard her both in the speaker and directly how do you read me loud and clear break a leg kiddo louise said dont tempt me sarah started to pedal lets get the batteries good and charged a few minutes later she said okayhere we go she let the prop spin damselfly rolled forward irv and louise ran with it keeping the wing level airborne irv shouted sarah took one hand off the control stick to wave then gave all her concentration back to flying irv watched damselfly slowly climb there goes the funniest looking warplane in the history oftwo worlds he said no arguments louise was on the radio again on a different frequency emmett are you there she called worriedly come in im here he answered busy but still here damselflys on its way now she told him not a minute too soon out out louise turned to irv now we can only wait the fun part he agreed id rather be doing something doing anything than just standing around here me too louise said i hate it when something thats important to me is out of my hands sarah said the same thing when emmett was landing athena its all in her hands now though irv made sure his radio was on damselflys frequency how you doing there honey how does the plane handle with the changes we made in it doing all right sarah answered the extra weight isnt bad about what id have if i were pedaling in my parka and im not getting enough extra drag even to noticegaining altitude shouldnt be a problem good irv said out he wanted sarah as high as possible above the slings and arrows to say nothing of axes and spearsof outrageous fortune to louise he said now what head over toward athena she was gathering up sarahs discarded outer layers of clothing i think wed better she said weve never all been away at once before and we sure as hell dont want to have to try to talk or fight our way through to the ship ifif reatur loses no irv said although the odds of emmetts getting free if reatur lost were slim and without emmett getting back to the ship didnt matter in the long run anyhow louise of course could figure that out for herself as well as he could and doubtless had they had only gone a couple of hundred yards when their radios crackled to life again ice that had nothing to do with the weather formed in irvs midsection as he lifted his set to his earonly bad news would make emmett call back so soon but pat was on the radio not emmett she was in reaturs castle checking on lamra has sarah taken off yet she asked a few minutes ago irv said why he had a bad feeling he knew the answer before he asked the question he did pat said because lamras getting ready to drop those budlings now and i dont think shes going to wait around shit irv said softly he could still see damselfly off in the distance sarah was banking into a long slow gentle turn the only kind the ultraultralight could make he could still call her backand most likely throw away the battle and emmett with it and lamra and her budlings too come to that if reaturs males were beaten what do we do louise asked he kicked at frozen dirt made his choice how are you at coping with gore i wont lose my lunch if thats what you mean louise answered at once you want me to help you try to save the minervan thats just what i want hang on to sarahs clothes shes got clamps and bandages in one of those pockets pat and i will coach you through as best we can youve got to be quick and accurate twice each of us does and if we are we have a chance irv wished he were as confident as he sounded it hadnt happened yet not even once im not the person you need louise said youre the person ive got come on they ran for thecastle the world wheeled under sarah as she began another slow careful clockwise turn the cold breeze coming in through the freshair tube helped take away the stink of the gunk sprayed all over the bottom of the cabin a great circle she thoughtsurely this was the long way around to deliver a surprise to the skarmer it had a couple of advantages though for one thing it gave her plenty of time in which to make damselfly climb she knew she had sugarcoated what she had told irv even in dense minervan air the ultraultralight climbed like a fat man going up a tall ladder it wasnt any worse now than it had been before they fiddled with it though so she hadnt really lied the route she was flying would also let her come up from behind the skarmer as far as the idea of behind meant anything when dealing with minervans this once emmett had argued persuasively worse luck it just might males in a battle ought to have sense enough to keep all their eyestalks pointed in the direction from which danger cametoward reaturs warriors in other words they shouldnt spot her till too late ought to shouldnt ought to shouldnt if youre wrong emmett ill never speak to you again sarah panted that she feared was no joke her stomach did flipflops when she thought about what a burst of kalashnikov fire would do to damselflyand to her fighter pilots she realized suddenly earned every penny they got and then some never seen this place so deserted irv said puffing his footsteps and louises echoed down the hallways of reaturs castle on any other day the noise of dozens of males would have drowned them out now he had only seen a couple one barely fullgrown and the other ancient at the battle louise also getting her breath back was short with words the usual racket pierced the doors of the mates chambers mates were sheltered from worries about their fate or rather irv thought they never got the chance to grow enough to understand what worrying about their fate meant maybe that would start to change today maybe the guard outside the doors widened himself as the humans came up he was in his prime standing by a post reatur reckoned important enough to keep him out of the fighting what word he asked anxiously i do not know irv answered the battle still goes on let us pass now please the male unbarred the doors shut them again behind irv and louise mates rushed from everywhere at the boom of the falling bar then drew back disappointed when they saw only humans not reatur pat louise called in here irv shook his head when he noticed from which chamber the answer came it was the one in which biyal had died he did not think of himself as superstitious but he wished lamra were somewhere else lamra lifted an eyestalk when he and louise came in hello the mate said pat told me i should not say goodbye not yet no not yet irv said soberly soon though maybe he thought and scowled at himself he could hear the unease in his voice when he asked pat hows she doing see for yourself the skin is splitting so it is irv stooped and switched to the omalo language lift the arm by me please lamra lamra did the mate kept her fist closed but irv saw the graybrown of minervan wood between her fingerclaws the precious toy runnerpest he supposed he smiled at that a little and waved louise down beside him see he said pointing at the growing vertical slit over the bud louise nodded in a few minutes as the opening gets longer and wider youll be able to see the whole budling and how its hooked on to lamra by its mouth when it falls away when its born i meanitll drop off thatll be that unless we can clamp the vessel it was feeding from and the ones for the other five too with two for each of us we may have a chance we cant afford any fumbling though pat sounded as if she was talking as much to herself as to louise weve got to be right the first time louise got clamps bandage packs and rolls of tape out of sarahs parka ill do the best i can she said she didnt seem nervous she sounded intrigued like an engineer sizing up a new and challenging problem only fair irv thoughtshe was one lets take our places he said the budlings wiggling feet were already pushing through the opening in lamras skin so through the other slits were those of its brothers and sisters irv slid over to louises right pat was on her left what about the six vessels around each central one louise asked shouldnt we clamp those too the bandages should take care of them pat said theyre all small compared to the one in the middle thats the one the two ratheryouve got to worry about when the budlings drop theyll go like a fire hydrant hit by a car irv grimaced that was a more graphic simile than he wanted to think about he switched to the omalo tongue again how do you feel lamra the mate after all was no experimental animal but a person too and a young person at that she had to be wondering worrying about what would happen next it doesnt hurt now lamra said after a moments pause perhaps for taking stock will it hurt later when you stop me from ending i dont think so irv said as reassuringly as he could actually he had no idea he hoped heand lamrawould find out he also hoped the mate was as confident as she sounded when you stop me from ending he knew that when was an if if lamra didnt more power to her for as much time as she had they would soon know how long that would be the arms and eyestalks of the budling in front of irv were twitching now along with its legs its mouth was tightly clamped round the big blood vessel that fed it any minute pat breathed if she was going to add now she never got the chance lamras budlings all let go at once blood gushed forth in a torrent that astonished irv anew every time he saw it the clamps were on the ground between his feet he seized the spurting vessel in front of him with one hand snatched up a clamp stuck it on that flood slowed to a drip he shifted leftward grabbing for the second bleeder and the other clamp at almost the same instant pat shifted to her right just as he had she had started on the blood vessel further away from louise so she could deal with both of hers and be in position to help irv fumbled with the second clamp got it on at last he looked toward louise how you doing he asked need a hand from the engineers other side pat was using nearly the same words to ask the same thing im done i think louise answered like her colleagues like the chambershe was spattered and dripping with gore she wiped the back of a hand across her face which only made matters worse with an engineers caution she went on check me will you irv looked at one of the vessels she had repaired pat at the other irv gave a thumbsup a moment later the clamp was on perhaps more securely than either of the ones he had done this ones fine louise pat said well done im officially impressed you told me what to do and i did it louise seemed surprised anyone would make much of simple competence shall we get the bandage packs on now yeah wed better irv started to walk over to pick up bandages and tape but almost tripped on one of the newiy hatched budlings all six of them were scrambling around like so many little wild animalswhich irv supposed in essence they were their squawks were calliope whistle shrill when were done well have to catch these critters he said he was taping the first gauzesoaked sweat sock into place when he suddenly realized lamra had neither said anything nor moved in some time he could not afford to think about that not until the other bandage was on then with the emergency work done as well as could be he took a step backa careful step so as not to step on a budlingto see how the mate was doing lamra he asked she did not answer all the eyes irv could see were closed and her eyestalks hung down against her body so did her arms they were not as limp he thought as those of the eloc mates he had failed to save but the toy runnerpest had fallen in the blood between her feet lamra he asked again still no reply now what louise asked irv shook his head baffled fearful but still hopeful now we wait progress at last fralk shouted at the eastern end of the fight the skarmer warriors had finally forced reaturs males back from the barrier but the omalo curse their stubborn ways would not flee they fought on holding a line against fralks warriors progress it was but not enough and from where he was fralk could not help make it more his males stood between him and the enemy he could not use the rifle not without doing the skarmer more harm than the omalo we shall advance he declared from a position nearer the barricade i will be able to pour a flood of bullets into the foe they will surely break then and our gallant males will be able to surround them we advance the males with him shouted they shook their spears and axes most of them fralk guessed had resented being kept out of the fighting the pistol oleg said shut up coward come on his keeper growled understanding the word the human had used before he tugged on the rope oleg stumbled forward do not worry about the pistol oleg borisovich fralk said in the human speech it has not boomed for a long time now surely the human who has it is out of bullets he waited for olegs reply oleg only made the gesture humans used for a shrug fralk shrugged too toward the fighting he cried grandly playing to the pride of the warriors with him toward the fighting they yelled back and toward the fighting they went hes in among that little bunch near the center there he just fired a burst see the muzzle flashes i see them emmett sarah wondered how emmetts voice could come so calmly through the radio the battlefield ahead looked like proof chaos nothing else but down there she knew she would have been scared shitlessshe was scared plenty up here but emmett seemed in his element he had read the minervans well too so far none of the skarmer had spotted her though she was less than half a mile behind their army flying straight down its line of march a minute to target maybe a minute and a half time to get ready her left thumb clicked the power switch to on she would need all the help she could get from the batteries because her pedaling was going to have to suffer now she reached down peeled up a square of mylar that was only taped in place cold wind blew into her face she pulled a butane lighter from the waistband of her shorts and flicked the little metal lever till it caught she lowered the flame toward the wick on the gallon bottle that hung just behind her front wheel the wind blew it out she swore flicked the lever again and then glanced up to see if the minervans had spotted her yet damn they had she would never get to make another pass the lighter lit thanking god for the fire retardant chemicals that were stinking up the cabin she made the flame bunsen burner big the wick was not soaked with fire retardantsvery much the opposite this time it caught move curse you you worthless traitor snarled the minervan who had hold of oleg lopatins leash lopatin had no choice but to move he glared at the warrior if only i had you back in lefortovo prison he thought longingly you would learn just what an amateur at torment you are the kgb man knew how futile such dreams of revenge were but they helped keep him going anyhow fralk fired again his band was less than a hundred meters from the omalo barricade any second now lopatin expected the american back of the barrier to prove fralk wrong and with a little luck fill him full of holes lopatin would have saved a few rounds for another good chance at taking out the kalashnikov and he was sure anyone smart enough to make it onto athenas crew would also be smart enough to do the same maybe he thought with a sudden savage grin the american would fill his kennelmaster full of holes there was a revenge that might be no dream one of the other highranking minervans in fralks group let out a startled squealhe sounded amazingly like a housewife spotting a rat a monster in the sky he shrieked look three arms away from the battlemits coming straight at us eyestalks writhed lopatins head whipped around he had never seen damselfly before but he knew what it was the skarmer did not that first scream was quickly echoed by many more lopatins keeper had two eyes on the human two on the battle and two on the new flying horror that left none to pay attention to the small greenbrown bush by his feet one of those feet brushed it the keeper jerked went limp the rope slipped from his fingerclaws a pestilence one of the other males shouted nogdar just stepped on a stunbush grab that rope somebody too late lopatin was free a spear wildly flung whizzed past damselfly sarah did her best to ignore it she couldnt do anything about it anyway fortunately most of the minervans seemed too scared of the ultraultralight to think of trying to bring it down there was her target dead ahead she leaned down again this time with a swiss army knife in her hand seeing the monster fly hissing toward him fralk wanted to void where he stood he needed an instant to remember he was still holding the rifle a rifle had chewed the krong to bloodyrags anything that could kill a krong ought to be able to take out a skymonster he thought the cursed rifle was on the wrong side of his body to shoot at the thing fast as he could he passed it from arm to arm oleg lopatin looked at damselfly looked at fralk and discovered as so many had before him one of the great flaws of international socialism when faced with a choice between their own kind and an ideology most people chose their own kind lopatin did not pause to reason that out he just yelled and jumped on fralk the swiss army knife cut the string that ran through the handle of the gallon jug filled with wood alcohol naphtha and butane damselfly seemed to leap higher in the air as the weight it had never been designed to carry dropped away the kalashnikov bellowed right under sarah she screamed expecting to die in the next second no bullets ripped through her damselfly did not tumble in ruins to the ground she couldnt even look back she didnt have a rearview mirror all she could do was pedal and pray then emmett braggs hoarse voice came yelling out of the radio you can play in my league any day darlin one extra large molotov cocktail right on target smoked em both he let go with a rebel yell that was almost too much for the little speaker both sarah panted she flew over reaturs barricade onto the side his males held as her fearinduced adrenaline rush began to fade she realized how tired she was the minervan and the russian too oh oh jesus didnt i see him fighting with the minervan trying to keep him from shooting me down if she had dumped hellfire on somebody trying to save her she wanted to be sick but bragg said coldly well what if you did hadnt been for lopatin that minervan never would have had a rifle in the first place and if he didnt a lot of peoplefrank maybe a lot of reaturs males for surewould still be alive besides nothin you can do about it now anyhow youre right she conceded still wishing he had not told her look if it makes you feel any better we can turn the kgb bastard into a hero when we talk to tsiolkovsky best part is i guess its even true yeah it did make her feel better less guilty id never make a soldier she thought but then she had never wanted to be a soldier okay im heading back for athena good we should have somebody minding the store now to win this battlethats the point of the exercise after all out out sarah pedaled on reatur stared in mixed awe and dread at the flames consuming his foe his watersmiths used fire of course to melt ice and pour it into molds for tools hot water could bore through walls or dropped from above scald attackers but to turn fire itself into a weapon for warthe domain master shuddered he tried to imagine how humans fought among themselves imagining a battlefield full of noiseweapons and fire falling out of the sky made him shudder all over again only for a moment though he had his own battle to worry about and enormous opportunity looking fight at him come on he shouted to the males around him their whole center depended on the noiseweapon now that its gone nothings left there we can split their whole army in half he scrambled over the barricade yelling his warriors followed he heard a long series of roars from a noiseweapon back where the skarmer had forced his males to give ground a pause another long string of blasts emmett could shoot as he would now without having to fear the enemys more powerful weapon then came the sweetest sound reatur had heard on the battlefield his warriors cheering going over to the attack that way he called well cut off the skarmer retreat he hurried east his males rushing with him in their eagerness to close with the enemy suddenly he stopped he divided the warband with him in two pointed to the larger group youll come with me to the others he said you go west instead maybe well be able to surround each half of their army that hope made his males shout louder than ever as the domain master ran toward the muchbattered rampart his eyestalks started twitching of their own accord he had never expected to be fighting from the north side of the barrier here he was though reaching across with a spear to thrust at the skarmer on the other side the foe was frantic now caught between the males they had pushed back and the barrier from which they had pushed them some started climbing over it this time in the opposite direction from before the arrival of reatur and his warriors put an end to that surrender the domain master shouted in trade talk we will not slay any male who throws down his weapons and widens himself before us he waited to see if the skarmer would yield they didnt not fight away but after a couple of desperate attacks failed to dislodge reatur and his warriors skarmer males began casting aside axes and spears and widening themselves when the first few who did so were not harmed more and more followed their lead reatur began telling off warriors to take charge of prisoners clamor to the west made him turn a couple of eyestalks that way he cursedthe skarmer there had broken out to the north through his hastily dispatched containment force were they to swing back on his males now they did not instead they streamed back the way they had come all thought of fight forgotten the western half of the omalo army pursued reatur spotted enoph close by take charge of the captives let our males loot as they will but they are not to injure the skarmer unless they try to escape it will be as you say enoph promisedand what enoph promised the domain master knew he would deliver but where are you going clanfather the reliable male asked reatur was already hurrying north to join the chase i want to rid my domain of the skarmer once and for all the western half of the skarmer army though beaten was still a force large enough to disrupt his lands and whoever led it now that fralk was dead knew his businessknew it better perhaps than hograms eldest of eldest ever had the invaders fought a series of stubborn rear guard actions to keep reaturs warriors away from their main body curse them the domain master shouted as his males finally broke through the third such delaying warband theyll escape scatter and cause us untold grief worse yet one of his warriors said gloomily pointing ahead to a defile a rearguard there will hold us off till sunset and theyll be able to reform on the far side at their leisure youre right reatur said and cursed again another battle to fight then he thought bleakly even winning would cost him the lives of males the domain could not afford to lose but instead of racing through the defile the skarmer piled up at its southern end they milled about in confusion a male all his arms outstretched to show he carried no weapons advanced from their ranks toward reatur and his oncoming warriors will you spare us if we yield he shouted in trade talk the domain master was flabbergasted but did his best not to show it aye we will he answered you have my vow on it good enough the skarmer said he spoke to his males in their own language they began throwing down their spears and knives and axes the skarmer widened himself to reatur we wouldve gotten away if you hadnt somehow posted warriors in there to block our path that was well donei never saw them leave the battle and i dont miss much juksal im called juksal suddenly seemed to think of something did you use tricks from the funny creatures to get them here the funny creatures reatur asked trade talk doesnt have a word for them you knowthe ones with two arms and two legs oh our name for them is humans no no human tricks reatur said wondering just where the warriorshis warriors had sprung from only one thing occurred to him he walked toward the defile some of his males came with him in case the skarmer decided to unsurrender ternat he called yes came the reply and the warriors with the domain master started to cheer how do we stand clanfather well very well now eldest very well the other half of the skarmer army has already yielded to us that brought answering cheers from ternat and his warband reatur went on how fare you eldest also well i have many many massi with me and dordal as a captive too do you reatur said when the clamor among his males subsided enough to let him be heard do you then eldest it is very well indeed he thought about that decided it was too small a thing to say eldest it is as well as i could have hoped as soon as damselfly touched down by athena sarah knew she had made a mistake if she didnt want to damage the ultraultralight she would need help getting out and it looked as though irv louise and the stepladder were still over on the other side of reaturs castle she reached for the radio switch then dropped her hand all she wanted to do was sit and shake for a minute flying across jotun canyon had been tougher physically but had not left her drained and limp the way this bombing run had terror was harder to take than exhaustion cold started seeping into her bones as she rested if she did too much of that she knew she would stiffen up and be sore for days her hand moved toward the radio again something hissed through the couple of inches of snow outside sarah turned to see what it was she had never heard any minervan creature make a noise like that it wasnt any minervan creature as it turned out it was emmett bragg speeding up on his bicycle he slid to a smooth stop waved need a hand getting out of that contraption dont you yes but doesnt reatur still need you back at the fight nope he got off the bike for one thing im out of ammo so im less use to him now than one of his own warriors who really knows what to do with a spear for another he was moppin up when i left with you takin out the kalashnikov the skarmer didnt have anything in the middle and reatur broke em in two and defeated am in detail all right as usual sarah thought emmett had a good mason for everything he did she laughed a littlehe wasnt eight feet tall though what are you going to get me out with the stepladders a couple of miles from here ill manage he climbed up the chain ladder to the airlock and disappeared into athena when he emerged a minute later he was carrying a large square plasticmesh box he set it down by damselfly and then climbed on top this ought to do the job i think youre right sarah unlatched the ultraultralights canopy and swung it open she stood up on the pedals and reached out for emmett he more than half lifted her out of damselflys cabin the box made a crunching noise under the weight of the two of them they jumped off it sarah stumbled emmett steadied her with an arm around her shoulder lets get you inside he said wearing that skimpy getup youre gonna be a lump of ice in a couple of minutes they walked over to athena he didnt take his arm away she started to shrug him off changed her mind he was warm she sighed in relief when he shut the inner airlock door after them till i got to minerva i never knew how wonderful the words room temperature could be she said you know it emmett grinned a lopsided grin of course they take on a whole other meaning when the walls of the room are made of ice he turned serious again you did a hell of a job there sarah a hell of a job thanks she said most soberly i dont quite know how i did it but i guess i did right now im just so glad to be back here in one piece that i can hardly think about anything else glad to be alive i know what you meando i ever the grin got wider suddenly emmett let another yell rip free hot damn gift we did it he shouted he hugged her tight enough to make the breath hiss from her lungs her arms went around his back the solid feel of him against her was a welcome affirmation that she was alive he tilted her face up and kissed her she was kissing him back before she wondered whether she ought to be mmm he said back deep in his throat without letting up on the kiss then his mouth slid to her neck his teeth gently worried the lobe of her ear she closed her eyes and let her head oll back nice she purred perhaps because of her brush with death every sensation the touch of his tongue against the soft skin under the angle of her jaw his warm breath on her cheek seemed deliciously magnified his hands were on her hips planted there as if without the slightest doubt they belonged come on he urged nodding back toward the cubicles she did not hesitate she had known for months that he wanted her and occasionally wondered how she would react if he ever did anything about it then the question had been academic and easy to answer with a no now why not she said feeling almost drunk on excitement his hand guided her into pats cubicle it was the one farthest forward but afterward she wondered if he had chosen it because it held nothing that belonged to irv or louise and could set off guilt that was afterward during she only wanted him to go on she stood while he quickly undressed her then did the same for him they embraced again he steered her to the foam mattress and lowered himself onto her low comedy briefly ousted desire wait she wriggled frantically get up for a second what the frowning emmett took some weight on his elbows that sufficed sarah reached under herself and threw aside whatever it was she had been lying on her arms went around his neck and pulled him back to her now she said had she not already known he was a test pilot she might have guessed it by the way he took her he flew her as if she were some new plane she thought before all thought vanished trying this trying that seeing how she responded what the limits of her performance were gasping she doubted she had any limits he laughed when at the end she tried to sink her teeth into his shoulder easy there shouldnt leave marks he said mind still in full control even as his body quivered and drove deep into hers that brought her back to herself faster than she wanted to return and brought her also to the beginning of anger she suddenly suspectedno she knewthe flying itself was more important to him than the plane he flew being just another test vehicle on which he could prove his expertise grated he sprang up from the mattress and bounded down the passage what the hell she squawked startled out of annoyance radio buzzer his words floated back to her i wonder how long it was on while we were busy here then she heard the insistent signal too and started to giggle he had paid some attention to her after all she heard him pick up the mike then he called loudly sarah youd better come its about lamra she raced to the control room only when emmett handed her the microphone did she realize that they were both still naked she didnt care what about lamra she demanded hon it was irv it would be irv she thought now she cared who she was standing with and how she felt herself go hot then cold but what irv was calling about mattered more than anything at least for the moment what about lamra lamra looked at herself how funny i look was the first thought that went through her mind well ahead of im alive and the surprise that accompanied it her budbulges which had been so firm and full were split open like ebster fruit and sagged clown almost onto her feet great strips of the sticky hide the humans used to hold things together clung to her skin she supposed they were helping to hold her together she really was the most ridiculous creature imaginable four eyestalks quivered the motion was less than she had though it would be for some reason they didnt want to do what she told them to but she was laughing lamra three voices all at once two sounding like people but oddly accented the third deep and strange humans she tried to talk her mouth didnt seem to want to work either she tried again wheres my runnerpest she demanded at last the humans abruptly stopped paying attention to her they yelled and screamed and she saw when she managed to raise her eyestalks a little jumped up and down wheres my runnerpest she repeated louder this time one of the humans finally handed her the toy it was bloody she squeezed it anyhow how are you how do you feel the humans all asked over and over again once they got coherent enough to talk sensibly tired she answered more thought produced sore messy she was thinking just clearly enough to know she wasnt thinking very clearly hungry too sore where pat sounded anxious hurt bad im sore wherei guess whereyou put those clampsshe used the human word she had learnedon me no pat i dont hurt bad when you put them on i hardly felt it at all i hardly felt anything at all it was funny when she laughed this time her eyestalks wiggled the way they should it was like being asleep and awake at the same time do you know what i mean no pat made the upanddown gesture humans used for a shrug glad you are not hurt though louise held up a couple of squirming squalling at first lamra thought they were big runnerpests but then she remembered seeing their like before sometimes when reatur would walk out after a mate had dropped oh the budlings she said yes you want to see i suppose so everything was interesting to lamra at least for a little while but the budlings got boring fast all they did was flail about and make noise thats enough you can put them down now irv spoke into his talkingbox the box to lamra was much more interesting than budlings she had started out wondering how humans made themselves small enough to fit inside for their voices surely came out of it later she realized they didnt hide in there but talked with each other at a distance to her that was more marvelous not less irv spoke into the talkingbox again this time nobody answered irv shook the box broke it in halflamra hadnt known it opened uplooked inside made a human shrug put the box back together he held it to his mouth once more he spoke louder now when nothing happened pat got out her talkingbox and offered it to irv but just then noise came out of his another rumbling human voice talking irv answered lamra knew only a handful of words of human speech but recognized her name and sarahs and sum enough sarahs voice came from the talkingbox a moment later she was talking about lamra too suddenly she started using words a person could understand lamra how are you how do you feel lamras eyestalks wiggled you humans all ask the same questions she said when irv held the talkingbox above her mouth never mind jokes sarah said sharply tell me fight now how you are lamra looked at herself again ugly i think and the tapeanother human word she had picked upitches not what i mean sarah sounded the way humans sometimes did when lamra couldnt figure out what they wanted fast enough please dont be angry lamra wanted to pull in all her arms and eyestalks i think im all right sarah except for the holes in me where the budlings were will they close up or will i look like this from now on not know lamra not counting a tiny hiss only silence came out of the talkingbox for a while then sarah went on sorry lamra not mean to be angry at you angry at me why would you be angry at yourself sometimes humans made no sense at all to lamra angry because i not there when your budlings come sarah answered want to be there to help you but not can do oh dont worry sarah its all fight lamra said irv and pat andshe had to think for a momentlouise helped me very well what could you have done that they didnt another silence longer this time irv fiddled briefly with the talkingbox and then said lamra sarah thought of the way we used to save you she showed us what to do we were lucky to do it fight without her here if we makehad madea mistake she show us how to fix it his strange voice held the gentleness reatur used when explaining something to a new mate who was hardly more than a hurling herself oh lamra thought about the tone irv had used about his words and decided she had been silly sarah she said irv put the talkingbox above her mouth again im sorry sarah i wish youd been here too you must have been doing something important or you would have been still more silence then not as important as you lamra not as important as you but did reatur ever talk to you about skarmer males on this side of ervis gorge yes sarah lamra squeezed the toy runnerpest again he beat them i helped him beat them that is important sarah lamra said if reatur hadnt beaten them then what happened with me wouldnt matter much would it no not much sarah said but still curse it lamra i wish i there with you instead all right sarah lamra said thinking once more that even when humans used peoples words they didnt always make sense with them trying to figure out what they meant was fun though and now she realized she would have more time to do it she liked that x the males standing guard outside hograms audience chamber hefted their spears as tolmasov and bryusov walked by their eyestalks followed the two humans seeing a spearpoint twitch a couple of centimeters toward him tolmasov wished he were carrying his akt instead of a radio but no he thoughtan akt had helped cause his predicament they are not fond of us anymore sergei konstantinovich bryusov said quietly he could feel it too then no the pilot agreed i only hope they are not in the habit of blaming the messenger for the news he brings he felt like some luckless boyar coming to ivan the terrible with word of a disaster against the tatars the minervans talking in file audience chamber fell silent as the humans entered a couple of males ostentatiously turned all their eyes away from tolmasov and bryusov they deny that we have the right to exist bryusov murmured like turning their backsbut they have no backs yes i understand valery aleksandrovich even though the linguist kept stating the obvious tolmasov was glad he was along being able to speak the skarmer tongue fluently ought to give him insight into the way the locals thought and having another human close by was comforting in this room full of hostile aliens hogram waited at the far end of the hall tolmasov approached the domain master bowed low in lieu of widening himself beside him bryusov did the same before hogram had always widened in reply as much as he would have to one of his high advisors the minimal widening he gave the humans now told how their status had changed we have come as you asked us to come clanfather tolmasov said let hogram remember who needed whom now yes i asked you to come hogram said tolmasov watched him closely looking for any color change but hogram was far too wily to let his skin reveal his feelings i want you to explain once more not just to me but to all my councilors here how the rifle for which we paid such a great price failed to help us defeat the omalo so you want to say everything is our fault do you tolmasov thought it made hogram seem very human but the pilot did not intend to let him get away with it honored clanfather am i wrong then he asked innocently if we humans not come down in your domain you stay on this side of ervis gorge not send males across though hogram stayed green several of his advisors turned a furious yellow we thought wed surely win with your weapon one of them shouted instead instead hogram broke in instead those skarmer males who are not dead are reaturs captives and fralk my eldest of eldest is slain as my eldest died years ago the domain must now pass to lorkis my second who is far from ready to take mastery and i am old so he may have to do so at any time honored clanfather one of our males also died east of ervis gorge a sixth part of all our numbers bryusov said sooner all you humans than fralk hogram said the rest of the minervans shouted agreement tolmasov wished for the kalashnikov again hogram in war nothing is sure not with rifle not without he said he could not talk prettily in the skarmer speech the way bryusov could but he knew he talked plain clear sense but you should be glad some humans still alive on this side of ervis gorge and on other side why is that now when his words were quiet and controlled hogram did start to turn yellow why should i not wish i had never seen any of you tolmasov took out his radio because of this honored clanfather from this we learn what happen to your army long before you find out otherwise and what we learn we tell you and because of thisbryusov pointed to the radio you can bargain with the omalo on the east side of the gorge what might reatur do to your captive males if we the other humans on that side of the gorge and through us you did not speak up for kindness the audience chamber grew silent all hograms males were related to one another more or less closely all felt the anguish of having so many of their kin at their enemys mercy none of them tolmasov was sure considered that those males would not have been in that predicament had they not invaded reaturs domain back on earth the germans still whined about how their pows were treated during the great patriotic war hogram was green again tolmasov was sure his brief show of anger had been just that a show when he had summoned the russians to come before him he had ordered them to bring a radio he knew he would have to dicker with reatur and needed his underlings to know it too yes hogram was a wily one how much that would help remained to be seen reatur held most of the cards to say nothing of the skarmer warriors to save our males i will speak with the omalo domain master unless anyone here objects hogram said he waited no one objected he waved a threefingered hand at tolmasov please have the other humans summon reatur i will try honored clanfather the pilot said he knew perfectly well that reatur was not at the americans beck and call let alone hograms when the domain masters summons came he had asked irv levitt if reatur would make himself available levitt had promised to try to arrange it now was the time to see if he had come through tolmasov spoke into the radio ready with the relay shota mikheilovich rustaveli was back at the orange tent the more powerful transmitter there could reach across jotun canyon da go ahead he answered after a moment soviet minerva expedition calling athena tolmasov said in english bryusov translated for the minervans the reply was prompt zdrast ye sergei konstantinovich irv levitt here what can i do for you speaking english tolmasov did not have to try to remember irvs patronymic the domain master hogram wishes to speak to the domain master reatur hetolmasov picked his words carefullyseeks terms for ending the ah hostilities between them if reatur didnt even want to talk tolmasov preferred not to think about that it would wreck the leverage he had on hogram reatur will talk with hogram sergei konstantinovich irv said in russian as the pilot felt a relieved grin stretch across his face irv went on in dry english we managed to talk him into it because he feels he owes us one but your fellow better not ask for muchhes not very happy about westerners right now the american anthropologist had style tolmasov thought getting his warning across in a language none of the skarmer could speak then reaturs contralto came from the speaker using the trade talk tolmasov had trouble following himself what have you to say for yourself hogram the old skarmer domain master waddled up to tolmasov who held the radio near his mouth only that we tried and lost reatur what else can i say you hold my males i hope he hesitated then went on i hope you are treating them better than we might have treated yours had we won some of hograms advisors went blue with fear as he said that bryusov gave tolmasov an appalled look the pilot kept his face blank he knew hogram was gambling but thought it a good gamble reatur would recognize and scorn false sweetness honesty might sway him theyre not harmed for now reatur said after a short thoughtful pause its up to you to persuade me to keep them that way put it like this hogramwhy should i go on feeding all those males who are not mine hogram sighed because imy domainwill pay to keep them safe how much that was one short word in trade talk maybe the basic word of trade talk how much do you want hogram asked how much do you offer if its enough i may listen to you if not reatur let the sentence trail away hogram sighed again even tolmasov who had had scant experience bargaining before he landed among these capitalist aliens could see the cunning behind that ploy hogram could not afford to be miserly not if he wanted to see his warriors againand not knowing reaturs price for certain he would have to be doubly extravagant to make sure he met it first i will give you goods enough to pay the cost of mainmining my males from now until the flood subsides in ervis gorge we can work out later exactly how much that is but i will pay it what do i care about goods later when i have trouble coming up with food now to keep them alive till then hogram widened himself very slightly to tolmasov who dipped his head in response the domain master spoke into the radio since you now dominate the domain to your north i trust you will be able to come up with supplies you know that do you reatur started talking his own language which tolmasov did not speak at all he heard irv answer in the same tongue the american sounded placating tolmasov chuckled thinking thats what you get for bragging to me about how wonderal your client is the omalo domain master returned to trade talk well what of it still easier for me to rid myself of my captives than go to the bother of caring for them that was only a token of good intentions hogram said to assure you that forbearance will not harm your domain above it for my males safe return i will paycurse it reatur i will pay that same amount twice more may your eyestalks rot if you try to melt more out of me it is not a small price reatur admitted will you include in it hmm at least three eighteens of trade goods you have got from your humans of at least ah nine different types hogram turned yellow tolmasov did not blame him reatur had all too good a grip on how the arrival of humans was changing minerva but the skarmer chieftain said what he had to say i will now tell me reatur said why you want me to feed and houseand guardyour warriors until fall because when the flood subsides by your leave we will stretch the bridge across ervis gorge once more our males can cross to our side and we will send payment to you in return send the payment first reatur said promptly i trust you no more than you trust me hogram retorted send the males first no hogram turned yellow again he did not answer wed best do something bryusov whispered to tolmasov tile pilot nodded the spectacle of russians and americans helping minervans fight a war had done nothing for the prestige of the soviet union or the united states back home helping minervans make peace might possibly repair it but the silence was getting icya good word for silence on minerva tolmasov thought suggest they takes turns tolmasov whispered back do it in trade talk so theyll both understand bryusov by now was fairly fluent in the local lingua franca honored domain masters the linguist said perhaps if some males are freed then some of the payment made then more males freed perhaps hogram said thoughtfully a third of the males a third of the payment and so on first you pay then we release males reatur said and we will do it in six turns not three if we tried it the other way round you could cheat us out of the last third of the payment and leave us with no arm of yours to grab tolmasov waited for hogram to get angry again instead the skarmer domain master wiggled his eyestalks he said you are wasted as an omalo reatur you should have been budded as one of us no im no thief hogram my job is keeping thieves in line irv levitt quickly cut in in english hes laughing is your boy yes tolmasov answered and switched to the skarmer tongue to let hogram know what the american had said hogram waved an indulgent armhe had known without being told tolmasov felt annoyed then resigned the skarmer domain master spoke into the radio do we agree yes provided we can work out the cost of feeding the captives each day reatur said if not i suppose i can always start getting rid of them if that was humor tolmasov thought it was in poor taste hogram did not seem put out we will work it out he said are we finished then i think so reatur answered this time bryusov interrupted without tolmasovs prompting honored domain masters while you talk with each other now why not pledge not to fight each other anymore so long as you both abide by todays agreement what a foolish pledge that would be hogram said reatur and i do not spring from the same bud we are not friends we may well go to war again and we both know it why lie now for once we agree skarmer reatur said and who can say on which side of ervis gorge the fight may be we can make baskets that float on water too you know now that weve seen some hogram made a whistling noise tolmasov had never heard from a minervan before one that reminded him of a teapot coming to a boil none of my males grasps the importance of new things as quickly as you do now thatnow that fralk is dead i wish you were of my budding reatur i would name you eldestdesignate dealing with humansreatur said it in english tolmasov put it into russian for the skarmerhas taught me more about new things than i ever expected to know yes hogram stepped away from the radio he told tolmasov that is all levitt are you there the pilot called when the american answered he went on we have a success to report it seems yes theyll be relieved back home irv answered in english i dont think people back home could stomach a coldblooded prisoner massacre he let the obvious joke lie tolmasov respected him because of it this was business come to that im not sure i could either out was all tolmasov said he and bryusov bowed their way out of hograms presence and started back toward their big orange tent foolish the americans foolish and soft bryusov said after a while one deals with whomever one has to deal with they talk softer than they are valery aleksandrovich never forget it tolmasov had had that same swift flash of contempt for irv levitt but changed his mind after a little thought for one thing as you said levitt would go right on dealing with reatur no matter what reatur did he may not want to admit it to himself but he would and for another before you call them soft remember what happened to fralk and oleg lopatin i am trained as a combat pilot but i would not care to attack a kalashnikov with a glorified hang glider bryusov was very quiet for the rest of the walk that suited tolmasov fine emmett bragg was hurrying up the corridor when sarah came through the airlock into athena he stopped and grinned at hex with the peculiarly male grin that never failed to set her teeth on edge will you stop it she hissed anyone who sees you will know exactly what that stupid expression means the grin didnt go away nobody here but you and me oh that hadnt happened since the day of the battle since then sarah had stayed close to irv most of the time partly because they both spent a lot of time with lamra and partly because it kept her from having to think about those frantic minutes on pats mattress irv seemed happy enough to be with her too they had probably spent more continuous waking time together since lamras budlings dropped than in all the previous months on minerva put together now she would have to think about those minutes let it slide emmett all right in similar circumstances irv she was sure would have come back with a raunchy pun emmett just stood there warrioralert and waited for her to go on that her first thought was of irv told her some of what she needed to know not that it wasnt good while it happened but but what he stepped closer emmett she heard her voice get shrill that infuriated her but she couldnt help it if he went ahead regardless of whether she wanted him to she would try to give him a dreadful surprise but he was bigger stronger a trained soldier of all the nightmares shell had about being cooped up on athena with too many people in too small a space for too long this was the worst smooth as ever he moved away from her then he started to laugh whats so goddamn funny she barked angrier than ever you gearin up to kick me right where itll do the most good you dont need to do that have i ever gone any place i wasnt welcome youd know better than i would but that wasnt fair either not with me sarah admitted all right then probably better this way anyhow that cool calculation of risk was emmett to the core she did her best to imitate him i think youre right for the ship and foreverything else suppose so he cocked his head studied her do you really think you couldve stopped me no she answered honestly but i was going to give it my best shot i noticed okaycant ask for more than that now im gonna get back to work he headed toward the control room never looking back for all he showed he and sarah might have been at the office water cooler talking about the weather she envied his detachment and had no idea how to duplicate it come on peri throw me the ball lamra shouted throw it to me its my turn this time i want to play too peri threw the ball to another mate lamra hurried over toward that one still trying to get into the game no you cant have it the mate said she threw the ball to someone else you cant play with us anymore lamra youre too ugly thats right peri said youve got holes in you from where your budlings fell out and with them falling out you shouldnt even be here you should have ended like mates are supposed to do who ever heard of an old mate who ever heard of an old mate who ever heard of an old mate a bunch of mates maybe even an eighteen of them formed a jeering ring around lamra sunyellow with fury she rushed at them but they skipped aside jeering still and even if she had managed to catch one what good would it have done the rest would all pile on her before she could get any of her own back sometimes she wondered if letting the humans save her had been a good idea down deep she hadnt really expected them to do it before when she had thought about what would come after she just thought about going on as she always had about running around and playing with the other mates without the big budling bulges getting in her way but the others didnt want to play with her not anymore who ever heard of an old mate who ever heard of an old mate they were so busy making fun of lamra they hardly noticed the door to the mates chambers opening whats going on here reatur shouted he was as yellow as lamra but his rage was not helpless like hers some of the mates turned blue and ran away others held their ground we dont want her here peri yelled at the domain master she should go away you go away right now reatur cried in a terrible voice he turned all his eyestalks toward the wall three arms away from peri her bravado collapsed she went from yellow to blue so fast she wasnt even green between then tled with a squeak reatur let his eyes look all around again that doesnt help you know lamra said sadly you cant make them like me reatur as soon as youre gone this will just start again will it reatur said does it every time lamra hesitated then went on i thought it would get better i mean im not as oddlooking as i used to be i dont have tape all over me and i dont have those big bandages stuck where the budlings came out but it isnt any better not with the other mates i guess im still too strange i think my runnerpest is the only thing that likes me anymore she opened a hand and looked down at the toy reatur had given her that is not true the domain master said i like you you know yes of course i know that lamra said after all you made the runnerpest andand she stopped when she realized the size of the compliment he had paid her widening herself was the least she could do and she did it then she blurted but youre not here to like me very often that is also true reatur said slowly i cannot be here all the time though not if i intend to run the domain too he paused a while in thought shall i gather all the mates together and tell them they have to treat you just like anyone else for a moment hope tingled through lamra she wondered if that would work i dont think so she said at last sadly theyll just be angry at me for getting them into trouble andim not just like them anymore am i im only like me and im lonesome i know you are theres never been a mate like you before reatur thought again himself then went on which means the laws that hold other mates dont necessarily put fingerclaws on you so what clanfather talk about laws meant nothing to lamra mates lived as they lived and that was all there was to it so perhaps reaturs voice trailed away when he resumed lamra wondered whether he was talking to himself or to her so perhaps just perhaps now it might be all right for you to go outside the mates chambers and livewell almost as if you were a male i suppose he sounded surprised at where his mouth was taking him but went on anyhow would you like that lamra i dont know the idea was so alien to her she could hardly take it in she seized on the part of it closest to her troubles and asked will males like me better than mates do i dont know reatur said some will some wont i expect thats the way it usually is some people dont like anything strange and different but i think your chance is better now than it would be another time what with the humans still being here things are already so strange that you may be just one oddity among many thats better than what i am now here lamra thought some more you mean ill be able to see and touch and smell all the things on the other side of that door as many of them as you want for all her life that door had marked the end of lamras universe she saw the outside world faintly through the sandy ice that let light into the mates chambers to mingle with those moving shapes though to find out what they truly were come on she said and hurried toward the door the slits of skin that had opened to let out her budlings flapped as she ran they were healing together slowly and raggedly she would never have quite the same smooth upanddown lines as before she had begun to bud no matter how long she lived reatur followed her open he told the guard on the far side of the door lamra heard the male lift the bar from the brackets that held it before the door opened the domain master said you can still change your mind you know why would i want to do that lamra asked the door started to swing open the first glimpse she had of the world beyond it gave her answer that corridor seemed to stretch on forever though it was only a tiny part of the castle and outside the castle was the whole world unimaginably big unimaginably strange for a moment staying where she was knowing everythingand everyone around her felt like the only safe thing to do but strangeness had already come in through that door had it not she would not be standing here turning blue with fright at the prospect of going out air hissed through her breathing pores come on she said again not an excited squeal this time but determined even so let me go first lamra moved aside so reatur could pass the guard started to shut the door after the domain master wait please orth reatur said sorry clanfather did one of the humans go in before my duty started orth poked an eyestalk around the edge of the door no he answered himself seeing only lamra no reatur agreed he paused as if he too was having second thoughts but when he resumed he spoke firmly this is the mate lamra the one the humans saved when she dropped her budlings as you can see she will not be ready to have buds planted on her again for some time if ever i am going to bring her out of the mates chambers into the world treat her as you would a male of the same age clanfather orth sounded so shocked lamra wondered if he would leave the door open for her he did perhaps he was too surprised not to his eyestalks kept moving back and forth between reatur and lamra she widened herself as much as she could far wider than she made herself for reatur these days hello orth she said barring humans she had never talked to any male but reatur before orth reatur prompted hello the guard managed to say his eyestalks returned to the domain master a mate out by herself living like a male forgive me clanfather but not even a massiherder living off by himself with a couple of mates would let them run loose how could he they dont know enough not to get into mischief and then orth suddenly seemed to realize lamra was a person of sorts even if a mate and then theyre uh done he finished weakly they die before they learn enough not to get into mischief you mean because they drop their budlings reatur said lamra has dropped her budlings and isnt dead she can learn she has time to learn orth stood silent hello lamra said again in a soft voice orth didnt answer he doesnt like me lamra thoughtnobody likes me out here either she started to go back into the mates chambers with the mates at least she could remind herself how foolish they were but grownup males werent foolish she knew that if they didnt like her maybe she wasnt worth liking but reatur said come along and started down the corridor she found herself following him he was the one link with certainty she had left whats that she exclaimed a little later pointing into a small room she had expected to see different things outside the mates chambers but none so different as theanimal monster in there reatur wiggled his eyestalks for yearsfor longer than youve been alivei wondered the same thing i found it in the hills not far from here turns out the humans made it its one of their gadgets fancier than most oh lamra said then there were humans so long ago i hadnt thought of that reatur looked at her i hadnt either not in that way they certainly never showed themselves till this past spring but you never can tell with humans no you cant lamra said because if you could i wouldnt be here with you now males walked by as lamra stood in the doorway peering at the human gadget they peered at her too none of them spoke to her though or even to reatur about her she wondered if they were trying to pretend she didnt exist she squeezed her runnerpest the pressure of it in her hand reminded her she was real then a male said well well what have we here you must be lamra he was talking to her she widened herself and stammered yyes i am who are you im ternat reaturs eldest are you ah doing well lamra you must find this whole business about as odd as we do someone who understood someone who wasnt reatur or a human but understood so that could happen imbetter now thank you very much ternat good ternat turned an eyestalk toward reatur why did you decide to bring her out clanfather the mates were harassing her the domain master answered males will too i fear but theyll have the sense to obey me when i tell them to stop and theyre grown they wont try to hurt her just because shes different or if anyone does the example i make of him will show the others its not a good idea lamra widened herself to reatur this time thank you for thinking ahead and looking out for me clanfather you dont know how to look out for yourself yet lamra i expect youll learn some males get to be old and saggyskinned without ever figuring it out reaturs eyestalks twitched in fact theres one of just that sort id like you to meet he started down the corridor then paused to wave an encouraging arm to ternat you come too eldest i think youll enjoy this the domain master led lamra out through an open door suddenly she realized no walls were anywhere nearby she stopped walking and watched herself turn blue is this outside she asked faintly she felt like a speck of dust floating in the middle of infinite space yes it is reatur said what do you think of it he did not mention her color itsvery big so it is come on now we dont have far to go and off he went ternat beside him lamra had a choice of staying frozen while the two people in the world who cared about her went away or of going after them she took a step then another and another they came ever more easily reatur went outside all the time she thought and it didnt hurt him it probably wouldnt hurt her either but there was so much of it several eighteens of malesmore eighteens than lamra could easily countmilled about in a large pen made of branches others these carrying spears stood all around the pen these are the males from dordals domain that ternat captured reatur explained wed send them back but for some reasonhis eyestalks wiggled brieflydordals eldest grevil isnt interested in paying for them one of the males a large impressive one near the edge of the pen was saying in a loud voice all this talk of humans lamra knew mates who pronounced the word better than he didbores me no end theyre weird things true enough but what can they really do im tired of hearing impossible lies and fables hello dordal reatur said so you want to know what humans can do eh here let me present you to the mate lamra the humans saved her when she dropped her budlings not long after ternat captured you dordals eyestalks jounced up and down with humor that was obviously forced tell me another tale reatur then one of those moving eyes lit on lamra it is a mate he said in surprise id not have thought even one like you would let them run loose but why does it look sotattered i told you dordal you listen about as well as you plan lamra dropped her budlings and the humans kept her from dying afterward thats what happened dordal lamra agreed i was there i ought to know she reached down pulled wide the still partially open flaps of skin that had once bulged over a budling dordal drew back in alarm lamra could not see why only the clamps were still in there and sarah had promised that even they could come out in another few days shell live longer than you will dordal ternat said cheerfully a lot longer if grevil doesnt come up with your ransom soon humans did that dordal muttered he turned blue hurried away from the fence then theyre worse monsters than she is dont let him bother you reatur told lamra he hasnt any more sense than a runnerpest you know lamra squeezed her toy i do know she said unruffled some mates are like that too even ones who got older than i am before they started budding i didnt think it would be true of males too thats all of course the only male ive really known till now is you reatur for some reason she could not fathom the domain master and his eldest started laughing at each other stop it whats funny never mind little one reatur said to ternat he went on you see why i wanted to keep this one because she can tell youre brighter than dordal a nosver could figure out that much disrespectful but reaturs eyestalks were wiggling again no because she thinks about the way things work dont you lamra i try to she said absently she wasnt paying too much attention to the domain master she was too busy looking at the wide wide world or rather at pieces of it if she examined one thing at a time the wideness was less oppressive she pointed whats that thats a lykao shrub reatur said massi like the betlies oh whats that she pointed in a different direction thats an eloc oh it doesnt look much like its meat does it whats that she pointed again but instead of answering reatur pointed at her that is a mate who looks as though shell be wandering around asking questions for the next year now that she has so many new things to ask questions about youre right lamra said happily good heavens irv said what happened to your calculator pat held it up the only thing that held the batteries in was a big piece of duct tape beats me she said i thought i left the stupid thing on my bed a while ago but i found it on the floor with the back smashed to hell you must have stepped on it without noticing irv said how do you not notice something that goes crunch pat retorted speaking of not noticing louise said looking up from a tape she was feeding into the computer for transmission back to earth that calculators been patched since she thought back i guess since the day lamra had her budlings the day of the big battle pat nodded thats right i remember having to fix it right after we all came back from reaturs castle oh irv said well hush my mouth he made as if to pull his head inside his shirt louise pretended to throw the tape cassette at him he ducked everybody in the control room laughed he spread his hands in defeat if thats when it happened i give up none of us will forget anything about that day not if we live to be ninety you better believe it louise said irv remembered coming back from the castle too after sarah had sped out there to make sure lamra really was all right he remembered drawing the privacy curtain to their cubicle afterward so he and sarah could celebrate her being alive lamras being alive everyones being alive and he remembered a pinkpurple notquitemark notquitebruise in the middle of her left buttock at the time he had thought nothing of it hed had other more immediate things on his mind but he remembered and it occurred to him now that mark had been just about the size and shape of pats calculator so what had sarah been doing that involved lying on a calculator or maybe lying on one and then say throwing it to the floor the only answer irv came up with was the immediately obvious one and with whom the answer to that was immediately obvious too sarah liked men at least in situations wherewhere one might be apt to lie on a calculator irv thought the joke he tried to make fell flat though he only told it to himself another question filled his mind what the hell am i going to do about this unlike the couple that had preceded it that one had no immediately obvious answer confronting emmett struck him as either useless or suicidal depending on how much he annoyed the pilot confronting sarahoh thatd be real good he said to himself youd even have to lie to claim the moral advantage he glanced over at pat then at louise so far as he knew she hadnt done anything she wasnt supposed to with anybody but if emmett had she was affected too great irv muttered two count em two unsanctioned bellybumps and the whole damn crew was involved or was it just two on reflection i decided it probably was since the day of the battle sarah had stuck a lot tighter to him than had been her habit before maybe she had all the same regrets he did he hoped so partly for the sake of their marriage and partly just because he wanted someone else to be as confused as he was the psychologists back home had warned about this kind of thing for exactly these reasons one of the rare times the psychologists were dead right irv thought so of course nobody paid attention to them he laughed a little under his breath it was funny in a frenchmovie sort of way then he sobered in french movies sooner or later everybody found out what was going on and the fur really started to fly that could happen here too from the same kind of accidental revelation he had just had he hoped it wouldnt but it could and wouldnt that be wonderful he didnt realize he had spoken more or less out loud until pat said what nothing he said firmly i was just thinking it ought to be an interesting flight home snow swirled around ternat fall was here early this year he thought under most circumstances that would have made him happy he had no more use for summer heat than reatur did now though he was looking for something and the snow made it hard to find his feet scraped ice were down to the very bottom of the gorge he told the males with him the frozen patch he was standing on and others he knew to be nearby were all that was left of the summer floods how are we supposed to find the end of a rope in the middle of all this grumbled one of his companions we could look from now till the next flood comes through and washes us away the skarmer said it would be easy when their humans talked with ours ternat said of course the skarmer have been known to lie theyd better not try it now said the male who had complained not while we still hold their warriors the rest of the band growled agreement exactly ternat said so we have to figure the cursed thing is around here someplace lets spread out a little and see what we can come up with we have to try to keep each other in sightwe dont want to go straggling up the side of the gorge by ones and two as if we were so many of dordals males eyestalks twitched the loud male yelled if dordals males act like that its because he went home all by himself the laughter grew when grevil refused for the third time to ransom the northern domain master reatur had released him without payment the civil war brewing between dordal and his disloyal eldest showed the wisdom of the move ternat wondered if he would have thought of it the males formed a circle as if they were warriors bracing to meet an attack from all sides but this circle was wider to let them search more ground and still stay in touch with one another they moved forward slowly cautiously people seldom went down to the bottom of ervis gorge and of course it was never the same from one flood to the next anyhow anything might be here ternat was glad he had a spear the male to one side of him suddenly stopped whats that funny noise he said suspicion thick in his voice ternat listened heard only the wind he went over to the other male who pointed and said its coming from over there i think ternat listened again now he also heard the strange rhythmic thump twang and tinkle for a moment he thought of the beasts legend put in the depths of the gorge beasts that could lure a male to destruction then his eyestalks wiggled in relief thats human music he said theres a human down here the male said incredulously i doubt it ternat said they have gadgets that make music for them my guess is that the skarmer put one by their rope so the noise would guide us a good idea i must say pretty sneaky if you ask me the male said as he would have about anything skarmer but then he shouted along with reaturs eldest to let the rest of the band know what they had found ternats prediction proved good the gadget sat on a large rock like a fair number of human gadgets it looked like a box ternat wondered how the humans knew this box made music instead of say pictures he let his arms and eyestalks shrug in and out one more thing about humans he would probably never learn the box had a handle tied to the handle was a thin string this is what we came for ternat said we have to be careful now so we dont break it on the way back the other end of the string was nowhere in sight ternat knew that eventually back toward the skarmer side of ervis gorge it would join a cord the cord a rope the rope a thicker rope and so on by increments until it linked to the massive cordage of the bridge that would once more span the gorge his small band though could scarcely have moved that massive final rope let alone hauled it back to the stones to which it would be attached thus the lighter precursors getting them to the attachment point where a goodsized crew waited would be easy what are you going to do with the box a male asked keep it ternat replied at once it can be part of hograms first payment to get his miserable males back and if he doesnt like that too bad maybe our humans can tell us if its good for anything besides their funny music me dont know that i want to be linked up to the skarmer anymore not after this summer a male said we can always cut the rope again you know ternat said not till we get all those cursed hungry skarmer out of our domain another male put in i know well be fat this winter with what hograms sending us but its only right weve been thin up to now what with them eating up so much of our food and dordals said yet another who had accompanied ternat on the raid into the northerners domain lets not forget all those greasyfat massi we brought back with us hograms males didnt complain about the way they tasted hograms males werent in a position to complain about anything ternat said theyre just glad weve fed them at all and do you know what theyre lucky we have the band shouted agreement ternat still wondered if keeping the prisoners alive had been a good idea had the humans not urged otherwise he was sure reatur would have massacred the skarmer the ransom the domain master was squeezing out of hogram was more than enough to pay for the cost of maintaining the captives but was it enough to compensate for having to look at them all through summer and fall enough to compensate for remembering all the damage they had done the lives they had taken ternat did not know where was the scale on which to balance such weights reatur had accepted his eldest trusting him supposed that was good enough he lifted the string come on time to go home xi here sarah said dumping the jingling metal clamps in front of reatur i other humans show you now many times how to use to save mates wish i had more to give you use as you think best often i hope her shiver had nothing to do with the cold though the weather was down to minnesota winter and heading straight for antarctica half a dozen clamps as many as she could spare from her medical supplies the thought of doing say an appendectomy in freefall on the way home gave her cold chills but far worse was the thought of what happened to all mates on minerva and how those six little clamps could help she wished she had six thousand or six million i will use them sarah reatur said i have spoken with you of the sorrow of the mates have i not she nodded yes reatur you have i thought so males have felt it for as long as there have been males and mates now i have a chance to get free of it the first of all my kind i will take that chance i also wish you had more clamps but perhaps it is for the best this way these clamps will end by changing our world as much as the spring floods change ervis gorge like the floods such changes should start slowly i think sarah nodded again this time reluctantly likely that is wise to her even one mates dying without need was tragedy worse than the sorrow the domain master knew when such death was inevitable on the other hand she knew that turning such a basic of minervan life upside down overnight would bring plenty of dislocations of its own if anyone could safely steer between extremes she thought reatur could he had a knack for finding the right questions to ask maybe lamra got it from him now he came up with another one might we also use these clamps to keep alive say eloc mates as well to keep our herds large sarah rubbed her chin in consideration and discovered she could barely feel it if no mateno mate of your peoplewill drop budlings before you can take clamps off animal then yes otherwise no if you want to save own mates ah reatur said that is sensible yes well sarah i will say that all this has worked out better than i thought it would lamra has been if not accepted at least tolerated by my males and the more mates we have who survive budding the greater the chance the males will have to get used to them i hope so sarah said she had her doubts though lamra was unique and being unique created scant antagonism some of reaturs males in fact regarded her with almost superstitious awe that would change when saved mates grew common how it would change sarah was not sure but if minervans reacted like people it probably would not change for the better the domain master cut into her thoughts i understand you humans will be leaving soon yes before too much snow drifts around uh flying house then reatur surprised sarah why not wait until the snow begins to melt next spring i would like to have you stay she bowed i thank you but no cannot do not enough of our food for one thing also have to leave before certain time this winter no matter what orbital mechanics she knew meant nothing to reatur he sighed you do what you must of course but i will miss you he widened himself to her she bowed again i miss you too all us humans miss you but must go back to our home maybe you will come back one day reatur asked did he sound hopeful sarah wondered if she was reading too much into his voice she didnt think so i like to see you again like to see your eldest again like to see lamra again that thought did warm her despite the worse than icy chill of reaturs castle then reality returned other humans come one day reatur i think i hope so she said sadly but not us not me hard for us to come herewill be turn of other humans next time we do let it be as it will then the domain master wiggled his eyestalks catching sarah by surprise tell the humans back at your home that i am sorry i broke their fancy picturemaking machine all those years ago when i saw it i thought it was a monster when i saw you humans i thought you were monsters too but it is not so i tell them reatur sarah felt tears come into her eyes angrily she brushed them away with the back of her glove they were worse than foolish she thoughtin this weather they were dangerous just what she would need trying to explain to the domain master how and why her eyelashes were freezing together good thank you once more also for the clamps and for flying so bravely against the skarmer with the riflean episode sarah would have been happy to forgetand thank you for lamra sarah bowed very low this time again fighting back tears reatur lamra makes for me this long trip worth doing even if dammit she added silently i wasnt there when the budlings dropped she didnt think she would ever stop kicking herself over what she had been doing some of that time much too late to change it now though the domain master asked can lamra bud again sarah she blinked he did have a girl for the telling question and she hadnt looked ahead in that particular direction she gave him the only answer she could not know reatur only a thought he shrugged a minervan shrug with arms and eyestalks even if so i wonder if i should risk her again without you humans here to help care for her but i like the idea of more budlings from her could they be got in safety not know reatur sarah repeated with a last bow she went on must go back to flying house now to help get ready to go home she almost hoped reatur would want to talk more it was freezing inside the castle but it was freezing and windy outside but the domain master waved her on sighing she fixed her hood so only her eyes showed then trudged out into the latest blizzard the small sun shone bravely in the greenblue sky glittering off endless miles of snow the snow fell on athena no less than on the ground irv levitt who was sweeping it off the spacecrafts left wing leaned on his pushbroom and asked how long do they think the weather will hold two days emmett said which means our next launch window to rendezvous with the rocket motors upstairs is this afternoon i intend to use it were early but yeah irv said he understood that but perfectly well another storm like the last one and athena wouldnt just be covered with snow it would be buried in snownot ideal circumstances for liftoff he started sweeping again his answer had been short for another reason too he still wasnt anywhere near comfortable around emmett it would have been a lot worse he knew had sarah seemed to want a return engagement with the mission commander as far as he could tellhow far was that a question often in his mindshe didnt he kept his distance from emmett anyhow how well that would work once athena was in space was another question everybody would be in everybody elses pockets again and everybody as he knew only too well had good reason to be angry at somebody they were all supposed to be very civilized people he hoped the psych tests were right because they were going to need to be very civilized at least till they got home from the other wing pat called done here good emmett said he peered through snow goggles toward athenas tail where sarah and louise were also busy with brooms now were getting down to what the deicers can handle irv saw the pilot glance his way but kept on pushing his broom no he thought he was wrong poor pat didnt have a reason to be angry at anyone except the russians or the skarmer or whoever had killed frank but thanks to him sarah had plenty of reason to be mad at her which amounted to the same thing one of the better reasons for monogamy that nobody ever talked about he thought as he shoved snow off the wing was how bloody complicated everything else got when he looked up again the wing was clean sarah and louise brooms shouldered like rifles were marching in step up athenas fuselage laughing as they came if louise knew what he knew oh shut up he told himself fiercely for a wonder the internal dialogue did lets button this bird up emmett said he waved the rest of them into athena ahead of him irv was stowing his brooms when the airlock doors clanged shut first the outer then the inner he had heard those clangs hundreds of times but this time they were special the doors would not open again not on minerva the crew trooped forward into the control cabin the seat irv had used for months was again suddenly an acceleration couch in his mind at least were used to gravity this time he said taking off wont be the hideous shock landing was shall we call the russians and tell era goodbye emmett said he was not looking for an answer he had already picked up the microphone athena calling tsiolkovsky athena calling tsiolkovsky here rustaveli speaking bragg switched to russian zdrastye shota mikheilovich could you patch me through to colonel tolmasov we are lifting off this afternoon i want to pass on my respects before we go so you give us the honor of staying longer on minerva than you eh rustaveli paused perhaps to think of more english words perhaps merely to set up his reply you may as well the only thing anyone will remember is that you landed first bragg grinned is that a kind thing to say no only a true one do you deny it rustaveli said a moment later he added in a different tone i have colonel tolmasov go ahead sergei konstantinovich good day brigadier bragg what can i do for you as usual tolmasovs english was excellent but bloodless not a thing thank you this is just a call to let you know we are lifting off this afternoon are you surprise brought a bit of life to the russian pilots voice snow bragg said simply ah yes quite the hills south of hograms domain have thus far shielded us from the worst of it but i do not think that will last much longer here either the best of luck to you brigadier i expect we shall have a good deal to say to each other when we finally meet back on earth i expect we will bragg hesitated went on better to meet on account of this than in our planes eh sergei konstantinovich yes tolmasov said at once and yet youd like to fly against me anyhow da youre a pilot back where emmett couldnt see him irv shook his head bragg and tolmasov reminded him of a couple of big cats roaring at each other across a moat after emmett signed off with tolmasov he turned that tigerish tone on his own crew all right people now we check this beast one more time the standard preflight and everything else we can think of they did when at last they were through the pilot sounded almost disappointed as he said looks green lets do it initiate turbojet sequence louise asked crisply initiate emmett said her finger stabbed a button for a moment nothing happened irv glanced at the boards for red lights saw none then through the thick padding of his seat he felt vibration begin muted thunder spoke from athenas engines outside the spacecraft he knew the thunder would be anything but muted i hope reatur has everyone well back the way he promised he said if they werent a minute ago i guarandamntee you they are now sarah said irv nodded at the same time wondering guarandamntee it sounded more like emmett than his wife but what if it did after two years cooped up like this everyones habits rubbed off on everyone else you worry too much he told himself and worried some more power buildup emmett asked he was watching the readouts as closely as louise but was too conscientious a pilot not to follow routine nominal she answered going through the ritual with him the thunder grew thrust optimum for taxiing louise declared emmett shoved the stick forward irv had just started to wonder if the landing gear deicers were doing their job when he saw the landscape start to slide backward in the monitor and felt the soft irregular bumps that said athena wasnt taking off from one of houstons glasssmooth runways kicked up snow made the view aft screen a meaningless white blur the snow ahead hid surprises too far from being soft one of the bumps made irvs teeth click together the whole spacecraft shuddered come on now emmett said as if gentling a restive horse like a horse responding to its rider athena leapt ahead leapt airborne emmett yelled the ground dropped away in the monitors but whumpings and bumpings went on landing gear retracting retracted louise said simultaneously killing one of irvs worries and making him feel foolish lord i forgot about the stupid wheels pat said relief in her voice irv grinned embarrassment like misery loved company heading onetwotwo onetwofive onetwoseven louise reported as emmett swung athena around steadying on onetwoseven he answered that was the course the craft would need to rendezvous with the rocket motors waiting in orbit above minerv the noise in the cabin changed tone part of it dropped away theres math one emmett said the monitors showed the sky a deeper bluepurple than it looked even aboard the concorde as irv watched stars began coming out seventy thousand feet louise said and mach two emmett echoed still doesnt fly like a phantom but were haulin he flicked switches the turbines roar died to be replaced by a high fierce whine ramjet running readings within parameters louise said now the monitors that looked up and ahead showed starflecked black below the minervan surface looked more as it did in orbital photos than as if from a plane the engine noise changed again a little computer adjusting ramjet opening for optimum combustion louise reported pretty soon it can adjust till it turns blue and there still wont be any oxygen out there to bum emmett grunted two hundred twenty thousand feet louise said which was a more prosaic way of announcing the same thing two hundred thirty thousand two hundred forty thousand commencing inboard rocket ignition sequence go for it hon emmett agreed irv didnt see louise press the button he just felt as though something kicked him in the ass even harder than he had been kicking himself lately arent you supposed to count down first he wheezed indignantly he couldnt see the gorilla lying on his chest but it was doing its damnedest to cave in his ribs in spite of acceleration emmett braggs voice never wavered irv remembered resenting the mission commander for that when they landed on minerva he tried not to listen then emmett exclaimed orbital velocity achieved the inboard rockets died suddenly irv weighed nothing at all after that imaginary gorilla he should have felt wonderful instead he gulped and swallowed spithis stomach was certainly weightless i have the external rocket pack on radar bearing zerozero two degrees range twentyseven miles and closing louise announced nice burn emmett thanks hon commencing docking maneuver people its officialwere on our way home wonderful irv said anybody have a dramamine right here sarah handed him one he swallowed it dryshe had pills handy but no water after a while his stomach decided it was under control after all by then the big bells of the orbiting rocket motors halffilled the view forward screen home irv breathed and started to believe it it moves lamra exclaimed through thunder as the flying housewalked through the fields she hung on tight to her toy runnerpest the din was terrifying but somehow she was not terrified maybe because she was too interested in what the flying house was doing it goes up this time she could hear the disbelief in her voice and up and up and up her eyestalks followed the flying house as it turned and dwindled in the sky the roar dwindled too the long thin white cloud the flying house left behind began to fray and blow apart just like any other cloud i saw it come down before reatur spoke louder than he needed to lamra supposed he was partly deafened too as she was i suppose i always thought that meant it could also go up again but seeing it is a lot more impressive i never saw it come down i was still cooped up in the mates quarters lamra said a little indignantly she thought back but i remember the noise nobody knew what it was we all thought the castle was falling down so did i little one so did i reatur turned a couple of eyestalks from the daytime star that was all that was left of the flying house to lamra that would have been a little while after i planted your buds on you so it would reatur she agreed consciously imitating his turn of phrase she looked down at herself she still didnt look the way other mates did but the bud bulges were hardly bulges any more and the scars that showed where the raw edges of skin had healed together were only lightcolored ridges above her feet all your budlings are doing well im told reatur said good she answered indifferently she still did not care a lot about budlings seeing how grown males behaved was much more interesting that was how she wanted to learn to act when reatur spoke again he sounded oddly diffident do you think you would be interested in bearing another set of budlings she started to answer then stopped one thing grown males sometimes did she had noticed was to think before they spoke instead of saying the first thing that popped into their minds i dont know she answered at last do you think you would be able to keep me from ending the way the humans did i hope so i think so the domain master said well have had a lot of practice by the time your budlings would be ready to drop thats true lamra said maybe well have more clamps by then too do you think we could find some springy wood say that we can carve new ones out of she didnt know if there was any such wood but the outside world she was finding had all sorts of things in it that she didnt know about maybe reatur said ive thought about that too sooner or later i guess we will need to see if we can make our own why dont you take a clamp and show it to one of our carvers me lamra squeaked in alarm he wouldnt listen to me to whom would he be more likely to listen than to the only mate in all the world who dropped her budlings but lived well she hadnt thought about it like that all right reatur i will good lamra came back to the question reatur had asked before she had hardly thought about budding at all since reatur planted these last six on her she certainly hadnt thought about it since she had dropped them but now reminded she recalled the way her body had driven her toward it she searched herself for that same feeling she did not expect to find it but she didnot with the urgency she had had before perhaps but with enough to be partial to the idea i suppose we can make budlings again she said from what i remember it was fun reaturs eyestalks wiggled for me too lamra well then lets go find someplace quiet and do it she said brisk once her mind was made up now reatur sounded startled then he laughed some more why not there have to be a good many rooms in the castle that dont have anyone in them right now shall we find one they walked back together afterward the domain master was not laughing at all he widened himself to lamra whats that for she demanded she was still uneasy whenever he did it because over the years ive planted buds on many eighteens of mates probably more and ive never felt sensations as strong as i just did with you he mimed tying his eyestalks into knots oh lamra thought about that i was only remembering what liked last time and trying to do more of that now it was reaturs turn to say oh then he asked do you suppose it will be better still after youre healed from your next set of budlings i dont know she said flustered that was further ahead than shed thought reatur was not listening to her anyhow he said dreamily human males and mates both live to grow up all the time what must planting buds be like for them with so much practice on both sides when they come back why dont you ask them lamra said if i live until they come back i will and if i dont live that longhe looked at her with four eyes maybe youll ask them yourself she thought it over maybe i will she said
