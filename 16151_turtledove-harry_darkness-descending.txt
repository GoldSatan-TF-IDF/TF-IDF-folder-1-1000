darkness descending one tealdo slogged west across what seemed an endless sea of grass every so often he or his algarvian comrades would flush a bird from cover theyd raise their sticks to their shoulders and blaze at it as it fled they were ready to blaze at anything sometimes they would flush an unkerlanter from cover unlike the birds the unkerlanters had a nasty habit of blazing back the unkerlanters also had an even nastier habit of staying in cover till a goodsized party of algarvian soldiers had gone by and then blazing at them from behind the ones tealdo and his comrades caught after stunts like that did not go east into captives camps even if they tried to surrender stubborn whoreson sergeant panfilo said dragging one such soldier in rockgray out of his hole once hed been stalked and slain his coppery side whiskers and waxed mustachios were sadly draggled dont know what he thought he was doing but he isnt going to do it anymore he wounded two of ours one of them pretty bad tealdo said i suppose he figuredor his commanders figuredthats fair exchange his own mustache and little chin beard about as red as panfilos could also have used sprucing up no matter how fastidious you wanted to be you couldnt stay neat in the field from up ahead captain galafrone called come on you lazy bastards weve got a long way to go before we can take it easy unkerlant isnt much of a kingdom but its cursed big and thats the other thing this fellow was doing tealdo said stirring the dead unkerlanter with his foot slowing us down i mean panfilo swept off his hat and gave tealdo a sardonic bow i thank you for your explanation my lord marshal or are you perhaps pretending to be the king never mind tealdo said arguing with his sergeant didnt pay neither did showing panfilo up they started marching west again toward a column of smoke that marked a burning village a young lieutenant with soot streaking his face came up to galafrone and said sir will you order in your men to rout out the last of those miserable unkerlanters in there galafrone frowned i dont much like to do it id sooner leave em behind and push on if we fight for every miserable little village well run out of men before king swemmel does but if we pass them all by theyll harass us from behind the lieutenant said then he noticed that galafrone while wearing a captains badges had none that proclaimed him a noble the young officers lip curled i dont suppose commoners can be expected to have the spirit to understand such things galafrone knocked him down when he started to get up the veteran knocked him down again and kicked him for good measure i dont suppose they teach juniors to respect their superior officers these days he remarked in conversational tones but youve just learned that lesson havent you sir the lieutenant wheezed and then aye sir when he got up again galafrone let him he took a deep breath before resuming sir you may not care for my tonewhich was tealdo judged a pretty fair understatementbut the question remains how can we leave the unkerlanters behind us theyll wither on the vine once we pass them by galafrone said weve got to knock this whole kingdom flat not fight through it one village at a time if we dont capture the villages sirthe young lieutenant was careful now to speak with all due military formality but did not back away from his own viewhow are we going to knock the kingdom flat despite the fellows earlier insolence tealdo thought it a decent question galafrone didnt hesitate in answering it galafrone as far as tealdo could see rarely hesitated about anything weve got to smash the big armies he said these little village garrisons are just nuisances and theyll be bigger nuisances if we let them he waved to indicate a path around the village come on men he called raising his voice weve got to press on captain the lieutenant said stiffly i must protest and i shall report your conduct to higher authority galafrone gave him a wave of invitation so elegant any noble might have envied it go right ahead if you care to let people know your favorite way to knock down a stone wall is by ramming it with your head thats your affair he waved again this time getting his company moving in the direction he judged best the lieutenant watched them go his hands on his hips the picture of exasperated frustration coming up alongside of trasone tealdo said i hope those unkerlanters dont break out of there and kick us in the arse when were looking the other way aye i can think of things id like better trasone agreed he pointed ahead toward a tangled wood of oaks and elms i can think of things i like better than heading through that too powers above only know what the unkerlanters have got lurking in there several unpleasant possibilities crossed tealdos mind evidently they crossed galafrones mind too for the captain ordered a halt now he looked unhappy they could have a whole regiment in among those trees he said i dont care to bypass them not even a little i dont his face grew longer still maybe that cursed lieutenant wasnt as stupid as i thought now tealdo did see him have trouble making up his mind before he could give any orders a man emerged from the woods tealdo threw himself flat and had his stick aimed ready to send a beam at the fellow before noticing he wore tunic and kilt of light brownalgarvian uniformnot an unkerlanters rockgray long tunic its all right the soldier called in algarvian with a northwestern accent much like tealdos they threw us out of here day before yesterday but not for long a few of the whoresons may still be running around loose off the paths but you shouldnt have any trouble getting through that sounds good enough galafrone said he waved his company forward lets go the sooner were through the sooner we can hit the unkerlanters another lick tealdo rapidly discovered the algarvian soldier whod told him the woods were mostly clear of unkerlanters was a born optimist some paths through the woods were clear the algarvians already in among the trees kept those paths clear by posting guards along them one of the guards called you go off the road to squat in the bushes youre liable to get blazed or get your throat cut or have something worse happen to you who does hold these stinking woods then tealdo called back wherever we are we hold the guard answered eventually theyll run out of food and theyll run out of charges for their sticks then theyll either surrender or try and pretend they were peasants all along in the meantime theyre a cursed nuisance galafrone swore aye maybe that lieutenant did have a point a moment later though he snorted and added besides the one on top of his head i mean thought he was a noble so his shit didnt stink he turned back to his men hurry along you chuckleheads hurry along got to keep moving got to keep moving is right trasone grumbled sounds like were nothing but targets if we dont they turned out to be targets even when they did keep moving a beam slammed into the trunk of an oak in front of tealdo steam hissed out of the hole charred in the living wood it would have hissed out of a hole charred in his living flesh the same way he threw himself off the track and behind a log somewhere behind him a comrade was screaming off to the other side of the path the unkerlanters were shouting hoarse cries of urra urra and king swemmels name repeated again and again more beams hissed through the air above tealdos head giving it the smell it had just after lightning struck from behind a nearby bush trasone called im sure glad we cleared the whoresons out of these woods they must have been standing on each others shoulders in here before we came through and did it oh aye tealdo hunkered down lower behind his log as the shouting on the other side of the path got louder and now theyre going to try and throw us out again still shouting urra unkerlanters swarmed across the path tealdo blazed one down but then had to scramble back frantically to keep from being cut off and surrounded all at once he understood how the forthwegians and sibians and valmierans and jelgavansaye and the unkerlanters toomust have felt when king mezentios armies struck them he would sooner have done without the lesson mezentio and the algarvian generals had outplanned their foes as well as beaten them on the battlefield the unkerlanters here in this stretch of wood showed no such inspired generalship all they had were numbers and ferocity tealdo tripped over a root and fell headlong those were liable to be enough rally by squads captain galafrone shouted somewhere not too far away to me to me that was sergeant panfilo never had his raucous voice seemed so welcome to tealdo as tealdo made his way toward panfilo galafrone shouted again this time for his crystallomancer tealdos lips skinned back from his teeth one way or another the unkerlanters were going to catch it he only hoped he didnt catch it first along with trasone he found sergeant panfilo they all had to keep falling back though ever deeper among the trees tealdo began to wonder if they would run into still more unkerlanters there he would hear cries of urra and swemmel in his nightmares as long as he lived he hoped he lived long enough to have nightmares he cheered when eggs started falling among the unkerlanters whod broken the algarvian grip on the path he cheered again when shouts of mezentio rang out from the east and yet again when the unkerlanters started yelling in dismay rather than in fury as algarvian reinforcements struck the unkerlanters the pressure on galafrones company eased powers above be praised for crystallomancers panfilo said wiping sweat from his face aye tealdo and trasone spoke together trasone went on say whatever you want about these cursed unkerlanters but going up against them isnt like fighting the jelgavans or the valmierans well lick em aye but they dont know theyre licked yet if you know what i mean thats the truth tealdo turned around still nervous lest some unkerlanters come at him from behind uhoh he caught a glimpse of light brown kilt behind a bush by the way the algarvian soldier lay tealdo knew the fellow had to be dead he looked around but all his companionsall the men whod rallied to sergeant panfilowere still standing he took a few steps forward then stopped in his tracks panfilo and trasone followed him trasone gulped powers above panfilo said softly the algarvians half a dozen of them looked to have been dead for a couple of days maybe theyd been caught in the earlier unkerlanter counterattack in the woods the guard on the path had had the right of it they hadnt been blazed they hadnt had their throats cut theyd been gruesomely and systematically mutilated most of them had their kilts hiked up what the unkerlanters had done down there in a sick voice trasone said we havent fought a war like this for a long time well we are now tealdo said grimly i dont think i want to be taken alive doesnt look like if i cant find some way to kill myself id sooner have a friend do it than go through that one by one the other algarvians nodded waddo strode out into the middle of zossens village square garivald watching from the edge of the square found the stocky village firstmans walk curious half the limping swagger he usually used half a nervous almost slinking step as if waddo also feared the pride he so often displayed garivald for once felt a certain sympathy for the firstman waddo had been reporting the iniquities of the algarvians all of them lovingly detailed on the crystal that had recently come to the unkerlanter village like everyone else in zossen garivald had expected the next bombastic announcement would be of the unkerlanter invasion of algarvianoccupied forthweg and probably of yanina as well instead a few days before the crystal announced that the algarvians had without warning attacked unkerlanter forces engaged in no warlike activity a palace spokesman had declared that the algarvians would be beaten he had not said how since then silence silence till now silence that let fear build especially among the older villagers who remembered how the algarvians had hammered unkerlant during the six years war thirty years before gossip and rumor filled zossenand doubtless filled every other peasant village throughout the vast length and breadth of unkerlant garivald had taken part cautiously with people he trusted if things were going well hed said to dagulf cottbus would be shouting its head off its not that means things cant be going well makes sense to me scarfaced dagulf had said also cautiously looking over his shoulder to make sure no one not even his wife could overhear now waddo stood in the center of the square waiting to be noticed he struck a pose that guaranteed he would be noticed my friends he said in a loud voice a couple of people looked his way but only a couple he didnt have a lot of friends in the village then he spoke again even louder people of zossen i have an important announcement in one hours time i shall bring our precious crystal from my home to the square here so that you may listen to an address by our famous glorious and illustrious sovereign his majesty king swemmel will speak to you on the state of our war against the barbarous savages of algarve off he went trying to look important he had a right to look important through his crystal the king would speak to the village garivald had never imagined such a thing if he got close enough to the crystal he might actually see king swemmel though the king would not see him that was exciting but try as waddo would to walk with the best swagger he could with his bad leg that nasty slinking hint of fear stayed in his step it had nothing to do with the limp either garivald didnt like it if waddo was afraid he probably had good reason to be afraid garivald wondered what the firstman had heard on the crystal and then kept to himself whatever it was garivald couldnt do anything about it he hurried back to his own house to tell annore and syrivald the astonishing news the king his wife said her dark eyes going wide like garivald like most unkerlanters she was solid and swarthy with a proud nose she repeated herself as if she couldnt believe it king swemmel will talk to our village powers above syrivald added around a crust of black bread leuba a toddler chewing on another crust was too little to care whether swemmel spoke to zossen or not i think hes going to be talking to the whole kingdom garivald said or to as many places as have crystals anyhow will we go see him syrivald asked aye we will his father answered i want to find out what the truth is about this miserable war weve got ourselves into with algarve after hed spoken he paused to wonder how much of the truth king swemmel was likely to tell annore said if were going to go wed better go now so we can get up close to the crystal suiting action to word she scooped up leuba and carried the toddler out of the house garivald and syrivald followed they werent the only family with the same idea the square got as crowded as garivald ever remembered seeing it and then a little more crowded than that not everyone in zossen had heard waddos announcement but no one could miss friends and neighbors and relatives heading for the square people jockeyed for position stepped on one anothers toes and loosed a few judicious elbows garivald caught one but he gave it back with interest i dont know what were squabbling about somebody said waddos not even here with the crystal yet that comment produced a brief embarrassed pause in the pushing and shoving but they soon resumed here he comes three people said it at once everybody surged toward waddo who carried the crystal on a cushion whose cover his wife had embroidered make way that was three different people waddo hadnt had such an eager enthusiastic reception since thinking back on it garivald couldnt remember the firstman ever getting such a reception but of course it wasnt really for him it was for the crystal he bore dont drop it someone told him set it on a stool someone else said that way more of us will have a chance to see waddo took that suggestion though he ignored the other one it wont be more than a few minutes before his majesty speaks to us he said he will set our minds at rest about the many things that trouble us garivald doubted whether swemmel would do any such thing but he shouldered his way through the crowd till he stood in the second row and could peer at the crystal over the shoulders of the people in front of him inactive at the moment the crystal might as well have been an ordinary ball of glass then abruptly it changed garivald had heard stories of crystals in use of course but hed never seen one work till now first light suffused it then as the brief glow faded he saw king swemmels long pale narrow face looking at him but the other villagers exclamations they all saw the king looking at them too even though they surrounded the crystal after the magic that made the crystal work garivald supposed the one that let it be viewed from any direction was a small thing by comparison it impressed him just the same swemmel stared out as if he really could see the peasants gaping at him from one end of the kingdom to the other after garivalds first astonishment and almost involuntary awe faded he saw how haggard the king looked beside him annore murmured i dont think hes slept for days probably not since the war started garivald agreed then he fell silent for king swemmel had begun to speak brothers and sisters peasants and townsmen soldiers and sailorsi am speaking to you my friends swemmel said and garivald was astonished yet again he had never imagined that the king would address his subjects in such terms swemmel went on now with the firstperson plural instead of that astonishing riveting firstperson singular we are invaded the vile hosts of king mezentio have plunged their dagger deep into us and algarves dogs yanina and zuwayza course behind their master the enemy has stolen much of that part of forthweg that we reclaimed for our kingdom summer before last our own longheld territory farther south also groans under the foes heels swemmel took a very visible breath but we must also tell you that only on our territory have the algarvians for the first time met with serious resistance if a part of that territory has nevertheless been occupied let that serve as nothing more than a goad to our recovering it the algarvians may the powers below eat them caught unkerlant by surprise let all unkerlanters now take the accursed redheads by surprise as well garivald raised an eyebrow at that he thought king swemmel had been getting ready for a war with algarve but swemmel after sipping from a crystal goblet of water or pale wine was continuing our kingdom has entered into a lifeanddeath struggle against its most wicked and perfidious foe our soldiers are fighting heroically against heavy odds against an enemy heavily armed with behemoths and dragons the main force of the unkerlanter army with thousands of behemoths and dragons of its own is now entering the battle together with our army the whole of our people must rise to defend our kingdom the enemy is cruel and ruthless he aims at grabbing our land our wheat our power points and cinnabar he wants to restore the exiled followers of kyot the usurper and through them to turn the people of unkerlant into the slaves of algarvian princes and viscounts there should be no room in our ranks for whimperers and cowards for deserters and panicspreaders our people must be fearless and fight selflessly for unkerlant the whole kingdom now is and must be for the service of the army we must fight for every inch of unkerlanter soil fight to the last drop of blood for our villages and towns wherever the army may be forced to retreat all leyline caravan cars must be taken away and the lines wrecked the enemy must be left not a pound of bread nor an ounce of cinnabar peasants must drive away their livestock and hand over their grain to our inspectors to keep it out of the algarvians hands all valuable property that cannot be moved must be destroyed friends our forces are immeasurably large the insolent enemy must soon become aware of this together with our army our peasants and our laborers must also go to war against the treacherous mezentio all the strength of unkerlant must be used to smash the foe victory will be ours onward king swemmels image faded from the crystal light filled it again for a moment then it was or seemed to be simply a round lump of glass once more garivald shook himself like a man awakening from a deep dreamfilled sleep instead of seeing the whole kingdom as swemmel had made him do he was back in tiny zossen filled with the village hed known all his life that was a great speech waddo said his eyes shining for the king to call us his friends aye he sounded strong garivald agreed he sounded brave he did indeed that was dagulf who had no great use for the king neither did garivald neither so far as he knew did anyone in the village save possibly waddo even so he said i may fear swemmel more than i love him but i think the redheads will come to fear him too he is what the kingdom needs right now annore said we will fight them waddo said sounding very fierce for a heavy man with a bad ankle we will fight them and we will beat them and once we have beaten them we will make songs about it that was annore again she glanced over toward her husband in confident anticipation no song rose up in garivald right at the moment he began sifting words in his mind looking for rhymes looking for smooth flows from one thought to the next he frowned i dont know enough yet to make any songs nor shall you learn waddo said for surely our brave warriors and fliers shall drive back the algarvians long before they enter zossen he looked toward the east with complete certainty so may it be garivald said from the bottom of his heart unlike so many zuwayzin hajjaj was not fond of the desert for its own sake he was a city man most at home in bishah or in the capitals of the other kingdoms of the continent of derlavai and he loathed camels with a loathing both deep and passionate a loathing based on more experience than he cared to remember riding on camelback through the desert then should have been nothing but ennui and discomfort instead he found himself smiling from ear to ear as he rode along this waste of thornbushes and sand and yellow stone had been seized by unkerlant more than a year before now it was back in zuwayzi hands where the treaty of bludenz said it belongednot that king swemmel had paid any attention to the treaty when he invaded zuwayza that made it worth seeing worth riding through even if it was full of scorpions and lizards and bateared foxes just like any other stretch of desert hajjajs escort a colonel named muhassin pointed to corpses from which vultures and ravens reluctantly flew as the camels ambled past them here your excellency the unkerlanters made a stand they fought bravely but that did not save them they are brave hajjaj said they are mostly ignorant and ruled by a king half a madman but they are brave muhassin adjusted his hat which bore four silver barsone broad with three narrow ones beneath itto show his rank zuwayzi officers had trouble making themselves as impressive as did their counterparts in other kingdoms being limited to their headgear as an area for display like hajjaj muhassin wore hat and sandals and nothing else covering the brown skin between the one and the others they are dead now muhassin said dead or fled or captured it is good hajjaj said and the colonel nodded the zuwayzi foreign minister stroked his neat white beard then went on do i understand correctly that they were not here in great strength aye your excellency muhassin replied of course they are somewhat occupied elsewhere otherwise i have no doubt we should not have enjoyed such an easy time of it powers above be praised that we did catch them unprepared to fight back hard hajjaj said perhaps they did not believe everything shaddad told them my own secretary powers below eat the traitor i had a scorpion in my own sandal there and did not know it but he did less harm than he might have perhaps it did not matter so much whether they believed him or not muhassin said hajjaj raised an eyebrow the broad brim of his hat kept muhassin from seeing that but the colonel explained himself anyway if you were about to fight algarve and zuwayza at the same time where would you place most of your warriors hajjaj considered that for a moment then chuckled wryly i dont suppose king swemmel crouches under his throne from fear of our parading through the streets of cottbus on these ugly mangy ungainly brutes he patted the side of his camels neck with what looked something like affection muhassin stroked his camel with what was obviously the genuine article dont listen to him sunbeam he crooned everyone knows youre not mangy the camel rewarded that limited endorsement by twisting around and trying to bite his knee he smacked it in the nose it let out a noise like a bagpipe being horribly murdered hajjaj threw back his head and laughed muhassin gave him a wounded look a column of glumlooking unkerlanters came toward them naked zuwayzi soldiers herded the men in rockgray along the zuwayzin were in high spirits singing and joking about the victories theyd won they also made comments their captives were lucky they could not understand stop them for a moment colonel if youd be so kind hajjaj murmured to muhassin the officer called orders the captives guards shouted in broken unkerlanter the lightskinned men halted in algarvian hajjaj asked does anyone speak this language i do sir an unkerlanter said stepping forward dont you wish your kingdom would have let mine alone hajjaj asked him i dont know anything about that sir the captive said bowing low as he would have to one of his own nobles all i know is they told me to come up here and do my best and thats what i tried to do only trouble is it didnt turn out to be good enough he looked warily at hajjaj you wont eat me will you sir is that what they tell you zuwayzin are like hajjaj asked and the unkerlanter nodded hajjaj sighed sadly you dont look very appetizing so i think ill be able to do without he turned to muhassin did you follow that aye i did muhassin answered in zuwayzi hes no fool he speaks algarvian wella better accent than i have myself as a matter of fact but he doesnt know anything about us he chuckled in grim anticipation well hell have his chance to find out so he will theres always work to be done in the mines hajjaj gestured to the column of captives they may go on now muhassin spoke to the guards the guards shouted at the captives the captives shambled forward again muhassin turned back to hajjaj and now your excellency shall we go on toward the old frontier the frontier we are restoring by all means colonel the foreign minister said his camel wasnt so interested in going on but he managed to persuade it here and there were already in position to cross the old frontier muhassin said as if to underscore his words a squadron of dragons flew by overhead going south muhassin pointed to them we couldnt have come so far so fast without help from the algarvians unkerlant hasnt got but a few dragons up here in the north country cross the old frontier hajjaj frowned has king shazli authorized the army to invade unkerlant itself i had not heard of any such order he wondered if shazli had given the order but not told him for fear of angering or alarming him that would have been courteous of the kingcourteous aye but also in hajjajs view deadly dangerous to his vast relief muhassin shook his head no your excellency as yet we have received no such orders i merely meant to inform you that we have the ability should the orders come a fair number of folk south of the old frontierand east of it toohave dark skins he ran a dark finger along his own arm that is so the foreign minister agreed still if a small kingdom can take back what rightfully belongs to it it should count itself lucky the more so in these days when great kingdoms are so mighty we would need something of a miracle to come away with more than we had at the beginning it is with feuds among kingdoms as it is with feuds among clans muhassin replied a small clan with strong friends may come out on top of a large one whose neighbors all hate it what you say is true but the small clan often ends up becoming the client of the clan that befriended it hajjaj said i do not want us to become algarves clients any more than i wanted us to be unkerlants clients back in the days before the six years war when zuwayza was ruled from cottbus no man loves this kingdom more than you your excellency and no one has served her better colonel muhassin said by which flowery introduction hajjaj knew the colonel was about to contradict him sure enough muhassin went on we have had the accursed unkerlanters on our southern border for centuries our frontier does not march with algarve and so we have less to fear from king mezentio than from king swemmel is this not your own view as well it is and mezentio is a far more sensible sovereign on his worst day than swemmel on his best hajjaj said which made the colonel laugh but the zuwayzi foreign minister continued if the war goes on as it has been going would you not say our frontier is liable to march with algarves before long hmm now the corners of muhassins mouth turned down something to that i shouldnt wonder the algarvians are moving west at a powerful clip arent they still and all theyll make better neighbors than unkerlanters ever did aye they wear clothes but they have some notion of honor hajjaj chuckled under his breath it wasnt that muhassin was wrong it was just that what the zuwayzin and the algarvians had in common was a long tradition of fighting their neighbors when those neighbors were weak and fighting among themselves when their neighbors were strong it wasnt that the unkerlanters didnt fight they did zuwayza would not have been free but for the unkerlanters twinkings war when both swemmel and his brother kyot claimed to be the elder and so deserving of the throne but unkerlanters did not fight for the sport of it as both zuwayzin and algarvians were wont to do come on your excellency muhassin said the encampment is over that rise there he pointed and then booted his camel back into motion the beasts complaints at having to work once more sounded as if it had been given over to the king of jelgavas torturers hajjaj also got his camel going again it too sounded martyred he had little sympathy for it though descended from nomads he greatly preferred leyline caravans to obstreperous animals but the zuwayzin had done their best to sabotage the ley lines as the unkerlanters drove northward king swemmels sorcerers had repaired some of the lines only to sabotage them in turn when the zuwayzin began pushing south once more these days naked black mages worked to undo what swemmels wizards had done nobody could sabotage a camel the powers above had already taken care of that however revolting the beasts were though hajjaj would rather have gone by camels back than by shanks mare at the encampment a comfortable tent and a great flagon of date wine awaited him he drank it down almost in one long draught in algarve hed learned to appreciate fine vintages next to them this stuff was cloying stickysweet he didnt care he always drank it without complaint whenever it was served to him in zuwayza as it often was it put him in mind of clan gatherings when he was a child visiting algarvians might turn up their noses at the stuff but he was no visiting algarvian to him it was a taste of home colonel muhassins superior general ikhshid greeted hajjaj after he had begun to refresh himself the general gave him more date wine and tea fragrant with mint and little cakes almost as good as he could have had in the royal palace hajjaj enjoyed the leisurely rituals of hospitality for the same reason he enjoyed the date wine lifelong familiarity ikhshid was not far from hajjajs age and quite a bit paunchier but seemed vigorous enough we drive them your excellency he said when small talk was at last set aside we drive them the algarvians drive them down in the south even the yaninans drive them which i would not have reckoned possible swemmel heads up a beaten kingdom and i am not the least bit sorry few in zuwayza would sorrow to see unkerlant beaten hajjaj said and then meditatively i would like our allies better if they ruled less harshly the lands they have conquered of course i would like the unkerlanters better if they were less harsh too when you have to choose between whoresons you choose the ones wholl give you more of what you want ikhshid said a comment close in spirit to muhassins that is indeed what we have done hajjaj said he looked toward the east the direction from which the algarvians were advancing then he looked toward the south the direction in which the unkerlanters were retreating he sighed the most we can hope for is that we have made the right choice when the leyline caravan in which fernao was traveling reached the border between lagoas and kuusamo it glided to a halt kuusaman customs agents swarmed aboard to inspect all the passengers and all their belongings whats this in aid of fernao asked when his turn came which did not take long a precaution the flatfaced little inspector answered which was more polite than none of your cursed business but no more informative please open all your bags that too was more polite than a barked order but left the lagoan sorcerer no more room to disobey when the kuusaman customs agent came upon the letter of introduction from grandmaster pinhiero to siuntio he stiffened something wrong fernao asked with an inward groan hed hoped the letter would save him trouble not cause it i dont know the kuusaman answered he raised his voice over here louhikko ive got a mage louhikko proved to be a mage himself probably if fernao was any judge of the second rank the spells he used to examine fernaos baggage though had been devised by sorcerers more potent than he he spoke to the inspector in their own language then nodded to fernao and left he says you have nothing untoward the customs agent told fernao he sounded reluctant to admit it and demanded why do you come to see one of our mages answer at once dont pause to make up lies fernao stared at him is this kuusamo or unkerlant he asked not altogether in jest such sharp questions were most unlike the usually easygoing kuusamans ive come to consult with your illustrious mage on matters of professional interest to both of us there is a war on the kuusaman snapped true but kuusamo and lagoas are not enemies fernao said neither are we allies the customs agent said which was also true he glowered at fernao who made a point of staying in his seat a lot of kuusamans did not care to be reminded that they ran half a head shorter than lagoans muttering something in his own language under his breath the kuusaman went on to search the belongings of the woman in the seat behind fernao the inspection held up the caravan for three hours one luckless fellow in fernaos car got thrown off the kuusamans paid no attention to his howls of protest only after they got him out of the car and onto the ground did one of them say be thankful we didnt take you on to yliharma youd like that a lot less believe me the ousted man shut up with a snap at last the leyline caravan got moving again it glided across the snowcovered landscape the forests and hills and fields of kuusamo were very little different from those of lagoas nor should they have been not when the kingdom and the land of the seven princes shared the same island the towns in which the caravan stopped might for the most part have been lagoan towns as readily as kuusaman for the past hundred years and more public buildings and places of business had looked much alike in the two realms but when the caravan slid past villages and most of all when it slid past farms fernao was conscious of no longer traveling through his own kingdom even the haystacks were different the kuusamans topped theirs with cloths they sometimes embroidered so the stacks looked like old stooped grannies with scarves on their heads and the farmhouses or some of them struck fernao as odd before the soldiers and settlers of the kaunian empire crossed the strait of valmiera the kuusamans had been nomads herders theyd learned farming fast but to this day more than fifteen hundred years later some of their buildings though made from wood and stone were still in the shape of the tents in which they had once dwelt the day was dying when the leyline caravan pulled into the capital of kuusamo as fernao used a little wooden staircase to descend from the floating car to the floor of the yliharma depot he looked around in the hope that siuntio would meet him and greet him hed written ahead to let the famous theoretical sorcerer know he was coming but he did not see siuntio after a moment though he did spot another mage he recognized from sorcerous conclaves on the island and in the east of derlavai he waved master ilmarinen he called ilmarinen he knew spoke fluent and frequently profane lagoan here this evening though the theoretical sorcerer chose to address him in classical kaunian the language of magecraft and scholarship you have come a long way to accomplish little master fernao he did not sound sorry to say that he sounded wryly amused ignoring his tone fernao asked and why is that if ilmarinen told him the reason he was bound to fail perhaps he wouldnt but ilmarinen did no such thing he came up and waggled a forefinger under fernaos nose because you will not find anyone here who knows anything or who will tell you if he does and so you may as well turn around and go back to setubal he waved a mocking goodbye cant i eat supper first fernao asked mildly id gladly have you as my guest in whatever eatery you choose going to quibble about everything are you ilmarinen returned but for the first time he seemed amused with fernao rather than amused at him stooping he picked up one of the bags at the lagoan mages feet that may possibly be arranged suppose you come with me and off he went fernao grabbed the other bag slipped its carrying strap over his shoulder and followed he had to step smartly ilmarinen proved a spry old man for a moment fernao wondered if the kuusaman was trying to lose him and make off with the bagit was the one in which hed brought what little sorcerous apparatus he had he didnt think ilmarinen could learn much from the stuff but ilmarinen wouldnt be able to knowhe didnt think ilmarinen would be able to knowthat in advance as they were leaving the large crowded depot the kuusaman theoretical sorcerer looked back saw fernao right behind him and said over his shoulder havent managed to make you disappear eh was he grinning because he was joking or to hide disappointment fernao couldnt tell he didnt think ilmarinen wanted him to be able to tell fernao looked around yliharma wasnt one of the great cities of the world as setubal was but it stood in the second rank buildings towered ten some even fifteen stories into the air people dressed in almost as many different styles as they would have been in setubal crowded the streets they hurried into and out of fancy shops sometimes emerging with packages as most kuusaman towns did to fernao it all looked very homelikeexcept that he could not read any of the signs he spoke sibian and algarvian forthwegian and classical kaunian he could make a fair stab at valmieran the language of the principality next door to his own kingdom though remained a closed book here ilmarinen said stilrin kaunian after theyd walked a couple of blocks this place isnt too bad the words on the sign hanging above the eatery were unintelligible to fernao the picture though made him smile it showed seven reindeer in princely coronets sitting around a table groaning with food he followed ilmarinen inside in priekule the capital of valmiera the waiter would have fawned on his customers in setubal fernaos hometown he would have been more stiffly servile here he might have been ilmarinens cousin he addressed fernao in singsong kuusaman a mistake made all the more natural by fernaos narrow slanted eyeslagoans though primarily of algarvic stock had some kuusaman blood in them too fernao spread his hands im sorry he said in lagoan i dont speak your language ah that makes you easier to gouge the waiter answered also in lagoan his grin like ilmarinens might have meant he was joking on the other hand it might not have too the menu also turned out to be incomprehensible kuusaman three specialties here ilmarinen said now deigning to speak lagoan himself salmon mutton or reindeer you cant go too far wrong with any of them salmon will do nicely thanks fernao answered when i was in the land of the ice people i ate enough strange things to put me off them for a while reindeer is better than camel but have it as you will ilmarinen answered im going for the mutton chop myself everyone calls me an old goat and this is as close to eating my namesake as i can come without horrifying the gyongyosians he waved to the waiter and ordered for both of them in kuusaman ale suit you he asked fernao who nodded ilmarinen turned back to the waiter who also nodded and went off fernao said i shouldnt think offending the gyongyosians would worry you not when kuusamo is fighting them because were fighting them theyre too easy a target ilmarinen replied which made an odd kind of sense to fernao the waiter returned with a large pitcher of ale and two earthenware mugs he poured each one full then left again good fernao said after a sip he looked across the table at ilmarinen it struck me as odd that none of the top theoretical sorcerers in kuusamo has published anything lately it struck grandmaster pinhiero as odd too when i pointed it out to him ive known pinhiero for forty years ilmarinen said and hes so odd himself its the normal that looks strange to him he studied fernao im too polite to explain what that says about you no youre not fernao said and ilmarinen laughed out loud after another sip of ale fernao went on and i had expected to see master siuntio not you he sent me ilmarinen answered he said i was better at being rude than he was bugger me if i know what he meant his chuckle displayed uneven yellow teeth why would you want to be rude to me fernao asked thats just iti dont need a reason and siuntio would ilmarinens eyes lit up and heres supper for a while he and fernao paid attention to little else fernaos salmon steak was moist and pink and flavorful he did not enjoy it so much as he might have though for hed become convinced he wasnt going to learn anything on this journey hed also become convinced there were things he badly needed to learn more ale he asked ilmarinen hefting the pitcher oh aye the kuusaman mage answered though youll not get me drunk fernaos ears burned but he poured anyway what would happen if i ignored you and did go to see siuntio he asked ilmarinen shrugged youd end up buying him supper too youd be even less likely to make him drunk than you are mei enjoy it every now and again but hes an old sobersides and you still wouldnt find out anything hed tell you theres nothing to find out the same as im telling you now curse you both for lying fernao flared if pinhieros curses wont stick to meand they wontim not going to worry about yours lad ilmarinen answered and i say i am not lying your own research will prove the truth of it as the exception proves the rule what sort of research fernao asked ilmarinen only smiled again and said not a word these days vanai feared every knock at the door most kaunians in forthweg did and had reason to she had more reasons far more than most major spinello had kept his part of the bargain her grandfather no longer went out to labor on the roads and she had to keep her part of the bargain too whenever the algarvian officer chose for brivibas sake she did it no longer hurt as it had the first time spinello was not cruel that particular way in fact he kept trying to please her he would caress her for what seemed like forever before doing what he wanted she never kindled she never came close to kindling she despised him far too much for that even resignation wasnt easy though at last she managed it instead of by wounding her in the bedchamber spinello took his nasty pleasure by ostentatiously leading her to that chamber and closing the door in brivibas face he didnt bother barring it once in a transport of impotent fury brivibas had burst in come to watch have you spinello asked coolly not missing a stroke vanais grandfather reeled away as if blazed through the heart it was after major spinello left that the fights would start better you should have let me die than to do such a thing brivibas would shout vanai knew he meant it too which was twisting the knife she always answered the same way in a while this will be over if you died my grandfather that would be forever and i could not bear it but how does this make me look brivibas cried one day preserved alive because my granddaughter gives herself to an algarvian barbarian how am i to hold my head up in the village he spoke in terms of himself not in terms of vanai his selfishness infuriated her she said i have not been able to hold my head up in oyngestun since you first grew friendly toward the algarvian barbarianwhich is not what you called him when he began meeting with youhow he admired your scholarship i shared your shame then if you share mine now is it not part of the bargain you made brivibas stared at her for a moment she thought shed made him see things through her eyes but then he said how after this will i be able to make a proper marriage alliance for you how after this do you think i would ever want another man to touch me vanai retorted at which her grandfather flinched and retreated to the safety of his study vanai glared after him he hadnt thought about how she might feel about being married only about the difficulties her behavior might cause him a poisonous thought sprouted in her mind tempting and lethal as a deathcap mushroom ishould have let him labor till he dropped she shook her head violently if she blamed him for thinking only of himself how could she let herself do the same by all the logic brivibas had so carefully taught her she couldnt and once in the open the thought sickened her however much she wanted it to though it would not go away when she had to go out in the streets of oyngestun she held her own head high that stiff straight carriageand the trousers she wore still stubbornly clinging to kaunian stylesdrew howls and leers from the algarvian soldiers who passed through the village these days marching west toward the fight with unkerlant down roads her grandfather had helped pave the men of the small local garrison though stopped bothering her she wished she could be happy about that but she understood why all too well they knew she was an officers plaything and so not for the likes of common soldiers only little by little did she notice that the kaunians of oyngestun were slower to curse her or turn their backs on her than they had been the summer before when she did notice she scratched her head then all shed done was eat some of the food major spinello lavished on her grandfather and her in the hope of getting brivibas to say how happy he was with algarvian rule now she was indeed spinellos plaything was the harlot shed been accused of being then the villagers should have hated her more than ever she got part of the answer one day from tamulis the apothecary brivibas had sent her forth because he was down with a headachehe seemed to come down with headaches ever more often these daysand they had no powders in the house handing her a packet the apothecary remarked im cursed if i think the old buzzard is worth it what headache powders vanai shrugged we can afford themand except for food theres not much to spend silver on these days tamulis looked at her after a moment he said i was not talking about headache powders vanai felt the flush climb from her throat to her hairline she couldnt even say she didnt know what he was talking about she did oh she did she looked down at the dusty slates of the floor he is my grandfather she whispered by all the signs ive seen thats his good fortune and none of yours the apothecary said his voice rough tears filled vanais eyes to her mortification they began dripping down her cheeks she was powerless to stop them shed spent so long and put so much effort into inuring herself to the villagers scorn sympathy struck her with double force id better go she said thickly here lasswait tamulis said blurrily she saw him holding out a square of cloth to her dry your eyes she obeyed though she didnt think it would help her eyes would still be red and swollen her face blotchy when she handed the cloth back she said these days we all do what we have to do to get through tamulis grunted you do more for that longwinded old foof than he would ever do for you vanai had a vision of a statuesque brassyhaired algarvian noblewoman demanding that brivibaswhose own blond hair was heavily streaked with silvermake love to her to keep his granddaughter out of a labor gang she held that vision in her mind for a couple of seconds but for no more than a couple of seconds because after that she exploded into laughter almost as involuntary as her tears had been try as she would she couldnt imagine an algarvian noblewoman with such peculiar tastes and whats so funny now tamulis asked somehow explaining to the apothecary why shed laughed would have embarrassed vanai more than having the whole village know major spinello spread her thighs whenever the fancy struck him maybe it was that she couldnt do anything about spinello not if she wanted brivibas to stay safe in oyngestun but maybe too it was that explaining would have meant admitting shed had a bawdy thought of her own she took the headache powders and left in a hurry what kept you brivibas demanded peevishly when she gave him the powders my head feels as if it were on the point of falling off i brought them to you as quickly as i could my grandfather vanai answered i am sorry you are in pain she kept her voice soft and deferential shed been doing that around brivibas for as long as she could remember it was harder now than it had been she sometimes felt he ought to keep his voice soft and deferential around her considering who owed whom what at the moment she shook her head brivibas had been father and mother both to her since she was no more than a toddler all she was doing when she lay still for spinello or sank to her knees in front of him was paying back a small part of that debt so she told herself over and over again and then brivibas said part of my pain i have no doubt comes from my grief and sorrow at your fall from the proper standards of kaunian womanhood had he said at what you are enduring for my sake everything would have been well but that was not how he measured things to him the standards were more important than the reason for which they were broken vanai said i can meet your expectations my grandfather or i can keep you alive my apologies but i do not seem to be able to do both at once she turned on her heel and walked away without giving him a chance to reply they did not speak to each other for the next several days they might have healed the rift sooner but major spinello chose that afternoon to pay vanai a visit brivibas retreated to his study and slammed the door spinello laughed the old fool does not know when he is well off he said as if to declare the rest of the house his to do with as he chose he took vanai on the divan in the parlor under the eyes of the ancient statuettes and reliefs displayed there afterwards sated he ran his hand along her flank she wanted to get up to wash away the feel of his skin slick against hers but his weight still pinned her to the rather scratchy fabric of the divan with a wriggle and a twist she let her exasperation at that show shed seen he didnt mind or not too much this time though he didnt let her go free right away looking down at her face from a distance of about six inches he said you were wise to yield yourself to me the whole of derlavai is yielding itself to algarve all vanai said rather faintly was youre squashing me spinello took more of his weight on his elbows and knees he stayed atop her though his legs between hers imprisoning her forthweg is ours he said sibiu is ours valmiera is ours jelgava is ours and unkerlant crumbles like a childs sand castle when the tide rolls over it unkerlant crumbles boasting of his kingdoms conquests excited him she felt him stir against her inner thigh he bent his head to her breast she realized he was going to have a second round with a small sigh she looked up at the rough plaster of the ceiling till he finished as he got back into his kilt and tunic he went on the war is as good as over you need have no doubt of that our time the algarvian time is come at last the time of which our forefathers dreamt even in the days when they dwelt in the forests of the distant south vanai only shrugged what seemed a golden dream to spinello was her nightmare brought to life she shuddered to think of algarvians free to torment kaunians for the next hundred years she also shuddered to think of spinello free to come back here tomorrow or the next day or a week from now to make her do whatever he wanted she could do nothing about spinello she could do nothing about the war as the algarvian major had boasted that his kingdoms armies were overwhelming the unkerlanters so the war had overwhelmed her spinello chucked her under the chinone more liberty she had to let him take until i see you again he said with a bow as if he imagined she might want to see him again and do give my best regards to your ever so learned grandfather out he went laughing and whistling he was happy why not hed satisfied himself and algarves armies stood everywhere triumphant vanai despised by the large forthwegian majority in her own kingdom despised even more by its conquerors went off to get a rag and a pitcher and to do her best to scrub the memory of his touch from her body she despised herself most of all marshal rathar had come down into the south to see with his own eyes how the algarvians were making such headway against the unkerlanter armies there he had gone to the north to the border with zuwayza to take charge of the fight in the desert when it was going badly that had been an embarrassment for unkerlant if this fight went badly it would be a catastrophe his first lesson was very nearly his last he had just got out of his leyline caravan car in the mediumsized town of wirdum a good twenty miles behind the battle line when flight after flight of algarvian dragons appeared overhead by the time they got done dropping eggs the local depot was burning so were the barons castle and much of the center of town he didnt realize he was bleeding till someone offered him a sticking plaster for the cut on his cheek he declined with a shrug i thank you but no i dont want the soldiers to think i hurt myself shaving the joke would have been better if he hadnt had to say it three times each louder than the one before till the fellow with the plaster finally got it the rain of eggs from the sky had stunned everyones ears strong hooknosed face set in a frown he rode forward toward general ortwins headquarters that was no easy trip either the algarvians had already given the roads hereabouts the same sort of pasting wirdum had just taken rathar s horse had to pick its way through the fields to get around the craters in the roadway soldiers and horses and unicorns and a few behemoths lay sprawled in death the stink of rotting meat that rose from them was very strong flies rose from them too in great humming buzzing clouds rathars horse flicked its tail this way and that the marshal swatted and fumed turning to the soldier guiding him to general ortwin he demanded where are our own dragons we need to pay the enemy in his own coin we didnt have as many to start with as the cursed redheads did the man answered the ones we did have are mostly dead by now closer to the line of battle eggtossers concealed from the air with nets hurled destruction back at king mezentios men rathar grunted in some satisfaction when he saw that the algarvians arent having it all their own way then he said oh no my lord marshal his escort replied they pay a price for every mile they move forward theyve already moved too many miles forward rathar said and the price theyve paid hasnt been nearly high enough the soldier riding with him grimaced and then with obvious reluctance nodded after what seemed far too long the marshal reached the tent from which general ortwin was conducting his defense ortwin who was very bald on top but as if to compensate had tufts of white hair sprouting from his ears and nos trils shouted into a crystal bring that regiment forward curse you if we dont hold the line of the river well have to fall back past wirdum and king swemmel will pitch a fit he glanced up and saw rathar in a voice full of defiance he said if you want to haul me away for lese majesty my lord marshal heres your chance i want to halt the algarvians rathar said thats the only thing i want and im not fussy about how i do it ortwin snorted which made his nose hairs quiver like grass in the breeze why arent you shorter by a head he asked with what sounded like genuine curiosity everybody thought you were going to be this past fall rathar shrugged his majesty believes i do not want to be king i think powers above know its a true belief but i came here to escape the court not to gossip of it he strode forward show me how you are doing none too bloody well ortwin answered which would have served as commentary for the entire unkerlanter fight against algarve when you set out we still had a decent force on the east side of the klagen this morning though the cursed algarvians threw us back over the river and powers below eat me if i see how were going to keep them from crossing he pointed to the map to show what he meant why didnt you reinforce your men on the east side rathar asked my lord marshal what do you think i tried to do ortwin retorted i havent got a fancy hat with a feather in it like an algarvian general but im not stupidnot too stupid anyhow i tried i couldnt their dragons kept dropping eggs on the fords of the klagen and their behemoths thundered right through the line our men put up where were our behemoths for a counterattack rather inquired spread too thin to do much ortwin told him they bunched theirs and they broke through with them rather exhaled angrily shouldnt that have given you a hint general were going to have to learn to fight like the algarvians if we intend to throw them back ortwin said my lord marshal i didnt have enough of the beasts to make any great counterattack with them anyhow he held up a hand whose back was gnarled with veins like old tree roots and before you ask why i didnt get some from the north or the south the redheads are driving back our armies there too and no general has enough for himself let alone to spare any for his neighbors that is not good rathar said an understatement if ever there was one we must be able to concentrate our behemoths as the algarvians are doing or else they will go right on smashing through us you are the marshal of unkerlant ortwin said if anyone can make it so you are the man he cocked his head to one side listen to the way the eggs are falling sure as sure mezentios men are trying to get over the klagen rathar cocked his head to one side too ortwin was right most of the bursts came from the southeast where the unkerlanters were fighting to hold the line of the river one of the crystallomancers turned and spoke urgently to the general i came here to see the fighting rathar said as he started out of the tent i am going up toward the line there crystals ortwin called after him we need more crystals too seems as though the stinking algarvians have em on every behemoth and every dragon and weve got regiments out there without any they fight smoother than we can if you know what i mean i do know rathar flung back over his shoulder the sorcerers are working night and day to activate more but we have to keep so many of them busy turning out sticks and eggs we cant do as much with crystals as wed like unkerlant was a bigger more populous kingdom than algarve king mezentios domain though had more trained mages and artisans than did king swemmels algarve spent materiel and sorcerous energy lavishly to stop the redheads if they could be stopped rathar feared unkerlant would have to spend men lavishly he shouted for a fresh horse when he got one he rode toward the klagen at a rapid though bonejarring canter unkerlanter eggtossers were flinging relentlessly straining to hold back the algarvians even as rathar watched though algarvian dragons dove on a knot of tossers the fliers released their eggs at just above treetop height so they could hardly miss most of those eggtossers fell quiet no unkerlanter dragons challenged the ones painted in red and white and green men in rockgray tunics streamed back toward the west stand curse you rathar shouted stand and fight the algarvians three of them shouted at him in return the algarvians are across the river one soldier added our officers say that if we dont get out now theyll cut us off and we wont be able to get out at all their officers might well have been right rathar rode toward a farmhouse where a captain was pulling together a rear guard to hold off the redheads while their comrades retreated the young officer gaped goggleeyed at the large stars on the collar of rathars tunic carry on captain the marshal said crisply you know the situation and the ground better than i do uh aye sir the captain said staring still he ordered his menmore than a companys worthwith no small skill but then from the east another shout rose behemoths rathar grinned in fierce anticipation hed come a long way to see the fearsome algarvian behemoths in action only belatedly did he realize that having seen them he was liable not to be able to make the long journey back again far from thundering down on the farm in a great rampaging charge the behemoths paused out of range of a footsoldiers stick and began methodically pounding the unkerlanter strongpoint to bits eggs fell on and around the holes the unkerlanters had dug for themselves heavy sticks set the farmhouse and its outbuildings ablaze flushing from cover the soldiers whod sheltered there after theyd battered the position algarvians in short tunics and kilts snaked forward to finish off their foes my lord marshal get out while you can the young captain called to rathar well hold them off here while you get away a cheer rose from the unkerlanter line one of the troopers had been lucky enough to blaze a behemoth in the eye as the beast toppled it crushed a couple of the algarvians whod been riding it rathar realized the captain was right if he was going to get out he had to do it now he saluted the soldiers who would cover his retreat then remounted and rode off toward the west a couple of algarvian behemoth crews lobbed eggs after him they burst close enough to frighten his horse but not close enough to knock it over more algarvian dragons flew overhead again they had the sky to themselves they did not bother with a lone man on horseback but saved their attention for larger groups of soldiers and horses and unicorns rathar had seen the gruesome results of that tactic on the ride up from wirdum now as he retreated along with the mass of unkerlanter soldiery he saw those results again rather fresher this time on came the algarvians behind him all through their fights against earlier foes theyd advanced as smoothly as a leyline caravan nothing hed seen here made it look as if things would be any differenttill he thought of that young captain and there ahead of him another officer was shouting at the men around him to form up for another rearguard action the men obeyed too though they must have known they were unlikely to last long this far south darkness came late a little bit further on toward summer and it would hardly have come at all when at last twilight deepened marshal rathar lay down in a hole in the ground and slept like a worn animal the algarvians hadnt come far enough to scoop him up before he woke nor for a wonder had anyone stolen his horse which hed tied to a bush close by he rode west again general ortwin greeted him with a cry of glad surprise when he rode up to the headquarters powers above be praised youre here my lord marshal the general said weve got to pull back sooncant hold here much longer with the redheads over the klagen i told you that alreadyand youre urgently ordered back to cottbus what rathar said irritably why only too late did he wonder if he really wanted to know want to or not he found out ill tell you why ortwin said the gongs have stabbed us in the back thats why theyve started up the war in the far west again two after so long on the island of obuda the ilszang mountains the borderland between gyongyos on the one hand and unkerlant on the other seemed almost like home to istvan as a matter of fact the valley where hed been born and raised lay only a couple of hundred miles northwest of the hillside path along which he marched now he scratched at his long thick tawny beard stars above he could even think about going home on leave something unimaginable out in the middle of the vast bothnian ocean come on you mangy sons of goats he called to the men in his squad the stars have never once looked down on such a pack of lazy wastrels as you have a heart sergeant szonyi said back on obuda you were a common soldier yourself you know istvan raised a hand to brush its back against the single white hashmark embroidered on his collar tab sure enough on obuda hed hated sergeant jokais petty tyranny he still wasnt so harsh as jokai had been but now with rank of his own bestowed on him for good service he better understood why jokai had acted as he did the boot was on the wrong foot then he answered its on the right one these daysso step lively i dont know why youre worrying sergeant that was scrawny bespectacled kun still as argumentative as fussily precise as he had been back on the island his wide wave almost knocked istvan off the path and down the hillside i dont think there are any unkerlanters for miles around im worrying because worrying is my job istvan told him and thats why were moving forward so easy too because the lousy goateaters have their hands full way off in the east i mean pick up your clumsy feet like i told szonyi lets grab with both hands while we can not even the former mages apprentice had a good comeback for that on he tramped with istvan with the rest of the squad with the rest of the company with the rest of the regiment with the baggage train of horses and mules istvan wished there were a ley line anywhere close by but ley lines were few and far between in this starsforsaken country country so little traveled that wizards surely hadnt yet mapped all the ones there were szonyi grinned at kun and at the other troopers in the squad from the coastal lowlands or from the balaton islands off the coast even if there arent any unkerlanters around here youve got to look sharp otherwise a mountain apell sneak down tuck you under his arm and walk off with you kun stared at him over the tops of his spectacles the only mountain ape i see in these parts is you oh you wont see them kun istvan said nodding toward szonyi no you wont see them but sure as sure theyll see you bah kun kicked a pebble if they didnt keep the cursed things in menageries i wouldnt even believe in them and ill bet you anything you care to name that nine stories out of every ten the old grannies tell about em are lies im no superstitious fool not me he puffed out his weedy chest and looked wise or at least supercilious have it your way istvan answered with a shrug one thing the grannies say is that whoever calls someone else a fool names himself too with an angry grunt kun kicked another pebble down the steep hillside istvan ignored the little show of pique his eyes were on the slopes above the path somewhere up there mountain apes were liable to be staring hungrily down at his companions and him yearscenturieshad driven them up into the desolate heights and taught them wariness when it came to man that did not mean they would not sneak down and raid only that they picked their spots with care one of the lowlanders newly attached to the squad a broadshouldered fellow named kanizsai said i heard a savant claim once that mountain apes werent really apes at all not like the apes in the jungles of siaulia what this chap said was we ought to think of them as really stupid people instead that notion kept the next couple of miles light and full of laughter everybody had his own candidate for who should be reckoned a mountain ape starting with childhood rivals and ending up with king swemmel and most of the population of unkerlant and what about us szonyi added if we had any wits would we be tramping through these miserable mountains just because somebody told us to oh now wait a bit kanizsai said were warriors by the stars this is what were supposed to be doing the argument took off from there like a dragon taking wing istvan and kun sided with szonyi most of the new men men who hadnt yet seen action ranged themselves behind kanizsai youll find out istvan said aye were warriors that means we know how to fight and were not afraid to do it ask anybody whos seen real war if he likes it though and youll hear some different stories now kun and szonyi supported him but theres glory in crushing the foes of gyongyos kanizsai declared the stars shine brighter when we show ourselves to be true men wheres the glory in huddling in a hole in the rain while the enemy tosses eggs at you istvan returned wheres the glory in sneaking up behind a kuusaman whos squatting in the bushes with his trousers around his ankles and cutting his throat so you can steal whatever food hes carrying kanizsai looked revolted having been through the course that hardened recruits into warriors istvan knew it stressed ferocity that was all very wellto a point he wanted men at his side who would not give way in battle but he did not want men at his side who would endanger themselves and him by rushing ahead when they ought to hold back today all that hardly mattered the unkerlanters offered no resistance to the advance maybe the war in the east did preoccupy them maybe they just didnt care about losing this stretch of mountains had it belonged to istvan he wouldnt have cared about losing it either when evening came the squadron encamped on the flattest stretch of ground istvan could find it wasnt a very flat stretch of ground or very large either well keep two men on watch he ordered three shifts through the night he named the sentries for each shift one of the best things about being promoted to sergeant was that he didnt have to take a turn on sentrygo himself as he rolled himself in his blanket he smiled at the thought of sleeping till morning someone shook him he came awake at once as hed learned to do on obuda men who couldnt rouse quickly and completely there often never roused at all the dying embers of the campfire gave the only light what is it he asked his voice a thin thread of whisper sergeant someones coming kun whispered back i cant see anybody but i know your little piece of magecraft istvan asked kun nodded the motion next to invisible in the gloom hed used that trick hed learned from his master before back on obuda istvan seized his stick and got to his feet in one smooth motion all right youd better show me the squad was his this was the price he paid for not having to stand guard or do some of the other things common soldiers did follow me kun said istvan did as quietly as he could up the side of the hill above the encampment to a boulder from behind which kun could keep an eye on the slope than ran up higher still when they got there kun mumbled to himself he played what looked like a childs finger game after a moment he raised his head and looked at istvan hes still out there whoever he is coming closer too or the sorcery wouldnt spot him aye istvan said an unkerlanter spy ill lay maybe with a crystal so he can let his friends know what he sees a brave man he thought no one but a brave man would dare come spying on his enemies when they were here in numbers and he alone so very alone istvan peered up the slope he wished for a moon the stars however beautiful and potent they were did not yield enough light to suit him the pale stones seemed dark the inky shadows impenetrable king swemmels men could have concealed not just a single spy but a battalion up there but for kuns little sorcery no one would have known till they attacked sergeant kun began wait istvans answer was an almost voiceless whisper but it slapped the mages apprentice into silence istvan leaned forward ever so slightly one of those inky shadows had moved as if istvans stick had a life of its own it took aim at that shadow which was now so still he doubted whether hed seen what hed thought he saw he waited patience hard won on obuda came in handy now he tried not to hear his own soft breathing or kuns all of him was pointing toward that shadow waiting for it to do something to do anything if hed imagined the motion the unkerlanter could be sneaking up on him from another direction the shadow moved again istvan blazed his finger found the blazing hole before he was consciously sure hed seen the motion the bright beam tore at his darkadapted eyes from up the slope a harsh cry rang out istvan dashed toward the place from which it had come kun pounded at his heels now the silent waiting game was over he heard scrabbling among the rocks and blazed again another cry rewarded him this one he was sure of mortal agony have a care sergeant kun panted he might be shamming if he is youll avenge me istvan answered the cries had roused the other soldiers in the squad he heard them coming up the hillside behind him after glory he thought all he wanted was a dead unkerlanter or perhaps a live one from whom answers could be ripped by someone who spoke the easterners ugly language kun pointed there istvan was already hurrying toward the form from which the stink of burnt meat rose and then all at once he stopped short ill be a son of a goat he said softly you may not have much believed in mountain apes kun but your magecraft did and took it for a man is it dead kun asked in an unwontedly small voice not yet i dont think istvan answered as if on cue the mountain ape writhed he blazed it once more this time in the head it groaned as a man might have done and lay still istvan turned to the oncoming soldiers in his squad calling somebody start a torch and fetch it up here i want a good look at this beast unlovely in life the mountain ape seemed even more unlovely sprawled in death under the flickering torchlight it was bigger than a man and its long coarse shaggy reddish hair made it look bigger still its low brow broad nose and mouth full of enormous though not very sharp teeth turned it into an embarrassing caricature of mankind was that a club fallen from its huge hand or just a branch that happened to lie close by istvan couldnt be sure kun turned away in fastidious disgust abominable creature he muttered simply abominable i suppose so istvan said its dead and it didnt hurt any of us thats what counts he looked east into the night when we do finally run into the unkerlanters theyll have more with them than clubs worse luck in the dark quiet of the secondstory farmhouse bedchamber merkela moved slowly delicately above skarnu oh he said in a soft voice still astonished at the joy she could wring from him he peered up at her her face inches above his own was half intent half slack with pleasure the tips of her breasts brushed the bare skin of his chest as she sat bent above him somehow that excited him almost as much as anything else she was doing he ran a hand down the smooth curve of her back till he clenched one meaty buttock the fingers of his other hand tangled in her golden hair as he pulled her mouth down to his he found her lips sweeter than honey sweeter and more intoxicating than the finest fortified jelgavan wine all at once she moaned and strained and bucked against him delicacy forgotten she clenched him inside her as if with a hand he cried out he could no more have held back than he could have stopped himself from breathing merkela cried out too a curious mewing wail almost like a cats then spent she slumped down onto him and then as she did after every time they joined she began to weep as if her heart would break noas if it were already broken gedominu she wailed oh my poor gedominu skarnu held her and stroked her and waited for the worst of the sorrow to pass as he knew it soon would there were jokes there were sayings about the chances a man took when he consoled a new widow in her bedchamber discovering she still loved her dead husband was not the least of them her tears felt hot as molten lead against the side of his neck and the hollow of his shoulder i cant bring him back skarnu said once the sobs had ebbed to sniffles the algarvians had blazed gedominu as theyd blazed a good many other valmieran hostages to punish resistance against their occupying army i wish i could but i cant that was true even if it meant merkela would not be giving herself to him now it might not have meant anything of the sort what had smoldered between them might have caught fire even with gedominu still limping around his farm he was a brave man that was also true skarnu would have said it even were it not to honor the dead aye he was merkelas head came up from grief she swung quickly to rage tears still streaked her cheeks but her eyes glittered with fury he was brave and the redheads blazed him down like a dog powers above spurn them powers below eat them through all eternity her voice held an incantatory quality as if she truly had the power to make her curses bite deep they will pay how they will pay aye skarnu kept stroking her gentling her as if she were an unbroken unicorn they will pay they are paying youre helping to make them pay merkela nodded the thought might have come from her own mind not skarnus while gedominu lived shed been content to wait at home and let him carry on the clandestine war against the redheads after they executed him shed gone out on every raid skarnu and his sergeant raunu and the handful of stubborn local farmers and villagers had put on skarnus greatest fear was not that she would be unable to hold her own but that she would get herself killed from foolish eagerness to throw herself at the foe it hadnt happened yet in time he hoped she would get her common sense back and you skarnu you are a brave man she exclaimed suddenly seeming to remember he was there even though shed been lying mostly on top of him her naked sweaty flesh pressed tightly against his when they took him you tried to go in his place skarnu shrugged shed been watching them he could think of no other reason why hed offered himself to the algarvians instead of gedominu had they taken him had they blazed him would merkela now be mourning him naked in this bed with her old lame husband skarnu shrugged and shivered both at the same time no one could know such a thingand just as well too he reached for her to hold away what might have been she was reaching for him too perhaps to hold away what had been only noblewomen in valmiera were said to know what she knew and used to get him ready quickly hed learned before that what people said and what was so often had no connection to each other soon she arched her hips to receive him hurry she whispered there in the darkness when her pleasure came this time she groaned as if it were pain a moment later skarnu groaned too and spent himself merkela wept again but only for a little while her breathing grew deep and slow she drifted off to sleep without bothering to put on the loose tunic and trousers she wore at night getting into his own clothes was a matter of a moment for skarnu merkela let him share her bed when they joined on it but she would not let him sleep with her in the literal meaning of the words he slipped down the stairs and out of the farmhouse closing the door behind him hed grown very used to sleeping on straw in the barn a mattress by now would probably feel too soft to be comfortable hello sir raunu said quietly straw rustled under the veteranraunu had fought in the six years waras he sat up oh hello sergeant skarnu said in dull embarrassment raunu had kept him afloat when thanks to his being a marquis hed taken command of a company in valmieras failed war against algarve theyd stayed together after the formal fighting ended too now since he hadnt been here raunu could hardly help knowing where he had been and what hed been doing i didnt mean to wake you you didnt raunu answered i was wakeful anyhow he didnt say anything else for a little while after that skarnu could see his face but not make out its expression the inside of the barn was darker even than merkelas bedchamber had been at last raunu resumed are you sure you know what youre doing sir sure skarnu shook his head no of course not only fools are sure they know what theyre doing and theyre commonly wrong raunu grunted skarnu needed a moment to realize that was intended for laughter raunu said all right sir fair enough if shed chosen to look at me i dont suppose id have looked away either ah skarnu didnt want to talk about it he pulled off his boots hed also got used to sleeping in tunic and trousers to keep the straw from poking him so badly his yawn might have been a bit theatrical but he thought it would serve here on the farm though sergeant and captain commoner and noble were far closer to equals than they had been in the tightly structured world of the army raunu did not back off he said did you know sir that gedominu knew shed started looking your way before the redheads hauled him off and blazed him that had to be answered no i didnt know skarnu said slowly nothing happened between us before then it was true how long it would have kept on being true he didnt know hed started looking merkelas way too hed started looking her way from the moment he met her he wondered if she mourned gedominu so extravagantly because she felt guilty about having turned her eye elsewhere before the algarvians seized her husband he doubted he would ever know he could hardly come right out and ask raunus thoughts had traveled along their own ley line aye he knew the sergeant said it was always one thing after another he said to me oncethat was how he looked at the world he was sure algarve would go after unkerlant next with forthweg and sibiu and us and the jelgavans down unkerlant was the next duck in a row skarnu didnt care about gedominus theories he yawned again louder and more stagily than before and lay down in the straw which rustled as it compressed under his weight he felt around till he found his blanket then wrapped it around himself i hope everything turns out all right sir thats all raunu said apparently resigned to the idea that he wouldnt get many more answers from his superior but skarnu gave him one more after all everythings turned out fine so far hasnt it sergeant our armies will be in trapani next week at the latest and gedominu should have a fine harvest come fall or have you heard something different well i walked into that didnt i i only wish we were in the algarvians capital and not the other way round raunu lay down too the straw rustled once more the sergeant sighed and said ill see you in the morning sir aye now that skarnu was off his feet his yawn had nothing forced about it he fell asleep almost as fast as merkela had up in her room in the morning he drew up a bucket of water from the well and splashed it over his face and hands raunu used some too then they went into the farmhouse merkela fed them fried eggs and bread and butter and beer all from the farm nothing bought in town but the salt that went on the eggs thus fortified they went out to tend the crops and the cattle and sheep leaving merkela behind to bake and wash clothes and weed the vegetable garden and feed the chickens she and gedominu had got a good enough living from the farm skarnu marveled at that he and raunu together had trouble doing as much as gedominu had managed by himself ah but theres a difference sir raunu said when skarnu grumbled about it which he did every now and then the old man had a lifetime to learn what he was doing weve had not quite a year aye i suppose so skarnu glanced over toward the veteran raunu had had a lifetime to learn how to be a soldier and then skarnu with a good deal less than not quite a years experience had been set over him iought to count myself lucky he didnt betray me to the algarvians the way so many jelgavan soldiers did with their officers he thought raunu might have been better off had he decided to turn traitor skarnu was weedingsomewhat more expertly than he had the year before if not with gedominus effortless skillwhen a couple of algarvians came riding along the path that ran by the fields they dismounted not far away one of them nailed a broadsheet to an oak tree the other one kept him covered which meant that for most of the time he was busy the fellow pointed his stick not quite straight at skarnu once the broadsheet was in place the algarvians swung back up onto their unicorns and rode away only after they were out of sight did skarnu amble over to see what the broadsheet said in rather stilted valmieran it offered a reward for information leading to the capture of soldiers who had gone into hiding rather than surrendering and a double reward for information leading to the capture of officers he stood rocking back and forth on his heels the picture of rustic indifference then with a shrug more convincing than his yawns had been the night before he went back to work maybe someone in the countryside knew what he and raunu were and felt like turning a profit on his knowledge whether that was so or not mattered little at the moment skarnu couldnt do anything about it he could do the work if he didnt no one would when he and raunu came in for their midday mealbig bowls of bean soup with more beer to wash them downhe mentioned the broadsheet raunu shrugged figures the redheads would try it sooner or later he said but not many people like em well enough to talk with em even for money someone will merkela said someone will want silver or will remember an old quarrel with gedominu or with me there are always people like that she tossed her head to show what she thought of them a gesture even skarnus sister krasta might have envied skarnu wondered how many of the people whod had quarrels with gedominu were jealous of him for taking such a woman to wife he chuckled he hadnt imagined farmers might have feuds as serious and as foolish as those of the nobility can you think of anyone in particular he asked merkela maybe someone needs to have an unfortunate accident her eyes flashed skarnu would not have wanted that wolfish smile aimed at him or even a fortunate one she said captain hawart said gather round men corporal leudast and the other unkerlanter survivors from his regiment obeyed they might have filled out three fullstrength companies hawart was the senior officer still alive colonel roflanz hadnt lived through the counterattack hed stupidly ordered against the algarvian invaders lieudast marveled that he himself was still breathing the regiment had been encircled twice during the grinding retreat through forthweg once the men had slipped through the algarvian lines a few at a time under cover of night the other time theyd had to fight their way clearwhich was one reason so few of them gathered to listen to captain hawart he pointed back toward the village in eastern unkerlant through which theyd retreated the day before the algarvians held the place now or what was left of it a breeze from out of the east blew stale sour smoke into leudasts nostrils men we have to retake pfreimd hawart said once we do it we can form a line along the western bank of the stream that runs by the other side of the town and have some chance of really stopping the redheads that stream was hardly more than a creek leudast hadnt bothered looking for a ford before wading across it and the water hadnt come above his waist he didnt think it would prove much of an obstacle to the algarvians as a matter of fact it hadnt proved much of an obstacle to the algarvians well have reinforcements coming in behind us hawart promised theyll give us the men we need to make a proper stand on the river line it wasnt a river not even in flood could it be a river but the regimental commander had met leudasts most urgent concern in any case hawart gave the orders leudasts job was to obey them and see that the men in his squad did the same he glanced over to sergeant magnulf magnulf shrugged ever so slightly he had to obey orders too after a moment leudast also shrugged going straight at the algarvians was only slightly more perilous than falling back before them lets get moving hawart said advance in open order use whatever cover you can find if you can manage it unkerlant needs you alive but unkerlant needs dead algarvians even more come on open order magnulf repeated spread it out as wide as you can we want to get into the village we want to clear out the algarvians and we want to keep on advancing to the line of the stream and leudast here he added pointing toward the corporal wants to keep the redheads as far away from his home village as he can aye thats so leudast agreed he turned his head to look westward his village couldnt have been more than twenty or thirty miles west of the battle line though he was rather south of it too too many villages lost already well lets take one back magnulf said leudast did his best to force fear to one side he couldnt keep from feeling it as long as he kept from showing it though he could hold his head up among his comrades maybe they felt it too he hadnt asked nobodyd asked him either he trotted forward through fields of growing wheat that might never be harvested he wished he were dressed in green not rockgray how far forward had the algarvians moved their outposts during the night one way to find out was to get blazed by a redhead somebody was liable to find out that way he hoped he wouldnt be the one eggs started falling on the advancing troops the algarvians were demons for making their eggtossers keep up with the rest of the army here though they were tossing a little long so they did less harm than they might have before they could correct their aim flashes of sorcerous energy came from inside pfreimd leudast let out a glad startled whoop then turned it into words weve got eggtossers of our own in the fight he shook his fist in the direction of the village how do you algarvians like it curse you he didnt think the algarvians liked it at all dishing it out was always easier than taking it the eggs the unkerlanters flung at the redheads must have put a couple of their tossers out of action for the rain of eggs down onto the advancing unkerlanter regiment slowed leudast waved men forward as he himself ran on maybe captain hawart hadnt been trying to get what was left of the regiment killed after all familiarlooking thatchroofed housessome amazingly intact others nothing but charred ruinsswelled in leudasts sight as he drew near them unkerlant he yelled king swemmel urra urra more unkerlanter eggs fell on pfreimd they would make the algarvians holed up in the village keep their heads down with a little luck that creek on the other side of pfreimd would become the front line once more a barricade of algarvian corpses might keep the defenders safe troopers started blazing at the nearest houses houses in which the redheads might be lurking where beams struck it thatching began to smolder so did some of the timbers before long those houses would catch fire the algarvians would have to come forth or roast in the meanwhile though they fought beams began cutting down the unkerlanters advancing on the village a near miss charred a line through the grass by leudasts feet he threw himself down behind a rock that wasnt really big enough to shield him and blazed back after a moment to gather himself he was up and running again then he was in among the houses of the village and discovered that the algarvians hadnt merely taken cover in them the redheads had also dug trenches and foxholes by the houses and in the village square they resisted with everything they had too and seemed not in the least inclined to give up pfreimd well if they wont well have to take it away from them leudast thought he blazed at a redhead in a hole the fellow reeled back clutching at himself surrender an unkerlanter officer shouted in algarvian that was a word leudast had learned mezentio was the only answer the officer got the algarvians intended to fight it out in the village captain hawart had said reinforcements were coming to help the regiment he commanded these days leudast wondered if the redheads expected help from their friends too if they did best to finish them now before that help arrived follow me leudast shouted to his comrades and leaped down into the trenches to his vast relief the unkerlanters he led did follow had they hung back he wouldnt have lasted long as things were hed never found himself in such a vicious little fight the algarvians might have been used to overwhelming all the foes in their path but they did not shy away from combat with the odds against them nor did they hang back from fighting at close quarters some of the work leudast did was with his stick used as a club and with his knife warfare as it had been in the days of the kaunian empire and even before the last few algarvians threw down their sticks and surrendered they looked as frightened as leudast would have had he been trying to yield to them they arent nine feet tall and covered with spines after all he said to magnulf no so theyre not magnulf agreed he was tying a rag around his arm blood soaked through the wool one of the algarvians had had a knife too not too bad he told leudast should heal well enoughand that cursed redhead isnt going to stick anybody else believe you me he wont good leudast said he thought hed come through without a scratch till he discovered a cut on one leg he had no idea when hed got it in the heat of battle he hadnt noticed it till now villagersthose who hadnt fled or been killedbegan coming out of their battered homes to shake the hands of the unkerlanter soldiers some of them held out jugs of spirits we would have had more one of them said but these redheaded swinehe spat in the direction of the algarvian captivesstole everything they could find still they did not find it all an old woman pointed to the captives what will you do with them now send them off to a camp i suppose captain hawart answered we start killing them in cold blood theyll do the same to our men but they deserve to die the woman shouted angrily they killed us they took a couple of our girls to enjoy they stole they burned captain hawarts smile was hard and unpleasant theyll have a thin time of it granny i promise you that not thin enough stubborn as an ox the old woman stuck out her chin hawart did not argue with her he detailed a couple of men to take the captives back to the rear as the algarvians stumbled away glad to keep on breathing he waved his own men forward up to the stream he told them see it went just the way we planned it so it had leudast scratched his head he wasnt used to things going as planned even retreats had been botched lately now the regiment had successfully advanced against the algarvian army the army that had thrown all foes back in confusion did that mean the line of the stream would hold after all leudast was willing to find out a couple of algarvian behemoths came up toward the eastern back of the stream leudast suddenly got less optimistic about holding the position the regiment had just gainedto say nothing of living much longer he hoped the redheads would come close enough to let him blaze them off their great beasts but they were too warwise for that they started tossing eggs at the unkerlanters defending pfreimd and the streambank from a range at which leudast and his comrades could not hurt them but the unkerlanter eggtossers that had lobbed packets of sorcerous energy at the redheads in pfreimd now shifted their attention to the behemoths on the other side of the stream by chance one of their eggs burst right on top of one of the beasts that burst all the eggs the behemoth carried leudast shouted himself hoarse more eggs burst all around the other behemoths and wounded or killed one of the men atop it but it trotted away from the stream faster than it had advanced powers above we held them leudast knew he shouldnt have sounded astonished but he couldnt help himself magnulf nodded looking astonished too less than an hour later a messenger ran up after listening to him captain hawart cursed furiously pull back he shouted to his men weve got to pull back leudast cursed too why he burst out along with many others why ill tell you why hawart answered the redheads have broken through in a big way farther south thats why if we dont pull back now well have to try to fight our way out of another encirclement how many times can we stay lucky wearily leudast got to his feet wearily he tramped back through the wreckage of pfreimd the villagers cursed him and his comrades for retreating he couldnt blame them the regiment had done everything it was supposed to do and done it well even that hadnt helped here he was retreating again head down he slogged on looking down from his dragon on the unkerlanter landscape far below colonel sabrino smiled from the day the algarvians began their campaign it had gone better than the nobleman dared hope columns of behemoths broke through one unkerlanter defensive line after another and footsoldiers flooded into the gaps the great beasts tore the foe either found himself outflanked and surrounded or else had to flee for his life sabrino peered back over his shoulder at the wing he commanded sixtyfour dragons painted in the algarvian colors of green white and red he wished he were wearing a hat so he could wave itlike almost every algarvian ever born he delighted in theatrical gestures taking off his goggles and waving them didnt have the same flair he contented himself with a wave of the hand when he looked back over his shoulder again halfmore than halfthe dragonfliers were waving back to him his smile got wider and fonder they were good lads every one few had more than half his fiftyodd years hed fought on the ground in the six years war a generation before one stretch of soldiering in the mud had convinced him he never wanted to go through another thus dragons his mount twisted its long snaky neck this way and that it let out a fierce shriek that tore at his ears it was looking for unkerlanter dragons to flame out of the sky orbetter yet from its point of viewto claw and tear with its taloned forelegs it shrieked again oh shut up you cursed thing sabrino snapped the only people who romanticized dragons were those who knew nothing about them like any dragonflier sabrino scorned the beasts he flew badtempered stupid vicious no dragonfliers never ran out of bad things to say about their mounts he looked down once more looked down and spied a long column of wagons moving up toward the fighting front through the dust they kicked up rolling along a dirt road he pointed to it and also spoke into his crystal lets make sure those whoresons never get where theyre going the crystal was attuned to those his squadron leaders carried aye sir well do it captain domiziano one of those squadron leaders said with a grin its what were forits what weve been doing all along he seemed altogether too young and eager to hold his rank or maybe that was just a sign sabrino was getting old down then sabrino ordered and used more hand signals to pass on the command to the dragonfliers who didnt have crystals his squadron leaders were relaying the order too in case the men watched them and not their wing commander from his seat at the base of his dragons neck sabrino leaned forward to tap out the command that would send the beast stooping like an outsized hawk at the wagons and draft animals below the dragon ignored him or possibly didnt notice the signal hed given it that was why he carried an irontipped goad he gave the command again this time with force that probably would have felled a man he did get the dragons attention it screeched in outrage and twisted its head back to glare at him with great yellow eyes he reached out with the goad and whacked it on the end of the nose it shrieked again even more angrily than before dragons were trained from the days when they were no more than newhatched lizards with evil dispositions never to flame the men who flew them but they were also very stupid every once in a while they forgot not this time after a last scream sabrinos dragon folded its wings and plummeted toward the unkerlanter supply column the wind whistled in sabrinos face one more glance behind him showed that the rest of the wing followed down on the ground the unkerlanters had spotted the dragons diving on them sabrino laughed as he watched them mill around not many could hope to run far enough or fast enough to escape the flames of destruction unkerlant by all the signs had been getting ready to attack algarve before king mezentios men struck first now the enemy was discovering what a mistake hed made imagining he could stand on equal terms against the greatest army the continent of derlavai had ever known here and there footsoldiers marching with the column blazed at the algarvian dragons sabrino spied the flashes from the business ends of their sticks they were brave they were also foolish a footsoldier couldnt carry a stick strong enough to bring down a dragon unless he hit it in the eye which required as near a miracle of blazing as made no difference he might also hit a dragonflier but sabrino preferred not to dwell on that the unkerlanters swelled from specks to insects to people with astonishing speed similarly their wagons stopped looking like toys they ripped the canvas cover off one of those wagons sabrino wondered what they were doing but not for more than a heartbeat to his horror he saw theyd concealed a heavy stick in the wagon soldiers in calflength rockgray tunics brought it to bear on one of the algarvian dragonfliers no sabrino cried in dismay as the beam spat upward to his frightened eyes it seemed bright as the sun wide as the sea no dragons scales not even if they were silvered could withstand a beam like that at close range the beam lashed out again but the stick had not been aimed his way since he was in the lead he couldnt tell whether it had struck one of the beasts behind himno time to look back not now the stick slewed toward him as the unkerlanters swung it on its mounting if it blazed once more it was death sabrino slapped his dragon a different way this time the beast obeyed without hesitation not least because he was ordering it to do what it already wanted to do its great jaws yawned wide it belched forth a sheet of flame that engulfed the unkerlanters heavy stick and the men who served it fumes reeking of brimstone blew back into sabrinos face he coughed and cursed but he would rather have smelled that odor just then than his mistress most delicate perfume those fumes and the flames from which they sprang had just saved his life nearer the head of the column the dragon flamed again incinerating a wagon and the horses that pulled it sabrino whacked it with the goad to make it gain height and come round for another run as its great wings worked behind himhe could feel the mighty muscles contract and loosen contract and loosen with every wingbeathe craned his neck to see how the rest of the dragonfliers had served the supply column he waved the goad with glee great clouds of black smoke rose into the sky the pyre of dozens of wagonloads of food clothing eggs stickswho could guess whatthat would never reach the unkerlanters struggling to hold back the algarvian footsoldiers and behemoths a good many unkerlanter soldiers and drivers had burned too so had a good many horses not all of them men or beasts died at once a burning horse ran madly through a wheatfield spreading fire wherever it went it galloped close to half a mile before falling over and two dragons lay not far from the wreckage of the unkerlanter column that meant two algarvian dragonfliers surely dead sabrino cursed the unkerlanters had caught him by surprise there they fought hard from what hed seen they fought harder than either the forthwegians or the valmierans already the word had gone through the algarvian armydont let yourself get captured behind the enemys lines sabrino spoke into the crystal once more weve done what we came to do now we can head back to the dragon farm and get ready to do it all over again tomorrow aye sir captain orosio said im already bringing my men up into formation and so he was though a good deal older than domiziano he hadnt commanded a squadron for nearly so long as the other man poor fellow sabrino thought his family connections arent all they might be now that orosio had the squadron he handled it with matteroffact competence too bad he couldnt get it sooner orosios squadron was in fact the first one to reform because of that sabrino ordered that squadron up above the rest to cover them from attack by unkerlanter dragons as they flew east here and there below them knots of unkerlanter troopers still held out against the algarvians elsewhere though algarvian behemoths some carrying eggtossers others with heavy sticks mounted on their mailcovered backs trotted west with next to no one even to slow them down by all the signs it was a rout but when the wing flew over land where thered been fighting sabrino saw as hed seen before that things werent so simple the unkerlanters had fought hard in every village and town most of them were little more than charred rubble and the corpses of men and behemoths unicorns and horses scattered through fields pockmarked with craters from bursting eggs proclaimed how hard theyd fought in open country too dragons colonel captain orosios sharp warning snapped sabrino out of his reverie dragons they were half a dozen of them painted in unkerlanter rockgray that made them hard to spot against the hazy sky they were flying back toward the west which meant theyd been raiding behind the algarvian lines they could have escaped sabrinos wing and fled into the all but limitless plains of unkerlant instead no matter how outnumbered they were they flew straight for the algarvian dragons for sabrino it wasnt a question of urging his mount on it was a question of holding back the dragon of making the attack part of an organized assault on the unkerlanters rather than a wild beasts headlong rush with the dragon goad in his right hand he used his stick with his left aiming from dragonback was tricky but hed had a lot of practice if he blazed an enemy flier the fellows dragon would be nothing more than a wild beast as likely to attack friend as foe hed fought unkerlanters in the air before and had a low opinion of their skill seeing six assail sixty or so he also had a low opinion of their common sense but as with their comrades on the ground hed never been able to fault their courage here they came as if they outnumbered his dragonfliers ten to one instead of the other way round they couldnt have hoped to win or even to escape they intended to sell themselves as dearly as possible for his part he wanted to dispose of them as fast as he could he sent several of his dragons after each of theirs to give them no chance for heroism somebody blazed one of their fliers almost at once that dragon suddenly on its own flew off another one plunged to the ground when an algarvian got in back of it without its fliers knowing and flamed it from behind inside a couple of minutes all the unkerlanter dragons were out of the fight sabrino himself blazed the dragonfliers his group of algarvians attacked but one of king swemmels men got a measure of revenge a couple of algarvian dragons had flamed the one he flew it was horribly burned and so no doubt was he still he made it obey one last command he flew it straight against an algarvian dragon they smashed together and both tumbled out of the sky that was a brave man sabrino said softly a moment later as an afterthought he added curse him save for the algarvians the heavens were empty sabrino waved the wing back toward the dragon farm where they and the handlers would tend to their beasts but now they had one more slot that wanted filling ealstan looked up from the page of bookkeeping questions his father had set him to find his cousin sidroc grinning a most unpleasant grin im done with my work for the night sidroc said but then i only have what the school dishes out i told you youd end up stuck with more aye and youve been telling me tootelling me and telling me ealstan said why dont you shut up and let me finish he wished leofsig his older brother were around but leofsig had gone to hear music with felgilde whom hed been seeing even before he went into king pendas levy sidroc went off he did his best to look insulted but he was chuckling too ealstan felt like chucking the inkwell after his cousin instead with a sour frown he buckled down and finished the rest of the problems after rising he stretched till his back creaked hed been sitting there a long time it certainly seemed a long time he took the problems into the parlor where his father and uncle hengist were sharing a news sheet his father turned away from the sheet all right son he said lets see what youve done with this lot lets see what this lots done to me ealstan returned uncle hengistsidrocs fatherlaughed ealstans father smiled for a moment and started checking the work sidroc must have got his habit of interrupting from hengist who set the news sheet on his lap and said looks like the unkerlanters are finished eh hestan algarves going to be top dog for a long time to come what was that hestan asked his mind had been on the questions sidrocs father repeated himself hestan shrugged the only news the algarvians let into gromheortinto any of forthwegis what makes them look good if anything goes wrong well never hear about it nobodys said the unkerlanters are calling the redheads liars and the unkerlanters call people liars even when theyre telling the truth hengist replied hestan only shrugged again he tapped ealstans paper with a fingernail son you reckoned simple interest here you should have compounded it a client would not be happy to find that sort of error in his books which one father ealstan looked down to see what hed done wrong he thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand ill fix it he said and ill remember next time too he hated making mistakes in which he was very much his fathers son the only real difference between them was that his dark beard was still thin and wispy while gray had started to streak hestans otherwise they could have come from the same mold broadshouldered swarthy hooknosed like most forthwegians and their unkerlanter cousins let me explain again when you use simple interest and when you must compound hestan began before he could explain hengist interrupted once more looks like the algarvians and the zuwayzin are both heading toward glogau thats the biggest port the unkerlanters have up on the warm side of derlavai cursed near the only port up there too except for a couple way out to the west what do you think of that he waved the news sheet at hestan i think it would matter more if unkerlant didnt have such an enormous hinterland ealstans father answered the unkerlanters need things from the rest of the world less than other kingdoms do they need sense is what they need though you cant haul that on ships hengist pointed toward his brother and you need some sense yourself you just hate the idea of algarve winning thats all dont you uncle hengist ealstan spoke before hestan could now hengist shrugged if we couldnt beat the redheads what difference does it make things wont be too bad i dont expect its not like we were kaunians or anything like that remember what the algarvians are letting your son learn hestan answered remember what they arent youre right they save the worst for the kauniansbut they do not wish us well they ruled here when we were boyshave you forgotten hengist said if they hadnt lost the six years war if the unkerlanters hadnt fought among themselves we wouldnt have gotten a king of our own back the redheads treated forthwegians better than the unkerlanters did farther west thats certain but we shouldbt free ealstan exclaimed forthweg is a great kingdom we were a great kingdom when the algarvians and the unkerlanters were nothing to speak of they had no business carving us up like a roast goose either a hundred years ago or now boy has spirit hengist remarked to hestan he turned back to ealstan if you want to get right down to it we arent carved up any more king mezentios men hold all of forthweg these days ealstan didnt want to get right down to it not like that without waiting to hear when he should use simple interest and when compound he left the parlor behind him hestan said in the old days a forthwegian or even a blond kaunian could get ahead in algarvenot as easily as a redhead but an able man could make do i dont see that happening now well i dont want a kaunian getting ahead of meunless shes a pretty girl in tight trousers uncle hengist laughed thats where sidroc comes by it all right ealstan thought instead of going back to his room he went into the kitchen intending to hook a plum he hesitated when he discovered his older sister conberge in there kneading dough since hard times and the algarvians came to gromheort his sister and even his mother had grown stern about making food disappear like that but conberge looked up from her work and smiled at him thus encouraged he sidled up her smile didnt disappear when he reached toward the bowl of fruit she didnt swat him with a floury hand he took a plum and bit into it it was very sweet juice dribbled down his chin through the sparse hairs of his sprouting beard what have you got there his sister asked pointing not to the plum but to the paper in his other hand bookkeeping problems father set me ealstan answered with a little effort he managed a smile im not wild about doing them but at least he doesnt switch me when i make mistakes the way a master would at school let me see conberge said and ealstan handed her the sheet she looked it over nodded and gave it back you used simple interest once when you should have compounded aye so father told ealstan stopped and stared i didnt know you could cast accounts he couldnt tell whether he sounded indignant or astonishedboth at once probably they dont teach you that in the girls academy conberges smile turned sour no they dont maybe they should but they dont father did though he said you never could tell and i might have to be able to earn my own way one day this was before the war started mind you oh ealstan glanced back toward the parlor his father and uncle hengist were still going back and forth back and forth but he couldnt make out what they were saying father sees a long way ahead his sister nodded it was a lot harder than writing bad poetry which is what my schoolmistresses set me to doing though they didnt know it was bad but i think better because of ii do you know what i mean maybe you dont because they will teach boys some worthwhile things they wouldtill the algarvians got their hands on the school ealstan said bitterly but he shook his head he didnt want to distract himself i didnt know father had taught you anything like that though and up until not very long ago i wouldnt have told you either conberges grimace made ealstan see the world in a way he hadnt before she said men dont usually want women to know too much or be too brightor to show they know a lot or theyre bright anyhow if you ask me its because most men dont know that much and arent that bright themselves dont look at me like that when you say such things ealstan said which made his sister laugh he grabbed another plum all right you can have that one but thats all conberge said if you think youll get away with any more you arent that bright ealstan laughed then perhaps drawn by his amusement and his sisters sidroc came in from the door that opened on the courtyard seeing ealstan with a plum in his hand he grabbed one himself conberge couldnt do anything about it not with ealstan eating one as she turned back to the bread dough sidroc asked whats so funny his voice came blurry around a big mouthful of plum he looked a good deal like ealstan save that his nose bore a closer resemblance to a turnip than to a sickle blade getting stuck with bookkeeping problems ealstan answered men conberge added sidroc looked from one of them to the other then suspiciously he looked at the plum has this thing turned into brandy while i wasnt looking he asked ealstan and conberge both shrugged so solemnly that they started laughing again sidroc snorted i think the two of you have gone daft is what i think youre probably right ealstan told him they do say that too many bookkeeping problems compounded quarterly his sister broke in compounded quarterly aye ealstan agreed bookkeeping problems compounded quarterly cause calcification of the brain even you dont know what that means sidroc said it means my brain is turning into a rock like yours was to start with ealstan said if the algarvians had let you take stonelore you would have found out for yourself think youre so smart sidroc kept smiling but his voice held an edge well maybe you are but so what so whatthats what i want to know whats it gotten you without waiting for an answer he pitched his plum pit into the trash basket and stalked out of the kitchen ealstan wished he could ignore the question it was too much to the point since sidroc hadnt stayed around he turned back to conberge what has being smart got me or you either nothing i can see would you rather be stupid that wont get you anything either conberge said after a moments thought she went on if youre smart when you grow up you turn into someone like father thats not so bad no but ealstan remained unhappy even father thoughwhat is he a bookkeeper in a conquered kingdom where the algarvians dont want us to know enough to be bookkeepers but hes teaching you anyhow and he taught me too conberge reminded him if that isnt fighting back against the redheads what is youre right ealstan glanced toward the parlor his father and uncle hestan were still arguing then he looked at conberge as surprised as hed been when he discovered she knew how to cast accounts sometimes i think i dont know you at all maybe i should have gone on seeming stupid his sister shook her head then id sound like sidroc he isnt really stupid not when he doesnt want to be ealstan said ive seen that no hes not conberge agreed but he doesnt care about the way things are right now hes happy enough to let the algarvians run forthweg so is uncle hengist all they want to do is get along i want to fight back if i can me too ealstan said realizing his father might have been teaching him more than bookkeeping after all milady he is waiting for you downstairs bauska said as marchioness krasta dithered between two fur wraps well of course he is krasta answered finally choosing the red fox over the marten but you should have gone down there some little while ago the maidservant said he is an algarvian what will he do to you he wont do a thing krasta said with rather more confidence than she felt standing straighter and brushing back a stray lock of pale gold hair she added i have him wrapped around my little finger that was a lie and she knew it with a younger suitor a more foolish suitor it might well have been true colonel lurcanio though to her sometimes intense annoyance did not yield himself so readily when krasta did go downstairs she found lurcanio with his arms folded across his chest and a sour expression on his face good of you to join me at last he said i was beginning to wonder if i should ask one of the kitchen women to go with me to the kings palace in your place from most men that would have been annoyed bluster lurcanio was annoyed but he did not bluster if he said hed been thinking of taking one of the kitchen wenches to the palace he meant it im here so lets be off krasta said lurcanio did not move but stood looking down his straight nose at her she needed a moment to realize what he expected it was more annoying than anything he required of her in bed grudgingly very grudgingly she gave it to him im sorry then well say no more about it lurcanio replied affable again now that hed got his way he offered her his arm she took it they went out to his carriage together his driver said something in algarvian that sounded rude had he been krastas servant she would have struck him or dismissed him on the spot lurcanio only laughed that irked her lurcanio knew it irked her and did it anyhow to remind her valmiera was a conquered kingdom and she a victors plaything after the carriage began to roll she asked him have you ever been able to learn what became of my brother i am afraid i have not colonel lurcanio answered with what sounded like real regret captain skarnu marquis skarnu is not known to have been slain he is not known to have been captured he is not known to have been among those who surrendered after king gainibu capitulated it could beand for your sake my lovely lady i hope it isthat the records of capture and surrender are defective it would not be the first time what if they arent krasta asked lurcanio did not reply after a few seconds she recognized the expression on his long somber face as pity you think hes dead she exclaimed milady there at the end the war moved very swiftly the algarvian officer replied a man might fall with all his comrades too caught up in the retreat to bring him with them our own soldiers would have been more concerned with the valmierans still ahead than with those who could endanger them no more it could be so krasta did not want to believe it but with most of a year passed since shed heard from skarnu she had a hard time denying it too as was her way when a painful fact stared her in the face she looked in another direction in this case around priekule i dont see so many algarvian soldiers on the streets these days i dont think you are likely right lurcanio said some of them have gone west to join in the fight against king swemmel hes a nasty sort krasta said he deserves whatever happens to him and so does his kingdom civilization as far as she was concerned did not run west of algarve not so long before she would have said it did not run west of valmiera someone shouted at her from a dark side street algarvians hired twat running footsteps said the fellow whod yelled had not lingered to note the effects of his remark in that no doubt he was wise had she been able to catch him krasta would not have been gentle colonel lurcanio patted her leg a little above the knee just another fool he said so take no notice of him i do not need to hire you do i of course not krasta tossed her head had lurcanio offered her money for the use of her body she would have thrown everything she could reach at him hed done nothing of the sort hed simply made her afraid of what might happen if she said no she chose not to dwell on that she did not care to think of herself as afraid ah here we are lurcanio said a little later as the carriage came up to the palace an impressive building the royal palace in trapani is larger but i think less magnificent one can imagine ruling all the world from here after that praise his laughter sounded doubly cruel one can imagine it but not all that one can imagine comes true he descended from the carriage and handed krasta down shall we pay our respects to your king who does not rule all the world from here he laughed again i came here the night king gainibu declared war against algarve krasta said then he still ruled some of the world from here colonel lurcanio said he would have done better to keep silent he would have gone on ruling some of the world now he has to ask the leave of an algarvian commissioner before he takes a glass of spirits if algarve hadnt invaded the duchy of bari he wouldnt have had to declare war krasta said then everything would still be as it was lurcanio leaned over and brushed his lips across hers you must be an innocent you are too decorative to be a fool he began ticking points off on his fingers item we didnt invade bari we took back what was ours the men welcomed us with open arms the women with open legs i know i was there item valmiera had no business detaching bari from algarve after the six years war it was done but as with wizards what one can do another can undo and item things would not still be as they were just for a moment long enough to make krasta shiver he might have been one of his barbarous ancestors had you not gone for us we would have come after you krasta turned and looked back toward the kaunian column of victory it still stood in its ancient park pale and proud and tall in the moonlight unlike during the six years war no damage had come to it in this fight even so the imperial victories it commemorated had never seemed so distant to her well lurcanio said let us go in then and pay our respects to your illustrious sovereign he spoke without discernible irony in the wink of an eye hed pulled the cloak of polished noble courtier over whatever lay beneath in the palace king gainibus servitors bowed to lurcanio as they might have to a count of valmieran blood or perhaps even as they might have to a duke of valmieran blood they fawned on krasta as if she were duchess rather than marchioness too that went a long way toward improving her mood at the door to the reception hallthe grand hall krasta realized the hall in which gainibu had declared his illfated wara uniformed algarvian soldier checked lurcanios name and hers against a list after affirming they had the right to go past him he stood aside he and lurcanio spoke briefly in their own language what was that about krasta asked irritably making sure neither of us is an assassin in disguise lurcanio answered still a few malcontents loose in the provinces theyve murdered some nobles who cooperate with us and some of our men too if they managed to sneak a murderer in here they could do us some harm he thought of harm to his kingdom krasta thought of harm to herself when she looked around the room she found it odd to realize algarvians were more likely to keep her safe than her own countrymen she made a beeline for the bar and got herself a brandy laced with wormwood she tossed it back as if it were ale the sooner the world got blurry the better shed like it lurcanio took a glass of white wine for himself he drank he enjoyed drinking krasta had seen that but shed never seen him fuddled she doubted she ever would foolishness she thought anything worth doing was worth doing to excess shall we go over and greet his majesty lurcanio asked glancing toward the receiving line at whose head gainibu stood his mouth tightened perhaps we should do it now while he will still remember who we areand who he is gainibu held a large tumbler half full of amber spirits by the way he stood by the vague expression on his face hed already emptied it a good many times krasta remembered lurcanios sardonic comment outside the palace the algarvian commissioner must not have given the king any trouble about refills krasta and lurcanio worked their way up the receiving line it was shorter than it would have been before the war not all the guests bothered presenting themselves to gainibu he was not the most important man in the room not any more several of lurcanios superiors possessed more authority than he again krasta had the sense of ground shifting under her feet gainibus decorations honorary and earned glittered on his chest lurcanio saluted him as junior officer to senior krasta bowed low your majesty she murmured ah the marchioness gainibu replied though krasta was not sure he knew which marchioness she was and with a friend i see aye with a friend he took another sip from the tumbler his eyes followed it as he lowered it from his mouth before the war his eyes had followed beautiful women that way theyd followed krasta that way more than once what was she now just another noblewoman on a conquerors arm less interesting than the spirits that swirled in his glass lurcanio touched krastas elbow she let him lead her away behind her king gainibu mumbled something courteous to someone else he is not the man he was lurcanio said hardly caring whether gainibu heard or not in a different tone it might have been pity it was scorn to her surprise sudden tears filled krastas eyes she looked back toward the king there he stood impressive amiable drunk his kingdom was a prisoner of algarve and he she thought with a burst of insight that surely came from the wormwood was a prisoner within himself now we have done our duty lurcanio said we can enjoy ourselves the rest of the evening aye krasta said though she had seldom felt less like enjoying herself excuse me for a moment she hurried over to the bar an expressionless servitor gave her another glass of the wormwoodflavored brandy she gulped it down with reckless speed have a care there lurcanio said from behind her will i need to carry you up the stairs to your bedchamber tonight an eyebrow quirked i do not think i need to make you pass out drunk to have my way with you no melancholy and insight were not natural to krasta ingenious lubricity was she ran her tongue over her lips tilted a hip and gazed saucily up at the algarvian officer but would you enjoy it that way he considered slowly he smiled once perhaps everything is interesting once krasta needed to hear no more she turned back to the bar and began to drink in earnest three pekka was beginning to hate knocks on her office door they always seemed to come in the middle of important calculations and the last thing she wanted was to discover ilmarinen or even some other theoretical sorcerer standing on his head in the hallway as she had once before maybe it would be a kajaani city college student she could she hoped get rid of a student in a hurry she got up and opened the door that done she had to fight back a gasp of dismay the smile that appeared on her face was an excellent job of conjuring professor heikki she exclaimed for all the world as if she were delighted to have her department chairman visit her at that moment wont you come in maybe heikki would say no maybe knowing pekka was here and working would satisfy her but she said aye i thank you and strolled in as if it were her office and pekka the visitor pekka in fact waited for her to sit down behind the desk but heikki planted her rather broad bottom in the chair in front of it retreatingand it felt like a retreatto her own chair pekka brushed a strand of coarse black hair away from her narrow eyes and asked what can i do for you this afternoon whatever heikki wanted pekka was sure it had nothing to do with the project that had engrossed her for so long heikki had got to be the chairman of the department of sorcery more for her bureaucratic talents than for her magecraft her specialty was veterinary sorcery in unkind moments pekka thought shed chosen it to make sure she knew more than her patients i am disturbed heikki said now in what way pekka asked by the chairmans expression it might have been dyspepsia pekka knew she would get herself in trouble if she suggested stomach bitters knowing just made the temptation harder to resist i am disturbed heikki repeated i am disturbed at the amount of time you are spending in the laboratory of late and at the expense of your recent experiments surely theoretical sorcery being uh theoretical requires less experimentation than other forms of the art in lieu of picking up a vase and smashing it over the department chairmans head pekka replied professor sometimes theory and experiment have to go hand in hand sometimes theory proceeds from experiment i am more concerned about our budget heikki said primly suppose you tell me what the nature of your experiments are so that i may judge whether they are worth the time and money you are expending on them pekka had not told her about the assault on the relationship between the laws of similarity and contagion no one without the most urgent need to know heard anything about that project all the theoretical sorcerers working on it agreed that was too dangerous and so doing her best to look regretful pekka murmured im very sorry but im afraid i cant do that what heikki leaned forward had the matter been less important she might have succeeded in intimidating pekka as things were pekka had to fight hard not to giggle the department chairman spoke in portentous tones when i ask a simple question i expect an answer you dont know any other kind of question pekka thought she smiled sweetly no what heikki said again how dare you refuse though her skin like pekkas was golden rather than pink a flush darkened her cheeks pekka said nothing more which seemed to disturb the chairman further if that is your attitude your laboratory privileges are hereby revoked and i shall bring your insubordination to the attention of the academic council she got to her feet and made a stately exit that vase sprang into pekkas mind again but chasing heikki down the hall and braining the department chairman would only get her talked about a different revenge more vicious if less bloody occurred to her a distant ancestor might have smiled that smile just before he sneaked into an enemy clans camp to slit a warriors throat pekka activated her crystal spoke briefly and then went back to work she had not been working long when another knock on the door made her set down her pen the fellow waiting in the hall was professor heikkis secretary and how may i help you today kuopio pekka asked with another of those sweetly bloodthirsty smiles the chairman would see you in her office right away he answered please tell her im busy pekka said perhaps day after tomorrow would do kuopio stared at her as if shed suddenly started speaking one of the clicking coughing languages of tropical siaulia she looked back without another word shaking his head the secretary departed pekka returned to her sheet of numbers and abstruse symbols if shed miscalculatednot on the problem of the two laws but on the knottier one of the kajaani city college bureaucracyshed be in hot water when a third knock came she jumped then hurried to the door there stood professor heikki hello again pekka said shed know in a moment heikki licked her lips she looked even more dyspeptic than she had earlier in the afternoon from that pekka knew shed won even before the department chairman said why did you not tell me your experiments had prince joroinens patronage i could not tell you anything about them pekka answered i cannot tell anyone anything about them i tried to tell you that but you would not hear me i wish you did not know i was experimenting at all so do i heikki said bitterly such ignorance would have spared me a great deal of the abuse i suffered just now i have been instructed to tell youshe spat out each word as if it tasted badthat the department is to offer you every possible assistance in your work andand to accept unchallenged any budgetary requisitions you submit plainly that hurt worse than anything else no one this side of the princely mints had such untrammeled access to money for a heady moment pekka wished she were a woman of extravagant tastes but joroinen would not have given what he gave had he reckoned her likely to abuse it she said what i want most is to be left alone to do what i need to do then that is what you shall have heikki backed away as if from a dangerous animal and pekka was a dangerous animal had she not been could she have caused one of the seven princes of kuusamo to turn on the department chairman who reckoned herself a princess within her realm pekka stood in the doorway and watched heikki retreat that helped turn the retreat into a rout by the time heikki reached a corner she was all but runningand was looking over her shoulder as she went so she nearly slammed into the far wall after heikki did successfully negotiate the corner pekka went back to her desk and got some of her calculations to an interesting point before yet another knock on the door this one from her husband ended the days work when she opened the door leino looked at her with curiosity flashing in his dark eyes what did you do to our distinguished chairman he asked as he and pekka walked across the campus to the caravan stop kept her out of my hair pekka answered these are modern times there are cures for head lice leino snorted i think your cure was to drop an egg on her i saw kuopio in the hall he flinched as if he thought id hit him too i didnt hit him i just told him no hes not used to that pekka smiled again i did hit heikkiwith prince joroinen ah so you did drop an egg on her leino said and then he said no more pekka blessed him for having better sense than heikkinot that that made much of a compliment but leino himself a mage of a more practical bent than pekkas could not help knowing she was working on an important project her trips to yliharma proved it ilmarinens recent visit to kajaani proved it but he hadnt asked questions he knew her well enough to know shed tell him what she could if she didnt tell him anything she couldnt tell him anything they bought a news sheet from a hawker at the caravan stop leino frowned at the lead story curse the gongs theyve sunk half a dozen of our ships off obuda weve thrown more into that fight than they have but they keep hanging on with reluctant admiration he added they are warriors theyre stubborn pekka said and then wondered if there was any difference between her words and her husbands she pointed to a smaller story about a bigger battle the unkerlanters are counterattacking against algarve they say theyre counterattacking anyhow leino answered theyve said that before too but they keep getting driven back he turned the news sheet over to read the rest of the story the algarvians say theres heavy fighting but theyre still going forward as the caravan came gliding up the ley line toward them he asked who do you hope wins that fight pekka considered i hope they both lose she said at last unkerlant is unkerlant and algarve is bent on taking vengeance on everyone who ever wronged her as best i can tell that means the rest of the world leino laughed then shook his head thats one of those things that would be funny if only it were funny if you know what i mean he stepped aside to let pekka get into the caravan car ahead of him the sun still stood high in the southwest as they walked from the caravan stop up the hill toward their house and that of pekkas sister in high summer it dipped below the horizon only very late and briefly even then no more than the brightest stars came out for twilight would linger till it rose again early the next morning kuusaman poets wrote verses about the pale nights of kajauni high summer did not incline pekka toward poetry it inclined her toward tearing her hair her sixyearold son was never easy to get to bed at any season of the year with the house light at almost all hours of the day and night getting uto to bed turned as near impossible as made no difference elimaki handed him over to pekka and leino with every sign of relief leinos laugh was rueful he knew what his sisterinlaws frazzled expression meant the house is still standing he remarked as if that were some consolation some perhaps but not enough not by the way elimaki rolled her eyes i didnt stuff him in the rest crate she said as if that proved her extraordinary virtue i was tempted to but i didnt and we thank you for that pekka said giving uto a glare that bounced off him like a beam from a stick off a dragons silvered belly i dont thank her uto said i want to see what its like in there aunt elimaki keeps her rest crate locked when she isnt using it for the same reason we keep ours locked when we arent using it leino said the magic in there is to keep food fresh it isnt to keep little boys fresh ayeyoure fresh enough already pekka told her son as if to prove her right uto stuck out his tongue leino swatted him on the bottom more to gain his attention than to punish him elimaki rolled her eyes again she said hes been like that all day long well take him home now pekka declared uto hopped off the porch and down the walk like a frog pekkas knees ached just watching him with a sigh she turned to leino some kinds of magic havent got anything to do with magecraft leino considered then solemnly nodded in days gone by cornelu had strolled through the streets of the shore town of tirgoviste in his uniform or in tunic and kilt of the latest style and the softest linen always perfectly pressed and pleated hed been proud to put himself on display to show off who and what he was a commander in the island kingdoms navy coming into algarvianoccupied tirgoviste now he still wore his best clothes such as they were a muchpatched sheepskin jacket over a sleeveless undertunic with a wool kilt that had long since lost whatever shape it might once have owned he looked like a shepherd from the inland hills down on his luck three days of ruddy stubble on his cheeks and chin only added to the impression the first algarvian soldier who saw him tossed him a coin saying here you poor beggar buy yourself a mug of wine by his accent he came from the far north of algarve algarvian and sibian were closely related tongues but a real shepherd from back in the hills probably wouldnt have understood him but the small silverpiece carried its own meaning cornelu bobbed his head and mumbled my thanks laughing nodding king mezentios soldier went on his way for all the world as if tirgoviste were his own town cornelu hated him for that despite his causal kindness cornelu hated him all the more because of his casual kindness toss a sibian dog a bone will you he thought not showing what he felt ate at him algarvians played at feuds made them into elegant games sibians nursed them cherished them never let them go a broadsheet pasted on a brick wall drew cornelus eye it showed two barechested swordswinging warriors from ancient days one was labeled algarve the other younger and half a head shorter sibiu below them was the legend sibians are an algarvic folk too join the struggle against unkerlanter barbarism below that a line of smaller type added see the recruiter dumbraveni street fury filled cornelu after a moment it leaked away a slow smile spread over his face instead if mezentios minions were trying to get sibians to fight for them how many men were they losing more than they could afford evidently but men hawking news sheets did their best to tell a different story they shouted about one algarvian victory in unkerlant after another by what they said herborn the biggest city in the duchy of grelz was on the point of falling even if that proved a lie that the algarvians had come far enough to make the claim did not speak well for the fight king swemmels men were putting up another algarvian soldier strolled by this one arm in arm with a girl who spoke sibian with a tirgoviste accent like cornelus they didnt always understand each other but they were having fun trying the girls face shone as she looked up at the man who had helped bring her kingdom to its knees again cornelu had to fight to keep from showing what he felt hed already come into the city a couple of times since swimming ashore after eforiel his leviathan was killed and had seen the same kinds of things then they tore at his heart sometoo manyof his countrymen were willing to accept that they had been conquered not i he muttered under his breath not i not ever he made his way along the hilly streets till he came to an eatery that had been fine once but had gone down in the world he nodded as he set his hand on the latch hed gone down in the world himself inside the place was cool and dim it smelled offish and the oil in which the cook fried them a couple of old men sat at one table nursing glasses of pear brandy a fisherman was demolishing a platter of fried prawns at another the rest were empty cornelu sat down on a stool at one of those a waiter came over with an expectant look cornelu glanced at the bill of fare chalked on a board behind the bar fried cod boiled parsnips and butter and a mug of ale he said aye the waiter went into a back room he didnt come out right away maybe he was the cook too he didnt have so much trade that he couldnt be both presently the door from the street opened cornelu started to leap to his feet a tiredlooking fisherman came in and sat down with the fellow eating prawns cornelu sank back onto his stool out came the waiter with his supper on a tray he set it down then took his new customers order that fellow wanted prawns like his friend cornelu started eating his fish it wasnt bad hed had better but also worse he sipped the ale like the fish it was middling good he ate slowly stretching out the meal making it last that wasnt easy he felt hungry as a wolf hed come up onto the island without a copper banu to his name and stayed alive doing odd jobs he really had herded sheep for a while hed spent a lot of time hungry coins clinked as the old men paid for their brandy they got up and left the waiter scooped their money into a leather pouch he wore at the front of his kilt cornelu raised a forefinger and asked for another mug of ale the waiter looked him over then raised an eyebrow he understood the challenge and set silver on the table mollified the waiter gave him what he wanted hed almost finished the parsnips and was halfway down that second ale when the door opened again a worn woman pushing a baby carriage paused in the doorway and looked at the handful of customers in the eatery a worn woman pushing a carriage for a moment to his shame that was all cornelu saw he salved his conscience by noting shed needed a moment to recognize him too then he did leap up as hed started to do before costache he exclaimed cornelu hed expected his wife to run to him in his dreams that was how it had been his dreams though had left out the carriage carefully pushing it ahead of her she made her way to his table then he embraced her then he kissed her as if from very far away he heard the fishermen sniggering he didnt care as far as he was concerned the powers below could swallow them both at last costache asked do you want to see your daughter what he wanted was a chance to start another child then and there he knew he couldnt have that as naturally as he could he looked down into the carriage what is her name he asked hed been able to write to his old address to the house where costache still lived but hed had no address of his own drifting from one place to another till this moment he hadnt known whether his child was boy or girl i called her brindza after your mother costache answered cornelu nodded it was good it was fitting he wished the baby could have been named eforiel but that would have been wrong the leviathan had still been living when she was born and what would milady care for today the waiter asked he might have been standing there for some time waiting to be noticed had he not spoken up he would have kept on waiting quite a while too whatever my husband had there will be fine for me too she answered sitting down on the stool next to cornelus she sounded dazed as if she didnt want to think right now cornelu understood that he felt dizzier drunker than if hed swallowed a tun of ale the waiter shrugged and went oft to the back room costache pointed a finger at cornelu as if in accusation i thought you were dead i was out to sea when the algarvians came he answered theyd already taken the harbor when i got back he spoke in a low voice so the fishermen couldnt overhear i didnt want to surrender so i took eforiel over to lagoas ive been there ever since along with the rest of the exiles doing what we could to fight mezentio now that costache wasnt in his arms anymore wasnt pressed against the flesh that had missed her so he took a longer look into the carriage the baby sleeping in there had a thin short fuzz of reddish hair she looks like you costache said softly she looks like a baby cornelu said as far as he was concerned all babies looked more or less alikeoh maybe not kuusamans or zuwayzin but the rest and yet even as that thought went through his mind he was trying to find his nose his chin on those small smooth features the waiter set down costaches supper if he found anything remarkable about a father staring at a daughter more than a year old as if hed never seen her before he kept it to himself costache ate absently she kept staring from cornelu to brindza and back again as if reconnecting the two of them in her mind how have you been cornelu asked her tired she answered at once if you have a baby youre tired you cant be anything else and times have been hard no pay no pension no money to hire a nurse to take care of brindza so i could make money on my own she shook her head tired she repeated i wish i could have let you know sooner that i was all right cornelu said some friends of mine were finally able to post that note he wondered if the lagoan raiders were still on the island he had no way to know not now i almost fell over in a faint when i recognized your script costache said and then the other notes started they wouldnt have but i got stranded here cornelu shook his head poor eforiel took all the energy from an egg ah too bad costache also shook her head she sounded sad but she did not understand not really no one but another leviathanrider could have understood cornelu had been more intimate with his wife but not a great deal intimate with his wife it had been so long he took a last swig from the second mug of ale can we go home now he asked confident he knew the answer but to his astonished chagrin costache shook her head again i dare not bring you home she said i have three algarvian officers billeted on me they have been correct in every way she added hastily but if you came there youd go into a captives camp the instant you walked through the door three algarvian officers cornelu echoed in tones that couldnt mean anything but three men i have to kill he thought pain and outrage would choke him clapping a hand to his forehead he exclaimed has it come to this then do i have to make an assignation to sleep with my own wife he barely remembered to keep his voice too low for the fishermen to hear him aye i fear it has come to that and even assignations wont be easy costache answered cornelu felt the veins of his neck tighten with fury fury at the algarvians fury at her fury at everything that kept him from taking what hed wanted so much for so very long before he could bellow like a bull brindza woke up and started to cry costache gave cornelu a weary smile and here you have one of the reasons assignations wont be easy she scooped the baby out of the carriage cornelu stared at his daughter he did his best not to see her only as an obstacle standing between him and taking costache to bed she looked back at him out of eyes that might have been her mothers with some effort he smiled she turned her face back toward costache as if to ask who is this person what she did say was mama shes shy with strangers right now costache said people say they all are at this age iam not a stranger cornelu wanted to shout iam her father that was true but brindza had no way of knowing it a new thought cut him like a dagger from out of the night iwonder if shes shy with the algarvians living in my house id better go costache said they will be wondering where i am at this hour she leaned forward and brushed cornel us lips with her own keep writing to me well meet again as soon as we can brindza up on one shoulder she pushed the carriage with the other as shed obviously had practice doing she used the carriage to butt the door open it closed behind her she was gone cornelu sat by himself in the eatery more alone in his hometown than he had been in exile in setubal as soon as bembo walked into the constabulary station in tricarico sergeant pesaros face warned him something was wrong the plump algarvian constable searched his conscience like a man ransacking his belt pouch for spare change rather to his surprise he found nothing but no matter how innocent he was or thought he was pesarowho was much rounder than hepointed a fleshy finger at him and growled you had to be so cursed smart didnt you what when bembo asked usually you call me an idiot the only time he could remember being smart lately was catching kaunians with their hair dyed he hadnt got in trouble for that hed earned a commendation even pretty little saffa had liked himfor a bit you are an idiot pesaro said even when youre smart youre an idiot tell me what youre talking about anyhow bembo said starting to get angry now id like to know what kind of idiot i am pesaro shook his head his flabby jowls wobbled ill leave it to captain sasso no patrols today except for a few lucky bastards the rest of us have to assemble at midmorning then youll find out wondering if sasso was going to order him executed before the assembled constables bembo tried to pry more out of the sergeant but had no luck cursing under his breath he went back to the offices to see if anyone there knew and would talk saffa sneered at him and tossed her fine head of fiery red hair when he walked in he ignored her which no doubt left her disappointed he ended up disappointed too if anyone did know what sasso would say he wouldnt admit it nothing to do but wait and worry and fume till midmorning then along with the rest of the constables bembo trooped out to the scruffy lawn in back of the station the summer sun beat down on him sweat rolled down his face and started to darken his tunic stewing in my own juices he thought captain sasso strutted up to the front of the assembled men without preamble he announced king mezentio is taking a contingent from every constabulary force in algarve into his service to control captives to round up criminals and undesirables in the newly conquered lands and to free up more of our soldiers for the fight against the kingdoms foes a low murmur ran through the constables pesaro mouthed now do you remember at bembo and bembo had to nod hed seen the need a year before the authorities had but his opinion of the authorities cleverness was low sasso hadnt finished from tricarico the following constables have been selected for the aforementioned service he pulled a list from a breast pocket and began reading names pesaros was on it which explained why he was irate and then a moment later bembo heard his own name sasso went through the whole list then continued men named here will report in uniform to the caravan depot at noon tomorrow for transportation to your new assignment bring all necessary constabulary gear but no more personal effects than will fit into your belt pouches and one small pack i know you will acquit tricarico well men he spun on his heel and marched away without so much as calling for questions tomorrow bembo howled his was far from the only cry of amazement and dismay he raised his hands to the uncaring sky how can we go tomorrow powers above how can we go at all southern unkerlant is lovely in the wintertime said a constable who was staying in tricarico he kissed his fingertips so white so fair and winter there doesnt last more than threefourths of the year your wife is lovely in a whorehouse bed bembo snarled he kissed his fingertips too so white so fair and your daughter the same they both charge more than theyre worth though with a curse the other constable hurled himself at bembo normally no braver than he had to be bembo was ready to brawl before either of them could throw more than a punch or two though their comrades got between them when you come home wretch our friends will settle where we can meet the other constable said you havent got any friends bembo retorted ask your wife to help she has dozens hundreds sergeant pesaro shoved bembo away before the fight could flare again let it go he said getting in trouble wont keep you off the caravan bembo hadnt thought of that and wished he had pesaro went on we arent going to unkerlant anyhow some other poor whoresons get stuck with that were heading for forthweg the weather will be better anyhow huzzah bembo said sourly he cocked his head to one side how do you know where were going pesaro only smiled after a moment bembo realized it was a foolish question pesaro was fat and slow and a long way from young if he didnt know things what good was he he thumped bembo on the shoulder go on go home get ready were stuck with it if youre not on the caravan car with me tomorrow youre a deserter during wartime he sliced a thumb across his throat thus encouraged bembo went back to his flat packing didnt take long not with the limits captain sasso had imposed he drank his dinner for good measure he drank his supper too with nothing better to do he went to bed early he woke with a pounding head and a taste in his mouth like the river downstream from the sewage works a glass of wine helped dull both complaints he still felt lethargic and abused but hed felt that way before shouldering the few belongings he could bring he made for the depot he got there at the same time as his frequent partner oraste pesaro checked off both their names oraste was quiet and looked somewhat the worse for wear too maybe hed spent his last night in tricarico the same way bembo had bembo was climbing up into the caravan car when someonea womancalled wait saffa came running up she threw herself into his arms and gave him a kiss that made him forget his headache then she slipped away and said there is that because im sorry youre going or because im glad youll never know she headed back toward the constabulary station putting everything she had into her walk dont stand there gaping with your tongue hanging out pesaro told bembo go on get aboard bembo didnt move till saffa was out of sight then as if a spell were broken he shook himself and obeyed but for the constables from tricarico the leyline caravan carried no passengers as soon as the last man climbed into the carwith curses from pesaro for being the lastthe caravan began its long glide west the bradano mountains sank below the horizon wheatfields meadows with cattle and sheep grazing in them vineyards and groves of almonds and olives and citrus fruit slid past outside the windows before long bembo got into a dice game and stopped worrying about the scenery just after noon the caravan stopped in a mediumsized town along the ley line half a dozen iratelooking men in constables uniform filed aboard hello bembo said misery loves company looks like the caravan stopped several times during the afternoon at each stop another contingent of disgruntled constables got on by the time the caravan began to near what had been the forthwegian border all the cars were full bembo doubted there was a happy man in any of them pesaro pointed out the window look at all the behemoths feeding there and we saw even more unicorns a little while ago behemoths unicorns constables bembo shrugged all animals that get ridden off to war whether they want to or not at what had been the border with forthweg the caravan halted again by then lampsdim ones in case the unkerlanters managed to sneak a few dragons throughwere shining in every car an algarvian army officer bounded up into the car in which bembo rode on behalf of his majesty king mezentio i thank you for entering his service he said with you to patrol the towns and villages of forthweg we can use the soldiers who were on garrison duty as soldiers should be used in the fighting if constables are constables then soldiers can be soldiers that sounded good it even impressed bembotill he remembered that the officer was as far behind the lines as he was where in blazes are we bound anyway he asked he saw no need to treat the officer as he would have a superior in his service in spite of the fellows fancy talk a scowl said the officer realized that too but he answered mildly enough constables in this car will get off at gromheort not far from here he coughed some of them may be fortunate they are replacing the army there and not elsewhere on the other hand army discipline might improve them bembo did not rise to that one narrow escape was enough the caravan slid along the ley line toward gromheort he tried to remember if hed ever heard of the place he didnt think so it would have been under algarvian rule before the six years war so it might not prove too bad but he wouldnt have bet more than a copper on that nor did his first glimpse by moonlight send him into raptures the depot was battered and about one building in four between it and the barracks where the constables would spend the night had been wrecked the forthwegians fought hard here explained the officer who guided them to the barracks why havent they repaired it since bembo asked safely anonymous in the darkness they have the army officer answered if you think its bad now you should have seen it just after we took it he pointed ahead to a low squat building that once must have housed cattle or forthwegian soldiers go through the curtains one man at a time to keep light from spilling out inside the barracks were as bad as bembo had expected after a day spent traveling across northern algarve he didnt care he hurried to a pallet set his pack under his head in lieu of a pillow he labored under no delusions about his fellow constables who were bound to have some lightfingered souls among them and went to sleep next morning glumlooking forthwegians served up bread and olive oil and harsh red wine another algarvian army officer came in and distributed maps of gromheort to those constables who would patrol it things are pretty quiet he told the newcomers just keep em that way and everything will be fine he offered no suggestions on how to achieve that laudable end without enough breakfast to suit him without a bath without really knowing his way around bembo was thrust out onto the streets of gromheort forthwegians in long tunics glared at him or tried to pretend he didnt exist kaunians got out of his way in a hurry that at least felt right and proper no one did anything in the least untoward all the same he walked far more warily than he would have back in tricarico there only the rare desperate fool would take on a constable here in a sullen conquered kingdom who could say he didnt want to find out the hard way at midmorning feeling peckish he stepped into an eatery and demanded an omelette the proprietor made as if he didnt understand algarvian bembos gut told him the fellow was bluffing he hefted his club and growledand got his omelette he didnt care for the cheese the forthwegian used but it wasnt too bad patting his belly he walked out you pay the proprietor exclaimedhe knew some algarvian all right bembo only laughed if he wouldnt have paid for a meal back in tricaricoand he wouldnthe was cursed if hed do it here in a land algarve had won by the sword what could the forthwegian do if he didnt not a thing he snapped his fingers and went on his way in summer a cold bath looked better to leofsig than at other seasons of the year after a day of building roads in the sun he took himself to gromheorts public baths to wash off the sweat and dirt before he went home he paid the attendant at the door a copper hung his tunic on a peg in the antechamber and naked hurried toward the pools and plunges beyond he tested the water of what had been the warm plunge with a toe not too bad said an older man already in there could be chillier than this and feel good on a day like today aye thats so leofsig slid into the water himself he rubbed at his hide by the time he got through he was three shades lighter than when hed begun the plunge wasnt so warm as to make him want to linger though as it would have been in happier times he climbed up the steps and headed for the soaping room the liquid soap in the troughs wasnt what it had been before the war either it was cheap and harsh with lye and smelled nasty when he rubbed it into a little cut on his arm it burned like fire an enormous rub stood in the rinsing room he grabbed a bucket with a pierced bottom filled it in the tub and hung it from a hook at a level above his head as the water in it streamed out through the holes he stood under it and let the soap run off down the drain a man in a hurry could make do with one bucket tonight leofsig used two on the other side of the brick wall women were rinsing as every man of gromheort had surely done leofsig imagined that wall suddenly made transparent imagining felgilde his almostfiancee bare and wet and slick made the water seem warmer than it was imagining the screech shed let out if the wall did turn transparent made him laugh he set the bucket back by the tub for another bather to use then got a towel from a kaunian attendant whod been there as long as he could rememberand as long as his father could remember too when leofsig was younger hed once said maybe hes been handing out towels since the days of the kaunian empire hestan had laughed but then precise as always hed shaken his head and said no people bathing together is a forthwegian custom and an unkerlanter one too but not a kaunian one dry and clean now leofsig threw his towel into a wickerwork basket and went up to the antechamber to get his tunic he hated to put it back on it was grimy and smelly but he was no zuwayzi to walk unconcerned through the streets of gromheort without a stitch on illchange when i get home he thought hed gone only a block or so when a chubby algarvian in tunic and kilt of cut somewhat different from the armys spoke to him in algarvian i dont know your language he said in forthwegian that wasnt quite true but unlike his brother ealstan and cousin sidroc he hadnt had to learn it in school plainly the redhead didnt follow him either leofsig tried classical kaunian do you understand me now no sooner were the words out of his mouth than he wondered if hed made a bad mistake the algarvians despised everything in any way connected to kaunians but this fellow after frowning answered in halting thickly accented kaunian understanding little not using when after since school he beamed at coming up with the right word leofsig nodded to show he understood too what do you want he asked speaking slowly and clearly not finding the algarvian said after a moment leofsig realized he meant lost the redhead pulled a sheet of paper out of a tunic pocket it turned out to be a map of gromheort he pointed going here please here was a barracks where soldiers had been garrisoned the algarvian waved one of his peoples extravagant gestures i now where he made a comic display of frustration and embarrassment i will show you leofsig said hed started to help before remembering he hated the conquerors he had trouble hating this particular one who was rumpled and funny and had asked for help instead of demanding it and so instead of sending him the wrong way leofsig traced the route back to the barracks on the map ah the algarvian swept off his hat and bowed as deeply as his rotund frame would allow thanking he bowed again leofsig nodded in return forthwegians were a less demonstrative people peering at the map the redhead went off down the street maybe he would find the barracks he was headed in the right direction anyhow he looked back to leofsig and waved leofsig gave him another nod and headed on toward his own home he mentioned the affable algarvian over supper his father nodded that must be one of the constables theyre bringing in hestan said if they use constables to keep order hereabouts they can put more soldiers into the attack on unkerlant he glanced over to uncle hengist as if hed just proved a point by the way hengist fidgeted maybe hestan had hengist said theyre still moving forward by the news sheet theyve trapped a big army west of the capital of the duchy of grelzforget the cursed places name after a while unkerlant will run out of armies herborn ealstan put in unless algarve runs out first hestan added hengist snorted and gestured dismissively almost as if he were an algarvian himself hestan sipped from his cup of wine then turned back to leofsig and what was this constable like son he didnt seem too bad a fellow leofsig answered about as much as he would say for any algarvian he thanked me when i showed him where he ought to go none of their soldiers would have all their soldiers were good for were pinches on the bottom conberge said i never had that happen to me leofsig observed youd best be glad you didnt sidroc said archly everyone laughed it was easier and more comforting to think of the algarvians as womanchaserswhich they werethan as warriors who had overwhelmed all their opponentswhich unfortunately for their neighbors they also were would anyone like more of this beansandcheese casserole leofsigs mother asked reaching out to touch the spoon in the bowl theres plenty for once i went to the markets early and got the cheese before it all disappeared ill take more elfryth hestan said leofsig and sidroc pushed their plates toward her too if his mother hadnt said there was plenty and plainly meant it leofsig would have made do with one helping hed grown resigned to being hungry a lot of the time feeling full as he did after his seconds seemed strange almost unnatural after supper ealstan came to him for help with a bookkeeping problem their father had set him leofsig looked at it then shook his head i know i ought to know how to solve it but im cursed if i can remember right now he yawned enormously im so tired i cant even see thats how i am most nights you dont know how lucky you are that father decided to keep you in school it doesnt teach much not any more his brother answered im learning a lot more from father than from the masters youre missing the point leofsig said you could be out hauling rocks instead plenty your age are then youd be too tired to think too oh i understand that ealstan said what makes me sizzle is watching sidroc not even working at the watereddown pap the algarvians still let the schoolmasters teach if sidroc wants the masters to stripe his back thats his affair leofsig said if he wants to try to get through life on gab thats his affair too i dont know why youre wasting your time worrying about it because he goes off and does what he pleases and i have the masters work and fathers too thats why ealstan snapped then he paused and looked sheepish it could be worse couldnt it just a bit leofsig said dryly aye just a bit but he paused too it could be worse for me too now that i think on it this time ealstan did not miss the point even for a moment of course it could he said you could be a kaunian he lowered his voice at least you know so many people dont even want to or else say the blonds have it coming he looked around then spoke more softly still some of those people are right in this house aye i know that leofsig said if you ask me sidroc wishes he were an algarvian uncle hengist too though not so bad ealstan shook his head thats not itclose but not right sidroc just wants to be on top and the algarvians are if he wants to be on top leofsig broke off ealstan hadnt been through the army and didnt take crudity for granted leofsig shrugged you know him better than i doand youre welcome to him too as far as im concerned thanks his younger brother said in a way that wasnt thankful at all they both chuckled then ealstan grew serious once more id like to pop him right in the face for the way he rides me about the problems father sets me but i dont quite dare why not leofsig asked i think you can thump himand if you have trouble ill pitch in a set of lumpsll shut him up maybe i can maybe i cant but thats not it ealstan said and if i ever do mix it up with him i want you to stay out of it leofsig frowned im not following this what are big brothers for if theyre not for thumping people who give little brothers trouble ealstan licked his lips if you thump him hes liable to go to the redheads and remind them nobody ever let you out of that captives camp i dont know that he would but i dont know that he wouldnt either oh leofsig pondered that slowly he nodded when you lift up a rock you find all sorts of little white crawling things under it dont you that hed do such a thing to his own flesh and blood but he might curse it youre right he might he rubbed his chin his black beard was a mans now thick and coarse not soft fuzz like ealstans i dont want him having that kind of hold on me i dont want anyone having that kind of hold on me i dont know what we can do about it ealstan said ive frightened him once or twice already when he started blowing in that direction leofsig said if i put him in fear of his life he spoke altogether matteroffactly before going into king pendas levy hed been as mild as anyone would expect from a bookkeepers son now the only thing holding him back was doubt about how well the ploy would work he clicked his tongue between his teeth the stinking worm might just run straight to the algarvians i was thinking the same thing ealstan said i dont know what to do maybe sitting tight and waiting would be best its always worked pretty well for father aye so it has leofsig gnawed at the inside of his lower lip i dont like it though powers above cant make me like it either he pounded a fist down onto his thigh i wonder if uncle hengist would sell me too ealstan looked startled hes never said anything so what leofsig broke in sometimes the ones who dont blab beforehand are more dangerous than the ones who do in skrunda as in so many jelgavan towns ancient and modern lived side by side a couple of blocks beyond the market square stood an enormous marble arch from the later days of the kaunian empire celebrating the triumph of the emperor gedimainas over the algarvian tribe known as the belsiti below a relief of kilted barbarians being led away in chains gedimainas inscription declared to the world what a hero and conqueror he was talsu took the arch and its inscription as much for granted as he did the oilsellers shop next to it on the street hed walked under it a couple of times a week ever since hed got big enough to go so far from home he rarely bothered looking up at the relief or at the vaunting inscription below it he could barely make sense of the inscription anyhow he hadnt studied classical kaunian in school and jelgavan like valmieran had drifted a long way from the old language he headed toward the arch this particular morning because he was carrying four pairs of trousers his father traku had made for a customer who lived half a mile down the street the monument straddled a crowd had gathered under the arch some were jelgavans some algarvians in their broadbrimmed hats tight tunics kilts and knee stockings you cant do that one of the jelgavans exclaimed several oftalsus countrymen nodded somebody else said that arch has stood there for more than a thousand years knocking it down would be an outrage more jelgavans nodded why do they want to knock down the arch talsu asked somebody at the back of the little crowd its not doing anything to anybody he consciously noticed it for only the third or fourth time since coming home to skrunda after the jelgavan defeat the year before before the fellow could answer one of the algarvians did in jelgavan accented but clear we can destroy it and we will destroy it it is an insult to all the brave algarvians of ancient days and to the algarvic kingdoms of today to algarve to sibiu and even to lagoas that is misguided enough to be our foe from the middle of the crowd a woman called how is it an insult if it tells the truth algarvians went on to triumph the redheaded officer replied that proves all the vile things this kaunian tyrant said about our ancestors were false they have stood too long they shall stand no more he turned to a mage looking over the people in the crowd talsu saw that eggs had been affixed to the pillars upholding the arch all of a sudden he didnt want to stand right there the oil seller didnt like his shop standing right there either bursting out of it he cried you people are going to drop a million tons of rock right through my roof calm yourself the officer said a startling bit of advice from an excitable algarvians mouth buraldo there is very good at what he does very careful you should come through fine and if i dont the oil seller shouted the algarvian shrugged one of his kingdoms extravagant shrugs the oil seller shouted again wordlessly this time talsu shouldered his way through the crowd a couple of algarvian soldiers swung their sticks in his direction they were only alert though not dangerous hed seen the difference on the battlefield holding up the trousers he said before you do whatever youre going to do can i get by to deliver these aye go on the officer said and waved him through witli a laugh he was glad of the archs shade against the summer sun that was about as much attention as he usually paid it more jelgavans stood on the far side some of them also grumbling about what the redheads were on the point of doing to the monument he pushed his way past them and up the street how can you be so uncaring a woman with yellow hair like his demanded lady i dont want the redheads to knock it down either talsu answered but i cant do anything about it and neither can you if you have the time to stand around and moan fine me ive got work to do she stared at him by the cut and cloth of her clothes she had more money than he a tailors son he could make a good guess at how much anyone made by what he wore on his back these days her wealth only meant the algarvians could steal more from her than from traku and his family behind talsu the redheads started shouting back everyone back if you dont go back its your own cursed fault shame somebody shouted one by one the crowd of jelgavans took up the chant shame shame shame if the algarvians felt any sense of shame they didnt let it stop them from doing what they had orders to do talsu hadnt gone more than another few steps when a roar of bursting eggs made him want to dive for coveragain reflexes honed in the field an instant later chunks of masonry thundered down like an avalanche in the mountains he turned to see what the redheads had wrought wind from the falling marble rustled his hair the familiar square shape was gone a cloud of dust kept him from seeing any more than that when the dust settled the street would be as unfamiliar to the eye as his lower jaw might be to the tongue after losing a couple of teeth no one was shouting shame any more he wondered if the collapse of the arch had caught any jelgavans in it or for that matter any of the algarvian soldiers he shrugged hed find out on the way back delivering the trousers came first silver jingled in his pockets as he headed home by then the dust was gone and so was the arch the algarvians had been clever about dropping it the marble lay in the street but did not seem to have wrecked the houses and shops nearby talsu couldnt see the oilsellers place which lay on the far side of that great pile of rubble small boys had already started playing king of the mountain on top of it their game did not last long the algarvian officer who spoke jelgavan shouted get off he followed that with some choice colloquialisms that set the children giggling as they scampered down then to talsus dismay the officer and his soldiers none of whom seemed to be missing started pulling men off the street to get rid of the hill debris one of the troopers nabbed him before he could make himself scarce he called is this a paying job to the officer after a moment the algarvian nodded aye well make it so for the rest of the day talsu carried baskets of broken marble under the broiling summer sun he dumped them into freight cars on the leyline caravan that could get nearest the arch that meant going halfway across town people hadnt known about ley lines in the days of the kaunian empire and so hadnt set their big buildings near them the algarvians didnt stop him when he went into a tavern to buy a mug of ale but one came in after him to make sure he didnt linger or slip out the back door he muttered curses under his breath hed had something like that in mind as evening twilight fell he lined up to get his pay he was worn and battered bruises covered his legs he walked with a limp because a stone had done its best to smash his right foot he had a couple of mashed fingernails too and half a dozen cuts and scrapes on his hands by the powers above we earned whatever they give us he said when he got to the head of the line and held out an abused hand the algarvian officer slapped a couple of shiny new coppers into it they bore the sharpnosed image of king mainardo king mezentios brother and now by grace of algarve lord of jelgava talsu looked from them to the redhead go on the officer snapped go on and count yourself lucky youre getting anything talsu stared at the coppers they might have paid for an hours labor most of a days he shoved them back at the officer keep em pal he said looks like you need em worse than i do do you know what i could do to you the algarvian demanded it might last longer than what you just did but it couldnt hurt much more talsu answered with a shrug you had a chance to make people like youlike you better than our own nobles anyway this isnt how you go about it like us what difference does that make the redheaded officer asked in surprise all that matters isthat you obey us he offered talsu the coins once more take them you earned them i earned six times that much talsu said and walked away he waited for the algarvian to order him seized it didnt happen he scurried around the first corner he came to trembling from fatigue and reaction both hed been a fool to talk back to the occupiers hed got away with it but that made him no less a fool where have you been laitsina his mother cried when he came into the shop above which the family lived and slept then she got a good look at him and cried out again this time in horror and what were you doing while you were there have the algarvians beaten you with sticks no they just caught me in the street and set me hauling broken rockone of their sorcerers wrecked the old arch past the market square talsu scowled hard work and then they cheated me at the end of it about what youd expect from the cursed redheads i didnt even bother taking their lousy coppers he didnt bother telling his mother how hed rejected the coins either his father slammed a pair of shears down on the counter beside which he was working they wrecked the imperial arch traku said at talsus nod the older man muttered something pungent under his breath that must have been the crash we heard this morning laitsina said i wondered what it was if business were better somebody who knew about it would have come in before this and told us if the algarvians werent here business would be better traku said by the look he sent his son he still blamed talsu for the collapse of the jelgavan armies and if the algarvians werent here they wouldnt have been able to knock down the arch either curse them its stood since imperial times theyve got no business wrecking things that have stood for so long they won the war talsu said at the moment he regretted that more than he had at any time since hed marched off to oppose the redheads that lets them do as they please and theyre turning out to be a worse bargain than our own nobles who would have thought anyone could be laitsina and traku both glanced around nervously though they were the only ones who could have heard what talsu said his sister chose that moment to come downstairs who would have thought anyone could be worse than what ausra asked worse than our nobles talsu answered defiantly the algarvians are he repeated the story of what theyd done to him and to the monument thats terrible ausra said are they doing the same thing all over the kingdom if they are there wont be an arch or a column standing before long theyre jealous of us thats what it is traku said we kaunians were civilized while they still chased each other through the woods they dont want to be reminded of that and they dont want us reminded of it either some people may think more about things that are missing than they ever did about things that were there talsu looked down at his battered filthy bloody hands i know i will garivald didnt know why the impressers hadnt marched him out of zossen as part of the draft they took for king swemmels army maybe theyd intended to scoop him and the other men they left behind into their net later if so they miscalculated for the algarvians overran the village before they could return waddo kept reporting good news coming in over the crystal swemmels forces advancing the algarvians and yaninans and zuwayzin falling back in disorder the firstman even brought the crystal out into the village square several more times so the peasants of zossen could hear the news for themselves he hadnt misrepresented it it always sounded good but then one day dragons painted in green and white and red flew by to the north of the village they dropped no eggs they did no harm but they were there they spread fear and worse they spread doubt as well if were kicking the algarvians tails how did those ugly flying things get here dagulf asked garivald as they were weeding in the fields outside of zossen after looking around to make sure no one but his friend could hear him garivald answered if you expect the crystal to tell you the truth all the time you probably think waddo tells you the truth all the time too both men laughed each warily after a moment garivald added i wish the king would speak to us again he pulled no punches i liked that aye dagulf nodded some of these city men with their fancy accents who lie straightfaced though he spat into the rich black soil less than a week later soldiers in rockgray tunics started falling back through zossen some of them had fancy city accents some used the almost forthwegian dialect of the northwest and others talked like garivald and his fellow villagers however they spoke they all told tales much different from those the villagers heard on the crystal aye herborn is fallen one of them said to garivald as he gulped water and gnawed on a chunk of black bread annore had given him he was skinny and filthy and looked wearier than a peasant near the end of harvest time powers above only know how many men the redheads cut off west of there too all i can tell you is im cursed lucky i wasnt one of them the crystal said we were still fighting hard there garivald said losing herborn the capital of grelz in the days when grelz was a kingdom and not a subordinate duchy of unkerlant was like taking a knife in the chest he didnt want to believe it but the soldier said bugger the crystal if we still held herborn if the cursed algarvians hadnt nipped in behind us like a crayfish nipping with its pincers you suppose id be here now he stuffed what was left of the bread into his pack drained the mug of water wiped his dirty face on his equally dirty sleeve and trudged off toward the west other unkerlanter troopers retreated through the fields careless of the crops they were trampling a couple of peasants ran out into the fields to try to preserve those crops one of them the soldiers simply ignored the other a cousin of waddos might have thought his connection to the firstman gave him special authority the soldiers thought otherwise when he annoyed themwhich didnt take longthey knocked him down and beat him he got up again sooner than they wanted they knocked him down again and beat him some more he lay there for quite a while then before rising and limping back to the village they told me theyd blaze me if i said one more word he exclaimed in disbelieving tones after getting a good look at his bruised face garivald murmured to dagulf you ask me hed already said too much by then his friend nodded later that afternoon a company came up the road from the east they were retreating too but in good order they paid for it garivald had seen algarvian dragons flying by now he saw them in action and wished he hadnt they dropped eggs on the unkerlanter soldiers then swooped low to flame those the bursts of sorcerous energy hadnt slain shrieks rose so did the stench of burnt meat a stray egg burst on one of the houses at the edge of the village nothing much was left of it nor of the woman and three children whod been inside waddo stared at the carnage the space of a few minutes had seen we ought to bury the poor brave fellows he said pointing out toward the slaughtered soldiers what if theyd been in the village instead of just outside when the dragons came garivald asked whod bury us then waddo turned that horrified stare on him then limped off without answering about noon the next day four horsedrawn eggtossers set up near the edge of the woods outside zossen and started flinging death at the algarvians farther east for a little while their solid presence cheered garivald then he realized the enemy had drawn within eggtosser range of the village and then the algarvians started tossing eggs back at that detachment earth leapt skyward from the fields now garivald watched in a different sort of horror those were the crops on which zossen would get through the winterif it got through the winter an older man a fellow whod fought in the six years war shouted at him and the other gawkers get down you cursed fools a burst close byu pick you up and smash you flat against the closest wall that doesnt fall over he lay on his bellyhe believed what he was saying garivald did too he got down flat he wished he could dig a hole that was what soldiers did when an egg burst behind him it rolled him over and battered him with its force others who hadnt listened to the veteran were down and screamingexcept for one woman who lay with her head twisted at an unnatural angle and would never get up again before long the unkerlanter eggtossers fell silent beaten into submission by the redheads a couple of men from their crews ran off into the woods garivald had a hard time blaming them when all their comrades were slain or wounded more and more soldiers in rockgray tunics streamed through and past zossen by then the villagers had nothing left to give them but water from the wells the next morning an officer declared this is a good enough place for a stand well make the redheads pay high for it by the powers above you peasants head off to the west if youre lucky youll get away but my lord waddo quavered that will mean the end of the village the officer pointed his stick at the firstmans face argue with me wretch and itll mean the end of you he started giving orders that would have turned zossen into the best fortress he could make of it before hed got far though his crystallomancer cried sir the redheads have broken through south of the woods if we try to hold in the front theyll take us in flank curse them the officer snarled that stretch of line should have held he ground his teeth garivald clearly heard the sound the officers shoulders sagged whoever was commanding down there ought to have his neck stretched but no help for it weve got to fall back again his men had already begun trickling off toward the west theyd been through this before garivald wondered if theyd been through anything else firstman the officer shouted waddo hobbled toward him looking apprehensive the officers lip curled oh you listen to me if youve got a crystal in this miserable place bury it deep you wont like what happens to you if the algarvians find it without waiting for an answer he tramped off he had more fight in him but garivald wasnt sure whether hed sooner take on king mezentios men or his own side garivald waddo called aye garivald answered all too sure he knew what was coming next with his bad leg waddo couldnt dig and the firstman did not surprise him fetch a spade and come with me waddo said wed better get the crystal out of sight i dont think we have much time wishing waddo had picked someone else garivald shouldered a shovel the firstman went into his housewhich eggs had left untouchedand came out with the crystal garivald followed him to a yarddeep hole in the middle of a vegetable plot where an egg had burst bury it at the bottom of that the firstman said pointing with the ground already torn some more digging wont show fair enough garivald got into the hole and went to work he might not like waddo but the firstman wasnt stupid garivald kept looking over his shoulder as he dug some people in zossen liked waddo even less than he did if they told the algarvians what the firstman had done the redheads would do something to waddo while they were about it they were liable to do something to garivald too thinking thus garivald hid the crystal covered it over and scrambled out of the burst hole as soon as he could he hurried to put away the spade hed just come out of his hut again when the first algarvian behemoth trotted into the village he stopped in the doorway and stared he couldnt help himself hed never seen a behemoth before not in the flesh the size and power of the beast astonished him the iron sheathing its great horn and the heavy mail that protected it were rusty and had seen hard use the mail jingled at every stride the behemoth took the animal had a strong odor something like a horses something like a goats the behemoth bore on its back a heavy stick and four algarviansthe first algarvians garivald had seen in the flesh too two more behemoths followed close behind they escorted a couple of squads of kilted footsoldiers the algarvians ran taller and leaner than garivalds countrymen to him it gave them the aspect of coursing wolves one of the men atop the lead behemoth shouted in what he thought was garivalds language unkerlanti soldieri not here three peasants said it at the same time two of them pointed west to show where king swemmels men had gone laughing and nodding the algarvian translated for his comrades they grinned too theyre stupid not to figure it out for themselves garivald thought but the redheads werent so stupid as to take anything on trust the footsoldiers fanned out through the village in pairs searching every houseand seizing the chance to feel up any woman they found pretty several indignant squawks rose but the algarvians did nothing worse than let their hands roam free once theyd satisfied themselves no aiabushers lurked nearby they relaxed and seemed friendly enoughfor invaders before long an unmistakable algarvian officer strode into zossen he owned even more arrogance than had marked his unkerlanter counterpart not long before he also owned a real command of the unkerlanter language barking where is the firstman for this stinking miserable pustule of a village leaning on his cane waddo limped forward here i am lord he quavered with a curse the algarvian pushed him over and kicked him youre not swemmels dog anymore have you got that youre king mezentios dog now and if you try any funny business youll be a dead dog have you got that he kicked waddo again aye lord the firstman gasped mercy lord out of the side of his mouth garivald whispered to annore so its going to be like that is it his wifes hand stole into his they squeezed each other hard four from the air the battle below had for sabrino the perfect clarity granted to footsoldiers only on maps after the fact he watched with some anxiety the development of the unkerlanter counterattack toward sommerda a city from which king mezentios men had driven the enemy a couple of days before the unkerlanters lost fight after fight but seemed too stupid to understand they were losing the war they kept hurling new soldiers into the fray and striking back as best they might nor could sabrino blithely hurl his wing of dragonfliers at the men in rockgray on the ground as he had in the first days of king mezentios assault on unkerlant dragons painted an unromantic rockgray were in the air too their fliers intent on doing to algarvian soldiers what sabrino and his comrades had done to the unkerlanters since the war was new those boring gray paint jobs made unkerlanter dragons cursed hard to spot especially against cloudy skies or smoke coming from the ground a squadron had got below sabrinos wing before some sharpeyed algarvian flier spied them and spoke into his crystal alerting the whole wing theyll pay for that sabrino whooped domiziano your squadron and yours too orosio the rest of you stay on top to make sure they dont try to bring any more of their little friends down on us he urged his dragon into a dive he was wing commander but he was also a fighting man the dragon screamed in anger at being ordered about but then screamed in fury at sighting the unkerlanter dragons its great muscles surged beneath sabrino almost like an ardent lovers its wings beat hard unkerlanters whether on the ground or in the air carried far fewer crystals than did the algarvians if any of their fliers spotted algarvians dragons dropping out of the sky on them he could do little to alert his fellows it might not have mattered much anyhow the unkerlanters were outnumbered close to two to one sabrino flew out of the westering sun down onto the tail of an unkerlanter dragon he didnt bother raising his stick but let his own beast have the pleasure of flaming the foe from the sky the unkerlanter flier had no notion of aught amiss till fire washed over him he and his dragon tumbled toward the ground more rockgray dragons plummeted too so did a couple of sabrinos men and their mounts he cursed when that happened he cursed again when a few of the unkerlanters managed to escape his trap flying off toward the west with the last desperate energy their dragons had in them pursuit sir captain domiziano asked his image tiny in the crystal regretfully sabrino shook his head no we did what we came down here to do we held them off our men on the ground and nights almost on us wed better head back toward the farm well want our beasts fresh come morning because the powers above know well be flying again aye sir domiziano seemed regretful too but obedient sabrino approved of the combination he wanted aggressive subordinates but not so aggressive as to set their will above his he led the wing back to the latest temporary dragon farm which lay at the edge of a goodsized estate a little east of sommerda the manor at the heart of the estate hadnt suffered the algarvians had taken it by surprise overrunning the area before king swemmeps men could decide to use it for a strongpoint theyd fought hard in sommerda itself spiraling down toward the farm sabrino could see how his own countrymen had had to level half the town before finally clearing it of the stubborn unkerlanter defenders on the ground he was glad to let the handlers tend to his dragon the beast liked them better than him anyhow he worked it hard while they gave it the meat and brimstone and quicksilver it craved it liked no one very much though sabrino knew dragons too well to have any doubts on that score he ate hastily roasted mutton himself along with hard bread olives and a nasty white wine the cooks who ran the field kitchen should never have bothered stealing too sweet and too sour at the same time he said staring at his cup in dismay tastes like a diabetics piss if you say so sir captain domiziano said innocently myself i wouldnt know sabrino made as if to throw the mug at him he almost did it for real it wouldnt have been a waste of the wine but he was laughing even as he reared back and so were the officers who ate with him hello captain orosio pointed toward the manor house looks like the old boy in there has finally decided to come out and see what were up to sure enough an elderly unkerlanter approached the dragonfliers sabrino had ordered the manor house and whoever lived in it left alone except for taking what he needed from the flocks to keep men and dragons fed until now the unkerlanter noblefor such sabrino assumed him to behad also ignored the algarvians he was straight and spry and for an unkerlanter tall he wore a bushy white mustache a style outmoded in his cleanshaven kingdom since the middle of the century the days before the six years war and he proved to speak excellent algarvian saying i never expected to see your folk come so far into my land sabrino got to his feet and bowed here we are sir nonetheless i have the honor to be the count sabrino very much at your service he bowed again a small bitter smile crossed the unkerlanters face as he returned the second bow in my younger days i had some considerable experience with algarvians he said i see the breed has changed little during my retirement and you are sir sabrino asked politely i doubt my name would mean anything to you young fellow the unkerlanter replied though sabrino was not so young as all that i am called chlodvald not only sabrino but some of his officers exclaimed at that powers above the wing commander said if you are that chlodvald your excellencyand he had no doubt the old man wasyou were the best general your kingdom had during the six years war you compliment me too highly i had good fortune chlodvald said with a shrug in his place an algarvian would have preened and boasted will you give us the privilege of dining with us sabrino asked several of the junior officers added eager agreement chlodvald raised an eyebrow generous of you to offer to share with me what is mine sir it is war sabrino said stiffly did you never feast from the fruits of victory there you have me the retired general admitted and sat down among the dragonfliers his kingdoms enemies fell over one another to give him food and drink when he tasted the wine that eyebrow rose again this did not come from my cellars your excellency with all my heart i should hope not sabrino said after chlodvald had eaten and drunk the wing commander asked him how is it that you live quietly here sir and are not engaged in helping unkerlant against us oh i have lived quietly here a good many years and i did not expect king swemmel to call me into his service even when war broke out anew chlodvald replied you may not recall but i fought for kyot in the twinkings war ah sabrino whispered captain orosio blurted what was in sabrinos mind then how come youre not dead chlodvald smiled that bitter smile again king swemmel didnt spare many id known both the young princes well back in cottbus of course before their father died and they went at each other maybe that had something to do with it i dont know he slew others he knew as well as me but he said he was letting me live because of my earlier service to unkerlant which partly excused my madness anyone who opposed him was and is in his mind mad what is in himself he sees in others sabrino said chlodvald did not disagree captain domiziano said algarve is the broom that will sweep him away king mezentio will arrange this kingdom as it should be for the third time the strange smile appeared on chlodvald s face if only you had come twenty years ago we should have welcomed you with open arms but now its too late we were just getting back on our feet after the six years war and the twinkings war and now you come and throw us back so we shall have to start all over again now we are fighting for unkerlant and in that cause we are all united sabrino eyed his officers they all looked amused as he felt amused politely inclining his head to chlodvald he said your excellency unkerlant may be united but we would not be here by sommerda were that doing king swemmel any enormous amount of good perhaps not the retiredforcibly retiredunkerlanter general replied but then again while you are winning you have not yet won tell me has the fight been easy for you sabrino started to nod in some ways the fight had been very easy the unkerlanters werent skilled either in the air or on the ground they blundered into traps that would have fooled no valmieran or jelgavan officer sometimes though they battered their way out of those traps too as the valmierans or jelgavans would not have even tried to do they fought hard all the time if they were doomed to defeat they did not admit it even to themselves you have not answered me count sabrino chlodvald said easy enough sabrino said and tossed an egg of his own how is it that all of unkerlants neighbors have joined against her that speaks volumes about how well king swemmel is loved throughout derlavai all of algarves neighbors joined against her too chlodvald observed and what does that say about king mezentio yanina marches with us captain domiziano blurted chlodvald raised his snowy eyebrow and said not another word after a moment domiziano turned red sabrino had all he could do not to laugh at his squadron leader he still wasnt sure having the yaninans as allies helped algarve more than it helped unkerlant chlodvald got to his feet rather stiffly he nodded to sabrino you algarvians were a polished lot when you fought us in the six years war i see that has not changed but i will take the liberty of telling you one thing more before i leave you unkerlant is a kingdomunkerlant is a landthat rubs the polish from invaders no less than from its own folk good night he turned away good night sabrino called after him we may not meet again before long we shall be advancing once more chlodvald did not reply sabrino wondered if the old man heard he watched chlodvald walk through deepening twilight back toward the manor house and go inside no lamps showed at the windows the unkerlanter general was too courteous to try to betray his foes in such a way even so unkerlanter dragons came over that night dropping eggs all around the algarvian dragon farm they killed only a couple of dragons and no fliers but their stubbornness made sabrino thoughtful lalla stamped her foot the angry gesture set her bare breasts bouncing prettily but i already ordered that emerald necklace she said what do you mean i cant have it the jeweler will deliver it soon no he wont hajjaj said wearily as for you cant my dear dont you speak zuwayzi i told you before you went and ordered it that you might not have it for it cost too much if you ignore my instructions you must expect me to ignore your desires i have had too many of these scenes with you his third wife set her hands on her hips old man you have been ignoring my desires since our wedding night you might expect me to minister to the pleasure of your body but you will not even let me adorn mine please she went from vicious to cajoling in the space of a couple of sentences hajjaj eyed her body it was well worth adorning broadhipped waspwaisted fullbreasted hed wed her in the hope of sensual pleasure and hed had more than a little from her but hed also had more than a littletoo much more than a littleaggravation from her because she pleased him in the bedchamber shed grown convinced he was assotted of her and would grant her every wish no matter how extravagant anyone who had such ideas about the zuwayzi foreign minister knew him less well than she imagined with a sigh he said i am an old man whether you grasp it or not however i am not necessarily a fool if i were a fool i would let you buy that necklace even after i told you not to do it instead i shall send you back to the head of your clan you may see how well you cajole him lalla stared realizing too late that shed gone too far have mercy my lord my husband she cried and threw herself down on her knees before him beseeching and inviting him at the same time have mercy i beg i have shown you too much mercyand too much cash hajjaj replied i shall pay out your divorcees allowance till you remarryif you do if you want more than that you may either earn it or pry it loose from your clan chief since custom and law forbid him from touching you you will have fewer inducements than you did with me you wicked old scorpion lalla cried i curse you i curse the powers above for setting me in your hands i she scrambled to her feet snatched a vase from a wall niche and threw it at hajjaj rage made her aim poor he didnt even have to duck the vase shattered against the wall behind him the crash brought servants running to see what had happened do escort her away hajjaj said and make everything ready to return her to the house of her clan head aye lord the servants said by the way they smiled theyd hoped for that order for some time lalla saw as much too she cursed them and then kicked one of them they escorted her away much less gently than they might have otherwise tewfik made his slow way into the chamber he bowed as well as age and decrepitude allowed then said my lord marquis balastro of algarve awaits without he craves audience with you by all means tewfik let him in hajjaj s joints clicked as he stretched he knocked one of the pillows on the floor aside with his foot i suppose you have a kilt and tunic waiting for me somewhere gauzy ones i hope the longtime family retainer coughed mufflings will not be necessary today sir the count having chosen to affect the habiliments of zuwayza hatan algarvian hat but the brim is wide enoughsandals and only himself between and hes waiting outside you said powers above hell bake hes lightskinned and not hardened against the sun hajjaj hurried toward the entranceway he was not so nimble as he once had been but still easily outdistanced tewfik from behind him the majordomo called a suggestion my lord as usual tewfiks suggestions had the force of commands and that is hajjaj asked over his shoulder until the wench lalla returns to her clan heads house she ought not to be alone lest valuables of this house go thither with her tewfik told him till that moment lalla had been junior wife in tewfiks mouth and used as respectfully as either of the wives senior to her hajjaj wondered whether the majordomo was finally expressing his own opinion or echoing what he presumed to be his masters then he wondered if tewfik saw any difference between those two either way he gave good advice aye see to it hajjaj said as you say tewfik replied though hed done the saying i presume you will entertain the algarvian minister in the library he did not bother waiting for an answer to that but continued i shall have tea and cakes and wine sent there directly i thank you hajjaj said still over his shoulder almost to the entranceway he paused algarvian vintages for the minister not date wine of course tewfik sounded offended that his master should judge he needed reminding hajjaj threw open the strongbarred doorlike many clan centers his home could double as a fortress sure enough there stood balastro bare and pale and sweating in the sun with a jaunty gesture he swept off his hat and bowed i am pleased to see you your excellency he said i am pleased to see you at least had the sense to travel here in a closed and covered coach hajjaj said come inside before my cooks decide youre done and put you on a serving platter you follow my customs when you call on me at the ministry balastro said he did sigh with relief when he stepped into the shade the thick mudbrick walls fought the heat as well as anything could i thought it the least i could do to follow yours while visiting you aye youve been known to do it before hajjaj agreed you are the only diplomat who ever doesalgarvian panache i daresay but truly your excellency you are not equipped with a hide of the proper color and yours will turn several improper colors if you stay out too long he could not quite take balastros nudity for granted as he did nudity among his own people not only was balastro the wrong color as hajjaj had said but he also displayed the distinctive algarvian mutilation hajjajs eyes kept coming back to it it made the redhead look deformed to cover his queasy fascination the zuwayzi foreign minister added all your hide ah balastro took the point cant have him sunburned can we hes got better things to do he followed zuwayzi custom in the library talking about books with hajjaj instead of coming straight to his real business he did not read zuwayzi but was as apt to choose a classical kaunian title as one written in algarvian he seemed to have as much regard for kaunians of imperial day as his kingdom had little for modern ones that puzzled hajjaj who longed to ask him about it but could not it was too serious to discuss before the rituals of hospitality were completed no sooner had balastro sunk to the cushions tjian serving wenches brought in die inevitable refreshments as part of his perfect care for his masters guest tewfik had chosen a couple of the prettiest women to wait upon balastro and hajjaj they eyed the algarvian minister with no small curiosity and looked to be fighting giggles perhaps because of his race perhaps because of the ritual of manhood hed endured he eyed them too with interest that soon became visible that made them giggle more after theyd left the room he asked hajjaj powers above your excellency how do you keep from ah rising to die occasion whenever you see a comely wrench i am old hajjaj answered remembering lallas taunt balastro sipped wine not so old as that and you know it cursed well hajjaj inclined his head the algarvian was right if you see something often enough it loses its power to excite i suppose thats so balastro said seems a pity though he nibbled at a cake these are the nuts called cashews arent they tastier than walnuts and almonds i think generous of you to say so hajjaj replied not many of your countrymen would agree i think you are right but i grew up with cashews he chuckled of course i grew up with date wine too but i know better than to serve you that balastros fastidious shudder could have played on the stage for which mercy your excellency i thank you presently with tea and wine drunk and cakes diminished with books and nudity talked dry hajjaj could with propriety inquire and what brings you up into the hills today sir past the desire for good wine and good company you mean balastro asked and hajjaj nodded the algarvian minister answered i was hoping we might get more aid from you uwayzin for the assault on glogau than weve had thus far hajjaj frowned and you come to me for this surely it is a matter for your military attache to work out with his majestys officers down in bishah now balastro looked annoyed a genuine expression rather than the playacting hed used before i pray you for both our sakes your excellency do not be disingenuous with me you must know that your officers have dissembled and delayed and done their best to keep from answering aye or nay this reluctance must spring from the king or from the foreign ministry from you in other words in either case if you think i lead king shazli around by the nose i must tell you that you are very much mistaken hajjaj said aye you must tell it to me for your honors sake and your sovereigns but must i believe it the algarvian minister to zuwayza returned a toss with a good deal of justice in it let us heremerely for the sake of argument if you likeimagine that you are the author of your kingdoms treatings with its neighbors for the sake of argument as you say hajjaj steepled his fingers and fought against a smile he liked balastro which made the fight harder i might say in that case that zuwayza by now has avenged herself in full against unkerlantin full and more glogau has never been ours few if any zuwayzin dwell there or ever have zuwayza is our ally and needs must aid our cause balastro said hajjaj shook his head no your excellency zuwayza is your cobelligerent we war against unkerlant for our own reasons not yours and since this discussion is hypothetical i might add that the vengeance you are wreaking on your neighbors leaves me somewhat relieved not to be one we have been foes to the cursed kaunians for time out of mind balastro said with a shrug now that we have the whip hand we shall use it tell me you love the unkerlanters go aheadi need a good laugh today we have been known to live at peace with them hajjaj said even as you algarvians have been known to live at peace with the kaunians peace on their terms balastro had no bend in him and was hajjaj knew forgetting long stretches of his homelands history now it is peace on our terms that is what victory earned us we are the valiant we are the strong then surely your excellency you will not need much in the way of help from zuwayza in reducing glogau will you hajjaj asked innocently balastro gave him a sour look got to his feet and departed with much less ceremony than was customary hajjaj stood in the doorway and watched his carriage start back toward the algarvian ministry back in bishah as soon as it rounded a cornerbut not an instant beforethe zuwayzi foreign minister let himself smile istvan eyed the pass ahead with something less than delight therell be unkerlanters up yonder he said with as much gloomy certainty as a man eyeing dark clouds billowing up from the horizon might use in saying theres a storm on the way aye no doubt that was szonyi and well have to pay the bill for digging them out too there wont be very many of them kun of all people was looking on the bright side of things there wont need to be very many of them istvan waved a hand at the steepsided jumble of rocks to right and left this is the only way forward as long as they hold it we arent going anywhere szonyi nodded looking no more happy than istvan felt aye the sergeants right kun ever since the unkerlanters decided they were going to fight after all this is the game theyve played they arent trying to stop us theyre trying to slow us down to give us as little as they can till winter comes and winter in this country wont be any fun at all istvan eyed the sun it still stood high in the northern sky at noon but a tiny bit lower each day winter was coming as inexorably as sand ran through the neck of a glass and down into the bottom half trouble was coming too from the strong position theyd set up for themselves in that pass the unkerlanters started tossing eggs at the advancing gyongyosians their aim wasnt particularly good many of the eggs instead of bursting on the paths istvan and his countrymen were using smote the mountainsides above them before long istvan discovered the unkerlanters knew what they were doing after all one of those bursts touched off an avalanche that swept several soldiers and several donkeys off a path and down to their doom whoresons istvan shook his fist toward the east thats a cowards way to fight they have no honor kanizsai said they do nothing but toss eggs and blaze at us from ambush thats because there arent very many of them here kun said as if explaining things to an idiot child they cant afford a big standup fight with us because theyre in the middle of a big standup fight with algarve no honor the young recruit repeated whether they do or whether they dont we still have to shift the goatbuggers istvan said as if to underscore his words an egg burst close by hurling a big chunk of stone past his head kun asked a question istvan wished he would have kept to himself how since the whole squad was looking at him istvan had to answer since he didnt know he said thats for the officers to figure out aye but its for us to do szonyi said we do the work and we do the bleeding too we are warriors said kanizsai who not yet having been in any big fights didnt realize how quickly most of them could become dead warriors if they rushed a strong position manned by stubborn troops the officers set over them did seem to realize that for which istvan blessed the stars instead of the headlong rush hed dreaded the commanders in charge of the advance into unkerlant sent dragons against the enemies blocking the pass ahead eggs fell from under the bellies of the great beasts having endured more rains of eggs on obuda than he cared to remember istvan knew a sort of abstract sympathy for the unkerlanters there to the east szonyi had endured attack from the air too if he knew any sympathy for the unkerlanters he concealed it very well ball the whoresons he said over and over again smash em up squash em flat dont leave enough of any one ofem to make a decent ghost kun cleared his throat the notion that a ghost resembles a body at the moment of its death is only a peasant superstition and how many ghosts have you seen with your beady little eyes there master spectacles szonyi demanded stuff a cap in it both of you istvan said rolling his eyes were supposed to be fighting the unkerlanters not each other and the unkerlanters to his dismay kept fighting back they must not have saved all their heavy sticks for the fight against algarve they blazed a pair of gyongyosian dragons out of the air as the beasts stooped low to drop their eggs precisely where their fliers wanted them to go the rest of the men flying the brightly painted dragons urged them higher into the sky stars guide the souls of those two szonyi murmured and glanced over to kun as if expecting the mages apprentice to argue with him kun simply nodded at which szonyi relaxed eggs did keep falling on the unkerlanter strongpoint if not with the accuracy the gyongyosians could have got by going lower but eggs also kept falling on the footsoldiers waiting to assault the strongpoint for the dragonfliers had not been able to wreck all the unkerlanter eggtossers a whistle shrilled forward shouted captain tivadar the company commander he went forward himself without hesitation a commander who was not afraid to face the foe brought his men with him forward istvan called and trotted after the captain he did not look back over his shoulder to see if his men followed he assumed they would if they didnt their countrymen would do worse to them for cowardice than the unkerlanters would for courage here at least he could see the position he was attacking back on obuda hed often blundered through the forest without the faintest notion of where the kuusamans were till he or his comrades stumbled over them the disadvantage here was that the unkerlanters knew where he was too he used what bushes and boulders he could for cover but felt as if he were under the eyes of king swemmels men at every stride still under assault from the air the unkerlanters were slower than they might have been to shorten the range on their eggtossers that made life easier for istvan and his companions for a little while but then flashes of light began winking from behind the piledup stones at the mouth of the pass as the unkerlanters brought their sticks into play istvan blazed back at them by squads captain tivadar shouted blaze and move make them keep their heads down while we advance on them he wasnt the only officer shouting similar orders the gyongyosian soldiers whod seen war before either in the mountains against unkerlant or on the islands of the bothnian ocean obeyed more readily than the new recruits running past a corpse with tawny yellow hair istvan shook his head living through a couple of fights improved your odds of living through more than a couple a moment later he shook his head again if you didnt live through your first couple of fights you were unlikely to live through any after that swemmel the unkerlanter soldiers shouted swemmel they shouted other things than their kings name too but istvan couldnt understand those to his ears the unkerlanter language sounded like a man in the last stages of choking to death a beam hissed past his head so close that he could feel the heat and smell the sharp lightning reek it left behind in the air he threw himself flat and scrambled toward the closest rock he could find he peered out from behind it in their gray tunics the very color of the mountainside the unkerlanters were cursed hard to see when he did spot one he took careful aim before blazing and then whooped as the fellow slumped bonelessly stick falling from his fingers good blazing sergeant tivadar called and istvan puffed out his chest nothing like doing well when a superior was watching then he had no more time to dwell on such trivia for he and his comrades were in among the unkerlanters forcing the enemy back more by weight of numbers than by skill at arms some of king swemmels soldiers seemed glad to flee running east down the valley toward the distant land where most of them were born others though iield their ground as stubbornly as if they too sprang from a warrior race and indeed it was not through want of courage that some of the defenders finally did give way but only through being overwhelmed by the swarming gyongyosians by the stars istvan said shaking his head in wonder as he finally made his way toward the end of the unkerlanters defensive works if this were great army against great army and not a regiment of ours thrown at a couple of companies of theirs gyongyos and unkerlant would both run out of men aye that was kun who limped along after him having taken a light wound from a stick the mages apprentice still had his spectacles on whether through some protective magic of his or thanks to an outandout miracle istvan couldnt have said kun pointed ahead one more little fortress of theirs up there and then we can go on so we can istvan said and then a few miles farther east theyll choose another pass we have to go through and theyll entrench themselves there at five miles a day how many years are we from cottbus kun wore a faraway expression as he calculated three he said or rather a bit more istvan who had only sketchy schooling did not know if he was right or wrong he did know the prospect struck him as gloomy and he also rapidly realized that the unkerlanters in the little fortress ahead had no intention of letting his comrades go any miles farther that day they blazed away at the gyongyosians with such ferocity across such level ground that to approach or to try to go around their strongpoint was an appointment with death only after gyongyosian dragons returned and dropped great swarms of eggs on the fortress did the blazing from it ease enough to let the footsoldiers mount an assault even then unkerlanter survivors kept fighting in the wreckage until at last almost all of them were slain only a couple of darkhaired men came out of the works with their hands held high and when istvan went into the battered fortress he discovered something that set him shouting for captain tivadar after a while the company commander picked his way through the wreckage and stood beside his sergeant well he said at last now we know why they were able to blaze so well for so long aye sir istvan said so we do ten unkerlanters lay side by side each of them with his throat cut the gyongyosians had not done that the unkerlanters own countrymen had do you suppose they volunteered or did their officers draw straws or would they just pick the men they liked least i dont know tivadar answered maybe the captives will be able to tell us he gulped looking for something more to say at last he managed it was bravely done though seenone of them has his hands tied they gave themselves up so their comrades would have plenty of sorcerous energy in their sticks to keep blazing at us so they did istvan looked down at the neat if bloody row of corpses he gave them the best tribute he could they died like warriors he wondered how many gyongyosians would have yielded themselves up for their fellows sake like that then he wondered what the unkerlanters would do at the next position they chose to defend with all their strength and then he wondered if hed be lucky enough to see the unkerlanter stronghold after that seen from setubal the derlavaian war had a curious feel almost as if it were happening in a distant room the strait of valmiera protected lagoas from invasion so did algarves enormous fight with unkerlant thus embroiled king mezentios men could not afford to do much against the lagoans occasional dragons dropped eggs on setubal and the other towns of the northern coast occasional warships tried to sneak in and raid the shoreline rather more lagoan dragons flew against the algarvianheld ports of southern valmiera other than that they fear us a secondrank mage named xavega said to fernao as the two of them sat drinking fortified wine in a dining room of the grand hall of the lagoan guild of mages fernao bowed in his seat an almost algarvian courtesy i thank you milady he said you have proved without leaving the tiniest particle of room for doubt that being a woman does not keep one from being a fool xavega glared at him she was in her early thirties a few years younger than he and had a fierce scowl somehow made fiercer by her being quite goodlooking if algarve did not fear us she said mezentio would have tried settling accounts with us before turning his eye westward youve never traveled outside lagoas have you fernao asked as if that should make a difference xavega tossed her head her mane of auburn hair flipped back over her shoulders ah but it does fernao said you may not believe me but it does people whove never left lagoas have no sense of of proportioni think thats the word i want its true of anyone who hasnt traveled but more so with us because our kingdom is only the smaller part of an island but we naturally think its the center of the world by xavegas expression no other thought had crossed her mind and by her expression she wasnt interested in having other thoughts cross her mind the thought of bedding her later in the evening had crossed fernaos mind he suspected hed just dropped an egg on his chances she said setubal contains the world what need to go farther that held some truthsome but not enough proportion fernao repeated for one thing mezentio couldnt very well jump on us when swemmel was ready to jump on him from the west for another if he did jump us hed bring kuusamo into the war against him and he cant afford that kuusamo xavega waved her hand as lagoans had a way of doing when they thought of their neighbors on the island kuusamo outweighs us two or three to one fernao said an unpleasant truth his countrymen preferred to forget the seven princes look east and north for gain more than they do toward us or toward the mainlandeasier pickings in those directionsbut they dont have to theyre kuusamans xavega said with a sneer as if that explained everything for her evidently it did pointing to fernao she went on just because you have their eyes you dont need to take their part fernao got to his feet and bowed stiffly milady i think you would find yourself more at home in mezentios kingdom than in your own i give you good evening he stalked out of the dining room proud he hadnt flung the last of his wine in xavegas face by her looks she might have been of pure algarvic stock but like most lagoans she also probably had kaunians and kuusamans somewhere down the trunk of her family tree scorning people for their looks was bad manners in most lagoan circlesalthough not evidently in hers he wondered how many did share her views if lagoas became a kingdom where a man with narrow eyes or a woman with blond hair couldnt go out on the streets without fear of being insulted or worse would it be the sort of kingdom in which he cared to live no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than another followed it where else could i go nowhere on the continent of derlavai that was certain hed been to the austral continent and heartily hoped never to have anything to do with it again he hadnt visited equatorial siaulia but had no interest in doing so it was as backward as the land of the ice people and the war that blazed through derlavai sputtered there too as derlavaian colonists and their native vassals squabbled among themselves the scattered islands in the great northern sea were even less appealing unless a man aimed to forget the world and make sure the world forgot him too that was not what fernao had in mind if lagoas went bad as he left the grand hall his head turned almost of itself toward the east odd to think of kuusamo as a bastion of sanity in a world gone mad it was odd for most lagoans to think of their short dark slim neighbors any more than they had to fernao hurried up the street to the caravan stop because of his own interests he was not like most lagoans maybe his interest in kuusaman magecraftand his curiosity over whatever the kuusamans werent talking abouthad led him to take xavegas crack about his looks more to heart than he would have otherwise a leyline caravan glided up a couple of passengers got off a couple got on fernao stayed at the stopthis wasnt the route he needed and maybe shes just a nasty bitch the mage thought sourly he glanced at the people hurrying past him regardless of the hour setubal never slept one in five maybe one in four had eyes like his if xavega didnt care for them too cursed bad another caravan car came to the stop fernao climbed aboard and tossed a coin in the fare box this car would take him to within a street of his block of flats he sat down next to a yawning woman who looked to have a good deal more kuusaman blood than he did himself coming into his building he paused at the pigeonholes in the lobby to see what the postman had brought him along with the usual advertising circulars from printers dealers in sorcerous apparatus nostrum peddlers and local eateries he found an envelope with an unfamiliar printed franking mark he held it up to his face so he could read the postmasters blurry handstamp over the mark kajaani he muttered where in blazes is kajaani then he laughed at himself hed been guilty of the crime for which hed taxed xavega hed thought of lagoas first to the exclusion of everyplace else as soon as he stopped doing that he knew perfectly well where kajaani was and with only a little more thought he knew who was likely to be writing him from the kuusaman town though the envelope bore no return address he almost tore that envelope open there in the lobby but made himself wait till hed gone upstairs to his flat there he flung the useless sheets of paper onto the sofa and opened the one that mattered sure enough the letterwritten in excellent classical kaunianwas on the stationery of kajaani city college and from the theoretical sorcerer named pekka my dear colleague she wrote i thank you for your interest in my work and your inquiries into my research unfortunately i must tell you that much of my recent silence in the journals has sprung from nothing other than the demands on my time my son takes i do eventually hope to publish more but when that may be i cannot say meanwhile my life is busy in many different ways hoping this finds you well and your own work flourishing i remainpekka professor of theoretical sorcery fernaos excitement dissolved like a little ink in a lot of water leaving his mood duller and darker than it had been before he had to fight to keep from crumpling the letter and tossing it over with the rest of the mail hed received hed got similar bland missives from other kuusaman theoretical sorcerers to whom hed written had the letters been identical and not merely similar he would have known for a fact that the mages were acting in concert as things were he had to infer it but it wasnt the subtlest inference hed ever drawn they know something all right he muttered they dont want anyone to know they know it either that means its big whatever it is so much had been obvious since his meeting with ilmarinen the meeting that should have been with siuntio it was even more obvious now he wondered what the kuusamans had found something that had to do with the relationship between the laws of contagion and similarity plainly but what lagoan mages more often than not of a more practical bent than their kuusaman counterparts hadnt explored the question in depth maybe we should have fernao muttered under his breath if the guild of lagoan mages were to try to catch up with the kuusamans to discover whatever they were hiding how best to go about it the only answer that occurred to fernao was getting some talented sorcerers together and having them proceed from the point where siuntio and pekka and the rest of the kuusamans had for whatever reason fallen silent he laughed an unhappy laugh even grandmaster pinhiero would have a hard time getting a group of lagoan mages to work on a project he proposed rather than on whatever they felt like doing themselves fernao was about to throw the notion into his mental trash bin when he suddenly stiffened he wondered if in trapani or some other algarvian town another group of mages was already hard at work going down that same path if so how could lagoas afford to ignore it he glanced at pekkas note again maybe just maybe she was telling the truth and hed been starting at shadows all along with the note in his hand he couldor maybe he couldmake a fair stab at finding out he set the note on the table and went to the cabinet of sorcerous gear that stood next to the stove in the kitchen had he been a better cook he would have had a cabinet full of spices there instead from the cabinet he took a lens mounted in a polished brass ring and a dried lapwings head the lapwing being a sharpeyed bird was to a mage a sovereign remedy against deception holding the lapwings head between a lamp and the lens that focused its power on the note he chanted a cantrip in classical kaunian if the writing on the note was true he would see the black ink as bright blue if the writing was false he would see it as burning red but he continued to see it simply as black frowning he wondered if hed somehow botched the charm he didnt think so but ran through it again this time with special care the ink continued to seem black to his eyes it shouldnt have not after that spell not unless why the tricksy minx fernao exclaimed if she hasnt magicked the note against this very sorcery im an addled apprentice shaking his head at pekkas forethought he put away the lens and the birds head now he couldnt be sure whether the kuusaman theoretical sorcerer had been lying or telling the truth not by any objective means but he could still draw inferences that pekka hadnt wanted him to know whether or not she was telling the truth strongly suggested she wasnt if she wasnt the kunsamans were indeed likely to be hiding something important hed already believed that one more bit of evidence he murmured and then kicked at the carpet evidence of what something that was as much as he knew he wondered if some dapper clever young mage in trapani a fellow with waxed mustachios and a hat worn at a jaunty angle knew more for his sake for his kingdoms sake he hoped not but when he looked north and west toward the algarvian capital he knew he had fear in his eyes east of cottbus a half ring of dowsers did their best to detect algarvian dragons so they could give the capital of unkerlant some warning against attack from the air marshal rathar swung off his horse at one such post a crude hut in the middle of a forest of birch trees letting soldiers see him letting them see he was still in the fight and still thought unkerlant could win was one reason he went out to the field as often as he could another reason was learning as much as he could about all aspects of the war still another was escaping king swemmel for a while soon enough hed have to go back to the palace and see what sort of advice the king would give sometimes rathar was convinced swemmel saw further than any other man living sometimes he could not see past the end of his pointed nose telling which was which on any given day though was anything but easy and king swemmel remained as convinced about the virtues of his bad ideas as he was about his good ones rathar shook his head as a horse bedeviled by flies might flick its tail hed come out here to get away from swemmel and the king had come with him in his mind where was the relief in that when the dowsers came tumbling out of their hut to salute him he was glad to nod to them as long as he talked with them he could get away from the mental presence of his sovereign aye lord marshal said one of the offduty dowsers a lieutenant named morold weve had pretty good luck feeling out the redheads so far he hefted his forked rod a dragons wings will disturb the air you know and thats what we sense but the algarvians are getting better at masking what theyre up to curse em ive read somewhat of this in the reports coming back to cottbus rathar replied but as you say a dragon must flap its wings now and again how do the algarvians propose to prevent that morolds strongnosed peasant face crinkled into a grin of reluctant admiration the sneaky buggers dont even try sir may the powers below swallow em down what they do instead is they have some of their dragons carry baskets full of foldedup strips of paper when they get close enough that were right on the edge of spotting emhe held up the dowsing rod againthey spill the baskets out into the air and these thousands of strips of paper all start fluttering down the rods pick up those flutters too so trying to tell whats dragons and what isnt is like trying to see a white horse in a blizzard do you follow what im saying aye rathar said and i thank you youve made it clearer than the reports ever did you still can find the dragons then we know somethings up sir morold told him but not exactly what or exactly where the way we would have before you must do better unkerlant must do better rathar said if youd been into cottbus lately and seen the burntout blocks you would know unkerlant must do better he did not want to blame the dowsers who were trying as hard as they couldand whose work had led to a good many algarvian dragons knocked out of the sky something else occurred to him are our dragons using these strips of paper too to confuse the algarvian dowsers lord marshal youd have to ask the dragonfliers for im sure i cant say morold replied ill do that rathar said maybe ill do that if i remember ill do that he scrawled a note hed scrawled a lot of notes on the little pad of paper he carried in his belt pouch eventually he hoped to do something about each and every one of them the way things had been going lately he wrote new notes faster than he could deal with old ones the dowsers spirits seemed high which cheered the marshal of unkerlant as long as the soldiers thought the war could be won it could that was not to say it would be won not with the algarvians still advancing in the north the south and in the centerin the direction of cottbus but if the unkerlanter army despaired of throwing back the redheads the fight was lost without hope of recovery morold said we need more crystals lord and more heavy sticks to blaze down the enemys dragons the algarvians talk back and forth among themselves more than we do and it shows in all the fighting i know that rathar did not take out the little pad again hed scribbled that note before the mages are doing everything they can we need too many things at the same time and have not enough mages to make all of them at once morold and the other dowsers looked unhappy to hear that rathar was none too happy to say it either but he did not want to lie to them either news sheets put out plenty of pleasing lies and put the best face they could on the truth that was fine for townsmen soldiers rathar thought deserved the truth unvarnished he commandeered a fresh horse from among those tied near the dowsers hut and rode back toward cottbus a single bodyguard rode with him he would have done without even the one retainer but the idea scandalized every other generaland rathars adjutant at least hed made sure he had a solid veteran at his side not a relative he was holding away from the fighting or some pretty boy heading to cottbus he passed a troop of behemoths trotting east toward the battle lines they kicked up a great cloud of dust because they were still far from the fighting they did not wear their heavy mail but carried it in carts they pulled behind them whatever color their long shaggy hair had been before it was dustbrown now a couple of the soldiers mounted on them waved to rathar coughing he waved back his tunic was scarcely fancier than theirs they more likely thought him just another soldier than the highestranking officer in the unkerlanter army he rode past a dead algarvian dragon an old mantoo old to go to the frontwas stripping the harness from it rathar nodded anything his kingdom could steal from the redheads was one thing fewer its artisans would have to make few people and most of them women were on the streets of cottbus as he trotted through a market square he saw a long queue to buy pears and plums and an even longer one in front of a sternfaced woman with a basket of eggs there looked to be plenty of fruit the eggs were going fast and the people at the end of that line would have to do without when rathar strode into his office his adjutant hurried up to him with a worried look on his face lord marshal his majesty urgently requires your presence major merovec told him of course the king shall have what he requires rathar replied do you know why he requires me merovec shook his head rathar let out a silent sigh he wouldnt know whether king swemmel intended merely to confer with him or to sack him or to take his head till he got to the audience chamber i shall go see him at once then swemmels guardsmen in the antechamber were as meticulous as ever but did not seem hostile to rathar the marshal took that as a good sign no more guards awaited him in the audience chamber he took that as a better sign arise arise king swemmel said after rathar completed the ritual prostrations and acclamations before his sovereign swemmel sounded impatient and angry but not angry at the marshal do you know what that swaggering popinjay of a mezentio has done he demanded king mezentio had done any number of things to unkerlants detriment evidently hed just done one more rathar answered with simple truth no your majesty curse him he has raised up a false king of grelz down in herborn swemmel snarled ice ran through rathar that was one of the nastier things mezentio might have done a good many people in the duchy of grelz still resented the union of crowns that had bound them to unkerlant even though it was almost three hundred years old if algarve restored the old kingdom of grelz under a pliant local noble the grelzers might well acquiesce in algarvian control which of the counts or dukes did the redheads pick as their pretender rathar asked duke raniero who has the dishonor to be mezentios first cousin king swemmel answered rathar stared king mezentio named an algarvian noble to be king of grelz aye he did swemmel said none of the local lickspittles seemed to suit him powers above be praised rathar said softly he could have struck a harder blow against us with a grelzer than with a man the folk down there will see as a foreign usurper hed almost said another foreign usurper swemmel would not have been grateful for that not even a little you may be right swemmel sounded almost indifferent to what was in rathars eyes a blunder big as the world a moment later the king explained why but the insult is no less here if anything the insult is greater for mezentio to presume to set an algarvian as king on unkerlanter soil he did the same thing in jelgava when he made his brother mainardo king there rathar said the algarvians have always been an arrogant lot aye king swemmel agreed if the jelgavans are spineless enough to take mezentios worthless brother as their sovereign they deserve him unkerlanters will never accept an algarvian for a king he looked sly rathar knew from long experience that he was never more dangerousto his foes or sometimes to himselfthan when he wore that expression we shall make certain that unkerlanters do not accept an algarvian for a king may it be so your majesty rathar thought the course of the fighting itself more urgent than any political machinations he pointed to a large map in the audience chamber we had better make sure mezentio has no chance to proclaim a redheaded king of unkerlant in cottbus even if he does we will fight on from the west swemmel said would anyone follow orders from a king whod fled to a provincial town one jump ahead of the algarvians rathar had no idea he didnt want to have to learn by experiment either he looked toward the map himself the bites gyongyos was taking in the far west were annoyances in the north zuwayza hadnt gone far beyond the borders shed had before her first clash with unkerlant but the algarvians aimed to tear the heart from the kingdom and keep it for themselves we also have to hold cottbus because of all the ley lines that converge here rathar said if the capital falls well have a cursed hard time moving caravans from north to south aye swemmel said aye his nod was impatient absentminded leyline caravans werent the topmost thing in his thoughts or anywhere close to it he walked over to the map we still have a corridor open to glogau the lagoans have sent us some prime bull behemoths to improve our herds and they came through so they did rathar had heard that it still left him faintly bemused the zuwayzin could have pressed their attack on the ports defenses harder than they have they love mezentio little better than they love us swemmel said which evidently seemed clear to him but did not to his marshal the king went on were the black men but a little wiser they would love mezentio less than they love us had we treated them a little better that might also be true rathar remarked we did not give them a tenth part of what they deserve swemmel said nor have we yet given the algarvians a tenth nor even a hundredth part of what they deserve but we shall aye we shall whatever else one said of swemmel he had no yielding in him maybe unkerlant or what remained of unkerlant would go right on obeying him even if the algarvians ran him out of cottbus marshal rathar still hoped with all his heart he wouldnt have to find out dressed in holiday fineryordinary trousers worn under embroidered tunicsskarnu merkela and raunu came into the village of pavilosta to witness the installation of simanu the late enkurus son as count over the local countryside neither skarnu nor raunu had a tunic that fit as well as it might both theirs had formerly belonged to gedominu merkela had altered them but they remained tight waste of our time to come here raunu grumbled as a true farmer might have too much work to do to care whos over us whoever it is hell take too cursed much of what we make aye thats so merkela agreed and simanus been squeezing as hard as enkuru ever did he sucks up to the algarvians as hard as his father did too thats the only reason they finally decided to let him take over as count instead of putting in one of their own men she didnt bother keeping her voice down people who heard her shied away one of them hissed powers above you fool of a woman put a shoe in it before simanus men or the redheads drag you up into the counts keep going in is easy coming outs a different storyaye it is she lifted her chin it wouldnt be if the men around here deserved the name skarnu set a hand on her arm easy darling he murmured the idea isnt to show how much we hate the redheads and the traitors who do their bidding the idea is to hurt them without letting them know who did it merkela looked at him as if he were one of the enemy too the idea is also to make more people want to hurt them she said in a voice like ice but youre not doing that youre just frightening folk and putting yourself in danger skarnu said merkelas glare grew harder and colder still the next thing she said would be something theyd all regret for a long time seeing that coming skarnu quickly spoke first simanu and the algarvians do more in a day to make people want to hurt them than we could do in a year he watched merkela weigh the words to his great relief she nodded to his even greater relief she kept quiet or talked of unimportant things as they made their way into pavilostas central square raunu muttered the algarvians dont want anybody starting trouble today do they not even a drop skarnu muttered back redheads with sticks prowled the rooftops looking down into the square more algarvians guarded the double chair in which simanu would be installed they arent stupid they wouldnt be so cursed dangerous if they were stupid a small bandbagpipe tuba trumpet and thumping kettledrumbegan to play one sprightly valmieran tune after another skarnu watched some of the algarvian troopers make sour faces at the music their own tastes ran more toward plinkings and tinklings that were to valmieran ears effete and then he watched one of their officers growl something at them in their own language the sour faces disappeared the smiles that replaced them often looked like bad acting but were unquestionably smiles the redheads didnt offend except on purpose no they werent stupid not even slightly after a little while the band struck up a particularly bouncy tune the drummer pounding away with might and main that is the counts air merkela murmured to skarnu and raunu had they grown up around pavilosta as she had they would have heard it on ceremonial occasions all their lives as things were it was new to both of them skarnu assumed an expression that suggested it wasnt here he comes someone behind him said peoples heads turned toward the left they knew from which direction simanu would come skarnu didnt but again couldnt have been more than half a heartbeat behind everyone elsenot far enough he hoped for even the most alert algarvian to notice dressed in a tunic stiff with gold thread and trousers of silk with fur at the cuffs the late count enkurus son advanced toward the double chair in which he would formally succeed his father simanu was somewhere in his midtwenties with a face handsome and nasty at the same time the face of a man whod never had anyone tell him no in his whole life ive served under officers who looked like that raunu muttered everybody loved emoh aye he rolled his eyes to make sure no one took him seriously simanu bestowed his sneer impartially on the valmierans over whom he was being set and the algarvians who were allowing him to be set over those townsmen and villagers just for a moment the cast of his features reminded skarnu of his sister krastas he shook his head that wasnt fair was it had krasta ever really worn such a snide smile he hoped not after simanu came more algarvian bodyguards and a peasant obviously cleaned up for the occasion the fellow led two cows one fine and plump the other a sad scrawny shambling beast raunu muttered again have to find out who that bugger is and make sure something bad happens to him aye we will skarnu agreed hes as much in bed with the redheads as simanu is he turned to merkela why the beasts he held his voice downone more thing a proper peasant from around pavilosta would have known from childhood only watch and youll see merkela answered she might not have seen this ceremony beforeenkuru had been the local lord for a long timebut it was second nature to her it probably figured in tales the peasants in this part of the kingdom told their children for all skarnu could tell diligent folklorists back in priekule had composed learned dissertations about it simanu strode up to the double chair one side of which faced east the other west people of pavilosta people of my county he called out in a voice as poisonously sweet as his face i now come into my inheritance he sat down facing west toward algarve that was no doubt intended to symbolize his defense of the region against the kilted barbarians who had so often troubled the kaunian empire and the later kaunian kingdoms his facing west now with algarvians surrounding and upholding him felt cruelly ironic the scrubbed peasant still holding the lead ropes for the two cows took his seat backtoback with simanu then he rose again and led the beasts around the double chair to the new count he held out both ropes one in each hand now youll see how it goes merkela murmured to skarnu simanu has to choose the skinny cow and he has to let the peasant give him a box on the earjust a little one mindto show he governs here not for his own sake but for the sake of his people but when count simanu got to his feet to face the peasant his smile had grown nastier still people of pavilosta people of my county the world has changed he said vile brigands slew my father and still have not got their just deserts because their wicked fellows conceal them and keep them safe from harm very well then if you will not give you will not get speaking thus he seized the fat cows rope in his left hand and with his right dealt the peasant a buffet to the side of the head that sent the fellow sprawling with a cry of pain and surprise simanu threw back his own head and laughed loud and long for a moment his laughter was almost was almost the only sound in pavilostas central square the peasants and townsfolk simply stared having trouble believing anyone would pervert their ancient ceremony maybe the algarvians had trouble believing it too their officers gaped like the valmieran peasants around themgaped and then started to curse in their shoes skarnu would also have cursed their chosen puppet had just chosen to outrage the people they wanted him to control someone threw an apple at simanu it missed and smashed against the double chair the fat cow took a couple of steps forward and crunched it up then someone else threw a cobblestone that one didnt miss it caught simanu in the ribs he let out a yell louder than the cleanedup peasant had more stones and fruits and vegetables whizzed past simanu some of them didnt whiz past but thumped against him he yelled again so did the algarvian officer in charge of the valmieran nobles kilted bodyguards you cursed idiot why did you not do the ceremony as it should be done they did not deserve it simanu said wiping blood from his face by the powers above they still do not deserve it not with how they treat me fool the algarvian started make them happy in the small things and you can rule them in the large ones this way he raised his voice to a shout that filled the square you valmierans stop this riotous nonsense at once and peacefully go back to your hooof that last came when a cleverly aimed stone hit him in the belly and he folded up like a concertina nicely thrown skarnu remarked i thank you sir raunu answered nice to know the arm still works aye skarnu looked around he stood near the front of the crowd but not so near that any algarvian could easily see who he was drawing in a deep breath he let it out in a shout of his own down with the vicious count and the algarvian tyrants no redhead could have identified him in the moments following that cry for merkela grabbed him pulled his face down to hers and gave him the most savage kiss hed ever had a kiss that left the taste of blood in his mouth because of that kiss he hardly noticed the valmierans surging past him toward the scapegrace count simanu and his algarvian protectors back the algarvian officer shouted in valmieran back or you will be sorry for it he had mettle no man without it would have found his voice so fast after making the acquaintance of raunus stone but the townsfolk and peasants roused by tradition flouted as perhaps by nothing else did not go back more stones flewskarnu flung one himself it missed which made him curse down with simanu the valmierans roared a cry that echoed through the square down with simanu down with blaze the algarvian officer shouted not about to let the outraged valmierans overrun his men blaze them down blaze them down the redheads did a few men got in among the kilted soldiers but they did not last long both the algarvians around simanu and those on the rooftops turned their sticks on the furious valmierans as menand womenbegan to fall the rest broke and fled skarnu had to drag merkela away by main force let me go she kept shouting i want my crack at them but he would not let her go come on he said i dont want you dead curse it as if to underscore his words a man beside them fell with a groan skarnu went on the algarvians and simanu have just done us a favor before people would put up with them no morenow theyve found out what they get when they do well have five people willing to fight them for every one who would before do you see merkela must have for she let him lead her out of pavilosta but she never admitted he was right not out loud five krasta rounded on her maidservant curse you bauska i ought to box your x i ears she said furiously its only the middle of the afternoon if you think you can fall asleep on me you had better think again i am sorry milady bauska said around a yawn im sure i dont know whats come over me the past few days wise in the ways of servants krasta had no doubt she was lying but couldnt tell why bauska yawned again yawned and then gulped her complexion always pale went distinctly green after another gulp she made a strangled choking noise turned and dashed out of krastas bedchamber when she returned she still looked wan but somewhat better as if shed got rid of what ailed her are you ill krasta demanded if you are you had better not give it to me colonel lurcanio and i are supposed to go to a banquet tomorrow night milady bauska stopped a fainta very faintflush darkened her white white cheeks she resumed picking her words with obvious care what i have it is not catching not between me and you what are you talking about krasta asked if youre ill have you seen a physician i am sick now and then milady but i am not ill her servant said and i have no need to go to a physician the moon has told me everything i need to know the moon for a moment the words meant nothing to krasta then her eyes widened that explained it you are with child aye bauska said and again blushed faintly i have been sure now for the past ten days or so whos the father krasta asked if bauska presumed to tell her it was none of her business she promised herself the maidservant would regret it for the rest of her life but bauska did nothing of the sort looking down at the carpet she whispered captain mosco milady you are carrying an algarvians bastard a cuckoos egg krasta said not raising her eyes bauska nodded anger shot through krasta anger oddly mixed with envy shed thought from the beginning that mosco who was years younger than lurcanio was also better looking how did it happen how now bauska did look up in the usual way of course krasta hissed in exasperation that is not what i meant and you know it perfectly well now thenhave you told this fellow what hes done to you bauska shook her head no milady i have not dared not yet well you are about to krasta seized her maidservant by the arm had she been just a little more provoked she would have seized bauska by the ear as things were she gripped bauska tightly enough to make the servant whimper krasta ignored that she was used to ignoring protests from her servants bauska whimpered again when krasta marched her down the stairs and into the wing of the mansion the algarvians occupied krasta ignored that too a couple of the clerks who helped administer priekule for king mezentio looked up from their desks as the two valmieran women went by they eyed krasta and bauska too though krasta paid no attention to that far more brazenly than valmieran commoners would have dared to do their leers had infuriated krasta at first now she accepted them as she accepted so much of algarvian rule but there are limits she muttered by the powers above there are limits bauska made a questioning noise krasta went right on ignoring her she knew where captain mosco worked in an antechamber outside the larger room that served these days as colonel lurcanios office mosco was speaking into a crystal mounted on a desk undoubtedly plundered from a valmieran cabinetmakers shop he murmured something in algarvian as the image in the crystal faded away he rose and bowed and shifted into his accented valmieran how lovely to see you ladiesand twice as lovely to see you both together oh he was smooth bauska smiled and curtsied and started to say something sweetexactly what the situation didnt call for as far as krasta was concerned what the situation did call for seemed plain enough seducer krasta shouted at the top of her lungs betrayer of innocence defiler of purity that made all the officious algarvian clerksor at least the ones who understood valmieranstare through the doorway at her with something other than lust on their minds it also brought colonel lurcanio out into the antechamber it did not however much abash captain mosco like so many of his countrymen he had crust with another bow he said i assure you milady you are mistaken i am no defiler no betrayer no seducer i assure you alsohe looked insufferably male insufferably smugno seduction was necessary not with the lady your maidservant being at least as eager as i krasta glared at bauska she was perfectly willing to believe the commoner wench a slut with some effort though she remembered that was neither here nor there she had considerable practice sneering and put that practice to good use lie however you please she said but all your lies will not explain away the child this poor woman is carrying what is this lurcanio said sharply mosco stared then kicked at the carpet he still looked very male but now like a sulky small boy caught after hed broken a fancy vase he should have handled carefully speak up krasta told bauska and squeezed the maidservants upper armwhich shed never let go ofharder than ever bauska whimpered yet again then did speak in a very small voice milady tells the truth i will have a baby and captain mosco is the father mosco had wasted no time recovering his aplomb with an extravagant algarvian shrug he said well what if i am thats what comes of poking every now and then anyhow he turned to lurcanio its not as if im the only one my lord count these valmieran women spread their legs at a wink and a wave i know that lurcanio answered he was looking at krasta blood rushed to her facethe blood of outrage not that of embarrassment she squared her shoulders and drew in a deep breath preparatory to scorching lurcanio but a moment later she exhaled the scorching undelivered she did not care to admit it even to herself but lurcanio intimidated her as no one else ever had he spoke to mosco now in algarvian mosco kicked at the carpet again as he answered in the same language krasta had no idea what they were saying though she had an algarvian for a lover she had not bothered learning above half a dozen words of his language to her surprise bauska leaned over to her and whispered they say halfbreeds are the last thing they want what are they going to do to me she looked as if she wanted to sink through the floor you understand the funny noises they make krasta said in some surprise to her way of thinking servants barely had the wit to speak valmieran let alone any other language but bauska nodded lurcanio and mosco went right on talking taking no notice of the two women krasta squeezed bauskas arm again to make the maidservant tell her what they were jabbering about in due course bauska did mosco says theyll have to make sure the baby weds an algarvian come the day in a few generations he says the kaunian taint will be gone he says that does he krasta whispered back outraged all over again everyone kneweveryone in her circles knewkaunian blood was infinitely superior to that of the swaggering barbarians from algarve but she did not have the nerve to throw that obvious truth in lurcanios face instead she tried a different ploy how happy will captain moscos wife be to learn of his little bastard she wasnt sure mosco had a wife by the way he flinched though he did lurcanio spoke in a flat voice the one he used to give orders you will not say a word to captain moscos wife milady after gathering herself krasta looked defiance at him in trying to keep her from playing the game of scandal he had for once overreached himself i will bargain with you she said if mosco acknowledges the bastard as his if he supports the brat and bauska as they deserve his wife need not hear anything unfortunate if he acts as so many men are in the habit of acting lurcanio and mosco spoke back and forth in algarvian again krasta had no idea what they were saying bauska did and let out an angry squawk pointing at mosco she said you certainly are the father i dont tomcat around and youve proved you do krasta didnt know whether to believe her or not she operated on the assumption that servants lied whenever they got the chance but bauska sounded convincing and mosco wouldnt have an easy time proving she liednot for some months anyhow he thought of that too if the child has hair the color of straw it can starve for all of me he growled but then with a sour look at krasta he went on if i see signs i did in truth sire it it shall not lack nor shall its mother this i would do for my own honors sake but men speak of honor more often than they show it krasta said you do not know algarvians as well as you think mosco snapped you do not know men as well as you think krasta retorted which drew a startled gasp of laughter from bauska and a couple of harsh chuckles from lurcanio i was trying to tell youif that is so the child and mother shall not lack captain mosco said and if they do not lack not a word of this shall go back to algarve is it a bargain it is a bargain krasta said at once she did not ask bauskas opinion bauskas opinion meant nothing to her when her maidservant nodded she scarcely noticed her contest was with the algarviansand she had done better against this pair than the valmieran army had done against mezentios men if only we might have blackmailed the redheads instead of fighting them she thought lurcanio sensed that he and mosco had come off second best waggling a finger under krastas nose he said do remember you have made this bargain with my aide who has his own reasons for agreeing to it if you seek to play such games with me you shall not be happier for it afterwards i promise you nothing could have been more nicely calculated to make krasta want to try to punish him for his algarvian arrogance though having his child struck her as going too far and lurcanio had shown her he was not in the habit of bluffing disliking him for the steadfastness she was also compelled to respect she made her head move up and down i understand she said good he was arrogant indeed you had better and then his manner changed he could take off and put on charm as readily as he took off and redonned his kilt up in krastas bedchamber shall we go out this evening milady as well as tomorrow viscount valnu i hear has promised one of his entertainments on the spur of the moment he raised an eyebrow if you are irked at me i can always go alone and bring some ambitious little tart back here krasta said not on your life lurcanio laughed would i do such a thing of course you would krasta said mosco may not know men but i do lurcanio laughed again and did not presume to contradict her pekka hurried around the house flicking at imaginary specks of dust is everything ready she asked for the dozenth time as ready as it can be her husband answered leino looked around the parlor of course we havent stuffed uto into the rest crate yet you told me id get in trouble if i went in the rest crate uto said indignantly that means you cant put me in there either it does it does he drew himself up straight as if defying leino to deny it big people can do all sorts of things children cant leino said pekka coughed she didnt want this issue complicated leino coughed too in embarrassment and yielded the point this time youre right im not supposed to put you in the rest crate under his breath he added no matter how tempted i am pekka heard that and coughed again uto fortunately didnt before any new arguments could startand arguments accreted around uto as naturally as nacre around of bit of grit inside an oystersomeone knocked on the front door pekka jumped then hurried to open it there stood ilmarinen and siuntio pekka went down on one knee before them as she would have before one of the seven princes of kuusamo enter she said your presence honors my home it was a commonplace greeting but here she meant it from the bottom of her heart as the two elderly theoretical sorcerers stepped over the threshold leino also bowed so did uto a beat slower than he should have he stared at the mages from under his thick mop of black hair ilmarinen laughed at that covert inspection i know about you young fellow he said aye i do and do you know how i know uto shook his head ilmarinen told him because i was just the same way when i was your size thats how i believe it siuntio said and you havent changed much in all the years since either ilmarinen beamed though pekka wasnt sure siuntio had meant it as a compliment gathering herself she said masters i present to you my husband leino and my son uto she turned to her family here we have the mages siuntio and ilmarinen leino and uto bowed again leino said it is indeed an honor to have two such distinguished men as my guests he smiled wryly it would be an even greater honor were i privileged to hear what they discuss with my wife but i understand why that cannot be come on utowere going next door to visit aunt elimaki and uncle olavin why uto had his eye on ilmarinen id rather stay and listen to him i already know what auntie and uncle will do we cant listen to these mages and your mother talk because theyll be talking about secret things leino said pekka thought that only more likely to make uto want to stay but her husband retrieved the situation by adding these things are so secret even im not supposed to hear about them utos eyes widened hed known his parents didntcouldnttell each other about everything they did but hed never seen that brought home so dramatically he went with leino to pekkas sisters house without another word of protest a likely lad ilmarinen said likely to make you want to pitch him into the sea a lot of the time i shouldnt wonder but likely the other way too i think youre right on both counts pekka said sit make yourselves comfortable i pray you let me bring refreshments she hurried into the kitchen then returned with bread sliced smoked salmon and onions and pickled cucumbers and a pot of ale from kajaanis best brewer by the time she got back siuntio had spectacles on his nose and a lagoan journal in his hand he set it aside willingly enough to eat and to accept a mug of golden ale but his eyes kept sliding over to it pekka noticed and said nothing ilmarinen noticed and twitted him the lagoans watch us and so you feel compelled to watch the lagoans and what if i do siuntio asked mildly this does after all touch upon our reason for coming to kajaani not even ilmarinen could find a way to disagree with him the vultures gather he said they clawed at the scraps of what we published now that weve stopped publishing they claw at the scraps of what isnt there how good a mage is this fernao pekka asked from the questions he asked me in his letter he knows as much as i did a couple of years ago the question is can he ferret out the direction ive taken since then he is a firstrank mage and he has grandmaster pinhieros ear back in setubal siuntio said sipping at his ale he is a sneaky dog and would have stolen everything in siuntios belt pouch had the two of them met ilmarinen said he tried slitting mine too but im an old sinner myself and not so easy to befool he came to us openly and innocently siuntio said ilmarinen made a rude noise siuntio corrected himself openly at any rate but how many mages from how many kingdoms are sniffing at the trail of what we have even one could be too many if he served king swemmel or king mezentio pekka said we dont know yet how much power lurks at the heart of this link between the two laws or how to unleash whatever there is but others with the same idea might pass us on the way and that would be very bad ilmarinen looked east arpad of gyongyos has able mages too he looked west and fernao is not the only good one in the stable of vitor of lagoas gyongyos hates us because we block her way across the islands of the bothnian ocean lagoas does not hate us siuntio said lagoas doesnt need to hate us ilmarinen answered lagoas is our neighbor so she can covet what we have without bothering to get excited about it and we and the lagoans have fought our share of wars over the years lagoas would have to be mad to fight us at the same time as she wars with algarve pekka said we outweigh her even more than mezentios kingdom does if she were ahead of us on this path you mentioned that might not matter so much siuntio said and she is at war and kingdoms at war do crazy things ilmarinen added and the lagoans are cousins to the algarvians which gives them a good head start on craziness by itself if anyone wants to know what i think kaunians are proud because theyre an old folk as we are siuntio said algarvic peoples are proud because theyre new that doesnt make them crazy but it does make them different from us anyone whos enough different from me is surely crazyor surely sane depending ilmarinen said pekka declined to rise to that she went on with siuntios though and unkerlanters are proud because they arent kaunian or algarvic and gyongyosians i think are proud because they arent like anyone else at all when it comes to that theyre like us but no other way i can think of theyre much uglier than we are ilmarinen said siuntio sent him a reproachful look he bore up under it they cursed well arethose overmuscled bodies that tawny yellow hair sprouting every which way like driedout weeds he paused their women do look better than their men i will say that and what do ou know of gyongyosian women the question stood on the end of pekkas tongue but she didnt ask it something in ilmarinens expression warned her that he would tell her more than she wanted to hear he had after all been attending mages meetings longer than shed been alive instead she said we have to learn more ourselves and we have to be careful while were doing it oh indeed siuntio said there you have in the compass of an acorn shell one of the reasons for our journey from yliharma ilmarinen glanced over to him aside from gulping down mistress pekkas excellent food and guzzling her ale i thought that was the reason we came to kajaani not quite siuntio said i have been pondering the implications of your truly astonishing insight into the inverse nature of the relationship between die laws of similarity and contagion he bowed in his seat i would never have thought of such a thing not if i examined the results of mistress pekkas experiment for a hundred years but once furnished with the insight that sprang from a mind more clever than mine i have tried to examine some of the avenues down which we may hope to follow it look out ilmarinen said to pekka the more humble he sounds the more dangerous he is siuntio took no notice of ilmarinen pekka got the idea that siuntio had a lot of practice taking no notice of ilmarinen from his belt pouch siuntio drew out three sheets of paper he kept one and gave one to each of his fellow theoretical sorcerers i hope you will not hesitate to point out any flaws you may find in the reasoning mistress pekka he said i do not give ilmarinen the same warning for i know he will not hesitate truth is truth ilmarinen said everything else is fair game he donned a pair of spectacles to help him read after a little while he grunted after another little while he grunted again louder and looked over the tops of the spectacles at siuntio why you old fox pekka made slower going of the lines of complex symbols siuntio had given her about a third of the way down the closely written sheet she exclaimed but this would mean and broke off for the conclusion to which siuntio was leading her seemed one only a maniac could embrace but he nodded aye it would or i think it would could we but find a way to do it believe me i was quite as surprised as you you old fox ilmarinen repeated this is why youre the best in the business nobody pays attention to the details the way you donobody if i had a hat on id take it off to you pekka worked her way down to the bottom of the sheet this is amazing she said its elegant too which argues that it ought to be true i find no flaws in the logic none whatever but that i dont find them doesnt mean they arent there experiment is an even better test of truth than elegance she hoped she hadnt offended the master mage and breathed a sigh of relief when siuntio grinned truly you will go far in your craft he told her and she inclined her head in thanks he went on some of the required experiments maywillbe difficult to formulate i shouldnt think so pekka said why she explained an idea that had come to her while she was nearing the end of siuntios work now siuntio dipped his head to her to her surprise so did ilmarinen who said well well i wouldnt have come up with that nor i siuntio agreed you deserve to be the one to try it mistress pekka in the meanwhilefor i can see that it will take some preparationilmarinen and i will acquaint raahe and alkio and piilis with our progress for the three of us seem to have drawn somewhat ahead of them is that agreeable to you aye pekka knew she sounded dazed the two finest theoretical sorcerers in kuusamo had just let her know they thought she belonged in their company all things considered she decided shed earned the right to sound a little dazed back in his study brivibas labored over yet another article on the bygone days of the kaunian empire by immersing himself in the past vanais grandfather did what he could to ignore the unpleasant present vanai wished she could find such an escape for herself she longed for escapes of all sorts escape from major spinello chief among them she glanced back toward the study brivibas would not come out till suppertime and would do his best to ignore her while they ate she had hours in which to try her spell the casting of which would take only a few minutes her grandfather would be none the wiser and what he did not know he could not tell as vanai opened the book of classical kaunian sorcerous lore she laughed without much humor and bowed in the direction of the study you have not trained me in vain my grandfather she murmured even if i use my knowledge to ends different from yours though she was no trained mage the spell before her looked simple enough shed had no trouble getting daffodil root from tamulis the druggist to this day the boiled root was a simple preventive against bladder pains and brivibas had reached an age where it was easy to imagine him suffering from such and vanais mother had owned a set of silver earrings necklace and bracelet set with seagreen beryls taking an earring from the dusty jewelry case without her grandfather noticing had been simplicity itself now she said gathering herself to hope this proves a true spell there lay the rub as she knew only too well however loath brivibas was to admit it the ancient kaunians had been a superstitious lot believing in all manner of demons modern thaumaturgy proved nonexistent some of what theyd reckoned magic too was nothing but imagination run wild too many of their spells gave no results when worked byor againstskeptical moderns vanai shrugged one way or another shed learn something i can write a paper afterwards she thought but she did not want to write a paper she only wanted major spinello gone as the classical text recommended shed made a crude straw image of her algarvian tormentor soaking the top of the images head in red ink showed its model came from mezentios kingdom now that the ink had dried vanai held the image in her left hand with her right she stirred a bowl of water in which shed boiled the daffodil root as she cast the image into the bowl she called out the classical kaunian invocation from the text devil begone from my house devil begone from my door devil begone from my bed she thought she wanted to say that aloudshe wanted to scream it but the charm said follow exactly what is written and thou shalt surely gain thy desire and this hath been proved in our time she would not deviate not yet if the charm failed her which she knew to be only too likely she would think about what to do next for now she took the image out of the bowl of infused water and dried it on a rag some of the red ink had smeared which made the straw man look badly wounded vanais lips skinned back from her teeth in a predatory grin she didnt mind that no she didnt mind that at all once the image was dry enough to suit her she laid the beryl on its inkstained chest beryl is the stone that driveth away enemies she intoned beryl is the stone that maketh them meek and mild and obedient to the operators will and my will is that he go away and never trouble me again or any other kaunian either when she was done she threw the image and the rag on which shed dried it into the cookfire for one thing she hoped that would hurt spinello too for another it got rid of the evidence like conquerors since the days of the kaunian empire king mezentios men took a dim view of those they had defeated practicing sorcery against them after the image had gone up in smoke she poured down the privy the daffodil root and the water in which she had boiled it the earring went back into the case from which it had come the book of charms onto its shelf as she set about peeling and slicing parsnips to add to the pot of bean soup simmering above the fire she wondered if shed just wasted her time also like conquerors since the days of the kaunian empire king mezentios men were warded against their enemies magecraft and she didnt know whether shed truly practiced magecraft or simply tried to use one of her ancestors outworn mistaken beliefs but she hoped oh how she hoped brivibas as usual these days was taciturn over supper hed given up lecturing her and reproving her and had no idea how to talk to her in any more nearly normal more nearly equal way or maybe she thought as she watched him spoon up the soup he had so many nasty things he wanted to tell her he simply couldnt decide which one to shout out first and so swallowed all of them however that worked his silence suited her major spinello did not visit her the next day she hadnt expected that he would shed come to know the rhythms of his lust better than she wanted to knowing them at all for that matter was knowing them better than she wanted to when he stayed away the day after that she began to hope when he stayed away the day after that too her heart sang a hymn of freedom inside her that made the peremptory unmistakably algarvian knock on the door the following morning all the more devastating brivibas who had been examining one of the antiquities in the parlor let out a disdainful sniff and retreated across the courtyard to his study he slammed the door behind him as if taking refuge in a besieged fortress he would be long since dead were i not doing this vanai reminded herself but her steps dragged even more than usual as she made her way to the door took you long enough spinello said you dont want to keep me waiting you know not if you want to keep your grandfather breathing i am here vanai said dully do what you will he took her back to her bedchamber and did exactly that and then because he hadnt done it for longer than usual he wanted to do it again when he didnt rise to the occasion quite so promptly as hed hoped he would vanai had to help him of all the things he made her do she despised that most of all if i bite down hard she thought not for the first timefor far from the first timethe redheads will slay me and my grandfather and the powers above only know what theyll do to the rest of the kaunians in oyngestun and so she refrained though the temptation got stronger every time at last after what seemed like forever spinello gasped his way to a second completion he preened and strutted as he got back into his kilt and tunic i know im spoiling you for every other man he said meaning it as a boast vanai cast down her eyes if spinello wanted to think that maidenly modesty and not disgust she would let him aye i think you are she murmured if he wanted to think that agreement rather than disgust again she would let him he left brivibas house whistling cheerfully the picture of sated indolence vanai barred the door after him she went back to the houses crowded bookshelves to the text from which shed taken the classical spell of repulsion shed hoped that because it was so old spinello would not be warded against it maybe he was or maybe the spell like so many from the days of the old empire had no real value either way she wanted to throw the book into the fire or drop it down the privy as she had when pleasuring spinello she refrained shed made sure she put the text back exactly where shed got it if it went missing brivibas would know and would hound her without mercy till it turned up or till she explained why it couldnt or he might think spinello had stolen it if anything could rouse her grandfather to violence a purloined book might spinello returned three days laterhe probably needed extra rest after his unusual exertion during his previous visitand then again two days after that in his own way he was nearly as regular and methodical as brivibas vanai cursed the classical kaunians under her breath and sometimes above it her grandfather remained convinced his ancient ancestors had been the font of all knowledge maybe so but what theyd reckoned magecraft couldnt keep the algarvian major out of her bed as far as she was concerned that made them uselessworse than useless for shed built up her hopes relying on their wisdom only to see those hopes dashed two days later spinello came back and then two days after that by then vanai had resigned herself to the failure of her ploy she let him do what he wanted he did leave more quickly these days than he had at first hed discovered she didnt care to listen to his tales of algarvian triumphs in unkerlant and so had stopped regaling her with them he allowed her all sorts of small courtesies but not the larger one of deciding whether she wanted to give herself to him and after another two days he returned once more this time to her surprise he had a couple of ordinary algarvian troopers at his back horror blazed through her was he going to give her to them as a reward for good service if he tried to do that vanai would she realized she didnt have to decide what she would do then one of the troopers carried a crate holding four jars of wine the other was festooned with sausage links and cradled a ham in his arms spinello spoke to them in algarvian they set the food and drink inside the front hall then went away spinello came in and closed the door behind himself as he was barring it vanai found her voice whats all this farewell gift spinello answered lightly my superiors in their wisdom have decided i am better suited to fighting the unkerlanters than to administering a forthwegian village it will be boring i expectno antiquities and mostly homely womenbut i am the kings to command you will have to take your chances with the constables who take over for me buthe slid a hand under her tunici am not gone yet vanai let him lead her back to her bedchamber when he had her straddle him she did it joyfully it was not the joy of fulfilled desire but it was the joy of a fulfilled desire and surprisingly close to the othercloser than shed ever come with spinello of that she was certain had he wanted a second go then she would have given it to him without much resentment knowing it would be the last but after shed brought him to his peak he caressed her for a moment then patted her bottom to show he wanted her to let him up she did and he began to dress ill miss you curse me if i wont he said bending down to kiss her an eyebrow quirked you wont miss me a bit and curse me if i dont know that but i brought the meat and wine to give you something to remember me by i will always remember you vanai said truthfully as she got back into her own clothes now perhaps she might not remember him quite as she would have before his giftor not to the same degree at any rate she might even hope he would live when he went into battlethough she might not too to her relief he didnt ask her anything about that he kissed and fondled her at the doorway before going out she closed the door and barred it then she stood in the entry hall for a couple of minutes scratching her head as she stared down at the sausages had her spell got spinello sent off to fight king swemmels men or was this only a coincidence if it was only a coincidence had some coincidences like it convinced the ancient kaunians they had an effective cantrip how could she be sure had she been her grandfather she would have gone to the shelves of dusty journals to find out what historians and historical mages had written but she was not brivibas knowing how shed got free of spinello didnt matter to her knowing that shed got free did there in the crowded little hallway she began to dance for once corporal leudast looked at behemoths with admiration rather than dread these behemoths belonged to his own side and were trotting into action for king swemmel and against the algarvian invaders stomp em flat he shouted at the unkerlanter soldiers riding the big beasts poor tactics corporal captain hawart said more efficient to blaze the redheads down or toss eggs onto their heads but having delivered that admonition he grinned i hope they stomp the buggers flat too weve got fine big behemoths there to do it sergeant magnulf remarked i think theyre bigger than most of the ones the algarvians breed hawart nodded i think youre right thats the far western strain bigger and fiercer than any the redheads or the kaunians ever tamed i wish we had more of them his grin faded i wish the size difference mattered more nowadays too with the weapons behemoths carry its not body against body and horn against horn as often as it used to be maybe not sir leudast said but if i dont like mediumsized algarvian behemoths coming at me mezentios men sure wont like great big unkerlanter behemoths coming at them heres hoping they dont hawart said whatever we do weve got to hold the corridor between glogau and the rest of the kingdom the zuwayzin have stopped their push but the algarvians he broke off his face grim leudast wondered if anything could stop the algarvians nothing had yet or he and his comradesthose of them left alivewouldnt have been pushed so far back into unkerlant but new recruits in rockgray tunics kept coming out of die training camps farther west king mezentios men occupied his own village along with countless others but unkerlant still held even more come on captain hawart shouted to the mix of veterans and new men making up his regiment forward and stick close to the behemoths we need them to smash a hole in the enemys line but they need us too if the redheads pop up out of the grass and blaze the men off those beasts they arent any good to us by themselves algarvian tactics leudast remarked sergeant magnulf nodded the redheads had a long time to figure out how to put all the puzzle pieces together were having to learn on the fly and i think were doing a lot better than we were just after they hit us aye leudast said nothing comes cheap for them these days but trying to hold back the algarvians didnt come cheap either as one whod started fighting them in central forthweg and was still fighting them here deep inside unkerlant leudast understood that better than most forward magnulf shouted echoing captain hawart and leudast shouted too echoing his sergeant and forward the unkerlanter footsoldiers went on the heels of their behemoths in a way such willingness to keep on counterattacking was surprising considering how often such blows either came to nothing or were frittered away leudast remembered the fight for pfreimd only too well in another way though a lot of the men whod retaken pfreimd only to have to yield it up again were by now dead or wounded the freshfaced young soldiers whod replaced them didnt realize how easily their superiors could throw their lives away for no good reason theyll find out leudast thought the ones who live will find out the ones who died would find out too but the knowledge would do them no good after another couple of strides he wondered how much good it would do the ones who lived he pounded along hunched forward at the waist to make himself as small a target as he could men whod seen some fighting imitated him and also imitated him in zigzagging frequently so as not to let any algarvian footsoldiers grow too sure where theyd be in the next moment troopers newly pulled from their villages stood straight up and ran straight ahead the ones who lived would soon learn better and that lesson would actually do them some good bursting eggs from the behemoths tossers tore up the wheatfield ahead the algarvians were supposed to have come that far though no one on the unkerlanter side seemed sure of exactly where they were that struck leudast as inefficient quite a few things about the way his side was fighting the war struck him as inefficient but mentioning them struck him as efficient only in the sense that it would be an efficient way to get himself into trouble sure as sure a behemothrider threw up his arms and slid out of his seat to lie crumpled and still among stalks of wheat now going from green to gold leudast hadnt seen whence the beam came but a couple of unkerlanters cried out there and pointed to a spot in the field not far ahead of him a moment later a beam blazed past his head so close he could feel the heat on his cheek he threw himself flat and scrambled forward through the grain the rich smells of fertile soil and ripening wheat reminded him the harvest would be coming soon were he back in his village were this a time of peace he would follow the horsedrawn reaper gathering up the grain it cut down now he wanted to cut down that algarvian soldier whod come so close to reaping him as he moved toward the spot where he thought the redhead hid he tried to work out what the algarvian would be doing if he was a new man himself hed probably be running but a veteran might well sit tight knowing he was unlikely to escape and intent on doing all the damage he could before being hunted down and killed the way this fellow had coolly blazed down the behemothrider argued that he knew what he was about never had it crossed leudasts mind that the redhead might come hunting him but the stalks of wheat parted in front of him and there was the algarvian waxed mustachios all awry he shouted something in his language and swung the business end of his stick toward leudast he was smart and dangerous and very fast but so was leudast and leudast blazed first a neat hole appeared in the redheads face just below his right eye the beam boiled his brains inside his skull most of the back of his head blew out he was dead before he crashed to the ground like a dropped sack of barley powers above leudast muttered cautiously he got to his feet and looked around to find out what had happened in the bigger fight while he and the algarvian carried on their own private war the unkerlanter behemoths and his comrades were still going forward he too hurried ahead algarvian dragons fell out of the sky on the behemoths but a couple of those dragons smashed to earth the unkerlanters manning the heavy sticks some of the behemoths carried were not caught napping and unkerlanter dragons their scales painted the rockgray of leudasts tunic attacked the beasts gaudy in algarves red green and white the redheads hurt the troop of behemoths but could not wreck it here and there little fires smoldered in the wheat had the wind been stronger they would have grown and spread a couple of them one around the burning body of a dragon were trying to spread anyhow leudast skirted them and ran on hed seen far worse things than fields afire more eggs began falling among his comrades these not dropped from dragons but hurled by algarvian eggtossers behind the line leudast threw himself into a hole one of them had made in bursting a moment later after another burst close by sergeant magnulf jumped into the same holeand onto leudast who said oof sorry magnulf said though he didnt sound very sorry leudast wasnt unduly put out magnulf worried about saving his own neck first and everything else afterwards as any sensible soldier would have the sergeant went on stinking redheads hit back faster than you wish they would dont they aye leudast said i wish i could say you were wrong he tried to look on the bright side were getting better at that ourselves too our dragons gave them more than they wanted a little while ago i know but they do it all the stinking time magnulf said the whoresons have more crystals than we do and they keep on talking into them shouts from ahead warned that the algarvians were doing more than talking into their crystals leudast and magnulf scrambled up to the edge of their hole and looked east behemoths and soldiers and eggs had flattened enough of the wheat to let them see troopers in tan kilts and tunics running toward them in loose order leudast laughed out loud they didnt do enough talking this time look sergeantthey didnt bring any behemoths with em and weve still got some of ours magnulfs eyes glowed ha theyll pay for that gloating anticipation filled his voice pay for it the algarvians did the unkerlanter behemoths heavy sticks blazed them down at a range from which the redheads could not hurt the beasts or their riders eggs from other behemoths tossers burst among the algarvians tossing some aside like broken dolls and making most of the rest go to earth to keep from suffering a like fate forward captain hawart called leudast heaved himself out of the hole and made for the algarvians so did sergeant magnulf almost without noticing they were doing it they spread apart from each other making themselves into less inviting targets for the enemy but the algarvians were as quick to correct their own mistakes as they were to punish the unkerlanters reinforcements came to the rescue of the men the unkerlanter attack had been on the edge of crushing and those reinforcements included behemoths with redheads aboard one thing leudast had seen before was that algarvian behemothriders went after their unkerlanter counterparts the instant they spied them so it was in this fight too and with fewer behemoths backing them king swemmels footsoldiers faltered shouting king mezentios name the algarvians came on again hot to retake the stretch of ground the unkerlanters had wrested from them but a flight of dragons painted rockgray swooped down on them dropping eggs on their behemoths and flaming their footsoldiers leudast shouted himself hoarse or rather hoarser for the smoke in the air had left his throat raw now for quite a while when he looked back over his shoulder he was surprised to see the sun dipping toward the western horizon the fighting had gone on all day and hed hardly noticed now he felt how worn and hungry and thirsty he was unkerlanter reinforcements came up during the night so did a little food leudast had more than a little food on him he knew supplies were liable to be erratic during the night the wind shifted as it had a way of doing as summer swung toward fall it blew from out of the south a cool breeze with a warning of rain in it sure enough at dawn gray clouds covered most of the sky eyeing them sergeant magnulf said itll already be raining i expect down in the village i come from nothing wrong with that you ask me no leudast said nothing wrong with that at all lets see how the redheads like slogging through the mud if the powers above are giving us an early winter maybe theyll give us a nasty winter too he stared up at one of the few patches of blue sky he could see hoping the powers were listening to him along with a dozen of his comrades tealdo sheltered in a halfwrecked barn somewhere in southern unkerlant it was raining almost as hard inside the barn as it was outside tealdo and trasone held a cloak above captain galafrone to keep water from dripping down onto the map the company commander was examining to try to figure out just where they were curse me if i know why im bothering galafrone growled this miserable thing lies more often than it tells the truth trasone pointed to a line printed in red sir isnt that the highway thats what the map says galafrone answered i saw unkerlanter roads during the six years war but i thought they might have got better since they were supposed to have got better since but the stinking highway is just another dirt track huzzah for swemmels efficiency mud track now trasone said his legs like everyone elses were mud to the knees and beyond tealdo said maybe swemmels efficient after all hard for us to go very far very fast if we bog down every step we take galafrone gave him a sour look if thats a joke its not funny i didnt mean it for a joke sir tealdo said i meant it for the truth they have as much trouble in this slop as we do trasone said what if they do tealdo answered theyre not trying to go forward right now or not so much theyre only trying to hold us back that produced a gloomy silence at last captain galafrone said weve got em by the ears and weve got em by the tail cant very well let go now can we he bent closer to the map then swore ill be cursed if i dont need spectacles to read the fornicating letters when theyre printed that fornicating small where in blazes is the town called tannroda trasone and tealdo both peered at the maprather awkwardly since they had to keep holding the cloak over it tealdo spotted the place first he pointed with his free hand there sir ah galafrones grunt held more weariness than satisfaction my thanks northwest is it well that makes a deal of senseits in the direction of cottbus once we take his capital away from him king swemmel wont be so much of a much he folded up the map and put it back in his belt pouch come on boys weve got to get moving the unkerlanters wont wait for us maybe theyve all drowned in the mud trasone said dont i wish galafrone grunted again for the first time since the veteran had taken command of the company tealdo thought he saw his years telling on him galafrone made himself rally its too much to hope for and you know it as well as i do if we dont shift em they wont get shifted maybe the yaninans can do the job tealdo said slyly as galafrone started toward the open barn door the captain stopped and gave him a baleful look i wouldnt pay you a counterfeit copper for a whole army of those chicken thieves they think were supposed to do the fighting while they steal anything that isnt spiked down only thing theyre good for is holding down quiet stretches of the lineand theyre not much good for that either come on weve wasted too much time here out they went the rain was still coming down hard tealdo felt as if hed been slapped in the face with a wet towel more bedraggled algarvians emerged from the farmhouse which had taken an even worse beating than the barn still others were resting in haystacks and under trees like tealdo they all squelched forward toward tannroda and somewhere beyond it cottbus every step was an effort tealdo like most of the company stayed on what was called the highway for lack of a suitably malodorous word others insisted moving through the fields to either side was easier it probably didnt make much difference one way or the other mud was mud they slogged past a leyline caravan whose forwardmost several cars no longer floated above the ground but lay on it canted at drunken angles the algarvian soldiers whod been riding in those cars now stood around in the mudexcept for the ones who lay in it hurt when the caravan went awry poor dears tealdo said theyll get wet trasones laughter had a nasty edge they look like new menprobably never saw an unkerlanter in all their born days theyve been drinking wine and pinching pretty girls back in algarve while weve had to go out and work for a living whoresons might as well find out what its like over here he spat into the muck the drumming rain drowned his spittle they hadnt gone much farther before the reason the caravan had come to grief became obvious three or four algarvian mages stood around and in a large hole in the ground that was rapidly turning into a pond a colonel shouted at them hurry up and fix the damage to this ley line powers below eat you all i have men to move and how am i supposed to move them with the line broken he stamped his booted foot which only made it sink into the soggy ground try walking tealdo called confident the rain would cloak him and sure enough the colonel whirled in his direction but couldnt pick him out from among the other vague dripping shapes in any case the officer was more concerned with the mages and they with him one of them said my lord colonel the egg the cursed unkerlanters buried and then burst did too good a job of wrecking the line for us to repair it right away it wasnt meant to try to absorb so much energy all at once and the unkerlanters use different spells from ours to maintain the lineand theyve done their best to obscure those too itll be awhile before youre gliding again how long awhile the colonel ground out before answering the mage put his head together with his colleagues a day certainly he said then maybe two two the colonel yelped he waved his arms and stamped his foot again and loosed some extravagant curses as any algarvian might have none of that did him any good being under his command the mages had to try to soothe him instead of telling him what they thought of him which tealdo knew he would have wanted to do had he been in their place come on galafrone said they may be stuck but were notquite on the footsoldiers went leaving the sabotaged ley line behind them after another mile or so the road became an even worse bog than it had been dragging himself out of the ooze tealdo discovered the going was betternot good nowhere close to good but betterin the field to one side something else is buggered up ahead trasone predicted you wait and seewell find out what it is theyd gone only a little farther when the wideshouldered bruiser proved himself a good prophet there ahead were half a dozen behemoths stuck bellydeep in the clinging mud hurrah tealdo said first they ruined the road for us then they went and ruined it for themselves too theyre in so deep theyre liable to drown there trasone said one of the trapped behemoths evidently thought the same for it lifted its head and let out a loud frightened bellow it thrashed in the mud trying to get free but succeeded only in miring itself even worse there precious there one of the behemothriders was down in the mud with the beast doing his best to keep it calm tealdo would not have wanted that fellows job not for anything the behemoths crews had already done everything they could to lighten their animals stripping off not only eggtossers and heavy sticks but also the chainmail coats the behemoths wore as far as tealdo could tell none of that had done much good a troop of algarvian horsemen rode up across the field not having been churned by the behemoths the ground there held their weight better than the alleged road would have the horsemen had ropes with them the men who rode the lead behemoth began making lines fast to their beast do they really think theyll be able to pull him out tealdo asked if they dont theyre going to a cursed lot of trouble for nothing trasone answered tealdo hadnt the faintest idea how to go about putting ropes around a behemoth to get it out of the mud unlike him though the men who rode the great animals looked to have considered the problem before for they went about the business as matteroffactly as he would have built a fire go a behemothrider shouted to the horsemen they urged their animals forward but could not move the heavy behemoth go the rider shouted again the horses had no better luck the second time the behemothrider threw up his arms in despair then his eye fell on the men of captain galafrones company slogging past lay hold of the ropes and lend a hand will you he askedbegged actually had he tried to order galafrones soldiers to help tealdo was sure the company commander would have consigned him to the powers below as things were galafrone said nothing but ayeneeds doing and ordered his men to the ropes with a company of soldiers adding their strength to that of the horses the behemoth came up ever so slowly out of the clinging mud the men who rode him cheered themselves hoarse then they fastened the ropes to the next behemoth so that the footsoldiers and horses could pull him free too getting all six of the great beasts out of the ooze took all day and by the time the dripping sky began to darken tealdo was more worn than he had been after any battle in which hed ever fought too weary to eat he wrapped his blanket around himself lay down not far from where hed labored so hard and slept like a dead man someone kicked him awake not unkindly at dawn the next day a field kitchen had found the company sometime in the night he wolfed down a couple of bowls of hot barley porridge with bits of unidentified meat floating in it in his civilized days he would have turned up his nose at such coarse fare now it brought him back to life he resumed the long tramp westward with more spirit than he would have thought possible before he ate were going to be late to tannroda galafrone muttered discontentedly powers above were already late to tannroda when they got to the town it didnt seem worth reaching the unkerlanters must have fought hard there it looked as if a giant had set it afire and then stamped out the flames with his feet a military constable asked galafrone to which regiment his men belonged the captain told him looking apprehensive but the fellow just nodded and said youre only the third company throughthis wretched weather is playing hob with everyone use the northwest roadthat one there the unkerlanters curse em are mounting another counterattack i thought king swemmel was supposed to be running short of men by now tealdo said as he and his comrades slogged on to try to throw the unkerlanters back yet again youve been in the army awhile now trasone answered dont you know better than to believe everything you hear yet tealdo pondered grunted nodded and kept marching tired as usual after a long days labor leofsig made his way through the streets of gromheort back toward his home he stepped carefully the pavement was wet and slippery from a shower that had passed through earlier in the afternoon he was wet from the shower too which meant he was a little less filthy than on most days he thought about heading for the baths but decided not to bother the sooner he got home the sooner he could eat and sleep nobody was as clean as in the days before the war hed got more than halfway home before he noticed the new broadsheet pasted to walls and fences and trees the algarvians had put it up of coursethe penally for a forthwegian putting up a broadsheet was death and the penalty for a kaunian probably something worse but regardless of whether the algarvians had put it up it showed the tough jowly image of bung plegmund arguably forthwegs greatest ruler and a troop of hardlooking soldiers carrying spears and bows and dressed in the styles of four hundred years before plegmund smashed the unkerlanters read the legend below the illustration you can too join plegmunds brigade beat back barbarism smaller letters gave the address of the recruiting station and also warned no kaunians will be accepted into this brigade with a snort leofsig walked on he had a hard time imagining kaunians wanting to join a brigade under the control of people intent on grinding their noses in the dirt for that matter he had a hard time imagining forthwegians wanting to join a brigade under algarvian control who would do such a daft thing somebody one jump ahead of the constables maybe he wished the algarvians joy of trying to make such recruits into soldiers a blond woman about his own age stepped out from between a couple of buildings as he went by sleep with me she called doing her best to make her voice alluring her tunic and trousers clung so tightly they might have been painted onto her leofsig started to shake his head and walk on then to his dismay he realized he recognized her youre doldasai he blurted my father used to cast books for yours as soon as the words left his mouth he wished he had them back better for both of them if hed pretended he didnt know her and gone on his way too late for that now she hung her head she must have wished hed kept his mouth shut too you see my shame she said if she remembered leofsigs name she didnt want to use it you see my peoples shame im sorry he said which was true and useless at the same time do you know the worst of it doldasai said the worst of it is you can still have me if you pay me i need the silver my whole family needs the silver and the algarvians wont let any of us make it any other way nasty promises glowed in her bluegray eyes promises of things he hadnt done perhaps of things hed scarcely imagined and he was tempted and hated himself for being tempted when he still hoped felgilde would let him slip his hand under her tunicshe hadnt yetwhy wouldnt he have been tempted to find out what all hed been missing of itself his hand slid toward his belt pouch doldasai made a peculiar noise half bitter mirth half disappointment leofsig gave her a couple of coins here take this he said i wish i could afford to give you more i dont want anything from you that wasnt quite true but it kept things simpler she stared down at the small silver coins then abruptly turned her back on him curse you she said her voice thick and muffled i didnt think anyone could make my cry any more not after everything ive had to do go on leofsigshe knew who he was all rightand if the powers above are kind well never see each other again he wanted to help her with something more than a little money for the life of him though he couldnt think of what he might do and so ingloriously he left he didnt look back over his shoulder either for fear he would see doldasai propositioning some other forthwegian who might part with cash for a few minutes pleasure you made good time coming home elfryth remarked as she unbarred the front door to let him in did i he said not wanting to tell his mother hed fled doldasai as the forthwegian army had ended up fleeing the algarvians aye you did to his relief his mother didnt seem to notice any false note in his voice you have time to wash a littlewhich meant he remained rank in spite of the rain showerand drink a glass of wine before supper conberge even came up with some meat to mix in with the peas and beans and pulses what kind of meat leofsig asked suspiciously roof rabbit he meowed elfryth shook her head the butcher called it mutton but i think its got to be goat its been in the pot for hours and it isnt close to tender yet but even tough meat is better than no meat at all leofsig couldnt argue with her he wondered how long it had been since doldasai and her family had eaten meat his family was going through hard times hers was going through catastrophe he grabbed a towel off the rack and went off to use the pitcher and basin in his room it wouldnt be a bath but would be better than nothing ealstan looked up from a page of work not problems from their father for once but verses of a poem why the grim face leofsigs younger brother asked i didnt know i had one leofsig answered as he started to wash well you do ealstan said how come do you want to know why leofsig considered ealstan wasnt a baby anymore ill tell you why i ran into daukantis daughter coming homeremember the oliveoil merchant he told the tale in a few words ealstan clicked his tongue between his teeth thats hard he said ive heard other stories like it but not anybody we know you ought to tell fatherif anyone can do anything for them he can aye thats so leofsig said through the towel he was using to dry his face he looked over it at his brother its a good idea in fact youre getting a mans wits faster than i did i think living under the redheads pushes everybody along fasterexcept for the people it pushes under like the kaunians ealstan said did you see the broadsheet for what the algarvians are calling plegmunds brigade aye i saw it youd have to be blind not to see it theyve slapped up enough copies leofsig answered disgusting if you ask me well i think so too but sidroc says hes dead keen on joining ealstan held up a hand before leofsig could burst like an egg i dont think he loves mezentio i think he just wants to go out there and kill something and this would give him the chance what do father and uncle hengist have to say about it leofsig asked uncle hengist was shouting at him just before you got here ealstan said he thinks sidrocs flown out of his bush father hasnt said anything that i know of maybe he figures sidroc is hengists worry with practicality so coldblooded it alarmed even him leofsig said maybe he ought to join plegmunds brigade if hes off marching on cottbus he cant very well tell the algarvian constables here that i broke out of the captives camp his brother looked horrified before ealstan could say anything conberge came by in the courtyard calling suppers ready ealstan hurried off to the dining room with transparent relief as leofsig followed he decided he was just as well pleased not to have that conversation go any further too whatever the meat in the stew was it wasnt mutton he knew it at the first bite it might have been goat for all he could prove it might have been mule or camel or behemoth it didnt taste spoiled hed had to choke down spoiled meat in the army and in the captives camp he wouldnt have taken felgilde to a fancy eatery to dine off this but it helped fill the enormous hole in his belly he kept glancing over at sidroc his cousin seemed as intent on eating as he was himself leofsig wondered if he really wanted sidroc to join the algarvians puppet force if sidroc joined of his own free will what could be wrong with that after a sip of wine leofsig s father turned to uncle hengist and remarked the news sheets talk about heavy fighting in the west aye hestan they do hengist said neither of them looked at sidroc hestan was less ostentatious about not looking at him than hengist was up until today hengist would probably have added some comment about how the algarvians were still moving forward in spite of the hard fighting now he just nodded still not looking at his son he wanted sidroc to think about what hard fighting meant the trouble with that was sidroc had never experienced it leofsig who had hoped he never did again in a musing voice hestan went on heavy fightings bound to mean a lot of men dead a lot of men hurt aye hengist said again again he said no more a couple of days before things would have been different sure enough sidroc spoke up a lot of unkerlanters stomped down into the mud too youd best believe that he glowered at hestan as if defying him to disagree but leofsigs father only nodded oh no doubt still would king mezentio want forthwegians to do his fighting for him if he werent running low on redheads if we dont show we can fight how will we ever get our kingdom back sidroc said if you ask me thats what plegmunds brigade is all about now no one else at the table wanted to look toward sidroc fighting is all very well leofsig said at last but you have to remember for whom youre fighting and against whom you ought to be fighting he didnt see how he could put it any more plainly than that ealstan found a way very quietly he asked cousin who killed your mother was it swemmels men or mezentios uncle hengist drew in a sharp breath sidroc stared in spite of everything he could doand he fought hardhis face began to work his eyes screwed shut he let out a great sob tears poured down his cheeks curse you ealstan he shouted in a griefchoked voice powers below eat you starting at the toes he sprang to his feet and ran blindly from the room a moment later the door to the bedchamber he shared with his father slammed in the silence enveloping the table leofsig could hear his weeping even through the thick oak portal leofsig leaned toward ealstan and murmured that was well done aye lad it was uncle hengist said he shook himself sometimes we lose track of what matters you did right to remind sidrocand me too ill own did i ealstan sounded not at all convinced aye son you did hestan said elfryth and conberge also nodded not even his familys reassurance seemed to persuade ealstan well its done and i cant change it he said with a sigh i just hope sidroc wont hate me in the morning the way he does now he was looking at leofsig leofsig started to ask why it mattered what sidroc thought but that answered itself if sidroc decided he really hated ealstan he was liable to decide he really hated leofsig too even if he also hated the algarvians who could guess what he might do in such a state i hope he wont too leofsig said six ealstan ate his porridge and gulped down his morning cup of wine he looked across the table at sidroc as he might have looked at an egg that had fallen from below a dragons belly but failed to burst sidroc ate stolidly eyes down on his bowl at last ealstan had to speak come on you know theyll thrash us if were late sidroc didnt say anything to that not at first ealstan cursed under his breath he stirred in his seat ready to head for his first class without his cousin maybe sidroc doesnt care if they break a switch on his back i do but just as he was gathering himself to go sidroc said im ready and got up himself they walked along in silence for a while every time ealstan spied the broadsheet proclaiming plegmunds brigade he pretended he hadnt sidroc must have seen the broadsheets too but he didnt say anything about them he strode toward the school with a set expression on his face that ealstan didnt like they had to pause to let a couple of companies of algarvian soldiers march past along a cross street remember how the day the duke of bari died we had to wait for our own cavalrymen ealstan asked that spilled the chamber pot into the soup all right we did didnt we sidroc said by the wondering look in his eye hed forgotten till ealstan reminded him then he scowled again and a whole lot of good our cavalrymen did us too fighting beside themhe pointed to the algarviansthatd be something theyre winners remember what my father said ealstan answered if they were doing as well as all that they wouldnt need the likes of us to help them sidroc had his sneer back if your father were half as smart as he thinks he is hed be twice as smart as he really is he knows numbers so he thinks he knows everything he doesnt you hear me i hear a lot of wind ealstan wanted to punch his cousin if he did though what would sidroc do getting into a brawl was one thing when all they could do was beat on each other it was something else again when sidroc could betray leofsig to the algarviansand ealstans father with him ealstans eyes slid toward sidroc again if i ever get the chance ill knock out one of your teeth for every time ive had to hold back then you can spend the rest of your days sipping supper through a straw they passed a couple of mushrooms pushing up through a gap between a couple of the slates of the sidewalk as any forthwegianor for that matter any kaunian who lived in forthwegwould have done ealstan slowed to eye them theyre just scrawny little worthless toadstools sidroc said like you if you are one you know one ealstan retorted boys had probably been saying that to one another since the days of the kaunian empire one glance at the mushrooms though told him that but for the insult sidroc was right he said pretty soon the ones worth having will start sprouting thats so and well all go off to the fields and the woods with baskets sidroc leered and maybe youll come home with that kaunian wenchs basket againor maybe youll stick your mushroom in her basket he guffawed one more tooth youll lose some day sidroc ealstan thought aloud he said shes not like that so why dont you drag your mind out of the latrine he did hope he would see vanai again and if she turned out to be a little bitonly the tiniest bit he assured himselflike that he didnt think hed mind by then they were very close to the school ealstan braced himself for another day of meaningless lessons putting up with his masters though would be a pleasure next to putting up with sidroc he endured the boredom when called on to recite he recited hed dutifully memorized all four assigned verses of the rather treacly poem from two hundred years before and delivered the first one without a bobble sidroc got called on for the third verse made a hash of it and got his back striped curse it he said as they went on to their next class i knew the first verse why didnt i get chosen in your place just luck ealstan answered hed known the third verse as well as the first so he wouldnt have minded getting called in sidrocs place with his cousin feeling abused and put upon he decided not to mention that sidroc got through the rest of the day without any more beatings which left him in a somewhat better mood as ealstan and he headed home ealstan on the other hand felt gloomier than he had in a while it must have shown on his face like a fire in the night for sidrochardly the most perceptive fellow ever bornasked him somebody go and steal your last bite of bread no ealstan said though the clichéd question for whats wrong had taken on a new and literal meaning in these hungry times in gromheort his wave encompassed the whole battered city its just thati dont knoweverything looks so shabby and broken and gray ive been thinking about how things were that day when we saw the forthwegian cavalry and how they are now and i keep wondering how anybody stands it what else can we do sidroc said they walked on a little farther sidroc kicked a small stone out of the way as he watched it spin off he went on maybe thats one of the reasons plegmunds brigade doesnt look so bad to me it would get me away fromthis his wave was as allembracing as ealstans had been ealstan found himself too surprised to answer he hadnt imagined sidroc could look so keenly at himself he also hadnt imagined his cousin might have such a sensibleseeming reason for thinking about fighting on king mezentios side as far as ealstan was concerned plegmunds brigade remained the wrong answer but now at least he understood the question sidroc was asking how can i escape had crossed his own mind too many times an algarvian constable threw up his hands to stop pedestrians and carts and riders halting he shouted in halting forthwegian weve got stuck going to and from today sidroc grumbled sounding more like his usual self ealstan nodded he hadnt been happy about waiting for his own kingdoms soldiers he was far less happy about having to wait for the conquerors troopers but this procession held only a few algarvians guards sticks at the ready most of the men who flowed past the intersection where ealstan and sidroc stood were unkerlanter captives as far as looks went there was little to distinguish them from forthwegians they were most of them dark and stocky and hooknosed and their beards were growing out which made them look even more like ealstans people sidroc shook his fist at them now you know what its like to have your kingdom overrun you thieves he shouted some of the unkerlanters looked at him as if they understood they might have the northeastern dialects of their language werent far from forthwegian most of them though kept shambling on their stubbly cheeks were hollow their eyes blank theyd enduredhow much however much it was they would have to endure more what do you suppose the redheads will do with themto them ealstan asked who cares the stinking backstabbers his cousin answered as far as im concerned the algarvians can cut their throats to make sticks or work whatever other magic with their life energy they care to he shook his fist at the unkerlanter captives they wont do that ealstan said if they do the unkerlanters will start cutting the throats of their algarvian captives and then where will we be back in the red days after the kaunian empire fell thats where if you ask me the unkerlanters deserve it sidroc drew his thumb across his own throat ealstan started to say something before he could sidroc went on if you ask me the redheads deserve it too powers below eat both sides ealstan pointed frantically toward the algarvian constable the redhead stood so close to them he couldnt have helped hearing but he didnt speak enough forthwegian to understand what they were saying the last few unkerlanter captives tramped past and the last couple of algarvian guards the constable gave a sweeping wave as if he were a noble graciously granting peasants a boon along with the rest of the forthwegians whod been waiting for the procession to pass ealstan and sidroc crossed the street why do you keep going on about plegmunds brigade if thats the way you feel about the redheads ealstan asked his cousin sidroc said i wouldnt be joining for the algarvians id be joining for me i cant see the difference ealstan said i bet you king mezentio wouldnt be able to see the difference either thats because youre a blockhead sidroc said if you want to tell me mezentios a blockhead too i wont argue with you i know what ill tell you ealstan said ill tell you im not the biggest blockhead here thats what sidroc mimed throwing a punch ealstan mimed ducking they both laughed they were still insulting each other but not the way they had been lately this was just schoolboys foolish talk not the sort of business that could poison things between them for years to come a little stretch of childishness felt good they hadnt stopped tossing insults around or laughing about it by the time they knocked on the door of ealstans house conberge unbarred it and stood in the entry hall looking from one of them to the other i think both of you stopped in a tavern on the way here she said and ealstan couldnt tell whether she was joking or not sidroc stepped up and breathed in her face no wine he declared no ale either conberge mimed reeling away no but when was the last time you cleaned your teeth she said considering how little love she bore for sidroc her voice should have had an edge had it borne one it would have wrecked the moment like a bursting egg somehow it didnt sidroc breathed in ealstans face not about to let his sister outdo him ealstan mimed falling over dead he and sidroc were laughing so hard they had to hold each other up conberge could no more help laughing too than she could help breathing a door opened across the street a neighbor stared at the three of them wondering what could be so funny in grim occupied gromheort ealstan wondered too but not enough to stop laughing maybe part of him sensed that this little glowing stretch couldnt last long no matter what the neighbor closed the door shaking her head that was funny too but then conberge who hadnt been quite so immersed in giggles as ealstan and sidroc said the two of you are later than you should be if you came straight home we did ealstan said really we had to wait for a bunch of unkerlanter captives to shuffle through the middle of town i suppose theyre on the way to a camp as soon as hed spoken he knew hed punctured the magic captives and camps didnt go with heedless laughter from out of the south a cloud rolled across the sun plunging the street into gloom ealstan wondered how he could have let himself be so silly even if only for a little while by sidrocs expression the same thought was in his mind ealstan sighed come on lets go in he said its getting chilly out here bembo did not like marching along a road roughly paved with cobblestones and other bits of rubble especially not when the cobbles and other bits of rubble were slick and wet with last nights rain if i slip and fall im liable to break my ankle the algarvian constable complained maybe youll break your neck instead oraste said helpfully that would make you shut up anyhow both of you can shut up sergeant pesaro growled we have a job to do and were going to do it thats all end of story he tramped along full of determination his big belly bouncing ahead of him at every stride and set a good pace for the squad of constables he led in a low voice bembo told oraste ive got silver that says hell be done in long before we get to this oyngestun place i know youre a fool the other constable answered but i didnt know you thought i was one too im not stupid enough to throw my money away on a bet like that they tramped past fields and almond and olive groves and little stands of woods here and there bembo saw forthwegians and kaunians sometimes in small groups but more often alone examining the ground and occasionally digging what are they doing he asked gathering mushrooms pesaro rolled his eyes they eat them thats disgusting bembo stuck out his tongue and made a horrible face none of the other constables argued with him after a moment he added its liable to be dangerous tooto us i mean they could be sneaking around doing anything at all while theyre pretending to go after mushrooms pesaro nodded then shrugged i know but what can you do the soldiers say these whoresonsd revolt if we tried to keep em inside their towns this time of year were stuck with a little troublei hope its a little troublebut we stay out of big trouble and we cant afford big trouble here right now weve got too much farther west ah trades like that made sense to bembo they were part of a constables life maybe we ought to make em pay to go out and hunt the cursed things the way you get a free one from a floozy now and then so you wont haul her in some sergeant would have pitched a fit to hear something like that pesaro only nodded again not a half bad idea maybe we ought to pass it on up the line anything we can squeeze out of this miserable place puts us that much further ahead of the game he walked on for another few paces then took off his hat and wiped at his sweaty forehead with his sleeve long miserable march bembo gave oraste an itoldyouso look oraste ignored him pesaro went on this big heavy stick doesnt make things any easier either he was right about that bembo had long since got sick and tired of the armystyle stick hed been issued for this assignment carrying it made his hand tired and his shoulder ache carrying it also worried him if his superiors didnt think a short stubby constabulary stick would be enough to keep him safe in oyngestun how much trouble was he liable to find there pesaro who had been slumping like suet on a hot summer day as the constables neared the village rallied just before they got into it straighten up there he barked at his men were not going to let these yokels catch us looking like something the cat dragged in show some spunk or youll be sorry bembo was already sorry from the feet up nevertheless he and his comrades did their best to enter oyngestun with proper algarvian swagger shoulders back heads up faces arrogant if they werent the masters of all they surveyed they acted as if they were as with any magic appearance could easily be made into reality oyngestuns forthwegians did their best to pretend the newly arrived constables did not exist most of the villages kaunians stayed behind closed doors that would not do pesaro shouted for whatever algarvian constables were already in oyngestun all three of them tumbled out pesaro handed the most senior one a scroll with his orders inscribed on it after the fellow had read it and nodded pesaro said turn out the kauniansall of emin the village square well help aye the constable quartered in oyngestun said as he handed pesaros orders back to him he added i see what youre doing but i dont see why you want to know the truth i dont see why either pesaro answered but they pay me on account of what i do not on account of why i do it come on lets get moving the sooner were done the sooner we can get out of this place and leave it to you and the cobwebs heh the seniormost constable in oyngestun said he couldnt very well quarrel with pesaro who outranked him and was following orders to boot instead he yelled at his own men while pesaro instructed the squad whod come with him from gromheort the instructions were simple they went through oyngestun especially the kaunian section on the west side of the village shouting kaunians come forth in classical kaunian in forthwegian and in algarvian depending on what they knew come forth to the village square and some kaunians did come forth some doors though remained closed bembo and oraste had picked up a stout length of timber and were about to break down one of those doors when a local constable called dont bother i know those buggers went out first thing this morning with a basket theyre even madder for nasty mushrooms than most folk round these parts whoever wrote our orders had his head up his backside bembo said how are we supposed to round up the stinking kaunians if theyre all running through the woods with baskets powers below eat me if i can tell you oraste said maybe theyll cook up some bad mushrooms and keel over dead the way king whatshisname in the story did when he ate bad fish serve em right if they did sure enough bembo agreed he walked to the next house pounded on the door and shouted kaunians come forth in what he thought was kaunian he was about to pound again when the door opened his eyebrows shot upwards behind him oraste let out a couple of short emphatic coughs hello sweetheart bembo said the girl standing in the doorway was about eighteen and very pretty she looked at him and oraste as if theyd crawled off a dungheap an older man appeared behind hera much older man his hair thinning and gone from gold to silver oraste laughed coarsely why the dog he said he looked the girl up and down aye a young wife with an old husband can have a baby as long as theres a handsome young fellow next door he laughed again and bembo with him this time then the old kaunian startled them both by speaking slow but very precise algarvian my granddaughter does not understand when you insult us but i do i do not know if this matters to you of course now what do you want with us bembo and oraste looked at each other bembo tried not to offend except on purpose roughly he said get along to the village square the both of you just do as youre told and everything will be fine the old man spoke in kaunian to his granddaughter she said something in the same language bembo couldnt make out what then they headed in the direction of the square on to the next house kaunians come forth this time oraste did the shouting after they had pounded on doors till they were good and sick of it the two constables went back to the village square themselves a couple of hundred kaunians milled about there talking in their own old old language and in forthwegian no doubt trying to figure out why theyd been summoned all at once bembo was glad to be carrying the fullsized highly visible military stick about which hed groused most of the way from gromheort the blonds he and his comrades had assembled badly outnumbered them they needed to see theyd pay if they started anything sergeant pesaro was looking around the square too is that all of them he asked all of them that werent out chasing mushrooms one of the constables said or hiding under the bed another added he pointed to a kaunian couple the woman was tying a rag around the mans bloodied head those whoresons there tried that but i caught em at it they wont get gay again i dont suppose all right pesaro turned to another constable translate for me evodio aye sergeant unlike his fellows evodio hadnt forgotten almost all the classical kaunian hed had rammed down his throat in school pesaro took a deep breath then spoke in a paradeground bellow kaunians of oyngestun the kingdom of algarve requires the services of forty of your number in the west to aid with your labor our victorious campaign against vile unkerlant laborers will be paid and will be well fed and housed so declares king mezentio men and women may serve algarve here children accompanying them will be well cared for he waited for evodio to finish translating the kaunians talked among themselves in low voices a man came forward after a moment a couple followed him a man and woman holding hands two or three more unaccompanied men came out pesaros frown was fearsome we require forty from this village if we do not have forty volunteers we will choose to make up the number as if oncue a leyline caravan pulled into oyngestun from the east pesaro pointed to it there is the caravan seethere are already kaunians in some of the cars a lot of kaunians in some of those cars bembo murmured to oraste theyre packed as tight as sardines in olive oil sardines are cheaper than olive oil oraste answered the cursed blonds are cheaper than space in caravan cars too he spat on the cobblestones three or four more kaunians stepped out of the crowd this wont do pesaro said shaking his head and setting hands on hips in theatrical dismay no this wont do at all in an aside to his own men he added hard to get this across when i cant do it in algarvian someone in the crowd of kaunians asked a question evodio translated she wants to know if they can bring anything with them when they go west pesaro shook his head just the clothes on their backs they wont need anything else well take care of them once theyre there another question this one from a man how long will we be there till the war is won of course pesaro said somebody shouted in his direction from the leyline caravan he scowled we havent got all day any more volunteers another pair of kaunians stepped forward pesaro sighed this isnt good enough weve got to have the full number he pointed to a man you he jerked his thumb a woman you another man you he pointed to the pair bembo and oraste had summoned youthe old hound and his young doxy aye both of you bembo said shes his granddaughter sergeant is she pesaro rubbed his chin all right never mind you two instead he pointed at a pair of middleaged men probably a couple of quiffs before long the selection was done under the sticks of the algarvian constables and the guards already aboard the chosen kaunians squeezed into the leyline caravan cars go home pesaro shouted to the rest of the blonds evodio translated for the ones who were dense the kaunians left the square a few at a time some of them sobbing for suddenly lost loves the caravan glided away theres a good days work done oraste said how much work do you think well get out of them hauled off the street like that bembo asked oraste gave him a pitying look one sergeant pesaro might have envied a lamp went on in bembos head oh its like that is it got to be oraste said and he was surely right nothing else made sense bembo was very quiet on the long tramp back to gromheort his conscience normally a quiet beast barked and snarled and whined at him by the time he got back to the barracks hed fought it down somebody far above him had decided this was the right thing to do who was he to argue tired as he was from marching he slept well that night autumn in jelgava except up in the mountains was not a time of great swings in the weather as it was in more southern lands people went from wearing linen tunics and cotton trousers to cotton tunics and trousers of wool or wool and cotton mixed talsus father had his business pick up a little as men and women bought replacements for what had worn out during the last cool season i need more cloth though traku grumbled thanks to the cursed algarvians i cant get as much as i could use theyre taking half of what we turn out for themselves everybody needs more of everything talsu said the redheads are stealing everything that isnt nailed down his father glowered this is what happens when a kingdom loses a war aye it is talsu agreed but powers above i wish youd get over the notion that i lost it all by myself i dont think that for a moment son traku said you had help lots of help starting with the king and going straight on down through your officers he did not bother to lower his voice in the old jelgava that would have been insanely dangerous but the algarvians didnt mind if the common people reviled king donalituon the contrary they didnt even seem to mind too much if the common people reviled them talsu wouldnt have wanted to try such tolerance too far though he was very pleased for a moment thinking his father didnt blame him for the kingdoms defeat after all then he listened again in his mind to what traku had said and realized he hadnt said anything of the sort all hed said was that traku hadnt been the only one who lost it before talsu could start the argument up again dustbunny trotted into the tailors shop tail held high and proud the small gray cat who had thus far managed not to become roof rabbit at the butchers shop carried in her mouth a large brown rat she dropped it at talsus feet then looked up at him with glowing green eyes waiting for the praise she knew she deserved talsu bent down and scratched her ears and told her what a brave puss she was she purred believing every word of it then she pushed the dead rat with her nose so it half covered one of his shoes traku laughed i think she expects it to go into the stew pot tonight maybe she does mischief kindled in talsus eyes he called up the stairs to the living quarters over the shop hey ausra come down here a minute what is it his sister called back present for you talsu answered he winked at his father and held a finger to his lips to keep traku from giving him the lie traku rolled his eyes but kept quiet a present for me ausra hurried down the stairs what is it who gave it to me where did he go so you think you have boys leaving you presents all the time do you talsu said relishing his joke more than ever well i have to tell you youre not quite right a little lady delivered this one and its all yours he brought his foot forward shying the rat in ausras direction she disappointed him instead of screaming or running off she picked up the rat by the tail called dustbunny and told her what a fine kitty she was then she tossed the deceased rodent back to talsu here if you liked it well enough to get it for me you can be the one who gets rid of it too now traku laughed loud and long talsu gave his father a dirty look but could hardly deny ausra had outdone him this time he picked up the rat rather more gingerly than she had carried it outside and dropped it in the gutter when he came back into the tailors shop he was wiping his hands on his trouser legs dustbunny spoke up in feline reproach maybe she really had thought the rat would make the main course at supper that night go catch me another one talsu told her well serve it up with onions and peas or maybe with olives i like olives a lot the cat cocked its head to one side as if contemplating the possible recipes then she meowed in approval and departed with purposeful stride if you want rat with peas and onions you can cook it yourself ausra told talsu she waved a finger at him and if you try doing this to mother shell make you cook it and shell make you eat it too since talsu thought his sister was right he didnt answer he hoped dustbunny wouldnt come back with another rat too soon if she did ausra was liable to have some unfortunate ideas about what to do with it before he could take that worrisome thought any further someone came through the door he started to put on the automatic smile of greeting he gave any customer so did traku so did ausra the shop did not have so many customers as to let them omit any courtesy no matter how small even so the smile froze half formed on talsus face his father and sister also looked as much stunned as welcoming the man standing before them wore tunic and kilt not tunic and trousers his coppery hair streamed out from under his hat his mustache was waxed out to needlesharp spikes a little vertical strip of hairnot really a beardran up the center of his chin he was in short an algarvian hello a good day to you all he said in accented but understandable jelgavan he swept off that hat bowed to traku bowed to talsu and bowed more deeply to ausra slower than he should have traku answered good day talsu was contentmore than content relievedto let his father do the talking this is the shop of a tailor is it not so the redhead said he was talsu saw by his rank badges a captain that no doubt meant he was a noble coming out and telling him to take his business elsewhere was bound to cause trouble traku must have reached the same unhappy conclusion aye it is he admitted excellent the algarvian sounded as delighted as if talsus father had told him he was about to win his weight in gold his eyes green as dustbunnys sparkled with glee algarvians talsu thought were funny people the fellow went on for i require the services of a tailor i would not come here for a cabinetmaker is it not so he thought he was the funniest fellow around you want me to make clothes for you traku sounded as if he didnt believe it or even more as if he didnt want to believe it but the algarvian nodded you understand he cried and bowed again you are you must be a man of great understanding you will make for me a set of clothes i will pay you and all will be well talsu doubted that last so evidently did his father who said what kind of clothes sir how much will you pay me sir when will you want them sir you do not trust me the algarvian sounded as if that had never crossed his mind after a shrug suggesting the world was a crueler place than hed imagined he went on i want a good wool tunic and kilt in civilian style to wear for the coming winter i will pay you silver the price we agree by dickering in the coin of either king donalitu or king mainardoboth circulate at par they shouldnt traku said mainardos coins are lighter by law they are at par the captain said talsus father kept quiet he was a formidable man in a haggle as talsu knew talsu also knew his father had never made a kilt in his life traku didnt let on about that either he just waited at last the algarvian threw his hands in the air all right all right i will pay in donalitus coin or in silver by weight to match the price in donalitus coin there are you happy now happy no sir i havent got a lot to be happy about traku shook his head but fairs fair now then if we come to a priceand youll pay me half beforehand and half when you get the clotheswhen will you need this outfit ten days the algarvian said and traku nodded that much at least proved easy the redhead went on price will depend on the cloth is it not so traku nodded again wool you said i can show you some samples if you care to take a look youll have to tell me how long youll want the kilt and how full and how many pleats and how deep that will let me know how much material ill need aye i understand the algarvian waggled a finger at traku you are not to change for cheaper goods afterwards mind trakus father glared at him if you think id do that youd better find yourself another tailor im not the only one in skrunda talsu knew how much traku needed the business but traku said not a word about what he needed talsu was proud of him let me see your samples the algarvian captain said presently he pointed to one this weight and grade in a forest green can you get it i think so traku answered if i cant you get your halfpayment back of course he turned to talsu measure him son then well talk about the kilthe muttered something that might have been barbarous garment under his breathand then well talk price the algarvian inclined his head talsu grabbed the tape measure the redhead stood very still while he measured and took notes only after hed finished did the fellow raise an eyebrow and remark i think you would sooner be measuring me for a coffin is it not so i didnt say that sir talsu answered and gave the notes to his father traku and the redhead talked about the kilt its length its drape its pleating traku looked up at the ceiling and mumbled to himself when he got done calculating he named a price the algarvian screamed as if hed been scaldedtalsu and ausra both jumped while the fur on dustbunnys tail puffed up in alarm then the algarvian named a price too one less than half as high nice talking with you traku said close the door after you go out they haggled for the best part of an hour traku ended up getting what struck talsu as a good price despite noisy histrionics the algarvian yielded ground more readily than the tailor the redhead was muttering to himself when he did leave forest green traku said i think i can get that i ought to short him on the goods though just on account of that crack he did get the cloth in the right color and the proper weight then set to work the tunic was straightforward it had a higher tighter collar than jelgavan fashion favored but presented no new problems for the kilt traku worked much more carefully after hed made the waistband and hemmed the garment he sewed two pleats by hand then sweating with concentration he set thread along the kilt where the other pleats would go and used a tailoring spell based on the law of similarity talsu watched in fascination as the rest of the pleats formed duplicating the first two in spacing and stitchery traku held up the finished kilt with a somber sort of pride readytowear cant come close to a good tailors work he said the big makers use cheap originals and they stretch the spells too thin so the clothes they make arent even properly similar to the originals he sighed but theyre cheap so what can you do when the algarvian captain came in to try on his outfit he kissed his fingertips he blew a kiss at ausra and for a horrid moment talsu thought he and traku were going to get kissed too but the redhead restrained himself at least from that he paid the second half of the price and left the shop a happy man good thing he liked it traku said after hed gone if he didnt what in blazes would i do with a cursed kilt sell it to another algarvian talsu said at once his father blinked maybe that hadnt occurred to him aye i suppose so he said i wouldnt get as much for it though talsu rang coins on the counter the music was sweet you dont need to worry we dont need to worry he checked himself we dont need to worry for a little while anyhow vanai was glad to be out of the house she shared with her grandfather and even gladder to be out of oyngestun with so many kaunians shipped off to the west to labor for the redheads in the war against unkerlant the village felt as if it had a hole in it like a jaw with a newly pulled tooth she and brivibas might have been among those taken for labor remembering what a few days of work on the roads had done to her grandfather vanai knew she was lucky to escape she also remembered all too well the price shed paid to get brivibas back from the labor gang she had no great love for the unkerlantersthey struck her as being even more barbarous than their forthwegian cousinsbut she hoped with all her heart that they gave major spinello a thin time of it meanwhile she had mushrooms to find with rain coming a little early this year she thought the crop would be fine and at last shed persuaded her grandfather to let her search by herself that had proved easier than shed thought it would he didnt cling to her as he had before she gave spinello what he wanted and so while brivibas went south vanai headed east in the direction of gromheort when they separated her grandfather coughed a couple of times as if to say he knew why she was going in that direction she almost walloped him with the mushroom basket she was carrying before she swung it though she noticed it was the one that belonged to ealstan the forthwegian from gromheort brivibas would surely have noticed too and would have taken a certain satisfaction in being proved right in his suspicions but hes not right vanai saidmost emphatically as if someone were about to contradict her he doesnt know what hes talking about he never knows what hes talking about a troop of algarvians on unicorns came trotting up the road from gromheort toward oyngestun the redheaded riders leered at vanai they whooped as they passed her and called out lewd suggestions some of which she understood because of spinello she breathed a silent sigh of relief when they kept on riding had they decided to ravish her one after another and then cut her throat who could have stopped them she knew the answer to that no one they were the occupiers the conquerors they did as they pleased along with sighing in relief vanai cut across fields instead of staying close by the road the going was harder that way and her shoes soon got wet and muddy she didnt care the next algarvians who came along the highwaythree crews mounted on their behemothscould have seen her as nothing more than a blondheaded speck in the distance not one of them waved or called out to her that suited her fine she came across a nice patch of meadow mushrooms and put some in her basketealstans basket actuallyto make sure she wouldnt go back to oyngestun emptyhanded a little later she clapped her hands in glee when she found some chanterelles yellow and vermilion growing together she like the yellow ones bettervermilion chanterelles tasted acrid to herbut gathered some of each and then at the edge of an almond grove she almost stepped on some bright orange imperial mushrooms they were still small but unmistakable because of their color as she plucked them from the ground she recited a snatch of ancient poetry theyd been favorites back in the days of the kaunian empire but her pleasure at picking them evaporated a moment later the mushrooms remained but the kaunian empire was only rubble even the kaunian kingdoms of the east had fallen into the algarvians hands these days and as for forthweg the forthwegian majority despised the kaunians still living among them and the algarvians delighted in showing the forthwegians the kaunians were even worse off than they after vanai discovered the imperial mushrooms she had no luck for quite a while she saw three or four forthwegian men down on their hands and knees in the middle of a field but did not go over to them they were unlikely to be willing to share whatever theyd found and not so unlikely to try to make sport with her as the algarvians might have done she put some bushes between herself and them and went on her way the sun was nearing its high point in the north when she came into the oak wood where she and ealstan had accidentally exchanged basketsand where theyd met the year before that too with her grandfather miles away she could at last admit to herself that she hadnt come there altogether by accident for one thing she did want to give him his basket if she saw him again and for another hed been a sympathetic ear and she hadnt had many of those lately she walked among the trees her muddy shoes scuffed through leaves and acorns some of the oaks gnarled roots lay close to the surface she wondered if she ought to try digging for truffles in the days of the kaunian empire rich nobles had trained swine to hunt the precious fungi by scent without such aid though finding them was a matter of blind luck she shook her headshe didnt have time to waste and not much in the way of luck had come her way lately she wandered through the wood finding a couple of puffballs which she picked and quite a few stinkhorns which she avoided with wrinkled nose she saw no sign of ealstan she wondered if he was out hunting mushrooms at all for all she knew he could have been back in gromheort or out searching in a different direction it wasnt as if she could make him step out from behind a tree by wishing no sooner had that thought crossed her mind than ealstan stepped out from behind a treenot the one shed been looking at but a tree nonetheless her eyes widened had she turned into a mage after all if ealstan had been conjured up he didnt realize it vanai he exclaimed a grin stretching itself across his face instead of using forthwegian he went on in his slow careful kaunian i had hoped i would see you here i am very glad to see you here and looki remembered your basket he held it up vanai laughed she did that so seldom these days each time stood out as an occasion i remembered yours too she said and showed it to him now my family can wonder at me if i bring back my own basket as they did when i brought back yours last year ealstan said with a chuckle but the good humor quickly slipped from his face i am very glad to see you here again he repeated the algarvians took many kaunians out of gromheort and sent them west i was afraid they had done the same in oyngestun they did vanai answered but my grandfather and i were not among them she remembered how close theyd come to being chosen for his sake im glad he couldnt have done the work shed seen he couldnt do it that made her think of spinello again and then wish she hadnt in gromheort they did not seem to care ealstan said they scooped up young and old men and women till they had enough to satisfy them then they herded them into caravan cars and sent them west with only the clothes on their backs how can they hope to get any proper work from anyone like that i dont know vanai answered in a small voice ive asked myself the same question but i just dont know i think they are lying about what they want i think they are doing something ealstan shook his head i do not know what something they do not want to talk about something that cannot be good he kept on using kaunian because it was not his birthspeech he paused every now and then to search for a word or an ending to vanai that deliberation made him sound more impressive not less and he sounded more impressive still because he obviously did care about what happened to the kaunians in gromheort and oyngestun vanai wasnt used to sympathy from forthwegians vanai lately wasnt used to sympathy from anybody though her own people were less harsh to her now than when spinello had been visiting brivibas rather than her tears stung her eyes she looked away so ealstan wouldnt see thank you she whispered for what he saidshed startled him into forthwegian how was she supposed to answer that for worrying about my folk when you dont have to she said at last most people these days have all they can do to worry about themselves if i do not worry about anyone else who will worry about me ealstan said returning to kaunian when you speak my language you sound like a philosopher vanai said she meant his delivery as much as what he said whatever she meant she made him laugh she laughed too but persisted no you truly do to emphasize the point she reached out with her free hand and took his only after shed done it did she realize shed astonished herself since spinello began taking advantage of her she hadnt wanted anyone male even her grandfather to touch her and now shed touched ealstan of her own accord his hand closed on hers that was almost enough to make her pull awayalmost but not quite even if she didnt finish the motion though she must have begun it for he let go at once saying you must have enough things to worry about without putting a forthwegian you scarcely know on the list vanai stared at him they were much of a height as was often true of kaunian women and forthwegian men slowly she said you care what i think by the way she said it she might have been announcing some astonishing discovery in magecraft he heard her surprise well of course i do he said surprised in turn plainly he meant it having been used and scorned and condescended to so much vanai hardly knew what to make of caring she astonished herself again this time by leaning forward and brushing her lips across ealstans he wasnt too swarthy to keep her from watching him flush something sparked in his eyes he wants me she thought seeing that should have disgusted her it always had with spinello somehow it didnt at first she thought that was because ealstan didnt forthwith try to grope her as spinello would have then belatedly she realized the warmth inside her had nothing to do with the weather which was on the chilly side iwant him she thought and that was most astonishing of all shed been sure spinello had curdled desire within her forever vanai ealstan said in a hoarse voice she nodded and much later than she should have set down her basket of mushrooms it will be all right she said not pretending she didnt know what he had in mind then she found something better to add well make it come out all right and in spite of everything they did it was clearly ealstans first time had it been vanais too it probably would have ended up a clumsy botch as things were what spinello had made her learn came in handy in ways she hoped the redhead would not have appreciated she guided ealstan without being too obvious about it but after a while she began to enjoy what they were doing for its own sake ealstan didnt come close to spinello as far as technique went maybe he never would it turned out not to matter too much the algarvians touch no matter how knowingperhaps because it was so knowinghad always made her want to cringe ealstan cared for her as vanai not as a nicely shaped piece of meat that made all the difference how much difference it made she discovered when she gasped and arched her back and squeezed ealstan tight with arms and legs major spinello utterly forgotten ealstan stared down into vanais face only a hands breadth below his own his heart thudded as if hed just run a long way next to the delight that filled him the pleasure hed got from touching himself hardly seemed worth remembering he started to lean down to taste the sweetness of her lips again but she said youre not as light as you think you are and wed better get dressed before somebody whos looking for mushrooms comes along and finds us instead oh ealstan exclaimed hed forgotten about that and was glad vanai hadnt he scrambled to his feet yanked up his drawers and threw on his tunic vanais clothes were more complicated but she got into them about as fast as he did turn around she told him and brushed leaves off him then she nodded no stains on your tunic thats good now you take care of me aye ealstan said despite what theyd just finished doing he hardly dared touch her warily he picked bits of dry leaf from her hair even more warily he brushed some from her backside instead of slapping him she smiled thanks over her shoulder your clothes are all right he told her thats good she said again slowly her smile faded i didnt come here expecting to do this the expression her face took on alarmed ealstan it would have alarmed him more had he thought it aimed at him i did not either he said which was nothing but the truth he might have imagined it once or twice but hed told himself he was being foolish he felt foolish now delightfully foolish as if hed had too much wine trying not to wear an idiotic grin he went on i did hope i would see you though speaking kaunian helped it made him sound serious even if he wasnt vanais face softened i know you brought my basket she looked down at the dead leaves on the ground and i brought yours ealstan felt like cutting capers instead very much his practical fathers son he said shall we trade some of what we have found as long as they were doing that she wouldnt go away he didnt want her to go away they sat down where theyd lain together sat down and swapped mushrooms they sat very close together their hands clung as they passed the mushrooms back and forth every so often they paused to kiss ealstan discovered how quickly desire revived at his age but when he reached for one of the toggles on her tunic she set her hand on his and kept him from undoing it we were lucky once she said i dont know if we would be again all right he said it wasnt quite but he would make the best of it he took his hand away vanais face showed hed passed a test shall we take back our old baskets he asked and then answered his own question before vanai could no we had better not that would tell people we had met this way no one has to know anythingno one except us aye youre right better if we dont vanai agreed she studied him its good you think of things like that he shrugged pleased and embarrassed at the same time i do my best he said and again had no idea how much he sounded like hestan he looked at vanai regardless of what theyd just done they hardly knew each other he coughed i do want to see you again though before next mushroom season he hoped that didnt sound too much like i want to lie with you again as soon as i can he did but that wasnt what he meant or wasnt all of what he meant anyhow i want to see you again too vanai said and once more ealstan had all he could do to keep from jumping up and turning handsprings she went on tomorrow is market day so i dont think i can get away but i can come here the day after his heart leapedand then fell my schoolmasters will beat me he said glumly the ones not out gathering mushrooms themselves at any rate he could think the switchings he got worthwhile as long as he lay in vanais armsbut not he feared very long afterwards to his relief he saw his unwillingness to drop everything for her sake hadnt offended her instead she was nodding you have a head on your shoulders she remarked anyone who knew him would have said the same but she didnt not yet not with the mind as well as the body out beyond the oak grove someone called to someone else it wasnt aimed at either ealstan or vanai but both their heads came up in alarm nervously ealstan asked did your grandfather come hunting mushrooms with you brivibas that was the old mans name if ealstan had to be polite in a hurry he could but vanai shook her head no hes searching by himself her voice went cold and distant she hadnt talked about her grandfather like that before something must have happened between them ealstan wondered what he saw no way to ask vanai found a question of her own what about your cousinsidroc shed remembered things about ealstan too he felt outrageously flattered he went off to the north awhile ago we are supposed to meet back at the city gate at sunset ealstan leaned over and kissed vanai she clung to him the kiss went on and on they started to lie back on the leaves again but whoever was outside the little wood called out again louder and closer this time we had better not take the chance ealstan said and heard the regret in his own voice youre right vanai slipped out of his embrace and got to her feet you can send me letters if you like i live on the street of tinkers in oyngestun ealstan nodded eagerly and i live on the avenue of countess hereswith back in gromheort i willwrite to you good vanai nodded too my grandfather will wonder when i start getting letters from gromheort but i dont much care what my grandfather wonders not any more something had indeed happened between her and brivibas maybe she would tell him what in a letter i had better go he said though he didnt want to leave her but she nodded once more and i she said and then as an afterthought i will address my letters to you in forthwegian i wouldnt want to put you in danger by letting anyone know youre friendly to kaunians he was grateful and ashamed of himself for being grateful if i can do anything for youor for your grandfather he remembered to add let me know my father is not a man without influence i thank you vanai said but would he use that influence for the cursed blonds she didnt try to hide her bitterness aye ealstan said and nothing more he saw hed startled her well she said if hes your father perhaps he would he will ealstan said though he didnt know if hestans influence reached toioyngestun and so will i he had no influence at all and did know that but he would have promised vanai anything just then by the way her eyes shone she believed him too or at least was glad hed said what he had ealstan kissed her one last time then started back to gromheort he kept looking over his shoulder at vanai and almost walked into a goodsized oak feeling silly he waved to her she was looking over her shoulder too and waved to him only when they couldnt see each other any more did ealstan turn forward and walk straight as he walked he wondered what to say to sidroc he laughed the easiest thing might be to tell his cousin the truth sidroc would surely call him a liar but what sidroc would call vanai didnt bear thinking of hed been making lewd jokes about her since the day ealstan met her now shed given herself to ealstan without hesitation by everything people in forthwegforthwegians and kaunians alikesaid that made her a slut almost as much a slut as the kaunian girl whod tried to get leofsig to go to bed with her for money but it wasnt like that ealstan said as if someone had declared it was whatever had brought vanai into his arms he got the idea that raw lust was only a small part of it loneliness and a desire to escape if only for a little while had probably played bigger parts that didnt flatter him but flattery wasnt so important to him seeing clearly counted for more and calling daukantis daughter a slut wasnt easy either not when the algarvians had left her with the choice between whoring and starving from the height of his seventeen years ealstan saw that the older he got the less the world looked like the things everybody said he hoped the redheads hadnt swept up the oil merchants daughter he couldnt remember her name though leofsig had mentioned it when they gathered laborers in gromheort something was strange there though he couldnt see what but had the algarvians only been after laborers they would have chosen differently and let the kaunians they did choose bring along more than they had he shrugged he couldnt do anything about that his features softened as his thoughts returned to what he and vanai had done he spent most of the walk back to gromheort trying to fix in his memory every kiss every murmured endearment every caress every caress every incredible sensation remembering wasnt as good as lying down with her again but it was all he could do now gromheorts gray stone wall loomed higher and higher as he neared the city behind the wall the sky was gray too gray as lead it looked as if it would rain again soon autumn was shaping up as wet and nasty which meant winter probably would be too he wondered if it would snow that didnt happen every year not this far north someone standing by the wall waved ealstan squinted aye that was sidroc ealstan waved too and tried to bring his mind back from vanai to mushrooms sidroc came toward him he pointed to the basket ealstan was carrying ha he said thats the one you brought home last year not yours didnt run into the little kaunian bitch this time eh too bad for you you might have had a good time the only thing that let ealstan get through was having been sure sidroc would make some such crack no i didnt see her he answered hoping he sounded casual even if i had wed have just traded some mushrooms that would have been true the year before it wasnt any more sidroc gestured derisively shes got to be sweet for you ealstan he said powers above if id found her out there in the woods id have got her trousers down faster than you could say king offa in your dreams ealstan said aye sidroc grabbed his own crotch in my wet dreams ealstan managed to laugh at that which seemed to convince sidroc nothing unusual had happened out in the oak grove sidroc chaffed him as they went into gromheort but not too hard they both chaffed the algarvian constable at the gate when the fellow looked disgusted at the baskets of mushrooms they showed him more for us ealstan said to sidroc the constable must have spoken some forthwegian for he made as if to retch ealstan and his cousin both laughed ealstan kept laughing all the way through the city all the way back to his house if sidroc wanted to think he was laughing at the algarvian he didnt mind a bit rain beat into colonel sabrino s face as he led his wing east from the front toward the miserable excuse for a dragon farm at which they were based his dragon didnt like the rain not even a little it flew heavily laboring much more than it would have had the weather been good sabrino didnt like the rain either he had a demon of a time keeping track of the dragonfliers under his command and had to rely on his squadron leaders more than he wanted he couldnt see far enough to do anything else nor could he see far enough to spy unkerlanter dragons and thanked the powers above the enemy couldnt see very far either he had a demon of a time finding the dragon farm too flying low to glimpse the ground through the curtain of rain he almost flew his dragon into the side of a hill the beast screeched protests when he made it pull up it would have liked hitting the hillside even less but was too stupid to know that he might not have found the dragon farm at all had he not flown over the victory camp that had gone up just north of it seeing the kaunians huddled in dripping misery behind their palisade made him wonder what they thought of the name some clever clerk nad come up with he doubted the algarvian guards on the palisade were any too happy either in this weather their sticks wouldnt carry very far before raindrops attenuated their beams but that was their worry not his his worries shrank because spotting the victory camp told him where he was he swung his dragon into a sharp turn the beast screamed at him not wanting to obey he whacked it with his goad and shouted into the crystal he carried as he did so the dragons he could see through the rain were conforming to his movements but he wanted to make sure the rest of the wing didnt keep on flying back toward forthweg and algarve and there was the farm too with the dragon handlers waving and shouting to keep him from missing them he brought his dragon down to a landing that splashed muck over the keepers who came running up to chain the beast to a stake how they made stakes hold in this muddy morass was beyond him but they did whats it like at the front one of the keepers asked as sabrino slid down from the base of the dragons neck and into the mud by everything i saw were stuck sabrino answered hard for us to go forwardand harder than it might be because the unkerlanters are still wrecking bridges and ley lines and everything else they can that gives them an edge of sorts because theyre bringing up their reinforcements on ground thats not quite so badly chewed up aye the keeper wiped his eyes with a sleeve an utterly useless gesture cursed unkerlanters are tougher than we figured they would be too so they are sabrino remembered general chlodvald then wished he hadnt the retired soldier had been right when he said his countrymen would fight as hard as they could and would keep on fighting more dragons splashed down into the muck seeing to his fliers and their beasts gave sabrino an excuse not to think about general chlodvald after a while he splashed past the keeper with whom hed been talking the fellow jerked a thumb toward the north if all else fails those kaunian whoresons in therell make sure we give king swemmel what he deserves sabrinos stomach lurched as if his dragon had sideslipped and dove without warning i hope it doesnt come to that he said if it does though he shrugged uneasily at least with the whole wing down and safea minor miracle in that ghastly weatherhe could get under canvas the ground was no drier inside his tent than outside but the oiled canvas did keep water from pouring down onto his head after hed changed into a fresh tunic and kilt he invited his squadron commanders to sup with him he had no idea what theyd get it turned out to be fried trout boiled beets and a jar of clear spirits that kicked like a mulemore nearly unkerlanter fare than algarvian phew captain orosio said after a pull at the spirits if swemmels boys drink this stuff all the time no wonder theyre mean after a swig of his own sabrino wheezed aye i think ill send my gullet out for copper plating but that didnt stop him from taking another swig a little later hed never been fond of beets especially plain boiled ones he was still picking at them when a commotion outside penetrated the noise of the rain drumming on his tent have the unkerlanters managed to sneak raiders past our lines captain domiziano said half rising from his seat but then one of the shouts out there in the night came clear your majesty a moment later a dragon handler burst into sabrinos tent sir the king honors us with his presence he exclaimed powers above sabrino said softly i wish i were better placed to honor him in turn than in this miserable bog well it cant be helped see if you can delay him long enough for the cooks to bring in another serving of supper anyhow as things worked out king mezentio and the servitor bringing more fish and beets arrived at the same time go on mezentio told the cook i cant very well eat that till you set it down now can i the wind had blown his umbrella inside out he was almost as wet as the dragonfliers had been sabrino and his squadron commanders sprang to their feet and bowed your majesty they said in unison save the ceremony for later cant you mezentio said let me eat and if youll pour me some of that whatever it is ill thank you for it too he knocked back a slug of the spirits as if his gullet were already lined with metal after the king had demolished his supperbeets fazed him no more than the spirits hadsabrino presumed to ask what brings you to the front your majesty and why this particular part of the front not just the pleasure of your company my lord count mezentio answered he poured from the jar again then drank ah that warms me curse me if it doesnt no not the pleasure of your company i probably wouldnt have come if the unkerlanters hadnt stalled us his lips pulled back from his teeth in what was more nearly snarl than smile but they have and so im going to watch what we do with a victory camp ah orosio beamed thats fine your majesty thats very fine sabrinos stomach lurched again has it truly come to that it has king mezentios voice brooked no argument if we delay we risk not taking cottbus and if we fail to take cottbus the war grows longer and harder than we ever thought it would be when we embarked on it is that true or is it not aye your majesty it is sabrino answered grimacing but mezentio made a sharp chopping gesture with his right hand but me no buts my lord count i did not come to this miserable cursed place to argue with you and nothing you can say will change my mind the mages are here the soldiers are here the stinking kaunians are here and i am here i came here to see it done we shall go forward and we shall go forward to victory is that plain sirrah sabrinos squadron commanders were staring with wide eyes as if wondering how he presumed to argue with his sovereign with king mezentio glaring at him he also wondered how he presumed aye your majesty he said but then being the descendant of a long line of freeborn algarvian warriors he added it had better do all weyouhope it will or wed be better off never having tried it you leave such worries to the mages and me mezentio growled your duty to the kingdom is to fly your dragons and i know you do it well my duty to the kingdom is to win the war and i aim to do exactly that need i make myself any plainer no your majesty sabrino said he took another swig from his glass of spiritshe needed fortifying as the spirits mounted to his head he reflected that hed done everything he could more probably than he should have king mezentio had overruled him he inclined his head i shall obey of course you shall for a moment mezentio sounded very much the way king swemmel was supposed to sound but then he softened his words after we parade through cottbus in triumph i am going to say i told you so he grinned engagingly at sabrino ill be glad to hear it then sabrino said and grinned back mezentio did his best to set his battered umbrella to rights and now i have to go find the tent theyve got waiting for mesomewhere always a pleasure to see you my lord count even if not always to argue with you he nodded to sabrinos squadron commanders gentlemen without waiting for a reply he went out into the wet wet night you dont live dangerously sir captain domiziano said to sabrino not half you dont its war sir orosio added anything we can do to kick the lousy unkerlanters teeth down their throats wed better do it i suppose youre right sabrino said i have no choice but to suppose youre right his majesty made that clear enough didnt he discovering he could still laugh at himself came as something of a relief all the same he drank himself to sleep king mezentio did not visit the dragon farm again sabrino told himself that was because his sovereign had come to unkerlant for other reasons which was no doubt true but he knew he hadnt endeared himself to mezentio men seldom found favor by questioning kings whether or not mezentio was there to watch it sabrinos wing kept on fighting the unkerlanters in that miserable weather they did less than they might have earlier in the year but the unkerlanter dragons were similarly hampered sabrino began using the victory camp full of kaunians as a landmark it was far larger and easier to spy from the air than his own dragon farm and then about the time he began wondering if decent weather were gone for good the sun returned to the sky days remained chilly but the ground began to dry behemoths were once more able to move at something more than a squashy heavyfooted walk the algarvians wasted no time in going over to the attack but the unkerlanters wasted no time counterattacking they had been gathering men and beasts and dragons against the day of need and threw them into the fight without seeming to worry about how many came out again if only they stopped their foes they didnt quite stop the algarvians but slowed their advance from gallop to crawl sabrino and his wing spent as much time over the front as their dragons could stand to stay in the air they attacked unkerlanter soldiers and behemoths on the ground and fought hard to keep the unkerlanter dragons from savaging their own countrymen one fine bright almost springlike morning the dragonfliers were over the unkerlanter lines when the world changed below them the earth shook a roar sabrino could hear even high in the air trenches and holes closed on the unkerlanter soldiers in them flames burst from the ground consuming men and behemoths unicorns and horses not all perished but the greater part did up and down the front as far as sabrino could see he shouted into his crystal now we slaughter the ones who are left as the dragons stooped on their horrified bewildered foes algarvian footsoldiers and behemoths and cavalry erupted from their lines and joined in the assault their exultant shouts reached high into the sky the disaster that smote the unkerlanters had not hurt them in the least they tore through the gutted enemy positions and swarmed westward when sabrino flew over the victory camp bringing the dragons back to their farm in triumph at the end of the day he saw what he knew he would see a camp full of corpses seven cornelu pulled his socks up above his knees he wished they were thicker wool so they might keep his legs warmer the wind that blew into the hills above tirgoviste came from the southwest off the narrow sea and die land of the ice people and carried the chill of the austral continent with it snow wouldnt have surprised him he stared down from the hills toward the harbor town with three algarvian officers quartered in her housemy house too curse them cornelu thoughtcostache would assuredly be snug and warm and so would brindza the sibian naval officer consigned the algarvians to the powers below all the same come on you lazy bugger shouted the boss of the woodcutting gang for which hed been working the past few weeks swing your axe or ill throw you out on your cursed arse aye cornelu said and then again wearily aye the weariness was more of the spirit than of the body though the work made a man sleep every night like one of the logs made from trees he cut down but cornelu had lived his whole life in polite company and was used to politely phrased orders he found few of those here he returned his attention to the pine hed been attacking when he swung the axe he imagined it bit into the algarvians neck rather than the dark scaly bark of the tree and that blood spurted in place of dribbles of fragrant resinous sap the gang boss a wideshouldered bruiser named giurgiu grunted in something approaching satisfaction and went off to shout at another woodsman who wasnt working so hard as he might have to give giurgiu his due he did almost as much work as any two of the men in the gang he handled an axe as if it were light as a schoolmasters switch and did far more than his share on a twoman saw his hands bore calluses half an inch thick and looked and felt hard as rocks cornelus hands had bled the first several days after hed joined the woodcutters hed never used them so roughly before rubbing them with turpentine made him want to shriek but it had also helped him gain calluses that gave him some protection by now swinging the axe was just work not torment chips flew as he struck the tree again and again come on you whore he panted having been reviled he in turn reviled something that could not argue back he let out a snort maybe this work wasnt so much different from the sibian navy after all he heard a crackling deep inside the tree a crackling and a groan he struck harder than ever looking up toward the crown of the pine as he did so the tree stood straight for another couple of strokes then it began to lean she falls he shouted woodcutters near him scattered he hadnt known to let out a warning cry when he first joined the gang the second tree he felled had almost driven giurgiu into the ground like a sledge hitting a spike hed had trouble blaming the boss for cursing him then with a louder crackling the pine went over cornelu stood on the balls of his feet ready to leap out of the way if it looked like falling on him hed almost driven himself into the ground two or three times here though he put the trunk right where he wanted a skill hed acquired without quite knowing how the pine thudded down into yellowing grass near the edge of the wood giurgiu came over and examined it he nodded ive seen worse jobs he rumbled at lastfrom him high praise now we turn it into stovewood theyre going to get chilly down in the city before too long and they have to cook even when they arent chilly as long as the hills still have woods on them the likes of us wont go hungry aye cornelu said he wondered how much longer the hills would have woods on them in earlier times forests had covered far more land than they did now before the days of iron ships that coursed the ley lines great trees were essential for the timbers and masts of the merchantmen that had made sibiu rich and the galleons that had made her strong great stretches of forest had been royal preserves then things were different nowadays cornelu doubted they were betterwith the algarvians occupying the kingdom they couldnt very well be giurgiu brought over a big twoman saw come on he said act lively well cut the trunk into wheels and then you can split the wheels into wedges dont stand there gawping curse itits not like youve got a lot of time to waste aye cornelu repeated but for his foul mouth giurgiu did think like a naval officer cornelu grasped the handle of the saw and lowered it to the tree trunk round after round of wood leaped off the trunk manning a saw with giurgiu was like manning it with a demonhe never seemed to tire cornelu tried his best to keep the boss woodcutter from doing too much more than his share of the work giurgiu noticed too youre not the handiest fellow ive ever seen he remarked when even he had to pause for a blow but you can pull your weight when you set your mind to it that left comelu absurdly pleased a boy of about fourteen scooped up sawdustand a little dry grass and dirt with itand stuffed it into a leather sack it got sold for kindling so did pine needles after they were dry there giurgiu said after a surprisingly short time you can deal with the wheels yourself like i said before and lop the branches into short lengths mind dont leave em as long as you did that one time he didnt wait for cornelus agreement but strode off to see how some of the other woodcutters were doing that one time had been weeks before giurgiu hadnt forgotten and made sure cornelu didnt forget either he was indeed very much like an officer in some ways by the time cornelu finished turning the tree into wood darkness was falling this far south days quickly got short as autumn wore on here in the woods that made itself more obvious to cornelu than it had back in tirgoviste there light to hold night at bay had been easy to come by tirgoviste sat on a power point simple firelight couldnt come close to matching it cooking over a simple fire didnt measure up either not to cornelu meat came out burnt on the outside and raw in the middle when held over the flames on a stick the porridge of beans and barley and peas would have been boring no matter how it was cooked but appetite made a wonderful sauce and exhaustion made a wonderful sleeping draught cornelu had discovered that in the navy and now was reminded of it again though the night was long giurgiu had to shake him awake at dawn he was not the only one to be treated so which spared him embarrassment he gulped down more of the bland porridge giurgiu said im going to send barbu and levaditi into town with the wagons today he eyed cornelu as he spoke sure enough cornelu jerked as if stung by a wasp what he yelped you told me id get to drive one of those wagons and now im telling you something different the boss woodcutter answered barbus got a sister whos sick down in tirgoviste town and levaditis our best haggler unless i go myself i didnt much care for the price you brought back on that last load you took in but cornelu said helplessly he ached to see his wife more than that he ached to touch her he didnt know whether he could have managed either of those things especially the latter but he wanted the chance to try thinking of costache under siege from three lecherous algarvian officersand what other sort was thereate at him next to that haggling seemed of small import so did anyone elses troubles giurgiu folded massive arms across his massive chest thats what im telling you now and thats how its going to be he looked cornelu up and down if you dont like it you can leave or else you can make me change my mind the rest of the woodcutters chuckled giurgiu wasnt the gang boss only because he knew the business inside and out he was also stronger and tougher than any of the men he led from what cornelu heard no one had challenged him for a long time but cornelu knew skill counted for as much as strength he set down the bowl from which hed been eating and got to his feet all right ill have a go at that he said giurgiu stared so did the other woodsmen giurgiu walked out onto the meadow come on then he said over his shoulder youve got stones in your bag anyhow but i dont think itll do you much good and youll go out and work after they throw water in your face too no i wont cornelu said ill drive the wagon instead of levaditi he wondered how foolish hed just been giurgiu moved more like a cat than a bear and he was a lot bigger than cornelu the woodcutters gathered in a circle around the two men come on giurgiu said you want me come and get me either that or pick up your axe and get back to work with a silent sigh cornelu approached no it wouldnt be easy but he couldnt back down now not unless he wanted to lose all his pride he rushed at the boss woodcutter deliberately making his attack look clumsy fooling giurgiu into overconfldence seemed his best hope and it worked giurgiu let fly with a haymaker that would have knocked cornelu through a boulder had it landed but cornelu seized the woodcutters beefy arm bent his own back and threw giurgiu over it and down to the dying grass he started to leap on the bigger man but giurgiu didnt land like a falling tree as hed hoped the boss woodcutter rolled away and bounced to his feet while the rest of the gang exclaimed in astonishment giurgiu eyed cornelu so you know what youre doing eh all right well see whos left standing at the end now he advanced with grim concentration in the unpleasant minutes that followed cornelu hurt his opponent several times he blacked one of giurgius eyes and landed a couple of solid kicks in the ribs but the head woodsman gave more than he got blood poured from cornelus nose though he didnt think it was broken his own ribs gave eloquent testimony of how giurgius had to feel somewhere in the middle of the brawl he spat out a small chunk of tooth and counted himself lucky not to lose most of a mouthful at the last giurgiu got round behind him seized his arm and bent it back you wont be able to work if i break something in there he remarked had enough or shall i go ahead and do it he bent the arm a little farther cornelus shoulder screamed enough cornelu mumbled through swollen lips and even more swollen selfdisgust giurgiu let go of him got up and hauled him to the feet then he slapped him on the back and almost knocked him down well you do have stones he said and the other woodcutters nodded you made me sweat for it the men nodded again giurgiu went on now wash your face and get to it youre not taking a wagon down to the city today and thats flat aye cornelu said someone brought him a bucket before splashing away the blood he looked at his reflection he was not a pretty sight maybe it was just as well costache wouldnt get the chance to look at him your majesty marshal rathar licked his lips then said what he had to say they have broken through in the north they have broken through in the south too though not so badly the weather hampers them worse there king swemmels dark eyes burned in a face as pale as that of a kaunian kept out of the sun his whole life long and how did this happen he asked in a deadly voice it was magecraft your majesty rathar answered i am only a soldier i can tell you no more than that if you would have the details you must have them from archmage addanz here swemmels burning gaze swung toward the chief sorcerer of unkerlant aye we will have the details addanz he said even more harshly than he had spoken to rathar tell us how you and yours failed unkerlant in her hour of need addanz bowed his head like rathar he was in the flower of his middle years most of the old men who might have served swemmel were dead some the lucky ones had died of natural causes others had chosen the wrong side in the twinkings war or displeased swemmel afterwards their ends commonly were harder your majesty addanz said still not looking up i did not expect the algarvians to do as they did none of us expected the cursed algarvians to do as they did he freighted the adjective with more than its usual mild weight of meaning when they did as they did the world shuddered for those with the wit and training to sense such things by the powers above your majesty the first time they did as they did i almost fell over dead better if you had swemmel snarled then we could appoint someone of some wit in your place he turned back toward rathar and yours mine rathar saidyelped rather hed hoped that with the kings wrath turned on the archmage he might escape unscathed no such luck he saw he let out a muted protest the only kind safe around king swemmel what did i do nothingwhich is why you are in part to blame the king answered you should have known the stinking redheads would try some such ploy when straightforward war began to fail em your majesty none of us dreamt they would dothis addanz said rathar nodded to him in grateful surprise for the archmage to defend him took more courage than hed known the other man to possess addanz went on you surely know your majesty how life energy is a very potent source of power for magecrafthow soldiers whose sticks run low on blazes may recharge them with the death of a captive or of a brave comrade aye we know this swemmel said how could we not know it the soldiers in the far west particularly have used the life energy of some few of their number to help the rest hold back the louseridden fuzzybearded gongs addanz nodded even so of some few of their number your majesty is the critical phrase for life energy is the most potent most concentrated form of sorcerous energy and the algarvians you might say went suddenly from the retail to the wholesale use of such energy they gathered together a couple of thousand kaunians in one placein each of several places actuallyand slew them all together all at once and their mages turned the energy from those slaughters against our armies that is the way of it rathar agreed the mages who aid our soldiers against the foe did everything they could to hold back the great storm of sorcery raised against emas addanz had defended him he returned the favorbut they were overwhelmed it is a great wickedness the greatest of wickednesses addanz said in a voice filled with dread to take men and women who have done nothing to use them so to slay them so as to steal their life energy i did not think even algarvians could stoop to such a thing they fought hard in the six years war but they used no more vileness than anyone else now he shook his head king swemmel heard him out indeed swemmel listened intently that relieved rathar who had feared the king would burst into one of his rages and start shouting for executioners then swemmels eyes swung back to him and he wondered if relief had come too soon how do we stop em the king asked now his voice was calm dangerously calm it was the right question it was at the moment the only question still marshal rathar wished his sovereign had not asked it though he knew it might cost him his head he answered with the truth i do not know if the algarvians will massacre by the thousands those theyve conquered we facing them are like a man in a tunic with a knife facing another in chainmail with a broadsword why swemmel asked in startled curiosityso startled it took rathar by surprise because they have no scruples about doing what we will not the marshal replied setting forth what seemed obvious to him swemmel threw back his head and laughed no more he howled a small drop of spittle flew across the table at which he and his subjects sat and struck rathar in the cheek tears of mirth rolled down the kings face you fool he chortled when at last he could do anything but laugh oh you milkfed fool we never knew we had a virgin leading our armies your majesty rathar said stiffly he hadnt the faintest notion what king swemmel meant he glanced over to addanz the archmages face held horror of a different sortto rathars amazement horror of a worse sortthan it had while addanz was explaining what the algarvians had done that deeper horror told rathar everything he needed to know he stared at swemmel you would not of course we would laughter dropped from the king like a discarded cloak he leaned forward in his seat and brought the full weight of his presence to bear on rathar where else how else shall we get chainmail and a broadsword of our own that was another question rathar wished swemmel had not asked having fallen into the abyss themselves the algarvians would now pull him in after them he had never been a man to look away from trouble but he looked away now trying to distract king swemmel from a large concern with small ones where would we get the victims he asked we had but a handful of kaunians on our soil and even if you thought to use them for such purposes theyre in algarvian hands now and if we start slaying redheaded captives theyll murder ours in place of the kaunians swemmels shrug chilled the marshal with its indifference we have plenty of peasants we care nothingnothing at allif only one of them is left alive when the fightings over so long as the very last algarvian is dead i dont know if we can quickly match them in their magecraft addanz said as with so much else they have been readying themselves for long and long even if we are forced to this thing to survivehe shudderedwe have much learning to do why did you not begin learning before the king demanded his archmage looked back at him in harassed fury because i never imaginedno one ever imaginedthe algarvians would be so vile i never imagined anyone could be so vile and i three times never imagined i could be forced to be so vile rathar had seen that defiance sometimes got swemmels notice in a way nothing else could sometimes a defiant man found he didnt want swemmels notice once he had it but that didnt happen here in surprisingly mild tones the king asked and would you rather go down to ruin because the redheads were vile and you couldnt stomach matching them no your majesty addanz had to know his head would answer for any other reply nor would we king swemmel said go then you and your mages had better learn how to do as the algarvians do and you had better learn it soon we promise you archmage if we do fall before the redheads you will not last long enough for mezentios men to finish off we shall make certain of that do you understand us aye your majesty addanz said swemmel made a peremptory gesture of dismissal addanz fled rathar did not blame him the marshal would have liked to flee too but the king had not dismissed him swemmel said your task marshal is to make sure the algarvians cannot finish us before we find out how best to fight back how do you aim to do that rathar had been thinking of little else since word of the disasters reached him he began ticking points off on his fingers we are spreading our men thinner so the algarvians cannot catch so many of them with one sorcerous stroke we are making our positions deeper so we can attack the redheads even if they pierce our front this will slow mezentios bandits it will not stop them swemmel observed he wasnt stupid often he would have been easier to deal with had he been stupid he was shrewd just shrewd enough to think himself smarter than he really was here however he was also right rathar said as much and then continued the weather also works for us try as they will the algarvians cannot go forward as fast as they would like we trade space for time we have less space to trade than we did the king growled and you were on fire for charging straight at king mezentio rathar thought he couldnt say that he did say winter is coming advancing will get no easier for them and your majesty we are also doing all we can to send parties behind the enemys position to sabotage the ley lines coming out of forthweg if the cursed redheads cant bring the kaunians forward they cant very well kill them rathar seldom won outandout approval from swemmel but this was one of those times now that is good the king said that is quite good he paused his approval never lasted long or is it can the redheads not slay them back in forthweg and bring the power of the magic forward you would do better asking addanz than me rathar said my answer is only a guess but it would be no if the algarvians could do that why would they put the kaunians in camps near the front swemmel fingered his narrow chin but for being dark of hair and eye he did look like an algarvian he grunted it could be so and if we overrun any of those camps we can dispose of the kaunians in them instead of using our own folk that would be funny having the redheads do our gathering work for us he had a rugged sense of humor rathar had seen as much over the course of many years the marshal said we might do better to turn them loose and let them try to get back to forthweg why would we want to do such a wasteful thing as that king swemmel said if any of them make it back to their own land and tell the truth about what the algarvians are doing to them dont you think forthweg might rise against mezentio rathar asked maybe but then again maybe not the king replied forthwegians love kaunians hardly better than the redheads swemmel shrugged we suppose it might be worth a try and it would embarrass mezentio which is all to the good aye you have our leave to do it thank you your majesty something new occurred to rathar if the algarvians slaughter their thousands for the sake of sorcery and we slaughter as many to stop them the war will come down to soldier against soldier once more i wonder if mezentio thought of that before he set this fire we do not care king swemmel said whatever fires he sets we shall set bigger ones try as she would pekka could not enjoy the principality she knew master siuntio had meant nothing but kindness when he booked her into yliharmas finest hostel after calling her to the capital but she would have come to the capital whether hed summoned her or not the cold fear and horror in her would have pushed her out of kajaani she hadnt been the only mage riding the leyline caravan north to yliharma shed spotted three or four other women and men with set worried faces theyd nodded when they saw her and then gone back to their private woes which were no doubt much like hers but siuntio had arranged to have the seven princes of kuusamo also gather in yliharma pekka could not have done that on her own she was glad the seven princes took the business as seriously as their mages did shed been far from sure they would a knock on the door sent her hurrying to open it there in the hallway stood siuntio a good day to you he said bowing i have a carriage waiting to take us to the princely palace ilmarinen will ride with us too unless hes gone off chasing a barmaid while i came up to get you master siuntio you didnt need to come here to bring me to the palace pekka said sternly i could have found my own way i intended to find my own way i wanted the three of us to come before the seven princes together the elderly theoretical sorcerer answered prince joroinen i know has been keeping his colleagues apprised of our progress when we have any if we join together in a show of alarm it will have weight for all of the seven you flatter me beyond my worth pekka said his face as serious as shed ever seen it siuntio shook his head flustered she turned and took a thick wool cloak from the cabinet that stood in the little entry hall as she settled it on her shoulders she spoke in a rough voice to cover her own embarrassment lets go then when she got downstairs she discovered siuntio hadnt been joking ilmarinen was chatting up a pretty young woman whose slanted eyes swarthy skin and broad cheekbones were all kuusaman but who had auburn hair far more typical of a lagoan he blew her a kiss as he went off to join siuntio and pekka just making certain shes not a spy sent out from setubal he said airily of course you were siuntio answered im certain you intended to probe her very deeply ilmarinen started to nod but pekkas giggle told him hed missed something after a heartbeat he gave siuntio a dirty look you think youre funny he growled i think youre in your second childhood is what i think i almost wish i were siuntio said then i could have gone on living my life instead of screaming like a man on the rack at the supper table a few days ago i alarmed the whole eatery but not so badly as i alarmed myself ilmarinen grimaced aye it was bad he said pekka nodded the memory of that moment would stay with her all her days ilmarinen sighed and went on wed best be at it the wench will wait this business wont chill air smote pekka as she and siuntio and ilmarinen left the warmth of the principality a little snow lay on the sidewalks and in the streets of yliharma it was half melted and gray with soot kajaani lay on the southern side of the vaattojarvi hills it took the full brunt of the storms rolling up from the land of the ice people the snow there was unlikely to melt till spring horses hooves clopping the carriage bore the three mages to the princely palace it stood on the highest ground in yliharma having begun its history as a hill fort centuries before the kaunians crossed the strait of valmiera farther west savants still dug below the far more splendid buildings gracing the hilltop these days and sometimes came up with fascinating finds what sort of man is prince rustolainen pekka asked living down in the south i hear less of him than id like hes not the sort to think the doings of the prince of yliharma belong in the news sheets anyhow siuntio said at which ilmarinen nodded siuntio went on hes a solid sort and far from a fool less forwardlooking than joroinen ilmarinen added he sees what is not what he wants to be but siuntios righthes solid about what is the seven princes of kuusamo went in for less in the way of gaudy ceremonial than did the kings on the mainland of derlavaior bang vitor of lagoas for that matter the usher who brought the mages before the seven announced them as matteroffactly as if he were presenting them to seven prominent merchants pekka went to one knee for a moment siuntio and ilmarinen bowed prince joroinen said we need stand on no special ceremony here this morning he looked along the table behind which the seven sat no one contradicted him the princes dressed more like prosperous merchants than rulers too prince rustolainen sat in the center of the group since they were gathered at his castle being the prince whose domain included yliharma he was the most powerful among the seven no matter where he sat he leaned forward nodding to siuntio master mage you have persuaded me to call my comrades together i have explained the business as best i can but i am no sorcerer tell it to them plain as you told it to me they will have also heard from mages in their own domains i expect siuntio said and some of the princes nodded siuntio went on in any case it is less a matter of magecraft than of simple right and wrong the algarvians have turned to murder in their war against unkerlant war is about murder rustolainen said siuntio shook his head so you said when i first brought this to your notice your highness i told you then and i tell you now war is about killing a soldiers foe has a chance to slay him the algarvians took folk who could not possibly fight back and killed them for the sake of their life energy which they then turned against king swemmels armies they go forward once more because of it where they had been stopped how strong a magic can they make this way asked prince parainen whose lands were in the far east looking across the bothnian ocean toward gyongyos how many kaunian captives do they care to kill siuntio answered bluntly the greater the murder the greater the magecraft killing is easier than it used to be in the old days too ilmarinen added they dont have to go up to each captive and smite him with a sword or an axe they can beam the victims down one after another with sticks ah the modern age we live in his glee was savage and sardonic prince joroinen asked how does the power of this magic the algarvians are using compare to the force of the new magecraft the three of you and your colleagues are investigating to pekkas surprise both siuntio and ilmarinen looked toward her she said your highness no wood fire can burn hotter than a coal fire we are looking at coal or at something hotter than coal but a large wood fire will do more harm than a small coal fire the algarvians have kindled the largest wood fire the world has ever seen and the one with the foulest smoke a good figure siuntio murmured pekka smiled her thanks we summoned the algarvian minister to kuusamo before us yesterday rustolainen said and the rest of the princes nodded he denied that his kingdom has done any such thingsays its a lie put about by king mezentios enemies how say you your highness i say algarve has a bad conscience siuntio replied the thing was done they could not hide it not from those with the senses and training to feel it they can only pretend to innocence they no longer have they say that if anyone worked such a magic it was the unkerlanters trying to hold them back rustolainen said pekka ilmarinen and siuntio all laughed bitter laughs oh indeed ilmarinen said thats why swemmels troops go back in triumphant retreat while the algarvians advance in fear and chaos and disorder results speak louderand truerthan words pekka agreed joroinen asked how soon will you have your hotter fire ready to burn that was more pekkas to answer than either of her colleagues she said your highness i was almost ready to make the experiment to see how the new fire would burnor it if would burn at allwhen the algarvians did what they did we will know more after i finally do make it how long we will need to control it if there is anything to control i cant say not yet im sorry she looked down at the carpet it was woven in a pattern of rushes to imitate the rushes kuusaman chieftains had strewn on their floors before they knew of carpets the algarvian minister may talk prettier than we do he may talk fancier than we do ilmarinen said but theres one other difference you had better remember you seven of kuusamo we tell you the truth as usual prince rustolainen spoke for the group and what would you have us do siuntio took a step forward it must be war your highness he said if we let them do this without punishing them the world will suffer because of it men must know they may not do such things i say it sadly but say it i must what of our war with gyongyos prince parainen exclaimed that war concerned him more intimately than any of the other princes for his ports looked out toward the islands on which it was fought your highness the war with gyongyos is a war for kuusamos advantage siuntio said the war against algarve will be a war for the worlds advantage with unkerlant for our partner parainen raised an eyebrow for which pekka had trouble blaming him he put his objections into words king swemmel i think would sooner wreck the world than save it doubtless he would ilmarinen agreed but what swemmel would do mezentio is doing what has the greater weight swemmel might have taken the mages head for such lese majesty parainen bit his lips and ever so reluctantly nodded rustolainen said if we war against algarve we war without the new magic is it not so it is so your highness at least for now pekka said it may come i dont know how soon it will and i dont know how much good it will do when it does a leap in the dark parainen muttered no your highnessa leap into the light siuntio said is it parainen remained unconvinced swemmel will start slaughtering his own as soon as he thinks of it tell me i am wrong pekka didnt think he was wrong she feared he was right but she said two things your highness what a man does to save himself is different from what he will do to hurt another and mezentio is leaving his own untouched he has other victims who can do nothing to make him stop the princes murmured to one another rustolainen said we thank you masters mistress if we need to hear more of your views we shall summon you pekka left the conference chamber downhearted she had hoped for moreshe had hoped for a promise but the news of the seven princes declaration of war on algarve beat her carriage back to the principality she had never dreamt she could be so pleased about something that promised such sorrow rumors swirled through priekule some were frightened some were furious krasta had no idea which of them to believe or whether to believe any she wanted to ignore them but could not do that either if anyone would know the truth colonel lurcanio would he looked up from his paperwork when she pushed her way past captain mosco and stood in the doorway to the chamber he was using as his officeshe didnt quite dare bursting in on him come in my dear he said with his usual cruelly charming smile setting down a steel pen what can i do for you is it true krasta demanded tell me it is not true very well it is not true lurcanio said agreeably krasta knew a moments relief a moment shattered when her algarvian lovers smile grew broader and he inquired nowwhat are we talking about krasta set her hands on her hips her temper flared as it had a way of doing why what everyone says of course everyone says all manner of things lurcanio replied with a shrug most of them are stupid almost none are true i think i stood on fairly safe ground when i denied yours whatever it was he made as if to go back to his papers being brushed off even by the formidable lurcanio was more than krasta would tolerate voice whipcrack sharp she said then why did kuusamo go to war against algarve she succeeded in getting her lovers attention he set down the pen and looked her full in the face his smile now was gone the expression that replaced it made krasta wish she hadnt sounded so prickly shed got more of lurcanios attention than she wanted you had better tell me just what you are saying and where you heard it and from whom he said softly unlike every other man she knew the quieter he was the more menacing he sounded you know perfectly well or you cursed well ought to krasta tried to hold on to her defiance against lurcanio that was next to impossible he had the edge on her just as algarves army had had the edge on valmieras a year and a half before and he knew it suppose you tell me he repeated suppose you tell me in great detail come in and sit down do make yourself comfortable and close the door behind you krasta obeyed she was very conscious of obeying of following his will rather than her own it chafed at her like trousers too tight in the crotch trying to get a little freedom a little breathing space she gave lurcanio a saucy smile and said your men will think i came her for another reason shed done that once on a whim and certainly had distracted lurcanio from whatever hed been working on she did not distract him today let my men think whatever they please he said you came down here to tell me you had heard certain things now you do not seem to want to tell me what these things are i need to know that he waited looking at her again krasta felt herself obeying because she was obeying and not doing as she wantedas she did whenever she was not around colonel lurcanioshe gave it to him full in the face is it true that algarve is taking kaunians out of valmiera or jelgava or or wherevershed been shaky in geography as shed been shaky in a good many subjects at the academies shed sometimes often briefly gracedand doing horrible things to them off in barbarous unkerlant oh that lurcanio gestured dismissively as if flicking a speck off his tunic i thought you were talking about something important my sweet no it is not true that we are taking people out of valmiera or jelgava or doing anything to them anywhere there is that plain enough she didnt notice he hadnt answered quite all of her questions had she paid closer attention at one of her academies or unfinished finishing schools perhaps she might have but his assertion didnt lay a fortnights rumors to rest at a stroke either then why do people say you are she persisted why lurcanio sighed have you not seen for yourself that most peopleespecially most common peopleare fools and will repeat anything they hear as if they were so many trained jackdaws that aimed at krasta was a shrewder stroke i certainly have she exclaimed the commoners who arent fools are commonly knaves commoners commonly she laughed she made jokes mostly by accident and didnt always recognize them even then when she did she felt uncommonly pleased with herself lurcanio laughed too more than the feeble wordplay deserved thereyou see out of your own mouth you convict these liars have any of your friends disappeared have any of your servants disappeared have any of their friends disappeared of course not how could we hope to keep such a thing secret if it were so it would be impossible aye so it would krasta admitted had anything truly been going on in valmiera the rumors would have been juicier full of more details now that she thought about it she saw that plain still why does kuusamo war on you then why colonel lurcanio raised an elegantly sardonic eyebrow ill tell you why my sweet because the seven princes are jealous of our triumphs and look for any excuse to tear us down ah again that made sense to krasta shed done the same thing to social rivals and had it done to her she nodded now lurcanios smile was charming again he pushed his chair back and away from his desk the chair was algarvian military issue its brass wheels squeaked as long as you are here do you care to give my men something to gossip about this time his voice held no command he never tried to force krasta in such matters not overtly anyhow had she chosen to walk out the door he would never have said a word about it not least because she was free to refuse she decided not to knowing the other algarvian officers would be jealous of lurcanio didnt hurt either she sank to her knees in front of him and flipped up his kilt having eased her mind and her body lurcanio was scrupulous about returning such favors she went back to her bedchamber to choose a cloak for the days journey through the shops of priekule bauska was no help with her what people called morning sickness lasted all day long she was liable to gulp and flee at any moment if that was what carrying a child meant krasta wanted no part of it her driver also muffled against the chill of approaching winter took the carriage to the boulevard of horsemen as soon as he handed her down onto the street he took a flask out of his pocket and swigged from it that would help keep him warm or at least make him stop caring he was cold krasta was more intent on what she would do than on what her servitor was doing the boulevard of horsemen which held priekules finest shops was not what it had been before the algarvians came far fewer people walkedparaded reallyalong its splendid sidewalks many who did were redheaded soldiers in kilts shopkeepers did good business with them at any rate as often as not packages filled their arms krastas smile was nasty as she watched a couple of algarvians emerge from a shop that sold lingerie would the silks and lace theyd bought adorn their valmieran mistresses or go home to keep their wives happy and unsuspecting she wished lurcanio would buy her presents there if he didnt though the world wouldnt end several earlier lovers already had the dainties rested in a drawer in her bedchamber smelling of cedar to hold the moths at bay a few doors past the lingerie shop stood a clothiers krasta enjoyed visiting she peered past the peeling gold leaf in the window to see what new things he was displaying if she didnt stay up with fashion lurcanio might decide to buy lingerie for someone else she stopped and stared the nearly military cut of the new tunics and trousers on display wasnt what caught her eye she had never imagined a valmieran clothier would put kilts out for sale after algarve beat her own kingdom in war it struck her as indecentno worse unkaunian but out of a dressing room stepped a young blond woman wearing a kilt that stopped a couple of inches above her knees and left the rest of her legs bare indecent krasta muttered shed worn kilts before the war but now it seemed a far more public admission of defeat than taking an algarvian lover but the clothiers assistant clapped her hands in delight while her customer reached into the pockets of the trousers she wasnt wearing any more and paid for the kilt iwont shop there again krasta thought and walked on discontented she stepped into a jewelers looking for earrings but he had nothing that suited her she reduced the shop girl to tears before leaving that restored most of the good humor shed lost standing in front of the clothiers and then walking up the street toward her she saw viscount valnu he waved gaily and went from a walk up to a trot krasta stiffened and turned away valnu was wearing a kilt whats the trouble he asked and leaned forward to kiss her on the cheek she turned away again not playfully as she so often had but in grim earnest whats the trouble she echoed ill tell you whats the trouble thats the trouble she pointed in the general direction of the kilt on a man even more than on a woman it seemed an admissioneven a celebrationof defeat valnu pretended not to understand what my knees wicked laughter filled his thin handsome face my pet youve seen a great deal more of me than my knees never on the street krasta ground out oh you have so valnu said that time you ended up shoving me out of your carriagewe werent just on the bloody street we were in it thats different krasta said though she couldnt have told him how then she asked the question that was really on her mind how can you stand to wear it how can i stand it ever the opportunist valnu rested a hand on her hip sweetling the way things are i should hardly dare not to don the kilt wouldnt you say its protective coloration krasta might have heard the phrase once or twice but it made no sense to her here impatiently she said what are you talking about what i said valnu answered you know the butterflies that look like dry leaves when they fold up their wings and the bugs that look like twigs all so the birds cant eat em if i look like an algarvian his voice trailed away oh krasta wasnt the cleverest woman in valmiera but she saw what he meant they arent really doing that i dont think theyre really doing that lurcanio says they arent doing that if they were wed have heard about people who went missing dont you think not if they didnt go missing from valmiera valnu said wed have heard about jelgava too or the jelgavan nobility would have and they would have started screaming their heads off wed have heard that krasta said it was lurcanios argument but it had convinced her and she made it her own if it didnt convince valnu it made him thoughtful maybe he said at last just maybe by the powers above how i wish it could be true still and all thoughhe ran the hand that wasnt on krastas hip down his kiltbetter not to take chances law of similarity and all that and dont i look splendid you look grotesque krasta exercised tact only around colonel lurcanio as grotesque as an algarvian in trousers it looks unnatural you say the sweetest things ill tell you what it is though valnu leaned toward her almost close enough for his tongue to touch her ear as he whispered its bloody drafty thats what he startled a laugh out of krasta despite her best intentions serves you right she said this time when valnu tried to kiss her on the cheek she let him he went on his way cheerfully enough but she found she could get no more pleasure out of shopping and rode back to her mansion in a glum and dour mood coming on an algarvian soldier shouted in bad unkerlanter more firewoods aye more firewood garivald said and dumped his bundle at the redheads feet every branch the algarvians burned was one the villagers of zossen couldnt but anyone who complained got blazed no one complained thennot where the algarvians could hear it could have been worse only a squad or so of algarvians garrisoned the village the men of zossen could have risen and wiped them out the men of a village a few miles away had risen and killed all of mezentios soldiers there that village was gone now the algarvians had brought in more soldiers behemoths and dragons and wiped it off the face of the earth the peasant men were dead the women garivald didnt want to think about the women his friend dagulf thumped a load of firewood at the algarvians feet the fellow nodded and gave a theatrical shiver he might not speak much unkerlanter but like a lot of redheads garivald had seen he had a gift for gestures cold he said very cold garivald nodded disagreeing with the occupiers didnt pay dagulf nodded too they caught each others eye neither laughed or even smiled though garivald knew he felt like it it was only a little below freezing and might even get about it by the middle of the day if the algarvian thought this was cold he hadnt seen anything yet after theyd got out of earshot of the redhead dagulf said he hasnt got the clothes he needs for this kind of weather no garivald said and then too bad he and dagulf did laugh now garivald scratched his calflength wooltunic was twice as thick as the one the algarvian wore beneath it he had on a wool undertunic wool drawers and wool stockings he was perfectly comfortable when winter came on hed add a thick wool cloak and a fur hat he wouldnt be perfectly comfortable then but hed manage wouldnt catch me wearing one of those little short kilts dagulf said curse me if ill argue with you garivald said first blizzard comes itd freeze right off he paused meditatively might be the best thing that could happen to the whoresons eh aye dagulf pulled a sour face theyre a lickerish lot mezentios buggers looks like theyll swive anything that movesand if it doesnt move theyll shake it thats so garivald said weve already had more scandal since they came than for years before and afterwards the women say the soldiers made em do it and they didnt have a choice but a lot of em look pretty cursed contented while they say it all this algarvian swaggering and handkissing and what have you spoils em you ask me dagulf said something vaguely related to handkissing he and garivald let out loud coarse laughs then he said you ought to make a song about ita song thatd keep our women from lying down with the redheads i mean nothing will keep them from lying down if its that or be blazed garivald observed you cant blame em for that but the other his voice trailed away his expression went slack and distant dagulf had to nudge him to get him to keep walking he murmured wed have to be careful where we sung it dagulf grunted so we would he pointed toward waddo the firstman who was limping toward them across the village square with the ground pardy frozen waddos stick got better purchase than it had when everything was kneedeep in mud dagulf went on algarvians arent the only reason wed have to be careful either he wouldnt betray us to the redheads garivald said but then softened that by adding i dont think he might dagulf said darkly selling us out is about the only way i can think of that hed get himself in good with the algarvians he hasnt pulled anything like that yet powers above be praised garivald knew something else that might make king mezentios men happy with waddo if the firstman led them to the buried crystal they might forgive him for having buried it and if he wasnt sure they would he might try to blame everything on garivald whod helped him hide it hello hello waddo said as he came up to them at last a very good day to you both i am sure he didnt sound so sure of anything as he had before the algarvians seized zossen he remained firstman and did their bidding when they gave him any bidding to do but hed lost most of the authority hed had as the nearest approach to king swemmels representative in the village as far as king mezentios men were concerned he was just a dog slightly larger than the other dogs in zossenand much more likely to be kicked good day garivald and dagulf said together dagulf pointed to garivald and added our friend here may be in the way of coming up with a new song garivald wished he hadnt said even so much waddo however beamed i saw him looking all dreamy so i hoped he might be a new song would help make the long cold winter nights pass quicker ill do what i can garivald said now hed have to come up with an ordinary song as well as the one urging the village women not to give themselves to algarvian soldiers he hoped waddo wouldnt hear that one even if the firstman had a daughter of an age if not of a beauty to draw the redheads notice if its half as good as a couple youve come up with itll be twice as good as a lot of the ones weve known for years waddo said a minstrel in our own villagea songsmith no less who would have thought it i thank you garivald said shyly the idea that he could make songs still astonished him no we thank you you do us credit waddo was very effusive is he laying it on too thick garivald wondered is he trying to lull me to sleep so he can sell me to mezentios men he wondered if he ought to dig up the crystal and hide it somewhere only he knew or throw it in a creek if he could do it without being noticed that might prove wise of course if the algarvians caught him digging up the crystal theyd blaze him or maybe just hang him with a placard round his neck warning others not to do as he had done did waddo want him to try something foolish that way hed be punished leaving the firstman in the clear garivald shook his head as if to knock such notions out of it he hated having to think that way aye a new song would be fine waddo said anything that takes our minds off our empty bellies would be fine it would have been a good harvest dagulf said mournfully if wed got to keep more of it it would have the redheads waddos head went back and forth in the automatic cautious gesture the rest of the villagers had always used to make sure he wasnt around before they spoke some of their minds he didnt see anything untowardgarivald knew because he looked around toobut he didnt say much either contenting himself with a sigh and the remark that cant be helped neither can grasshoppers dagulf said garivald contrived to step on his foot the other peasant wasnt thinking enough before he spoke today waddo nodded garivald didnt trust him even so the firstman might find favor with the algarvians by betraying other villagers too after as little small talk as he could get away with and still stay polite garivald went back to his house and told annore im going out to the woods again this time if im lucky ill be able to cut some firewood for us too not just for the redheads that would be good his wife said if you could knock a squirrel out of a tree with a rock or club a rabbit or two that would be even better if im lucky i will garivald answered of course if i were lucky there wouldnt be an algarvian within a hundred miles of zossen and isnt that the truth annore said bitterly well go on then maybe some small luck will help make up for the big heres hoping hand me the whetstone will you he took the hatchet off his belt and got the edge as sharp as he could while he was working for the algarvians he didnt care what state his tools were in dull ones gave him an excuse for going slower and doing less working for himself he wanted to do the job right he hurried out among the trees firewood and the chance to hunt werent all that drew him there in the quiet words shaped themselves in his head more readily than back in the village hed had a whole verse vanish from his mind when syrivald asked him a question at just the wrong time waddo expected a song to make winter nights pass more pleasantly garivald knew that was the piece he should have been working on naturally the other one he had in mind the one that urged unkerlanter women not to give their bodies to king mezentios soldiers kept forcing its way forward he threw a stone at a gray squirrel on die gray bark of a birch the stone slammed into the trunk a few inches to one side of the little animal the squirrel scurried around to the far side of the tree chattering reproachfully whore garivald muttered he chopped at a sapling unlike the squirrel it couldnt run away he stuffed lengths of the trunk and the bigger branches into a leather sack he carried over his shoulder as his body did the work his mind roamed free two verses centered on the word whore shaped themselves before he quite knew what had happened he quietly sang them to himself weighing the sounds seeing if the rhythm was right looking for ways to make the verses better by the time he went back to zossen hed have them just the way he wanted them after singing them he changed a couple of words then sang them again he was about to change one of the words back when someone behind him clapped his hands garivald whirled in alarm his hand tightening on the hatchets handle some of the villagers thought the best way to get along with the algarvians was to suck up to them anyone who tried taking this tale back to them would be sorry but the fellow whod clapped didnt come from zossen garivald had never seen him before he was skinny and dirty and meanlooking once upon a time his grimy tunic had been rockgray he carried a stick garivalds hatchet wasnt much against it he wasnt pointing it at garivald though instead he was nodding in slow approval good song he remarked and his accent proved he hadnt been born anywhere near the duchy of grelz did you make it aye garivald answered before realizing he should have lied thought sohadnt heard it before the stranger said aye a good song sing it over friend so i get it straight garivald did this time all the way through the stranger listened then made a peremptory gesture for him to do it again now the stranger sang along he had a good ear he made few mistakes my pals will like that he said aye in a few months people will be singing that all over the countryside not everyones given up against the algarvians no indeed not even after their behemoths ran over us whats the name of your village yonder zossen garivald answered zossen the strangera soldier who hadnt surrenderedrepeated zossen will hear from us one of these days he sketched a salute as if to an officer before slipping away between the trees he was far better in the woods than garivald and vanished almost at once fernao didnt know why hed been summoned to the royal palace in setubal the bored functionary whod linked crystals hadnt explained saying only all will be made clear upon your arrival sir in a way fernao supposed his caution made sense a good mage could spy on the emanations passing between two crystals but not knowing why he had to go to the palace irritated him as he got off the caravan car in front of the palace grounds an unpleasant thought crossed his mind what if it had to do with the exiled king penda of forthweg that was worse than irritating it was downright frightening he would have been perfectly happypowers above he would have been delightednever to see penda again he worried as he walked up the broad redbrick path toward the palace worried so much that at first he paid little attention to the building itself having lived his whole life in setubal played a part in that he took die palace for granted where a man who saw it but seldom would not have even for him it wasnt easy the lagoan royal palace cried out to be noticedcried out in a loud piercing voice it was built in the ornate algarvian style of the century before last the algarvian style carried to an extreme only the royal treasury could have supported everything leaped toward the heavens and everything was carved in incredible maniacal detail the entire history of lagoas up till that time appeared on the walls and buttresses and towers all of it perfect much of it swathed in gold leaf fernao wondered how many stonecutters had gone blind while the palace rose if anything the great bronze doors that led into the royal residence were even more astonishing than the building on them was the second battle of the strait of valmierain which not long before the palace went up lagoas had won a smashing victory over sibiuall picked out in enamelwork whose brilliance had not diminished a bit over the course of two centuries muttering under his breath fernao passed through those brazen doors and into the palace a dozen secretaries sat behind desks in the antechamber there he went up to one of them and gave his name a moment sorcerous sir if you please the fellow said let me consult my list of appointments he ran his finger down the sheet ah here you areand right on time too your appointment is with colonel peixoto in the ministry of war that is in the south wing sirgo through this hall and take the corridor to your left thank you very much fernao said the secretary bowed in his chair almost as ceremonious as an algarvian fernao walked through the antechamber with a new bounce to his stride only the splendor of his surroundings kept him from whistling as he walked whatever this was about it had nothing to do with penda and if it has nothing to do with penda he thought idont care what it is as he got farther from the parts of the palace where king vitor actually lived interior decoration grew less grandiose by the time he reached the offices of the ministry of wara good ten minutes walk from the antechamberhed come to surroundings in which he could actually imagine men doing serious work a uniformed clerk took charge of him after making him touch his guild cardhad he been an impostor the spot he touched would have glowed redthe clerk led him to peixotos office the lagoan colonel was younger and leaner than fernao had expected within a couple of years of the sorcerers own age he was also more enthusiastic than fernao had looked for in a soldier a pleasure to make your acquaintance sir a very great pleasure peixoto said springing from his seat to clasp fernaos hand here take a chair make yourself comfortable will you drink a glass of wine with me without waiting for an answer he clapped his hands the military clerk hurried in with a bottle and a couple of glasses the wine had the tang of oranges and lemons a jelgavan vintage fernao remarked without bothering to look closely at the bottle aye so it is colonel peixoto answered the algarvians make better but ill be cursed if i want any of theirs now id think i were drinking blood his face which seemed sunny most of the time clouded thats a filthy trick theyve pulled in unkerlant youre not a mage colonelyou have no notion how filthy it feels to me fernao said if youve called me here to try to put a stop to it i am your man and with all my heart he emptied his wineglass then poured it full again well in a manner of speaking sir mage in a manner of speaking peixoto said we aim to put a thorn under the wings of king mezentios dragons so we do and from all i can seehe rustled papers on his deskyou are the perfect manthe perfect man i tell youfor the job say on fernao told him ill do just that colonel peixoto replied curse me if i wont now theni see youve served as a ships mage you were doing that when the war broke out werent you cant very well hit the algarvians a proper lick unless we cross the sea to get at em can we no indeed fernao said the wine lent his voice extra solemnity although the research im working on now is important if you think i could best serve the kingdom by going back to sea ill do it peixoto beamed spoken like a patriot my dear sir but thats not precisely what we have in mind for you by your leave youre not far offdont get me wrongbut youre not quite on either plenty of magesplenty of lagoan mages anyhowgo to sea but do you knowdo you know sirthat only a handful of lagoan mages and fewer of the first rank have ever set foot on the land of the ice people fernao discovered hed made a mistake a dreadful mistake when hed decided he didnt care why hed been called to the palace so long as it had nothing to do with king penda colonel he said plaintively have you ever eaten boiled camel hump have you ever tried to gnaw through strips of dried and salted camel meat never once powers above be praised colonel peixoto sounded pleased that that was true too for which fernao could hardly blame him the mage wished it were true for himself peixoto went on but since you have that makes you all the more valuable for this expedition you must see that mustnt you what expedition demanded fernao who was not in the mood to see anything if he could help it why the one were planning to the austral continent of course peixoto said with a little bit of luckwith only a little bit of luck mind youwell throw out the yaninans and however many algarvians theyve got down there to give them a hand and then where will they be eh where then somewhere warm and civilized fernao answered colonel peixoto laughed heartily as if hed said something funny rather than speaking simple truth the mage asked why on earth are we mad enough to want to take the land of the ice people away from the yaninans as far as im concerned they did us a favor when they ran us out of it last year whats on the earth there doesnt matter not a bitno not a bit its whats in the earth that counts peixoto leaned forward and breathed a winesmelling word into fernaos face cinnabar ah the mage said indeed but still but me no buts my dear sir peixoto said without the austral continent algarve has not got a lot of cinnabar without cinnabar her dragons cannot flame nearly so fiercely as they can with it if we take it away that makes fighting the war harder for them can you tell me i am mistaken in any particular there no fernao admitted but can you tell me that whatever we have to spend to take the cinnabar from the land of the ice people away from mezentios men wont be twicethree timesfive timeswhat it costs them to do without peixoto beamed at him the colonel really was too cheerful to make a typical soldier ah a very nice point a very nice point indeed but you must recall we can think differently now that kuusamo has joined the fight on our side and we dont have to worry about being stabbed in the back algarvian folly there nothing else but i do recall that aye fernao said hed hoped it would mean the kuusamans would start sharing whatever they know of whatever they werent talking about so far it hadnt theyd kept blandly denying everything pointing to a map on the wall by the desk he continued but i also recall that sibiu sits over our route to the austral continent and that there are a certain number of algarvians and algarvian ships and algarvian leviathans and algarvian scouting dragons in sibiu its true every bit of its true nothing fazed peixoto i never said this would be easy sir mage i said we were going to undertake it if we succeed in landing men and dragons on the austral continent we will require sorcerers somewhat familiar with conditions thereand also with conditions in the waters thereabouts can you deny you are such a mage after his journey by leviathan back from the land of the ice people to lagoas fernao was more familiar with those waters than hed ever wanted to be i dont suppose i can deny it no he said wishing he could even so colonel peixoto held up a hand my dear sir your voluntary cooperation would be greatly appreciatedgreatly appreciated indeed it is not a requirement however fernao glared at him that was plain enoughunpleasant but plain you will dragoon me then if we must we will peixoto agreed we need you i promise you this the rewards of success will not be small neither for the kingdom nor for yourself nor will the penaltiesfor me anyhowbe small if we fail fernao said the kingdom i expect will survive it he sighed at least ill have till spring to prepare for this adventure oh no peixoto shook his head it will not be at once but we aim to move later in the winter the bad weather in the south will make it harder for the algarvians to spy out what were doing and we have more practice sailing in those waters during wintertime than they do practice dodging icebergs you mean fernao said and the colonel curse him nodded the mage went on and i suppose you intend landing your army at the edge of the ice pack and letting everyone march to real ground hed intended that for sarcasm to his dismay colonel peixoto nodded aye nothing better than taking the foe by surprise a blizzard at the wrong time would take us by surprise fernao remarked peixoto shrugged as if to say such things couldnt be helped fernao tried again what do you propose that we eat once we get down there well manage peixoto said after all the ice people do youre mad fernao said your superiors are mad and you want me to help save you from yourselves if thats how you care to put it peixoto said im going along when we go im not asking anything of you i dare not do myself oh dont turn algarvian on me fernao said crossly ill go he wondered how big a fool he was being nohe didnt wonder he knew eight leofsig turned to his younger brother and asked whos your friend in oyngestun this is the third letter youve got from there in the last couple of weeks he hadnt meant anything in particular by the question the last thing he expected was for ealstan to blush and look embarrassed and stammer out oh just uh somebody i uh got to know thats all it so patently wasnt all leofsig started to laugh ealstan glared at him somebody you got to know eh is she pretty he asked and then went on she must be pretty to get you all flustered like that and sure enough ealstans face lit up like a sunrise aye shes pretty he said in a low voice he glanced out toward the doorway of the bedroom they shared to make sure nobody was standing out in the courtyard and listening leofsig thought he was being foolish on a miserably chilly night like this one nobody in his right mind would want to linger out there well tell me more leofsig urged howd you meet her whats her name he had trouble thinking of his baby brother as being old enough to care about girls but ealstans beard was getting on toward manthick these days i met her gathering mushrooms ealstan answered still hardly above a whisper leofsig laughed again if that wasnt the way a quarter of the forthwegian writers ever born started their romances hed eat his shoes well i did curse it ealstan said but something more than silliness at being caught up in a cliche was on his face leofsig had trouble naming it whatever it was whats her name he asked again that other thing grew stronger on ealstans face now leofsig recognized it it was fear for a moment he didnt think his brother would answer him when at last ealstan did speak he said i wouldnt tell anybody but you not even father not yet anyhow her names vanai the whisper was so quiet leofsig had to lean forward to hear it why are you making such a secret out of he began and then before hed finished the sentence he understood exactly why oh he whistled softly because shes a kaunian aye ealstans voice was bleak when he chuckled the sound might have come from the throat of a weary cynical old man my sense of timing couldnt be better could it not if you tried for a year leofsig shook his head as stunned as if an egg had burst close by that would be hard enough any time now ealstan nodded now its a disaster but it happened anyhow and do you know what he stuck out his chin as if challenging not only leofsig but the whole world to make him take it back im glad it happened youre head over heels is what you are leofsig knew a stab of jealousy hed been taking felgilde out since before hed got summoned into king pendas levy and he didnt think hed ever felt about her the way ealstan obviously felt about this vanai but his brother had his eyes open too his wariness made that plain so did his next question leofsig do you think its true what people are saying about what the redheads did to the kaunians they shipped off to the west leofsig started to sigh his breath caught in his throat what emerged was more of a choking noise which seemed to fit i dont know he answered but that wasnt what ealstan had asked with another sigh a real one this time he went on by the powers above i hope not i wouldnt like to think that of anyone even the algarvians what hed like to think wasnt what ealstan had asked either i tell you this though it could be true the way they treated kaunians in the captives camp the way theyre treating them here aye it could be true i thought the same thingi was hoping youd tell me i was wrong ealstan said if youre rightif were rightking mezentios men could go into oyngestun for some more kaunians to send west and they might take her fear was back on his face it rubbed his voice raw and i wouldnt be able to do anything about it i wouldnt even know about it till i stopped hearing from her leofsig had never had such worries with felgilde for that matter he suspected she wouldnt be brokenhearted to see every kaunian vanish from forthweg he eyed his brother with mingled sympathy and surprise youve got a mans load of troubles there sure enough i dont know what to tell you i dont suppose you could move her here to gromheort could you ealstan shook his head not a chance she lives with her grandfather and even if i could the redheads would be as likely to grab her here as they would there he clenched his fists what am i going to do i dont know leofsig repeated that being kinder than saying theres nothing you can do after some thought he added you might tell father he wont get mad at you for being sweet on a kaunian girlyou know better than thatand he may be able to do you some good maybe ealstan didnt sound convinced i didnt want to tell anybody but you asked just the right questions he looked grim if i keep getting letters from oyngestun i wont need to do much telling will i not unless i want to do a lot of lying i mean from grim his features went to grimmer pretty soon sidrocs going to figure things out that wont be so good he already knows about her how does he again leofsig stopped in the middle of a question and answered it himself this is the girl whose basket you brought home last year he thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand angry he hadnt made the connection sooner aye it is ealstan said but we were just friends then not now he stopped abruptly not what leofsig asked ealstan sat on his stool and didnt answer by not answering he said everything that needed saying leofsig shook his head in bemusement hed only thought he was jealous of his younger brother before he had hopes he might enjoy felgildeprobably the night after he asked for her hand if he ever did that ealstan didnt have to live on hope struck him as most unfair he found another question what are you going to do now thats what weve been talking about ealstan said impatientlyand leofsig wasnt used to his little brothers being impatient with him either i dont know what to do i dont know if theres anything i can do and i dont want anybody else to know ive got to do anything i still think father could help leofsig said he helped me remember of course i remember ealstan said if i think of anything he might do ill ask him he suddenly looked very fierce but dont you dare say anything to him till i doif i ever do do you hear me leofsig had used that tone with ealstan any number of times up till now ealstan had never used it with him he started to bristle the set look on his brothers face warned that bristling would do no good and might do a lot of harm when he did speak his voice was still rough but not in the way it would have been a moment before just dont go and do anything stupid do you hear me oh aye i hear you ealstan answered the way things are going though who knows whether ill be able to listen to you i wish i could argue with that leofsig got up and clapped his brother on the shoulder i hope it turns out as well as it can for you thanks now ealstan sounded like the younger brother hed always been as he looked up at leofsig his smile seemed familiar toofor a couple of heartbeats but then his face hardened into that of a nearstranger again about as much as anybody can hope for these days isnt it seems that way leofsig thought about adding the hope that things would get better soon he held his tongue as far as he could see that hope would just rouse ealstan to bitter laughter contemplating it almost roused him to bitter laughter instead of laughing he yawned im going to bed shoving rocks around takes more work than algarvian irregular verbs good night ealstan said and then used an algarvian irregular verb that startled leofsig where did you learn that he asked the guards in the captives camp used to yell it at us from the constables his brother answered they call people that all the time they usually laugh when they say it though theyre whoresons aye but they arent as mean as the soldiers were maybe notsome of them dont seem to be bad fellows anyhow leofsig allowed but theyre still redheads having said that he thought hed given them all the condemnation necessary then discovering he was wrong he added and theyre the ones who loaded the kaunians into the caravans cars so they are ealstan grimaced id forgotten that i wonder how they sleep at night i dont know leofsig yawned again but i can tell you how im going to sleep tonight like a brick he soon proved himself right too a couple of evenings later while ealstan was wrestling with algarvian irregular verbs or his fathers bookkeeping problems hestan took leofsig out into the courtyard and quietly said something is troubling your brother do you know what it is aye leofsig answered he shivered a little the weather had got no warmer when he said no more than that his father clicked his tongue between his teeth is it anything where i could help him maybe leofsig said hestan waited to see if anything more was forthcoming when he found it wasnt he chuckled under his breath in a gamesome mood tonight are you all right ill come out and ask what is it i dont think i ought to tell you leofsig said he asked me not to ah hestan exhaled a lamp inside the kitchen and another in a bedroom showed the puff of fog that came from his mouth and nose whatever it is it has to do with those letters hes been getting from oyngestun doesnt it too late leofsig realized ealstan would have wanted him to say something like what letters when he didnt say that right away his father slowly nodded leofsigs sigh brought forth mist too i dont think id better say anything at all father why not hestan was still quiethe almost always wasbut now he was quietly angry i did you some good you know i might be able to do the same for your brother if i thought you could id tell you fast as a blaze leofsig said i wish i did but i dont have you got the pull to keep the redheads from shipping kaunians west hestan stood silent just for a moment his eyes widened glittering in the dim lamplight so he said a word that stood for a sentence or maybe two or three no i dont have that kind of pull no one has that kind of pull no one i know of ever so slightly his shoulders sagged i was afraid of that leofsig said without another word he and his father went back inside skarnu gave the sky a warning glance as if telling the powers above what they might and might not do in case they werent listening he spoke to his comrades too if it snows weve got trouble aye raunus gaze also flicked up toward those ugly gray clouds snow can make hiding your tracks a lot harder standing behind a barebranched chestnut merkela clung to the hunting stick that had been gedominus well try it anywayweve come too far not to she said and if it snows hard enough itll cover our tracks as fast as we make them a peasant whose farm lay on the far side of pavilosta a short dour middleaged man named dauktu shook his head if it snows that hard cursed simanull just stay inside his castle where its nice and warm instead of coming out acoursing he said all of the double handful of valmierans who hated count simanu and the algarvians propping him up enough to risk their lives to try to be rid of him looked toward the fortress of yellow limestone that crowned a hill halfway between pavilosta and adutiskis the other leading village in the county enkuru simanus father had made the place strong the way hed treated the local peasants hed needed a strong place of refuge this forlorn squad could not hope to go in there and get simanu out they had to hope the word theyd got was good and that he would come forth today after deer and boar and pheasant raunu said back before the days of eggtossers nobody could have stormed a keep like that even with eggtossers even with dragons a stubborn garrison in there could have made the algarvians work for a living skarnu said dauktu spat on the ground not enkuru he said bitterly he knew which side of his bread had honey on it as soon as the redheads looked like winning the war he rolled over on his back and showed em his throat and his belly the way any cowardly curdog would hes dead merkela said powers below eat him hes dead simanu deserves to be dead andher voice roughenedall the redheads deserve to be dead too what they did to gedominu her war with the algarvians was and always would be personal skarnu said what theyre doing now there in the west as merkelas had his voice trailed away none of the other valmierans said anything none of them wanted to meet his eye skarnu still didnt know how much faith to put in the rumors that swirled through his conquered kingdom he didnt want to believe any of them but with that much smoke he feared a fire had to be burning somewhere down at the bottom of it you wouldnt think even algarvians could do such a thing raunu said theyre whoresons aye but they fought clean enough taking all in all in the six yearswar barbarians always have been always will be dauktu spat again aye merkelas voice was fierce no onenot skarnu not raunu not the peasants whod known her all her lifehad had the nerve to tell her she might not come with the men on this raid had anyone tried she would have been more dangerous to him than the redheads were likely to prove the algarvians would say even kaunians do thus and so skarnu thought they have the whip hand though and theyre using it curse them he gave no outward sign of what was going through his mind seeing the enemys point of view was sometimes useful for an officer soldiers fought better when they reckoned the foe nothing but a barbarian a whoreson a horn call thin in the distance drove such thoughts from his mind he peered toward count simanus castle squinting to try to make his vision sharper is that the drawbridge coming down aye raunu said i cant hardly read at all without spectacles on my nose but i dont have any trouble with whats far away here he comes merkela breathed oh here comes the whole band of hunters her voice was soft but the passion it held matchedoutdideven her wildest moanings when she lay joined to skarnu in the bedchamber she had shared with gedominu skarnu had no trouble seeing that either every one of the hunters mounts was a brilliant gleaming white a white that glowed even under this dark lowering sky those arent horses he said theyre unicorns for swank aye dauktu said you didnt know about the herd the counts keep he shrugged well cant be helped i suppose youre not from here if skarnu lived out all his remaining days in this stretch of the kingdom people would he knew be saying youre not from here even when he was a doddering old man he put that out of his mind it makes our job harder he said unicorns are faster than horses and theyre smarter than horses too aye and all of those riders will have sticks of their own and theyll know what to do with them raunu said dont know about simanu but algarvian cowards are few and far between whatever else you say about the redheads if you havent got the stomach for the game you can still go back to the farm merkela told him you know better the veteran underofficer locked eyes with merkela she looked away first with a grudged nod skarnus respect for raunu already high went up another notch very few people were able to make merkela give ground hed had scant luck there himself and he was her lover another horn call sounded simanu and his cronies drew nearer some wore trousers others kilts they were all fine riders handling their unicorns with effortless ease the lead riderskarnu thought it was simanu himselfpointed in the direction of the thicket where the raiders waited raunu chuckled mirthlessly now we find out whos sold whom aye skarnu agreed did that groom tell us the count would come this way today because he couldnt stand his master or was he taking simanus money to suck us into the redheads web one of the peasants nodded in the direction of the fortress i dont see any more soldiers coming forth there and wed know if the algarvians had men in these woods theyd already be at us what he meant by that was wed already be dead since skarnu thought the fellow was right he didnt argue simanu shouted something the count was still too far away for skarnu to make out his words but he sounded carefree maybe that meant he was a good actor skarnu hoped it meant he suspected nothing we dont start blazing too soon he warned his comradesmerkela in particular this is likely to be the best chance well ever have if we waste it were stuck with the bugger forevermore he wondered if he ought to be talking like that simanu was a reprobate but he was also a member of skarnus class nobles who maligned their fellows to commoners got themselves a bad name but what of nobles who went to bed with the algarvians what did they get not half what they deserve skarnu thought hed do his best to fix that simanu shouted something else this time skarnu caught a phraseafter a wild boarthough the breeze blew away the rest one of the algarvians answered in his own language then simanu said something in algarvian too the rhythms and trills were unmistakable skarnu didnt know why that should have surprised him but it did and infuriated him too closer raunu said softly let em come closer he might have been watching a wary doe approaching a deadfall we dont want to spook em by before he could finish one of the peasants at the far end of their little line started blazing the kaunian behind simanu threw up his hands and slid bonelessly off his unicorn it was a very fine blaze skarnu didnt think he could have matched it not at that range oh you cursed fool he muttered under his breath because it was such a fine blaze who else would have the chance to get an easier one no help for it now simanu and his henchmen were already shouting in alarm skarnu shouted too lets get them he raised his stick to his shoulder aimed at simanu and blazed the collaborationist counts unicorn reared let out a horrid shriek and then toppled skarnu and his friends cheered then they cried out again this time in dismay simanu had managed to kick free now he lay behind the beasts thrashing body and started blazing toward the woods most of his henchmen galloped back toward the safety of the keep a couple of men thoughboth algarvians skarnu saw with mixed admiration for their courage and shame that they had no valmierans with themspurred their unicorns straight for the woods they blazed as they came buying time for their comrades to get away they couldnt have known how many foes they faced or just where among the trees those foes hid but they attacked anyhow several beams converged on them merkela used gedominus hunting stick for all it was worth as each redhead fell she grunted breathily as she might have done while building toward her peak of pleasure with skarnu atop her when they both lay unmoving she nodded to him you were right she said they are brave now these two are brave and dead which is better yet aye skarnu said a hole appeared in a branch too close to his head for comfort but simanus not dead curse him and hes got some cover wed best do something about him quick too raunu said theyve seen somethings wrong back there in the castle well have all of simanus cursed retainers coming down on us if we hang around too long aye skarnu called quick orders to dauktu and the other raiders at the far end of the line they didnt obey automatically as true soldiers would have had to do and while were up to that whats your part of the game dauktu demanded youll see skarnu said i wont shrink i promise nowdo you want simanu dead or dont you that decided the peasants they started blazing at the count without taking so much trouble about their cover one of them cried out in pain a moment later too for simanu was alert and no bad blazer himself but while he traded beams with the raiders skarnu burst from cover a good ways away and rushed toward him as soon as the unicorns body no longer shielded the count skarnu raised his stick and blazed he was almost too late simanu had already started to swing back toward him but his beam caught simanu in the face the count wailed and went limp skarnu waited to see no more but dashed back toward the trees when he stood panting by merkela again she kissed him as ferociously as she had when hed shouted against simanu in pavilostas market square lets get out of here he said when after some long and mostly enjoyable time he broke free she didnt argue with him neither did any of the other raidershed won his spurs today but even as he fled he wondered what the algarvians would do tomorrow or the day after that officially leudast remained a corporal no one had bothered with the paperwork that would have promoted him unkerlant had neither time nor energy to spare on paperwork these days unkerlant had neither time nor energy to spare for anything save survival and even survival looked to be too much to hope for unofficially leudast led a couple of squads in the company sergeant magnulf just as unofficially commanded captain hawart headed the regiment of which that company was a part none of them had the rank for his job they were all still alive and still fighting back against the algarviansa less formal qualification but good enough cold wet filthy and frightened leudast peered east out of the hole in the ground he shared with magnulf one thought was uppermost in his mind when are they going to do it again curse me if i know magnulf answered wearily he looked as worn and disheveled as leudast felt spitting into the mud at the bottom of the hole he went on i could fight the redheads aye they kept coming forward but they paid for every inch of ground they stole from us but this he shook his head a man caught in the grip of horror this leudast echoed he shook his head too and what are we doing to fight back we keep bringing up more men but so what the algarvians murder another raft of poor whoresons who never did em any harm and they smash right through us again he looked over his shoulder toward the southwest if they smash through us two or three times more theyre in cottbus and what do we do then he only half heard magnulf s reply hed spotted a soldier trudging through the pitted muck toward them the fellow called captain hawarts coming up to the front and hes got some big blaze with him leudast glanced over at magnulf who still outranked him with an angry gesture magnulf said aye tell em to come ahead well give em pheasant under glass just like were having and they can sleep on the same featherbeds we use with a couple of chunks of stale moldy bread in his wallet and a grimy blanket for a mattress leudast couldnt help snickering the soldier shrugged and trotted away hed delivered his message past that he didnt care what happened in a lazy sort of way the algarvians started lobbing eggs at the line the unkerlanters held a couple landed close enough to the hole in which leudast and magnulf sheltered to splash fresh mud onto them the captain would come forward in this leudast said but any big blazed turn up his toesor else pick em up and run away he paused considered and corrected himself any big blaze but marshal rathar he was right there in the thick of it up in zuwayza hes not afraid to mix it magnulf agreed now he looked back toward the rear and a moment later let out a low whistle of surprise turns out youre wrong here comes the captain and hes got somebody in a clean tunic with him hawart got down into the hole with leudast and magnulf without hesitation he knew it could keep him alive the fellow with him a cleverlooking man of middle years got into it with wrinkled lip as if fearing his tunic wouldnt stay clean sir hawart said to him let me present to you magnulf and leudast theyve been in this fight from the start and they want to stay in it to the finish boys this is archmage addanz the top wizard in the whole kingdom king swemmel has seen fit to honor me with the highest rank addanz said whether i have the highest skill in all the land may perhaps be a different question leudast wasnt inclined to quibble then you can stop the algarvians when they hurl their magic at us he asked eagerly thatd be wonderful magnulf exclaimed let us fight the redheads man against man and well lick em the unkerlanters hadnt licked king mezentios men even before they started using their bloodsoaked magecraft but theyd fought hard enough to lend magnulfs words some weight one look at addanzs face told leudast his first wild hope was indeed too wild you cant do it he said he didnt mean it to sound like an accusation but that was how it came out i cannot do it not yet the archmage said i do not know if i will ever be able to do such a thing what i can do what i hope to do now is to drop an egg on them of the same sort as they have been dropping on us what do you leudast broke off he didnt need to have addanz draw him a picture like anyone else whod grown up in an unkerlanter peasant village he knew how hard life could be he asked only one question will it work sergeant magnulf whod grown up close to the duchy of grelznow again the kingdom of grelz under mezentios cousinfound another one can you do that and not have the people rise up against king swemmel and for the algarvians people who knew grelzers well always thought in terms of uprisings i can do it addanz answered my mages and i under the orders of the king have already begun to do it the algarvians will make far harsher masters than king swemmel so of course the people will follow him that meant he didnt know and no one else did either another egg burst near the hole splattering the soldiers and the mage with more mud unkerlanter eggtossers slow as usual began throwing sorcerous energy back at the algarvians about time leudast growled sometimes i think weve forgotten about fighting back since the redheads started doing this to us that wasnt fair and he knew it but he didnt much care about being fair hed come too close to dying too many times to care about being fair addanz clucked reproachfully leudast remembered he had king swemmels car if he chose to remember a name if he chose to mention that name to the king if he chose to do that leudast would regret saying what he thought perhaps the archmage of unkerlant was about to reprove him if he was he never got the chance he stiffened his mouth hanging open then he groaned as if a beam had burnt its way through his body they die he croaked in a voice that suggested he might be dying himself oh they die mezentios men at their butchery again captain hawart demanded addanz managed to nod aye he gasped and we have not gathered enough men behind our line to try to block them altogether he gasped again as if hed run a long way didnt expect them to smite again so soon leudast knew what that had to mean but didnt want to dwell on it he didnt have time to dwell on it either he spoke urgently wed better get out of this hole when the algarvians start their spells places like this have a way of closing up all of a sudden hes right magnulf said he leudast and hawart started to scramble out so did addanz but his effort was feeble and plainly hopeless with a curse leudast jumped back into the mud at the bottom of the hole and heaved the archmage up to magnulf and hawart then he got out again himself my thanks addanz said he looked as if hed just gone through a fourday battle you have no notion of what it is like for a mage to feel the trapped death throes of so many at once how the algarvian sorcerers do what they do without blazing out their minds is beyond me their hearts are surely colder than winter in grelz however the algarvian mages did what they did they chose that moment to loose their latest sorcerous onslaught the ground shuddered beneath leudast like the body of a man shackled to the whipping post when the lash bites he imagined he heard it groan like a man under the lash too flames sprang upward all around as if fire mountains were erupting all over the field here and there men caught in those flames screamedbut not for long with a wet sucking noise the lips of the hole in the ground by leudasts feet pulled together they would have been pulled together had they been down in the hole too you were right to get us out of there hawart said i hope we didnt have too many men trapped this time addanz groaned once more as he had a couple of minutes before are they doing it again sir mage sergeant magnulf asked leudast understood the alarm in his voice the algarvians had never struck two such sorcerous hammer blows back to back going through one was bad enough could flesh and bloodto say nothing of earth and stonestand two but the archmage of unkerlant shook his head speech just then seemed beyond him his head was turned back toward the west toward land unkerlant still held not toward the east and the algarvians oh by the powers above leudast whispered no addanz croakedhe could talk after all by the powers below murder piled on murder and where shall it end tears trickled through the dirt on his face he was dirty by now almost as dirty as the soldiers around him captain hawart spoke as gently as he could were only doing it because the redheads did it first were doing it to try to defend ourselves if mezentio hadnt done it we would never have taken it up all that was surely true none of it seemed to console the archmage he swayed back and forth back and forth as if mourning something he would never see againa cleaner time perhaps leudast started to reach out to set a hand on his shoulder but he stopped with the motion stillborn sooner than it had under any of the algarvians earlier sorcerous onslaughts the ground steadied beneath him the flames shrank most of them though not all vanished i think sir mage your comrades back there did us a good turn only then did he think of the peasantshe supposed they were peasantswho must have perished in the unkerlanter countermagic he didnt suppose they thought addanzs sorcerous comrades had done them a good turn here come the redheads magnulf said algarvian behemoths lumbered toward the battered unkerlanter line footsoldiers trotted along to help protect them and to take advantage of the holes they tore horse and unicorn cavalry swift but vulnerable trailed after them if the holes were big enough the cavalry would tear through too and spread chaos in the unkerlanter rear do you know i think we may just give them a nasty surprise captain hawart said this time maybe they think theyve kicked us harder than they really have leudast wasnt thinking about that he was scurrying toward the nearest hole he could find over his shoulder he called get the archmage out of here this isnt his kind of fight it was leudast s kind of fight he started blazing at the advancing algarvians he wasnt the only one eitherfar from it the redheads started dropping even without their magics working as well as they would have liked they kept coming though leudast had fought them for too long to think they were cowards he wished they had been unkerlant would have suffered far less fall back captain hawart shouted as hed had to shout so many times unwillingly leudast obeyed lest the algarvians get behind him as clashes went these days the unkerlanters had done well by the time nightfall brought fighting to an end leudast and his comrades had lost only about a mile of ground every once in a while a handful of unkerlanter dragons would appear over bishah drop a few eggs and then flee back toward the south they did little damage hajjaj judged they didnt come intending to do much damage but rather to remind the zuwayzin that king swemmel hadnt forgotten about them even if he was involved in bigger fights elsewhere after the third or fourth visit the zuwayzi foreign minister noticed something else most of the eggs the unkerlanters dropped fell near the algarvian ministry he remarked on that to balastro when king mezentios minister to zuwayza held a reception i think you are trying to gather all the diplomats in the city here together to be wiped out at one stroke are you sure youre not in king swemmels pay rather than that of your own sovereign marquis balastro threw back his head and laughed uproariously ah your excellency you do both me and the unkerlanter dragonfliers aim too much credit he said lamplight glittered off his badges of nobility and rank and also off the silver threads that ran through his tunic far from being naked as hed come to hajjaj s hillside estate tonight he displayed full algarvian plumage that was literally true in his hatband glowed three bright feathers from some bird or another out of tropical siaulia hajjaj minded clothes tonight less than usual with the sun almost as low in the north as it ever went the weather was cool by zuwayzi standards mild by those of algarve he didnt feel as if his own tunic and kiltnot nearly so splendid as balastroswere trying to smother him some date wine your excellency balastro asked we have what the dealer assured me was an excellent vintageif thats the word one uses for date winesthough i hope you will forgive me for admitting i have not sampled it myself i may forgive you eventually but not soon hajjaj smiled and the algarvian minister to zuwayza laughed again balastro was a charming fellow goodnatured clever cultured hajjaj eyed him wondering how he could be all he was and yet but that would wait it would have to wait for now the zuwayzi foreign minister ambled over to the bar the algarvian servitor behind it bowed and asked what may i get you sir in fairly good zuwayzi that made him likelier to be a spy than a tapman by trade but these days hajjaj assumed everyone a spy till proved otherwise painful experience with his secretary had taught him that was safest balastro was eyeing him to see what hed choose as much to humor the redhead as to please his own palate he did ask for date wine when the servitor poured it from the jar hajjajs eyes widened pressed from the golden dates of shamiyah he exclaimed and the algarvian nodded hajjaj bowed partly to him partly to the wine you do me great honor indeed and great harm to king mezentios purse he sipped the lovely tawny stuff almost he went over to grab balastro by the scruff of the neck and force him to taste the wine himself in the end he refrained balastro would say all the right things but he would not mean them no man who came to dates after grapes could appreciate them as they deserved to be appreciated hajjaj could and did sipping he eyed the gathering it was not what it would have been in times of peace ansovald the unkerlanter minister had been sent south over the border once more when war between his kingdom and zuwayza resumed the ministries of forthweg and sibiu and valmiera and jelgava stood empty untenanted zuwayza was not formally at war with either lagoas or kuusamo but algarve was and balastro could hardly have been expected to invite his kings foes that left delegations from algarve from yanina from gyongyos from small neutral ortah which no doubt thanked the powers above for the mountains and swamps that let her stay neutral and of course from zuwayza hajjaj was far from the only darkskinned person making the best of clothes tonight the yaninan minister to zuwayza was a plump bald little man named iskakis he had the hairiest ears of any man hajjaj had ever seen on his arm was his wife who couldnt have had more than half his years and whose elegant sculpted features bore an expression of permanent discontent hajjaj knewhe wasnt sure whether she did tooiskakis had a taste for boys for a man with that taste to be married to such a woman seemed a sad waste but hajjaj could do nothing about it iskakis was telling a gyongyosian almost twice his size about the triumphs yaninan soldiers were running up in unkerlant neither he nor the big yellowbearded man spoke algarvian perfectly being from the other side of broad derlavai the gyongyosian might not know most of the triumphs iskakis was describing were as imaginary as the yaninans command of the perfect tense the yaninan minister did not brag of his kingdoms might to algarvians horthy the gyongyosian minister to zuwayza made his way over to hajjaj he was a big man too his beard streaked with gray you do not seem joyful your excellency he said in classical kaunian the only tongue he and hajjaj had in common hearing kaunian spoke inside the algarvian ministry and using it himself made hajjaj s mouth twist again he put that aside answering i have been to too many of these gatherings to let one more overwhelm me the wine is very good ah is it so i understand that i have not seen so many as you siri honor your yearsbut i too have seen enough horthy pointed to the goblet and you say you esteem that wine i do hajjajs smile held an edge of selfmockery but it is made from a fruit of my countryto his annoyance he couldnt come up with the classical kaunian word for datesrather than grapes and is not to everyones taste i shall try it the gyongyosian minister declared as if hajjaj had questioned his manhood he marched over to the bar and returned with a goblet of shamiyah wine raising it to his lips he said may the stars grant you health and many more years he sipped paused thoughtfully and sipped again after another pause he delivered his verdict i would not care to drink it and nothing else but it goes well enough as a change from the usual most zuwayzin say the same of grape wine hajjaj said as for myself your excellency i agree with you marquis balastro is a good host he lays in something to please all of us horthy leaned forward toward hajjaj and lowered his voice now if only he had laid in victory too he did invite us here some little while ago hajjaj replied also quietly perhaps he expected to be celebrating victory tonight and in truth algarve has won great victories against unkerlantas has gyongyos of course your excellency he bowed to horthy not wanting to slight his kingdom our war against unkerlant is what our wars against unkerlant have always been the gyongyosian minister replied with a massive shrug a slow hard halfhearted business in that countryside what else can it be he laughed a rumble deep in his chest do you see the irony sir we of gyongyos pride ourselvesand with justiceon being a warrior race yet the stars have decreed that we are because of our placement in the uttermost west of derlavai hard pressed these days to fight a war worthy of our mettle hajjaj raised an eyebrow i hope you will not take it amiss if i tell you that kingdoms may have troubles far worse than the one you name i did not expect you to understand horthy sipped again at the date wine few if any outside the dominions of ekrekek arpad do the algarvians sometimes come near to the thing but even they he shook his big head i believe they at the moment face a problem the opposite of yours hajjaj said now horthys eyebrows climbed toward his hairline hajjaj explained do you not think algarve may have undertaken a war beyond her mettle however great that may beand i hasten to add i think it is very great indeed i mean no offense when i say i believe you are mistaken horthy replied and is it not so that you may be speaking too soon king mezentios armies still move westward aye they do hajjaj let out a sigh far more wintry than even the coolest night in zuwayza but do they move forward by virtue of their mettle or through some other means consider the language we use your excellency you spoke before of irony do you see no irony here ahhh horthy said a long slow exhalation now i take your meaning where i did not before worse that the unkerlanters slaughter their own in my view we differ hajjaj said politely as soon as he could do so with propriety he disengaged himself from the gyongyosian minister a toast count balastro called he had to call several times to gain the attention of all the feasters when at last he had it he raised his glass on high to the grand and glorious triumph of those united against the vast barbarism that is unkerlant to refrain from drinking would have made hajjaj stand out too much the things i do in the name of diplomacy he thought as he raised his goblet to his lips he did not sip now but tossed back the date wine it was sweet and potent and mounted to his head he found himself moving through the crowd toward balastro how now your excellency the algarvian minister said with a wide friendly smile it faded as he got a good look at hajjajs face how now indeed my friend balastro asked what troubles you he was hajjajs friend that made what the zuwayzi had to say harder he spoke anyhow though in a voice he hoped only balastro would hear shall we also drink a toast to the vast barbarism that is algarve balastro did not pretend to be ignorant of what hajjaj was talking about for that hajjaj gave him reluctant credit we do what we must do to win the war balastro said and the kaunians have long oppressed us youve lived in algarve you know that for yourself why blame us and not them when your armies broke into the marquisate of rivaroli which valmiera took from youunjustly in my viewafter the six years war did your foes massacre the algarvians there to gain the sorcerous power that might have thrown you back hajjaj asked he answered his own question they did not and they could have as you must admit what they did to us in the years before that was as bad as a massacre balastro said for long and long we fought among ourselves kaunian catspaws let people wail and moan as they please your excellency i feel not the least bit of guilt he threw out his chest and looked fierce i am sorry for you then hajjaj said sadly and turned away we grow strong and you grow strong with us riding on our backs balastro said are you not ungrateful to complain about the road when you wanted revenge on unkerlant hajjaj turned back that held enough truth to sting who now will want revenge on algarve your excellency and for what good reasons he asked balastro s shrug was a masterpiece of both indifference and algarvian theatricality my dear fellow it will matter very little once we are the masters of derlavai whoever wants revenge on us will no more be able to have it than a dog howling at the moon can make it come down for him surely the lords of the kaunian empire at the height of their glory thought the same hajjaj replied and had the doubtful pleasure of seeing balastro look very indignant indeed cornelu felt no small pride at finally making it down into tirgoviste town he even had giurgius leave to spend an extra couple of days there before returning to the woodcutting gang he hadnt had to offer to fight the gang boss again to get it either hed lost their last encounter but had won a measure of respect and so now bundled up against the icy south wind he walked along the edge of the harbor he might look like a rustic in town to sell firewood but he surveyed the quays with a practiced eye the algarvians didnt have so heavy a naval presence here as sibiu had but he wouldnt have wanted to try breaking into the harbor against what they did have he cursed under his breath cursed the surprise that had let mezentios men overpower his kingdom and cursed their cleverness too how he wished a storm had blown up while their sailing ships were on the sea but wishes were useless things no one could change what had been not the greatest mage ever born he ambled along as if he hadnt a thought in his head and presently paused by the leviathan pens an algarvian sailor was tossing fish from a bucket to a leviathan not a quarter so fine as eforiel had been cornelu paused to watch the fellow at his work he paused too long the sailor noticed him and growled get moving you stinking sib before we find out how this fellow likes your taste cornelu probably would have understood that without speaking algarvian were he a woodcutter whod understood it what would he do he did it he nodded looked frightened and hurried away behind him the algarvian laughed cornelu knew what a leviathans jaws could do to a man he wished the beast in the pen would do that to the sailor one more wish he wouldnt see fulfilled why do i linger here he wondered hed gathered a little intelligence to whom could he report it no onenot a lagoan not a sibian all hed done was briefly become the ghost of what hed once been after starting toward a dockside eatery he checked himself hed eaten there too often back in the days when sibiu was a free kingdom and he an officer in king burebistus service someone might recognize him in spite of his poorly shaved chin and shabby clothes most sibians loathed their algarvian occupiers a few though the posters calling for sibians to join the fight against unkerlant were still pasted to walls and fences king mezentio had to be drawing recruits from the five islands of sibiu that he was shamed cornelu farther inland he could crumble twicebaked bread into pea soup at a place where hed never gone while wearing sibius uniform the meal he got showed hed known what he was doing when he stayed away too but it made his belly stop growling like an angry dog he set silver on the table and stalked out before long he found himself walking along his own street that was stupidly dangerous and he knew it old neighbors were far likelier to know him for who and what he was than were waiters at a seaside eatery he couldnt help himself though there stood his house it looked very much as it always had the flowers in front of it were dead and the grass yellow and dying but that happened every winter smoke rose from the chimney someone was at home costache just costache well just costache and brindza or was one of the algarvian officers quartered there or more than one at the house too if one of the algarvians answered he could beg and then shamble away theyd be none the wiser but if it was costache if it was costache hed posted a note saying he was coming into town and suggesting they meet tomorrow to protect her and himself hed signed it your country cousin and used a false name she would know his hand all at once tomorrow seemed impossibly far away he started up his own walk aye a risk but one he couldnt help taking he was about to set his foot on the first step leading up to the porch when a man spoke inside the house those trilling rs could only come from an algarvians mouth cornelu hesitated hating himself for hesitating but the risk had just gone up as he was about to go on despite that risk costache laughed shed always had an easy friendly laugh it had brightened cornelus day whenever he heard it now he heard her lightly giving it to one of king mezentios men that wounded him almost as much as if hed peeked in their bedroom window and seen her limbs entwined with the algarvians in the act of love he turned away staggering a little as if hed taken a beam from a stick but his stride firmed faster than it would have after a physical wound he no longer worried about being recognized who would know him with this black scowl distorting his features tomorrow he muttered under his breath as he hurried away from his neighborhood tomorrow if the powers above were kind hed see his wife maybe she would have an explanation that satisfied him for the life of him he couldnt imagine what it would be with the remains of naval discipline he walked past half a dozen taverns if he started drinking he would either drink himself blind or drink himself angry he could easily see himself storming up to his own front door with ale or spirits coursing through him and trying to kill all the algarvians in his house or maybe trying to slap costache around for not being distant enough to them that he could also see the tragedy that would follow immediately thereafter made the picture only a little less tempting he bought a sack of crumbs at the edge of a park and tossed them to pigeons and sparrows till late autumns early dusk came a couple of algarvian soldiers walked by but they didnt bother him he wasnt the only fellow passing time in the park feeding the birds as soon as the sun sank below the northwestern horizon the wind picked up it seemed to blow straight through him and carried the bite of the land of the ice people where it had originated it blew the park empty in short order cornelu hoped the others who were leaving had better places to go than he he ate fried clams and allowed himself one mug of ale at a tavern that also sold meals the clams werent bad but the ale had been watered to the point where two or three mugs would have done little to him next door stood a rooming house where he bought a cubicle for the night the tiny chamber barely had room for the bed and the cheap nightstand that held a cup basin and pitcher the mattress smelled sour when he lay down on it he might have done better rolled in a blanket in the park but he might not have too the algarvians might have picked him up for being out after curfew he didnt want to fall into their hands for any reason eventually he slept it was still dark when he woke the clouds in the northeast had gone from black to dull gray though so dawn wasnt far away he scratched hoping the nasty bed didnt have bugs in it then got dressed went downstairs and walked out of the rooming house a new clerk had come on duty sometime in the night but he looked as sullen and indifferent as the fellow from whom cornelu had rented his little room he went back to the tavern it was already crowded with fishermen fortifying themselves for the day ahead the fried bread cornelu ordered sat like a boulder in his stomach the only resemblance the murky brown liquid the tavern served bore to tea was that it was hot he drank it without complaint on a morning like this heat sufficed after stretching breakfast till sunrise cornelu went back to the park a sibian constable strolling through looked at him as if he were crazy even after he displayed the bag of crumbs still half full the birds appreciated him though and came close to feeding right from his hand he stretched out the bread crumbs too making them last till nearly noon then he got up brushed his hands on his kilt and left the park for the short walk to the bell tower at the edge of tirgovistes old market square hed asked costache to meet him there shed better he said as he made his way through the square by the powers above shed better clang clang thebells blared out noon just as cornelu got to the base of the tower he looked around the square wasnt crowded not the way it would have been before the algarvians came but he didnt see his wife and then he did his heart leaped here she came striding with determination across the square if he could be alone with her even for a few minutes but he wouldnt be for she was pushing the baby carriage ahead of her brindzas head popped up as she looked out cornelu knew he shouldnt hate his daughter but remembering that wasnt easy when she kept coming between him and costache he knew better than to show what was going through his mind he smiled and waved and stepped forward to embrace her he squeezed her to him she raised her mouth to his after a long breathless kiss he murmured oh its good to see you again see you wasnt exactly what he meant feel you came closer and you costache said a quaver in her voice that sent tingles through cornelu she looked him over with an expression he recognized comparing what she recalled to what she saw after a moment she clucked in distress youve got so thin and hardlooking i cant help it he answered ive been working hard mama brindza said and then up king burebistu could have given no more imperious command costache picked up her daughtermy daughter too cornelu reminded himself his wife looked tired hed thought that the first time he saw her after coming back to tirgoviste he said i wish you could have found a way to leave her at home she shook her head mezentios men wont take care of her for me curse them ive asked aye curse them cornelu agreed he eyed his wife again but you were laughing with one of them yesterday how do you know that costache asked in surprise when he told her she went pale im so glad you didnt knock she exclaimed all three of them were there youd be in a captives camp now every day im away from you i feel like im in a captives camp cornelu complained this whole island is a captives camp this whole kingdom is a captives camp what else would you call it costache gave back a pace before his fury brindza stared at him with wide green eyes the same shade as her mothers after a moment costache said things are hard aye but theyre worse in the camps when the algarvians let people out of them they come back as skeletons i think half the reason mezentios men turn them loose is to frighten other people she spoke calmly reasonably logically she made good sense she said not a word cornelu cared to hear have you any notion of how much i want you he burst out aye his wife answered in a low voice but i dont know when we can i dont know if well ever be able to not till the war is over if it ever is cornelu started to slap her for saying such a thing before the motion was well begun though he turned it into a quick spin away from costache hed never imagined he could wish hed stayed up in the hills chopping wood but he did snow blew into tealdos face it numbed his left side worse than his right for he still marched northwest in the direction of cottbus while the wind roared up from the southwest from the austral continent and the iceclogged narrow sea he wasnt used to snow growing up in the north of algarve hed seen it but seldom before joining king mezentios army his education in such matters was advancing faster than hed ever wanted beside him trasone let out a chuckle either that or tealdos friend was starting to come down with pneumonia you look like a scarecrow trasone said raising his voice to be heard over the endless ravening wind heh tealdo answered nobodyd pinch your bum if you were walking along the streets of trapani dressed like that either too true trasone said aye its too true what we both look like is a couple of madmen who bought out a rummage sale everybody in the whole regiment looks the same way trasone said if wed had some decent winter gear shipped out to us we wouldnt have had to steal from every unkerlanter village we went through either an inspecting officer would have had trouble proving he was even in uniform he had on a long unkerlanter tunic over his short tunic and kilt a horse blanket over that and a rabbitfur cap on his head in place of the dapper but not nearly warm enough hat hed been issued trasone s garb was similarly outlandish winter gear trasone chuckled again sounding even more ghastly than before theyre having trouble shipping kaunians forward to kill and youre worrying about winter gear too stinking many unkerlanters running around loose behind us and with what they do to ley lines its like the powers below have been eating them thats all so no doubt about it tealdo paused to knock snowand possibly frozen snot with itout of his mustache but if i freeze to death im not going to care about the miserable kaunians i dont know if wed have got as far as we have without slaughtering them trasone said you just said theyre having trouble bringing the blond buggers forward but were still advancing tealdo said what does that tell you about how much difference theyve made trasone shook his head which made the earflaps of his own looted fur cap flop up and down you wont sneak that by me so easy now that its snowing the grounds frozen up and our behemoths can get going again as if to prove his point a couple of the big beasts trotted past the footsoldiers the behemoths were draped in stolen blankets too their riders had covered them in preference to covering themselves if the behemoths froze to death their crewmen turned into footsoldiers and not very useful footsoldiers at that one of the men waved a mittened hand to tealdo and trasone tealdo waved back he wore mittens too which kept the fellow on the behemoth from seeing the gesture he shaped he went back to the argument with trasone the footings better for the unkerlanter behemoths too you know ahh that doesnt help them so much trasone said with a scornful wave the unkerlanters mostly dont know what to do with behemoths even when the ground is all right a good thing too or wed both likely be dead by now tealdo thought about rising to that to that even though he knew it was true but he saw a couple of men standing by a series of low rises in the snow he needed a moment to realize the men were mages they looked as draggled as everyone else in the algarvian army these days whats toward he called to them see for yourself one of them answered though the wind almost blew his words away from tealdo curious tealdo ambled over the mage kicked at one of the ridges in the snow it turned out to be the body of an unkerlanter not a soldier but a peasant woman her throat had been cut the mage said this is how they fight back against uswith their folk as victims me id sooner kill kaunians than algarviansill say that tealdo remarked but if were doing it and now theyre doing it too wouldnt it be better if both sides stopped since its pretty much evened out if one side stopped and not the other that could meanwould meandisaster the mage said sometimes climbing onto a wolf is easier than climbing off again maybe somebody should have thought of that before we went and got into this lousy war with unkerlant in the first place tealdo said this is a cursed big wolf and i ought to know ive walked every miserable inch of the way from the yaninan border to here it is the inches you have yet to walk that truly matter the mage said what could be more important than taking cottbus staying alive tealdo thought he kept that to himself judging hed already pushed the mage about as far as he could he started marching once more trotting a little to catch up to trasone snow kept swirling down the stuff was very pretty to watch but tealdo wouldnt have been sorry never to see it again by the time evening came he had to lift up his foot at every step which made him slow and awkward despite the hard ground under his feet captain galafrone chose a grove of firs as a halting place tealdo had hoped for a village but this would do the trees grew close enough together to make a good windbreak he sat down on the leeward side of one of the first this isnt as easy as they thought it would be back home he said captain galafrone looked like an old man now hed given everything his kingdom asked of him and more but he had very little left to give wearily he said can somebody get a fire going before we all freeze to death with the fir trees breaking the force of the wind and keeping off a good bit of the snow tealdo used his stick to start a small blaze it wasnt really enough to keep the soldiers warm but it did make them feel a little better somebody said after we take cottbus and drive king swemmel off into the wilderness this will seem worthwhile my arse trasone exclaimed thisll be fornicating dreadful if we look back on it a hundred years from now and half of unkerlants a fornicating wilderness what do you call this where were at right now a fornicating playground we still have to take cottbus galafrone said rallying a little at the sight of the flames id like to see swemmel try and fight a war without the place maybe just maybe tealdo said in speculative tones we could spend some time out of the line let some other people take it on the chin for a while cant let our mates down galafrone said reproachfully no i suppose not tealdo agreed and his comrades nodded he went on not letting my mates down is about the only reason i see for going forward anymore i dont care one pile of behemoth dung for the greater glory of algarve ill tell you that the rest of the redheaded soldiers nodded again galafrone said anybody who went through the six years war knows what glorys worthnot even a pile of shit like you said but we lost that war and all our neighbors made us pay if we dont want to pay again wed better win this one oh aye tealdo said i remember how glad they were when we marched into the duchy of bari that started us getting our own back he shook his head in slow chilly wonder two years ago now two years and more a lots happened since i wonder how glad the folk of bari are now that we marched in then trasone said now they get the joys of fighting in unkerlant too that wasnt the first thing on their minds back then i bet first thing on their minds then was screwing us till we couldnt see straight fond reminiscence filled sergeant panfilos voice i like the way they thought captain galafrone climbed to his feet like tealdo says that was awhile ago now us weve still got a war to fight come on lets go do it as soon as the algarvians came out of the shelter of the wood unkerlanters started blazing at them from behind snowcovered bushes tealdo threw himself down on his belly in the snow a beam made steam hiss up from the white powder a couple of feet away from him when he blazed back more steam rose from the cover king swemmels men were using he thought the troopers under galafrones command outnumbered their unkerlanter foes galafrone evidently thought the same thing for he sent out flanking parties to left and right to make the unkerlanters give ground or risk being blazed from three sides at once a couple of his men fell but more gained the positions to which theyd been running and then a pair of algarvian behemoths came up from the southeast the ground was hard now but so much snow had fallen that they had to plant their feet with care one of them bore a heavy stick on its back that beam had no trouble punching through either the snow still falling or the snow on the bushes that had helped shield the enemy soldiers one unkerlanter after another fell the other behemoth carried an eggtosser when bursts of sorcerous energy sent snow and frozen dirt flying the unkerlanters decided theyd had enough and fled for the next patch of woods more eggs pursued them so did beams from the algarvians sticks obliged tealdo shouted back toward the behemoths and their crews one of the soldiers on the behemoth with a heavy stick waved his fur hat in reply id be even more obliged if theyd got here sooner trasone said as he and his comrades rose to go after the unkerlanters so would i but they cant be having an easy time there tealdo said look how much trouble it is for them to move in deep snow this is unkerlant this is winter or near enough as makes no difference trasone said the snows not going to up and disappear not for a cursed long time its not how much good are the behemoths going to be till then not as much as wed like odds are tealdo replied but the unkerlanters wont have it any easier than we do i want them to have it harder than we do curse em up one side and down the other trasone said i want to lick the whoresons out of cottbus i want to help make sure they cant give us any trouble for a long time afterwards and then by the powers above i want to go home a lot of places in algarve it hardly snows at all i knowim from one of them tealdo said wistfully come on before we lick them out of cottbus weve got to lick them out of those woods there before the algarvians went in after the unkerlanters the behemoth with the eggtosser flung death in among the trees but it was tossing blind without any visible targets king swemmels men still showed plenty of fight when the troopers who followed galafrone came to close quarters with them some of the fighting in the shadow of the pines and birches was with knives and with sticks swung clubfashion men came on enemies too close to let them swing up their sticks and blaze a few unkerlanters surrendered more though fought till they were killed or retreated northwest to take yet another stab somewhere else at holding the algarvians away from cottbus when galafrones men emerged to continue the pursuit unkerlanter eggtossers made them dive for cover i enjoy this so much dont you trasone said lifting his mouth an inch or so off the snow to speak aye of course tealdo answered but were still moving ahead powers above be praised well get there yet nine halfway along the road from gromheort to the village of hwinca the paving gave out bembo discovered that the hard way by going into the mud almost up to his boot tops cursing the algarvian constable slogged through the soggy patch and up onto drierif no more pavedground dont blaze my ears on account of it advised oraste whose boots were also befouled take it out on the kaunians when we finally get to this miserable place i will by the powers above bembo growled if it werent for them id be sitting back in the barracks all warm and cozy he was always ready to feel sorry for himself as a matter of fact if it werent for those miserable buggers we wouldnt have a war and id be back in tricarico happy as a clam at the beach and not stuck here in stinking forthweg sergeant pesaro looked over at him remember while youre cursing the kaunians odds are theyre cursing us too i dont expect theyll be as easy to round up here as they were in that oyngestun placetoo many stories going around about what happens after they go west they deserve it oraste said bembos right sergeantwerent for them we wouldnt have a war bembo wondered if oraste was feeling well the dour constable hardly ever agreed with him bembo also wondered if the kaunians really deserved it most of the time he tried not to wonder about that it did no good hed been ordered to gather them together and send them off to the west he couldnt do anything about what happened to them afterwards what point then to puzzling over who deserved what the constables tramped through a hamlet of half a dozen houses an old woman on her knees in an herb garden looked up as they went her nose was like a sickle blade her chin almost met it her face was a tightwoven net of wrinkles her smile her smile chilled bembos heart hed seen some raddled old procuresses in his day but none who could match the ancient exultant evil this forthwegian crone showed no blonds here she called in bad algarvian made worse by her being almost toothless blonds there she pointed north up the road toward hwinca aye granny we know pesaro answered with a chortle and a nasty smirk the peasant woman went back to her weeding oraste chuckled she loves kaunians too just as much as we do i noticed bembo said dryly a lot of forthwegians do dont they keep moving there pesaro said he was puffing and sweating himself hed done more marching since coming to forthweg than in all the years since hed made sergeant and comfortably ensconced himself behind the stationhouse desk back in tricarico but he kept on putting one big foot in front of the other steady as a stream inevitable as an avalanche as for bembo he wanted a breather pesaro didnt give him one it was most of an hour later when oraste pointed ahead and said there that must be the place miserablelooking little dump isnt it how many are we supposed to take out of it sergeant twenty pesaro grunted hardly looks like its got twenty people in it does it let alone twenty kaunians but if we dont bring back twenty we get blamed he kicked a clod of dirt lifes not fair sergeant that was a youngish constable named almonio bembo looked at him in some surprise he hardly ever said anything what is it pesaro sounded surprised too sergeant now that he had spoken almonio looked as if he wished he hadnt he marched along for several paces before going on when we get into this hwinca place sergeant may i have your leave not to help round up these kaunians whats this sergeant pesaro studied him as if he were a double rainbow or a golden unicorn or some other astonishing freak of nature pesaros beefy face clouded you telling me you havent got the stomach for it miserably almonio nodded aye i think thats what it is i know whats going to happen to the whoresons once we take em and i dont much want to be a part of it bembos eyes got wider and wider as he listened powers above he whispered to oraste the sergeantll tear him limb from limb aye so he will oraste sounded as if he was looking forward to it pesaro though seemed more curious than furious suppose were rounding up the blonds and they try and fight us what are you going to do then almonio you going to stand there and let the kaunians kill your comrades of course not sergeant almonio answered i just dont want to have to drag them out of their houses thats all its a filthy business war is a filthy business pesaro said but he still didnt sound angry he rubbed his chins as he thought at last he pointed toward the reluctant constable all right almonio heres what youll do for today youll stand guard while the rest of us winkle out the kaunians if they give any troubleif they even look like they might give any troubleyou start blazing have you got that aye sergeant almonio stopped marching for a moment so he could bow i thank you sergeant dont thank me too much pesaro answered and by the powers above keep your cursed mouth shut or were both in hot water he shook his head warm water would feel good right now but not that hot well wellisnt that interesting bembo thought ive got a hold on pesaro if i ever want one he lifted off his hat so he could scratch his head the way things were he couldnt see wanting one hed spent years getting used to pesaroand getting pesaro used to him any other sergeant was too likely to be harder on him he laughed a sour laugh wasnt that the way of the worldcome up with something that looked good and then decide you couldnt use it into hwinca marched the constabulary squad the village was smaller and dingier than oyngestun it didnt lie on a ley line and so seemed more a product of a distant time than oyngestun had and oyngestun as far as bembo was concerned hadnt been anything to write home about either he didnt write home very often anyhow hed quarreled endlessly with his father before going out on his own they still had little to do with each other his sister had quarreled with the old man too but lanfusas escape had been to marry a furrier who was now on his way to being rich she didnt like being reminded her brother was only a constable if he sent a letter to safta she might write back she was likelier to fall over dead from shock though a few forthwegians nodded to the constables one of them grinned and winked and clapped his hands almost as if he were an algarvian the leer on his face made bembo remember that what he was doing in forthweg probably ought not to go down in writing to anyone kaunians come forth pesaro shouted in a great voice when he got to hwincas village square evodio turned his words from algarvian into classical kaunian that was the tongue the blonds hereabouts still spoke or near enough as to make no difference no matter what language the order came in the kaunians ignored it bembo turned to oraste thereyou see theyve got a notion of whats going to happen to them they wont come out all by themselves not anymore were going to have to go in after em itll be a lot of extra work from now on oraste hefted his stick liable to be dangerous work too if they figure theyre going to get shipped west anyhow whos to say they wont decide theyve got nothing to lose and try and take some of us with em aye that had occurred to bembo too he wished it hadnt pesaro shouted again his voice echoed off the houses and shops facing the square again evodio translated his words into classical kaunian again none of the yellowhaired men and women in hwinca came forth well well have to do it the hard way pesaro said his chuckle had a nasty edge you know what though i dont think itll be too hard he beckoned to the forthwegian whod applauded the constables arrival come here pal aye you you speak algarvian with a show of regret the villager shook his head pesaro looked exasperated neither he nor any of his men spoke any forthwegian past what little theyd picked up since coming from tricarico evodio said ill bet he speaks kaunian sergeant find out pesaro said sure enough intelligence lit on the forthwegians face pesaro nodded good tell him well pay himdoesnt have to be anything much or im a yaninanif hell show us which houses the kaunians live in that fellow turned out not to be the only villager who spoke kaunian three or four others clamored for a share of the reward too bembo and oraste followed one of them to a house that didnt look any different from those to either side of it the forthwegian pointed at the door as dramatically as if he were a hunting dog pointing at a woodcock kaunians come forth the two constables shouted together nobody came forth bembo and oraste looked at each other they drew back a couple of paces then slammed the door with their shoulders it flew inward the brackets in which its bar rested pulled out of the wall bembo sprawled on hands and knees in the front hall hed expected to bounce off his first try oraste kept his feet but barely theyll pay for that the scum bembo muttered as he got to his feet come on lets turn this place inside out sticks at the ready he and oraste swept through the house they didnt have to search long or hard they found the kauniansa man and woman of about bembos age with two little girls too young to be interestingcowering in a pantry in the kitchen oraste gestured with his stick come out every cursed one of you he growled aye sir said the man in decent algarvian he was bembo judged frightened almost out of his wits but doing his best not to show it for the sake of his family in a low urgent voice he went on whatever you want so you will say you could not find us i will give it to you i have money i am not a poor man all of it is yoursonly let us live kaunian oraste said an allinclusive rejection bembo gave his comrade a dirty look hed wanted to see how much the blond would offer but he couldnt get away with that if oraste didnt go along the yellowhaired man whispered something to his wife she bit her lip but nodded not money then the kaunian man said rapidly desperately but anything you want anything he gestured to the woman she undid the top toggle of her tunic she wasnt badlookingshe wasnt badlooking at allbut out in the street all of you bembo barked he was disgusted at himself but more disgusted at the kaunians for sinking so low and for reminding him how low hed sunk the blond man sighed now that he saw it was hopeless he regained a measure of the dignity hed thrown away he put his arms around his daughters and shepherded them out his wife set her tunic to rights before following good youve got four pesaro said seeing the kaunians bembo and oraste had found a double handful more already stood glumly in the square before long the constables had their quota from hwinca pesaro paid the forthwegians whod helped his men round up the blonds one of the villagers said something in kaunian as he got his money evodio translated he wants to know why were only taking this many why were not cleaning out all of them tell him this is what we got ordered to do so this is what were doing pesaro answered its just our job that was how he thought of it too almonios conscience needed more of a shield it all came down to the same thing in the end though the constables marched the kaunians off toward gromheort off toward the caravans that would take them west traku shook his head back and forth back and forth a man seemingly caught in the grip of nightmare before throwing his hands in the air in despair he stared toward his son i have more cursed orders than i know what to do with he moaned theyd been facing different problems a few weeks before that one algarvian liked the outfit you made for him so he went and told his friends talsu answered by everything ive seen the redheads do like to talk i wouldnt mind if traku corrected himself i wouldnt mind so much if i didnt think all the talk going through skrunda had to have some truth behind it but if im slaving for the algarvians while theyre doing horrible things to our folk thats hard to stomach aye talsu said but you know how rumors are one day everybody says this was bound to happen the next day its that and then the day after its something else in the war the algarvians werent any worse than we were and thats the truth they might have been better he remembered colonel dzirnavu and the captive algarvian woman hed taken into his pavilion not a soul in the regiment had shed a tear when she cut dzirnavus fat throat heres hoping youre right traku said i dont know that i think you are but heres hoping before he or talsu could say anything further the door to the tailors shop opened and an algarvian officer came inside not just an algarvian officer talsu saw but the algarvian officer the one whod made traku popular among his countrymen garrisoned in skrunda good day sir talsu said and then on taking a closer look are you all right all right of course i am all right why shouldnt i be all right the redhead said in his accented jelgavan he staggered rather than walked red tracked his eyes and the stench of strong spirits came off him in waves pointing a peremptory finger at traku he said my good man i require a cloak of the heaviest stuff you can buy and i require it as soon as you can possibly turn it out which had better be pretty cursed quick do you hear me aye sir i do traku said though if youll forgive my saying so a heavy cloak isnt the sort of garment youll get much use from in jelgava jelgava the algarvian officer cried jelgava he might never have heard of the kingdom before who said anything about cursed jelgava theyre shipping me to unkerlant is what theyre doing they havent had enough men killed there to satisfy them yet so theyre going to try to put me on the list too go ahead tell me i wont need a cloak like that in unkerlant its supposed to be a cold kingdom for true traku turned brisk now then sir what will you pay me for such a cloak as if money matters when i am going to unkerlant the algarvian exclaimed as far as talsu was concerned that proved how drunk he was money always mattered the redhead fumbled about in his belt pouch and set two goldpieces on the counter in front of traku there does that satisfy you aye traku answered in a strangled voice talsu stared at the gold coins both stamped with king mezentios beaky visage he didnt blame his father for sounding astonished he couldnt remember the last time hed seen gold traku gathered himself and asked when will you require the cloak sir day after tomorrowno later the algarvian answered the cursed leyline caravan leaves the day after that unkerlant it was almost a howl of despair what did i do to make someone want to send me to unkerlant maybe algarve is running short on soldiers talsu said he didnt want to sound as if he was gloating but had trouble doing anything else his father hissed at him in alarm lest he queer the bargain traku might not want to serve the algarvians but he didnt mind taking their money fortunately the officer paid talsus tone no mind someone still has to garrison jelgava he said it might as well be me this time talsu had the sense to keep his mouth shut traku said a cloak is not a complicated garment i can make one for you in two days sir the heaviest wool i can lay my hands on is that right just exactly right the algarvian officer snapped his fingers the heaviest lightcolored wool you can lay your hands on i dont care to stand out like a lump of coal against the stinking snowfields aye traku said tonelessly when talsu glanced his fathers way traku wouldnt meet his eye had he planned on giving the algarvian a black cloak in the hope that it would get him killed talsu couldnt prove it and he couldnt ask either no matter how drunk the redhead was the fellow might note what he said and might remember it after leaving for now the algarvian just stood there swaying gently unkerlant he said again his voice a mournful bleat what did i do to deserve being sent to unkerlant i couldnt say sir traku replied ill have your cloak ready day after tomorrow thick wool lightcolored a very good day to you he was talsu realized trying to get the officer out of the shop rather to talsus surprise the algarvian took the hint too he lurched back out onto the street slamming the door behind him when he was gone talsu stared at the coins hed set on the counter gold father he murmured aye and enough to buy him half a dozen cloaks traku answered well ill give him a good one i could face it with furpowers above i could cursed near face it with erminebut he didnt ask for that so hell have to do without you ought to give him something shoddy talsu said who cares if the whoreson freezes hell do it a long way from here maybe i ought to but i wont his father said my pride wont let me ill dicker hard on price but not on the quality of the goods once i have a price and besides the lousy bugger may write to his friends back here or he may even come back here himself one day the algarvians are still moving ahead or thats what the news sheets say anyhow they say whatever the algarvians want them to say talsu pointed out they say mainardos the best king jelgava ever had and everybody loves him oh that traku shrugged everybody knows thats a lie so whats the use of getting upset about it most of the time though you can find out when theyre stretching things if you ask around a little i havent heard anybody say the algarvians arent still advancing have you no not when you put it so talsu admitted i wish i had thats a different story traku paused in thought now have i got the material hell need in stock or am i going to have to scour skrunda for it he went through what he did have then called to talsu here come feel this bolt of beige stuff do you think it would do talsu rubbed it between thumb and forefinger i think you could wear it instead of chainmail matter of fact youd feel like you were carrying another man on your back with a cloak made from it he asked for heavy traku said he cant very well complain if it turns out even heavier than he looked for he reached under the counter and pulled out a stout pair of pinking shears get me his measurements will you son i want to make sure i have the length just right when the algarvian captain came into the shop to pick up the cloak he was sober he still looked no happier at the prospect of going off to fight in unkerlant from everything talsu had heard about the weather in the huge western kingdom he couldnt blame the redhead for that traku draped the cloak over the algarvians shoulders as fussy to get it right as if hed made it for king donalitu i put a lot of handwork into it sir he said not as much room to use magic in a cloak as there would be in say one of your kilts staggering a little under the weight of the garment the redhead said plain enough that you didnt stint on the cloth before the tailor could answer the officer gave a shrugan effortfilled shrug with the cloak still heavy on his shoulders fair enough i will probably need all of this in unkerlant i hope it is what you had in mind traku said oh aye very much so the algarvian shrugged again even if it werent id be stuck with it because my leyline caravan leaves before sunup tomorrow morning he took off the cloak and folded it with the sure hands of a man who knew how to care for clothing my thanks i wont be the only one nor even the only one from skrunda heading down the ley lines you know we hadnt thought about it traku said including talsu in his answer to show he intended to be included talsu nodded i am sorry for you the algarvian said this gives your counts and dukes more power from what i have seen of them you would be better off if they had all fled with your coward of a king you would be better off if we had decided to blaze all of them too but we didnt talsu said they will still be taking orders from you and you dont like that either do you the officer asked without waiting for an answer he went on how often does anyone of rank care what the common people think not often enough was the answer that sprang into talsus mind he would have said as much to his mother or father or sister or to a close friend he had said as much to men he trusted in the army but even in the army hed been careful about speaking his mind he was not about to unburden himself to one of the occupiers a man on whom he had no reason to rely maybe the algarvian understood as much with a nod he said im off then we may see each other again one day he bowed to traku and said you do good work with a comic shrug he carried the cloak away hes not a bad fellow traku spoke as if he hated to admit anything of the sort no hes not talsu agreed i saw that in the field one by one the redheads arent much different from us but put a bunch of them together and they turn into algarvians i dont know how or why that works but it does put a bunch of them together and they start knocking over monuments traku said every time i go near the market square i miss the old arch talsu nodded aye me too put a bunch of them together let them go conquering and he broke off and who knows what they might do he finished not really wanting to give the rumors substance after all his father knew what he meant i still dont care to believe that he said not even algarvians would sink so low i hope youre right talsu said and then in thoughtful tones i wonder just how many soldiers and officers theyre taking out of jelgava to send to unkerlant i wonder if the ones who stay behind will be enough to hold down the kingdom of course the other thing i wonder is if anyone would rise up for our nobles i dont much fancy a cursed algarvian calling himself my king traku said talsu thought about that then nodded again the wind howled and screamed like a mad ghost snow blew horizontally up from out of the south except in front of boulders and bushes it had trouble staying on the ground istvans squad moved forward leaning into that shrieking gale what beastly weather kun shouted the scrawny little mages apprentice had tied his spectacles on with twine to keep them from blowing away its only weather istvan shouted back into the teeth of the wind its like this every winter in my valley the stars must hate your valley then kun said in the capital we have halfway decent weather in the wintertime its made you soft istvan said kun gestured derisively istvan didnt take the argument any further but he felt he could have gyongyosians were a warrior race werent they what kind of warrior was a man who couldnt even stand a blizzard then szonyi said i come from a little valley thats as chilly as any die stars shine down on and im stinking cold too and im not ashamed to admit it i never said i wasnt cold istvan backed a little way up the ley line but not very far i said its only weather and it is and i said we have to deal with it and we do he slapped at his chest weve got the gear for it eh snow flew from his long sheepskin coat he wore a wool blouse under the coat and a wool undertunic beneath that the coat went down below his knees his baggy leggings were wool and so were his long drawers which itched in places it was embarrassing to scratch fur lined his boots and his mittens he wore a foxfur cap with earflaps and had a wool muffler tied over his nose and mouth so that only his eyes showed he carried slit goggles in his belt pouch in case the sun came out by the way the blizzard raged he wondered if it would ever come out again kun said i can get by in this he was as well protected against the storm as istvan curse me if i know how anybodys supposed to fight in it though us or the unkerlanters they manage and so do we istvan answered they know about cold the miserable whoresons same as we do he peered ahead all he could see was swirling whiteness discontentedly he muttered i wish i knew exactly where we are we could blunder into them without knowing it till too late or some of them could be sneaking up on us and we wouldnt know that till too late either szonyi added aye we would even in the howling blizzard kun sounded smug i have a bit of magecraft ill have you remember it spotted kuusamans and it spotted a mountain ape so it should work even on brutes like unkerlanters kun was proud of his little bit of magecraft istvan hoped he wasnt prouder of it than it deserved but it had worked and more than once no denying that it wouldnt work though if he didnt use it istvan said maybe youd better check now just on the off chance those goateating buggers could be half a blaze away and wed never know it not through this aye sergeant thats not the worst notion i ever heard by the way kun said it he managed to imply that istvan had come out with most of the worst notions hed heard dont get clever with me istvan snapped he paused appalled at how much like sergeant jokai he sounded after a moment he shrugged where else to learn how to be a sergeant than from a sergeant he hoped tlie stars treasured jokais spirit whether they did or not he had things to attend to here squad halt he shouted over the howl of the wind all right kundo what you need to do aye kun repeated and set about it whatever passes he made his mittens hid the wind blew away the words of his spell after a couple of minutes he turned to istvan and said sergeant no unkerlanters are moving toward us well thats something istvan said but you cant be sure were not about to stumble over them kun shook his head the spell detects an enemys motion toward us and nothing else i wish i knew more iwish you knew more too and not just about magic istvan thought but kun this time had done nothing to deserve an insult you tried your best istvan said and we know more than we did even if we dont know as much as wed like come on ladsforward again if we find the foe by falling over him then we do thats all how do we even know were going in the right direction szonyi asked with all this snow flying every which way who can say where east is if we keep the wind almost at our backs we wont go too far wrong istvan answered but he didnt sound happy about the reply even to himself nothing easier than for the wind to shift he turned to kun do you know any spells for finding out which way were headed there is one quite a good one but it depends on a bit of lodestone and i have none the mages apprentice answered regretfully anyone have any lodestone istvan asked no one admitted to it he wasnt surprised he hadnt seen lodestone more than a couple of times in his life both when traveling mountebanks did astonishing things with it he turned back to kun any other ways im sure there are sergeant but i dont know how to use them kun replied istvan sighed through the muffler over his mouth all right then well just have to keep on and see what happens stars be praised were through the worst of the really rugged country not so much risk of blowing off a cliff here if we can hold where we are till spring well be in a place where we can stab deep into unkerlants vitals kun said i thought you were a mages apprentice not a newssheet scribblers istvan said kun was too swaddled in fur and fabric for istvan to see if he changed expression but he turned away and kept quiet for a while and then up ahead someone called a challengein unkerlanter istvan knew no more than a handful of words of the language neither did anyone else in the squad the challenge came again sharper and more peremptory what do we do sergeant somebody asked get down you fools istvan shouted suiting action to word as he thumped down into the snow himself he added balogh back to the rest of the company tell em weve found the enemy actually the unkerlanters had found them beams hissed overhead blasting snowflakes to steam istvan worried about them less than he would have in clearer weather snow attenuated their force even faster than rain did but how large an unkerlanter position lay ahead there shielded by the blizzard if hed uncovered a regiment of king swemmels soldiers theyd wipe out his squad as casually as he swatted a fly provided they knew he had only a squad he blazed at the unkerlanters a couple of times not so much in the hope of hurting them as to make them believe he led a goodsized force kun he hissed hey kun you all right aye for the time being the mages apprentice answered from over to his left can you make the unkerlanters think weve got more men here than we really do istvan asked for a moment he didnt think the mages apprentice heard him then a voicekuns voice he realized but bigger and deeper and more resonant than it had any business beinganswered aye colonel istvan looked around to see where so exalted a figure as a colonel might have sprung from but then started to laugh kun was doing his best to follow orders and his best turned out to be better than istvan had expected other voices came out of the snow from different directions nonexistent captains positioning equally nonexistent companies for a charge mythical sergeants who sounded much fiercer than istvan ever had gave their mythical squads orders off to the east the unkerlanters started shouting nerving themselves for an attack urra urra urra istvans shiver had nothing to do with the snow on which he lay from the sound of those shouts he hadnt stumbled over a regiment that had to be at least a brigade he wished kun had given him an imaginary brigade of his own he would have enjoyed being a brigadier even an imaginary one for the few brief moments till the unkerlanters overran him amid the calls and the shouts kun spoke in his own voice what next sergeant this cant lasttheyre bound to test it all the men they have over there he was right curse him balogh must have got lost or else captain tivadar would have brought up real reinforcements but istvan having begun the game did not want to give it up he got to his feet advanced on the unkerlanter position and shouted a couple of the unkerlanter phrases he knew you surrender hands high king swemmels men didnt blaze him down out of hand the shouts of urra urra died away only the wind spoke the wind and kuns conjuredup officers and sergeants and then dejectedly an unkerlanter shouted back we surrender istvan gaped hed known how colossal a bluff he was running and was astonished past words that the unkerlanters had fallen for it if he showed that though everything was ruined hands high he yelled again not caring if he rasped his throat raw so long as he made his voice pierce the gale he aimed his stick eastward he could do no more than that the snow was blowing too hard to let him find a sure target out of that swirling snow came unkerlanters in long thick wool tunics with leggings beneath and long hooded cloaks over them they carried no weapons their hands were above their heads catching sight of istvan the first one in the line repeated we surrender gesturing with his stick istvan sent them back toward his comrades as they glumly tramped past him he counted them only twenty men were marching into captivity had more stayed behind or sudden suspicion flowered in him kun he shouted youve got to have more of their language than i do maybe sergeant though i havent got much the mages apprentice answered sounding more respectful than he usually did tell em youre a firstrank mage wholl know if they lie then ask em if all those cursed urrafs were magic to scare us off istvan said ill try kun sounded doubtful but he spoke to the unkerlanters istvan listened to gutturals going back and forth and watched gestures till kun returned to gyongyosian thats what they were doing all right they knew the jig was up when they heard our regiment forming for the attack istvan laughed till tears came the tears promptly started freezing his eyelashes together he swiped at his face with his mittens then he heard shouts from the west captain tivadar at last bringing reinforcements against the unkerlanter host the unkerlanter host istvan had just captured he made his way over to tivadar saluting he said sir the enemy position is ours and laughed again at the flabbergasted expression on his company commanders face no one came back from the west that to vanai was the central fact to life in oyngestun these days no one came back no one sent money from the wages the algarvians had promised to pay no one sent so much as a scrawled note that continuing echoing silence made the worst rumors easier and easier to believe as day followed day one chilly afternoon vanai went to the apothecarys to get a decoction of willow bark for her grandfather whod come down with the grippe as tamulis handed her the small jar of green glass he remarked not quite out of the blue if you hear the algarvian constables are on their way here again youd be smart to take to the woods before they start yelling kaunians come forth do you think so vanai asked and tamulis nodded vigorously then she asked another question is that what you intend to do aye i expect i will the apothecary answered im no woodsmananyone who know me knows that i dont know whether id starve before i froze or the other way round but whatever happens it has to be better than getting into one of those caravan cars bound for unkerlant vanai bit her lip you may be right and thank you for telling me that youve been as kind as as anyone in oyngestun it wasnt enormous praise but she could give it without feeling like a hypocrite lifes hard tamulis said gruffly lifes hard for everybody and especially for everybody with yellow hair go on get out of here i hope your grandfather feels better the old fool if he gets well maybe you wont have to come in here so often and listen to me complain its not as if theres nothing to complain about vanai bobbed her head and then turned and went out the door a couple of forthwegian men two or three years older than she leaned against the wall of the apothecarys shop vanai wasnt too surprised to see them in the kaunian part of oyngestun tamulis knew three times as much as his forthwegian counterpart and had plenty of stocky swarthy darkhaired customers but one of the forthwegians pointed at her and said so long blondy he drew a thumb across his throat and made horrible gagging gargling noises while he was laughing the other fellow grabbed his crotch and said here sweetheart my meats got more flavor than an algarvian sausage any day that the earth did not swallow them proved the powers above were deaf vanai stalked past them pretending they didnt exist shed had plenty of practice doing that with both forthwegians and kaunians but now she had to hide more fear than usual since the algarvians sent that shipment of kaunians west oyngestuns forthwegians had grown bolder toward their neighbors why not would the redheads punish them for it not likely if these two laid hands on her ill fight vanai thought i dont have to lie there and take it the way i did with spinello she chose not to dwell on what her odds would be against two men both stronger than she to her vast relief they did nothing worse than taunt her after she slipped round a corner she breathed easier she passed the postman on the way home he was a forthwegian too but decent enough letter for you he said something for your granddad too ill take it to him vanai said she almost always took him whatever mail there was these days she made a point of getting it first holding up the little green bottle she added hes down with the grippe aye its been going around my sister and her husband have it the postman said hope he feels better soon with a nod he went on his way vanai hurried the rest of the way to the house she shared with brivibas her heart sang within her a letter for her had to be a letter from ealstan no one else wrote to her shed feared spinello would but he must have realized any letter he sent her would only go into the fire ealstans letters she cherished strange how a few minutes of fondling and grunting and thrashing could make two people open their souls to each other she had no idea how that happened but was ever so glad it did as far as her grandfather knew no one sent her letters that was why she made a point of picking up the mail before brivibas could it wasnt hard even well he usually stayed in his study on the far side of the house from the doorway but when vanai opened the door no letters shoved in under it lay on the entryhall floor she wondered if the postman had delivered them to the house next door by mistake though he didnt usually do things like that then she heard her grandfather moving about in the kitchen and she realized she might have a problem she had to go into the kitchen anyhow to mix the bitter willowbark decoction with something sweet to make it more palatable for brivibas i greet you my grandfather she said when she saw him i have your medicine how are you feeling i have been better he answered his voice a rasping croak aye i have been better i came out here to make myself a cup of herb tea and heard that ignorant lout of a postman slide something under our door i went to get it and foundthis hed taken ealstans letter out of the franked envelope in which it had come you read it anger pushed fear from vanais mind you read it you had no business doing that whatever ealstan says there its not meant for you give it to me this instant very well my dearest sweet darling vanai brivibas quoted ealstans greeting with savage relish two spots of color from fever or outrage or both at once burned on his cheeks he crumpled the letter into a ball and flung it at vanai as for its being none of my business i would have to disagree i would say just as a guess from the style that this is not the first such letter youve received thats not your business either vanai snapped cursing his literary analysis she bent and picked up the letter and unfolded it far more carefully than brivibas had wadded it up why couldnt he have stayed in bed till she got back i think it is his eyes glittered you still live under my roof how much more shame must i endure on account of you he still thought of what vanai did in terms of how it affected him not in terms of what it meant to her her chin lifted haughtily as if she were a noblewoman from the days of the kaunian empire i dont propose to discuss it its fortunate that we have no zuwayzin or kuusamans close by brivibas said or you might seek to slake your lust with them as well vanai threw the bottle of willowbark decoction at his head rage lent her strength but not aim the bottle flew past and shattered against the wall behind him if you think i was slaking my lust with the cursed algarvian youre even blinder than i thought she snarled the only reason i sucked his prong was to keep you alive and now and now im sorry i did it was in her mind but she burst into tears before she could say it brivibas took her words in a different direction and now this forthwegian barbarian satisfies you better still is that it he demanded when vanai found herself looking toward the cutlery to see which knife was longest and sharpest she spun away with a groan and fled to her bedchamber it was less a refuge than she might have wanted less a refuge than it would have been a year before lying on the bed alone she couldnt help thinking of the times when shed had to lie there with spinello if her grandfather thought shed wanted to lie with the algarvian if he thought that he had even less notion of what went on around him than shed imagined she didnt know what she would have done had brivibas knocked on her door then or come in without knocking luckily she didnt have to find out her tearstears of fury rather than sorrowquickly dried she sat up and did a better job of smoothing the letter from ealstan at least someone cares about me she murmured as she began to read it it was as her grandfather had sneeringly shown filled with endearments as were the ones she sent to him but it was also filled with his doings and those of his father and mother and sister and his cousin and uncle she wondered if he knew how lucky he was to have a goodsized family where everyoneexcept she gathered sidroc and hengistgot along probably not to him that would be like water to a fish i honor you for choosing to stay with your grandfather even though it means we must be apart ealstan wrote please believe me when i say that please also believe me when i say i wish we could be together oh i wish we could too vanai whispered for the first time she really thought of leaving the house where shed lived almost all her life and traveling to gromheort she had no idea of what she would do there or how she would keep from starving but the idea of being away from brivibas glowed in her thoughts like a fire catching hold in dry grass she shook her head then wondered why she pushed the idea aside when she was a child she and brivibas had fit together well enough he did not fit her now any more than one of the small tunics shed worn then would why not go her own way then and leave him behind to go his because if i leave him behind hell die in short order because if i wanted him to die in short order i never would have let spinello have me because since i did let spinello have me ive given up too much to let him die in short order but ohhow i wish i hadnt after a little while grimacing she got up and opened the door she couldnt even stay and sulk not if she wanted toor felt she should which came closer to the actual state of affairsnurse her grandfather back to health she had to go fix his supper and fetch it to him it wouldnt be muchvegetable soup and a chunk of breadbut she didnt trust him to be able to do it for himself shed known all along that he underestimated her now she discovered shed underestimated him too her nose told her as much as soon as she came out of the bedchamber she smelled cooking soup when she came into the kitchen she found the pot over a low fire and a note on the table nearby brivibas spidery hand was as familiar to her as her own far more familiar than ealstans my granddaughter he wrote in a kaunian straight out of the glory days of the empire judging it wiser that we not impinge on each other for some little while i have prepared my own repast leaving enough behind to satisfy i hope those bodily wants of yours susceptible to satisfaction through food vanai stared in the direction of his study where he was probably spooning up soup even now she had to look at the note twice before she noticed the sting in its tail bodily wants susceptible to food eh she muttered and the stare turned into a glare why didnt you come right out and call me a whore in the end though she ate the soup brivibas had heated she was unhappy doing it just as no doubt her grandfather had been unhappy eating a great many meals shed made when she was finished she washed and dried her bowl and spoon and the ladle shed used she went to her bedchamber and started a letter to ealstan that made her feel better felgilde squeezed leofsigs hand as they walked along the street together oh this will be fun she exclaimed i hope so he answered and then smiled and said you look very pretty tonight she squeezed his hand again perhapshe hopeda little less archly than she was in the habit of doing thank you she said thats a handsome cloak you have on thank you leofsig said hed borrowed it from his father but felgilde didnt need to know that she said ethelhelms band is one of the two or three best in forthweg im so excited this is the first time since the war theyve come here from eoforwic theyre supposed to have all sorts of new tunes toothats what everybody says anyway you were so lucky to be able to get tickets i know leofsig said his father had helped there too hestan cast accounts for the hall where ethelhelms band was going to perform but that was also nothing felgilde needed to know he slid his arm around her waist she snuggled closer to him he brought his hand up a bit so that the top of his thumb and wrist brushed against the bottom of her breast most of the time she slapped his hand away when he tried that tonight she let it stay his hopes among other things began to rise maybe he wouldnt have to keep on being jealous of his younger brother for so long as hed thought the hall was in a part of town that had housed a good many kaunians some of them still remained looking shabby and frightened an old man with fair hair stood on the street not far from the entrance to the hall begging from the people who were coming to hear ethelhelms famous band leofsig let go of felgilde to rummage in his belt pouch and take out a couple of coins he dropped them into the bowl at the scrawny old mans feet powers above bless you sir the kaunian said in forthwegian hed had little luck till leofsig came by only a few other coins most of them small coppers lay in the bowl that was a waste of money felgilde said as they walked on she didnt bother to keep her voice down though the old kaunian had already shown he could speak forthwegs majority tongue i dont think so leofsig answered my father always says kaunians are people too that fellow looked like he could use a hand my father says that if we hadnt listened to the kaunians in forthweg we wouldnt have gone to war against algarve when the blond kingdoms in the east did felgilde said he says wed be better off if we hadnt too even the kaunians in forthweg would have been better off if king penda hadnt gone to war against algarvebetter off for a little while anyhow leofsig said how long do you think it would have been before king mezentio went to war with us if we didnt stand by our allies im sure i dont know felgilde said with a toss of her head and im just as sure you dont know either since that was true leofsig could hardly argue with it he didnt feel like arguing anyhow he knew what he felt like and hoped felgilde felt like it too to try to put her back in the mood he slipped his arm around her waist again she let him do that but brushed his hand away when he tried to bring it up again he gave her a resentful look hers in response might have said so there she did get friendlier when he took out the tickets and gave them to the toughlooking fellow standing in the doorway the bruiser nodded smiled a surprisingly warm smile and stepped aside to let them pass they both held out their hands to a woman with a stamp and an ink pad she marked them with the word paid then she too stood aside and waved them into the hall ethelhelms band occupied a raised platform in the middle the men on viol and double viol lute and mandolin were tuning their instruments the trumpeter and fluteplayer made runs up and down the scale so did the piper with results that set leofsigs teeth on edge ethelhelm himself manned the drums he was taller and slimmer than most forthwegians enough to make leofsig wonder if he had a quarter part of kaunian blood if he did he didnt advertise it for which prudent silence leofsig could hardly blame him felgilde pointed lookthere are a couple in the first row that havent been taken come on hurry she and leofsig got to the seats before anyone else could and sat down with no small feeling of triumph rows of chairs had been placed around the whole inner perimeter of the hall all facing inward toward the platform on which the band would perform there was considerable space between the front row and the platform though room for people to dance as the mood took them the hall filled rapidly before the war leofsig wouldnt have seen many blonds at one of ethelhelms appearances kaunianss tastes in music were different from forthwegians now he saw no kaunians at all that didnt surprise him but did leave him sad people began clapping their hands and stamping their feet on the floorboards eager for the show to start leofsig stamped along with everyone else but put his arm around felgildes shoulder instead of clapping she was clapping but her good humor restored leaned toward him while she did it when all the lights in the hall faded except for those aimed at the band on the platform she clapped louder than ever leofsig whooped he turned toward felgilde and gave her a quick kiss her eyes sparkled he grinned as foolishly as if hed had a glass of wine too many it looked as if it might be a good night after all its grand to be in gromheort ethelhelm called the crowd cheered the band leader went on the way things are its grand to be cursed anywhere and thats the truth leofsig laughed hed had that feeling more than once himself after some narrow escape or another ethelhelm waved to the people whod come to hear him since we are all here we may as well enjoy ourselves isnt that right aye the crowd roared leofsig and felgilde loud among them well then ethelhelm brought his stick crashing down onto the drums the band struck up a sprightly tune forthwegian songs didnt rely on thudding rhythms the way the music of the kaunian kingdoms did nor was it a collection of tinkling notes going nowhere in particular which was how algarvian music struck leofsigs ears this was what hed heard his whole life and it felt right to him the first few tunes ethelhelm and the band played were familiar some of them old favorites leofsigs father and grandfather would have known others songs by which the drummer and his fellow musicians had made their reputation some people got up and started to dance from the very first note leofsig and felgilde sat and listened for a while before heading out onto die floor then after basking in yet another passionate round of applause the band swung into a number that made leofsig and felgilde turn to each other and exclaim thats new they both leaned forward to listen closely ethelhelm sang in raspy angrysounding bursts doesnt matter what you choose when youve got nothing left to lose doesnt matter what you say when they wont listen anyway felgildes brow furrowed whats he talking about she asked i dont know leofsig lied without hesitation as he spoke he looked around the band had nervemaybe more nerve than sense somewhere in the audience was bound to be an algarvian spy singing about what life in an occupied kingdom was like struck leofsig as gloriously foolish the same sort of foolishness that had led forthwegians on unicorns to charge algarvian behemoths he got to his feet come on lets dance all right felgilde rose with alacrity i usually have to start you going she swayed forward into his arms dancing helped take his mind off his worries he half expected algarvian constables to come pushing through the crowd and haul ethelhelm and his band off to gaol after a moment he realized he was being foolish seizing ethelhelm now would touch off a riot if the redheads wanted the musicians theyd wait till after the performance as long as ethelhelm kept playing he was likely safe leofsig didnt take long to stop worrying about ethelhelm felgilde molded herself to him as closely as if they werent wearing tunics when his hand closed on her backside she didnt squawk she just sighed and pushed tighter against him still its safe here she murmured in a voice he couldnt have heard if her mouth hadnt been next to his ear she was right nobody in the hall paid one couple clutching each other the least attention dozens hundreds of couples clutching one another filled the dance floor theyd escaped their parents and they were going to have the best time they could in as many different ways as they could some of them were doing more out there on the floor than he and felgilde had ever done in private his eyes widened a few times up there on the platform ethelhelm saw everything that was going on youll get in trouble when you go home he warned the dancers between songs then he laughed raucously good by the powers above if youre going to get in trouble get in trouble for something worthwhile theyll yell at you anywaygive em something to yell about at his waved command the band swung into another new tune one so lascivious that a few couples altogether carried away hurried outside ethelhelm laughed again harder than ever leofsig tried to steer felgilde toward the door that didnt work she might have kindled but she wasnt blazing at last after what seemed not nearly long enough despite repeated encores the band put down their instruments called their last good nights and escaped leofsig and felgilde reclaimed their cloaks and joined the stream of music lovers pouring from the hall outside the stream divided many couples instead of going straight home ducked into doorways in dark side streets to continue what theyd started on the dance floor hopeful but not expectant leofsig started to swing down one of those alleyways himself he thought felgilde would steer him back toward their houses instead with a throaty chuckle she followed heart pounding leofsig found a doorway no one else had he wrapped his cloak around both of them though nobody could have seen much in the darkness anyhow felgildes mouth found his as his hands roamed over her he slid one under her tunic it closed on the smooth soft flesh of her breast she sighed and kissed him harder than ever he rubbed at her crotch with his other hand hed never tried that before hed never thought she would let him try oh leofsig she whispered and spread her legs a little to make it easier for him and then she was groping him too through his tunic and his drawers he grunted in astonishment and delight it was hard to remember to keep his hand busy felgilde whimpered and quivered her hand squeezed him painfully tight a moment later groaning he made a mess in his drawers everything down there was wet and sticky and he didnt care at all i like ethelhelms music felgilde said seriously so do i leofsig panted now he really did head home if he couldnt bring vanai to gromheort ealstan wanted to go to oyngestun he wondered if he wouldnt be able to see her again till the next mushroom season he was sure hed go mad long before then but if he did go see her the first thing hed want to do would be to find someplace where they could be alone he knew that he wondered if it would make her angry he hoped not but he couldnt be sure maybe letters are better after all he thought one morning at breakfast vanai had opened her soul or at least some of it to him and hed tried to do the same with her he really felt he knew her now which he couldnt have said when they lay down together in the oak grove he marveled that she kept living with her grandfather who in her letters sounded even more difficult than hed seemed when ealstan briefly met him a couple of years before ealstan didnt quite understand why vanai and brivibas had fallen outshe never did make that clearbut he was sure he would have fallen out with the stiffnecked old scholar too and maybe letters arent better he thought he couldnt stroke a letters hair or kiss its lips or caress it he couldnt thinking about all the things he couldnt do with a letter made him forget his morning porridge altogether and hed only been picking at it before hurry up ealstanyoure going to make both of us late sidroc snorted there for once i get to nag you not the other way round i think its the first time ever elfryth said ealstans mother sent him an anxious glance are you all right im fine recalled to himself ealstan proved it by gulping his wine and inhaling the porridge left in his bowl he still finished after sidroc but not by more than a couple of spoonsful elfryth looked happier ealstan got to his feet all right cousin im ready lets get going they both exclaimed when they went outside sidroc said my nose is going to freeze he wrapped his cloak around himself in a dramatic gesture but that did nothing to protect the organ in question look ealstan pointed to windows frost frost didnt come to gromheort very often he admired its delicate traceries then he rubbed his nose like sidrocs it was turning frosty too he spent the first couple of blocks on the way to school shivering and complaining after that he resigned himself to the weather and went back to thinking about vanai that warmed him at least as effectively as his cloak it also made him oblivious to sidroc hed long wished for something that could do that but it irked his cousin sidroc gave him a shot in the ribs with his elbow and said powers above you havent heard a word ive told you huh ealstan proved sidroc right feeling foolish he said try it again i really am listening now well why werent you before sidroc demanded half the time these days you go stumbling around like a moonstruck calf what in blazes is wrong with you anyhow im in love ealstan thought but since hed been rash enough to fall in love with a kaunian girl sidroc was the last person he wanted to know it if sidroc knew he could endanger ealstan himself he could endanger vanai and he could endanger leofsig too ealstan set his jaw and said nothing he did try to pay more attention to what his cousin said which struck him as more trouble than it was worth i know what it is sidroc said with a guffaw saying moonstruck made me think of it i bet youre mooning over that blond floozy in the tight trousers you keep meeting during mushroom season aye thats what its got to be powers above why dont you find a girl closer to home why dont you soak your head ealstan suggested which made sidroc laugh without letting him know how close to right he was why dont i find a girl closer to home ealstan thought because ive lain with vanai and im not interested in anyone else he clamped his jaw tight on that answer too school loomed ahead both literally and metaphorically as he went into the gray stone building he tried not to think about the long stretch of mostly meaningless useless time ahead the algarvians seemed more determined every day that their forthwegian subjects should learn as little as possible which meant classes taught less and less the one good thing about it was that it gave him more time to daydream about vanai he spent too much time daydreaming during his forthwegian literature class the master warmed the back of his jacket after he failed to recite when called on sidroc snickered he was more used to having the switch fall on his own back than to seeing it land on his cousins ha he said when they were walking home together thats what you get for sighing over your yellowhaired tart oh shut up ealstan snapped i was so busy thinking about all the different ways youre an idiot i didnt even hear the master call my name he and sidroc had a more or less enjoyable time insulting each other till they got to their front door when they went inside conberge came up to ealstan with a smile and handed him an envelope heres another letter from your friend in oyngestun ealstan had asked leofsig not to tell anybody else about vanai evidently his brother had kept the promise hed made he hadnt told conberge anyhow now all at once ealstan wished he hadnt forced the promise out of leofsig thanks he told conberge with a rather sickly smile oyngestun sidroc said as if wondering where hed heard the name before ealstan had never before hoped so hard his cousin would stay stupid by the way sidrocs gaze suddenly sharpened he knew that was going to be one more blighted hope sidroc snapped his fingers oyngestun thats where that whatshername that vanaito ealstans horror he even came up with her namelives and somebodys writing you from there another letter your sister said if you arent a lousy kaunianlover i dont know who is maybe he meant it as a joke ealstan thought of that only afterwards at the moment he handed vanais letter back to conberge and hit sidroc in the face as hard as he could sidrocs head snapped back he didnt get an arm up to block the blow he staggered backwards fetching up against the wall of the entry hall but he was made of rugged stuff after a muttered curse he surged forward fists churning a solid right thudded into ealstans ribs but however aggressive sidroc was he was also still dazed from that first punch he moved a little slower than he might have otherwise ealstan punched him again right on the point of the chin the sudden sharp pain he felt in his own knuckles told how effective the blow was sidroc stood swaying a moment then toppled his head hit the floor with a dull thud powers above conberge exclaimed the way you went after him anyone would think he knew what he was talking about he did ealstan said shordy conberges eyes widened ealstan knelt beside his cousin come on sidroc wake up curse it sidroc didnt wake up he was breathing steadilysnoring in factbut he just lay there his eyes half open ealstan glanced up at conberge get some water well flip it in his face and bring him around but the water didnt bring sidroc to himself either drawn by shouts and thumps elfryth came into the front hall hard on conberges heels ealstans mother stared at sidroc inert on the floor and let out a small shriek what happened she cried i hit him ealstans voice was toneless i hit him and he hit his head hed always thought he might be able to lick sidroc but wished he hadnt been proved quite so thoroughly right is he dead elfryth asked sidrocs snores should have told her the answer to that but ealstan said no hes not anyhow sidroc showed no signs of coming to either rubbing at a bruised knuckle ealstan went on if he doesnt wake up what will uncle hengist do for that matter if he does wake up what will uncle hengist do hell go to the algarvians now elfryths voice came out flat and if sidroc does wake up hell go to the algarvians conberge added either that or hell wait for you to come round a corner and then bash out your brains with a fire iron ealstan started to say sidroc wouldnt do anything like that but the words clogged in his throat sidroc took revenge seriously elfryth stared down at her nephew loathing on her face hes been nothing but trouble since he had to come here her gaze swung toward ealstan when she spoke again she was as grimly practical as hestan had ever dreamt of being you had better go leave the front door open after yourself conberge and i dont know a thing about whatever happened here maybe it was a footpad thats what well say if he doesnt come to himselfthe footpad killed sidroc and knocked the wits out of you so you went wandering off youll be able to come back then eventually but if sidroc does wake up take all those letters with you before you go conberge broke in he may not remember where this one came from people who get hit in the head can have trouble remembering things letters ealstans mother asked never mind ealstan and conberge said together ealstan turned to his sister aye youre rightill do that thanks he paused a little while in thought id better not stay in gromheort ill need whatever money we have in the house to keep me eating till i find work ill get it conberge said and left but where will you go elfryth asked conberge will know so will leofsig ealstan answered at first anyhow after thathe shrugged a mans slow sour shrugill just have to see how things work out what will you do his mother said he shrugged again i can dig ditches i can cast accounts im not as good at it as father but im not bad im better than most of the bookkeepers theyll have in little towns the ones who cant count past ten without taking off their shoes conberge came back and handed him a heavy clinking leather purse here she said and he fastened it to his belt she went on you have to get those letters i dont know where you keep them aye ealstan retrieved them from the bedchamber then went out to the front hall again sidroc still lay unconscious ealstan hugged his mother and his sister elfryth was fighting back tears as she withdrew conberge kissed ealstan be careful she said i will he went to the door leaving it ajar as his mother had suggested as he headed from gromheorts west gatethe gate on the road to oyngestunhe opened vanais letter the one that had led him to flee and began to read ten skarnu hiked past pavilosta toward dauktus farm he carried a headless chicken by the feet if an algarvian patrol questioned him hed say he owed it to the other farmer he didnt expect to be stoppedthe algarvians were spread thin in valmiera these days with the war sucking soldiers to the westbut he didnt believe in taking chances hed never tramped country roads in wintertime till coming to the farm that had been gedominus and now was merkelasand in an odd way his the leather jacket he wore had been gedominus too it didnt fit very well but kept warm those parts of him it did cover hed had to buy new boots he couldnt squeeze his feet into gedominus after a couple of walks along country roads the boots had got muddy and battered enough not to look new any more but for the mud and the cold the countryside had a certain austere beauty his sister would have sneered at it but his sister was in the habit of sneering at everything bare trees and empty fields were not so much in and of themselves but they held the promise of future growth looking at them as they were he could see them as they would be he hadnt been able to do that before a squirrel with a nut in its mouth scurried up the trunk of an oak tree it knew to keep the tree trunk between itself and skarnu living in a mansion down in priekule he would have turned up his nose at the idea of squirrel stew merkela had taught him it could be surprisingly tasty not today little fellow he told the squirrel as he walked past the oak the squirrel chattered indignantly it had to think hed prove a liar if he got the chance and it was very likely right hed skirted pavilosta and saw no one on the road before he got to dauktus farm winter for the peasantry hed found was a time of pulling back offending ones own of preparing for the spring sowing it was not a time for dances and feasts as it was among the nobles of valmiera skarnu kicked a pebble in a show of defiance count simanu would give no dances this winter host no feasts for his algarvian friends and overlords imade sure of that skarnu thought triumph filled him which meant he needed longer than he should have to notice that no smoke curled up from the chimney of dauktus farmhouse when he did notice that he frowned on a day like this he would have wanted a good fire roaring in the fireplace and dauktu had plenty of firewood a big pile covered by a canvas tarpaulin stood by the barn still skarnu didnt think much of it if dauktu and his wife and their daughter preferred bundling themselves to the eyebrows that was their business swinging the chicken as he walked skarnu drew near the farmhouse then he noticed the front door standing open he stopped in his tracks somethings wrong he muttered and stood irresolute not knowing whether to go forward or to flee in the end warily he went forward when he got closer still he saw the door had something written on it scratching his head he took step by cautious step till he could read it it was five words in all daubed on with whitewash that had run simanus vengeancenight and fog he scratched his head again whats that supposed to mean he asked the winter air he got no answer he raised his voice and called dauktus name again no answer wondering if he should go back he went forward again all at once the quiet seemed eerie when skarnu set foot on the wooden steps leading up to the porch the thunk of his bootheel made him start in alarm he called dauktus name once more not a sound came from the house he went inside though half of him was warning that he ought to turn tail too late for that anyway he thought something in the front room moved skarnu froze so did the red fox that had been eating from the plate spilled on the floor the fox darted under a roughhewn chair skarnu went into the kitchen the oven was as cold and dead as the fireplace when he walked back into the front room the fox had scurried away dauktu he called up the stairway only silence answered him normally he would never have presumed to go up to the farmers bedchamber uninvited now now he didnt think it would matter the bedchamber was neat and empty so was the smaller one across the hall which had to belong to dauktus daughter as far as skarnu could see by anything up there the other farmer and his family might just have stepped away for a moment theyd stepped away all right the spilled plate of food downstairs argued that they werent ever coming back night and fog skarnu murmured hed never seen the phrase before he didnt know exactly what it meant but it couldnt have meant anything good for dauktu and his wife and daughter skarnu went back downstairs and then back out of the farmhouse he stared at the words painted on the doorway ever so slowly he shook his head still carrying the chicken he started the long walk back to the farmhouse where he lived it seemed much longer than the walk out to dauktus house had hed been bubbling with ideas on how to strike another blow against the algarvian occupiers of valmiera unless he was dreadfully wrong theyd struck a blow of their own again the road might have been deserted but for him everyone else might have vanishedvanished into night and fog he thought uneasily and his shiver had nothing to do with the weather when he got back he breathed a silent sigh of relief to see merkela scattering chicken feed in front of the barn if disaster had struck dauktus farm it might have struck here too but no there stood raunu not far away nailing a fence rail to a post skarnu waved to both of them they waved back raunu called whats the matter dauktu didnt want that scrawny old hen so you had to bring it back merkela laughed skarnu knew he would have laughed too had he found things different at dauktus farm but he said he wasnt there his voice came out as flat as if he were reciting a lesson in a primer merkela went on feeding the chickens she didnt know what that flat tone meant raunu whod seen combat since before skarnu was born did instead of asking where the other peasant had gone he found the right question on the first try what happened to him that made merkela stop scattering grain and come to alertness herself skarnu answered night and fog he explained how hed found the words painted on dauktus door and what hed discovered when he went into the farmhouse simanus vengeance eh raunu looked unhappy did they pick him because he was one of us or just because they pulled his name out of a hat and if they wanted to avenge simanu why didnt they leave his body there and his family dead with him i dont know the answer to either of those skarnu felt as unhappy as raunu looked id like to especially the first if people get killed everyone knows how it happened merkela said if they just disappear everybody wonders did the redheads take them away and murder them somewhere else or are they still alive and suffering because the algarvians dont want to let them die theres a pleasant thought skarnu said after a bit of thought he admitted it makes better sense than anything i came up with on the way back here aye raunu nodded itd be like the algarvians to try and put us in fear if they are torturing dauktu and his kin theyve put me in fear skarnu said who knows what a mans liable to blab when theyre pulling out his toenails or working over his daughter in front of him they wont take me alive merkela declared like any farm woman she wore a knife on her belt she caressed its hilt as she might have caressed skarnu powers below eat me if ill give them any sport or let them squeeze anything out of me wed all be smart to go armed some way or another for a while raunu said skarnu nodded wondering if hed be able to find the courage to slay himself to save himself from algarvian torment he thought he might he slept close by his stick that night but the algarvians did not come as theyor perhaps simanus henchmen acting with their leavehad come to dauktus farm the next morning raunu went into pavilosta to buy salt and nails and with luck sugar things the farm couldnt make for itself the veteran underofficer took along a blade of his own long enough to reach his heart after hed vanished around a bend in the road skarnu and merkela without a word spoken set aside their chores hurried upstairs to her bedchamber and made love this time he was as desperately urgent as she usually was he wondered if it might be the last and did his best to give himself something to savor for however long he had when pleasure drowned him he groaned as he might have under an algarvian torturers whip drained emptied numb he and merkela went back out to the endless farmwork he did it at about half speed waiting for raunu or king mezentios men whoever chanced to come to the farm first it was raunu a little bent under the weight of the pack on his back but his face glowing with news there must be a dozen of those simanus vengeancenight and fog signs in town he said as he set down his burden not a one that i could tell was on the door of anybody whos fighting the redheads they just picked people powers above knows how and now nobody knows whats become ofem thats good to hear skarnu said good for anybody except the folk who had it happen to them i mean night and fog merkela repeated musingly they want people to wonder whats happened to whoever they took all right are they dead are they under torture like we said before or are the redheads doing what the stories we hear talk about skarnus lips pulled back from his teeth in a horrid grimace one more thing i hadnt thought of one more thing i wish you hadnt thought of either there may not be any kaunians left alive in the world if the algarvians have their way merkela said they havent taken anyone from valmiera or jelgava skarnu said wed have heard if they started doing anything like that would we that was raunu not merkela he added three words night and fog were still fighting skarnu said i dont know what else we can do they wont get anything cheap not from this county they wont aye merkelas angry nod sent a lock of her pale hair flipping down over her eyes brushing it back with a hand she went on they say simanus had his revenge we havent even started taking ours yet keeping ourselves alive staying in the fightthats a kind of victory all by itself skarnu said he wouldnt have thought so not when the war was new and his noble blood entitled him to don shiny captains badges he knew better now bembo lifted a glass of wine in salute to sergeant pesaro heres to some time well spent in gromheort the constable said aye pesaro tilted his head back to upend his own glass giving bembo a splendid view of several of his chins he waved to the busy barmaid two more glasses of red here sweetheart the forthwegian woman nodded to show shed heard him he turned back to bembo im glad not to spend all day on my feet marching ill tell you that thats the truth sure enough bembo agreed the barmaid came by with an earthenware pitcher and refilled their glasses since bembo had bought the last round pesaro set a small silver coin down on the table the barmaid took it as she went off to serve someone else pesaro reached out and pinched her backside she sprang in the air and gave him a dirty look you shouldnt have done that bembo said mournfully now shell spend the rest of the day pretending not to notice us shed better not pesaro growled besides its not like im the only one in this tavern whos ever got his hands on that arse looking around bembo had to nod because it was across the street from their barracks the tavern was always full of algarvian constablesand algarvians had never been shy about putting their hands on women their own or those of the kingdoms theyd overrun will she sleep with you for silver bembo asked curse me if i know pesaro answered i never thought she was pretty enough to try and find out the blond wenches in the soldiers brothels look a lot better to me well i wont tell you youre wrong about that bembo said all these forthwegian women are built like bricks he started to say something more but then pointed to another constable a couple of tables away oh powers above almonios gone and drunk himself into another crying jag pesaro cursed as he twisted on his stool he had to push it back to get his belly past the front of the table he too watched the young constable sitting there with tears streaming down his face almonio was very drunk a pitcher like the one the barmaid carried lay on its side empty on the table in front of him miserable bugger pesaro said shaking his head i dont know why he ever thought he could be a constable sergeant you never should have let him beg off hauling kaunians out of their houses with the rest of us bembo said i dont like it eitherthats another reason im glad im back in gromheort aside from all the marching im not doingbut i pull my weight he looked down at himself and ive got a deal of weight to pull too if he hadnt said it pesaro would have though he carried even more weight than bembo as things were pesaro emptied his new glass of wine before asking you think hed be better if i made him do it youre the one who always says things like theres nothing like a boot in the arse to concentrate the brain bembo answered i know i know pesaro waved for the barmaid again sure enough she pretended not to see him muttering the constabulary sergeant said he hasnt got the stomach for the job as is i just thought id make things worse if i held him to it so i didnt me i havent got the stomach for hard work bembo said never would have noticed pesaro said in tones that made bembo wince pesaro called out to almonio powers above man pull yourself together im sorry sergeant the young constable replied i cant help thinking about what happens to the kaunians when we ship em west you know it as well as i do i know you know why doesnt it drive you mad too theyre the enemy pesaro said with assurance you always hit the enemy as hard as you can thats the rules almonio shook his head theyre just people men and women and children with blond hair and a funny language out of old times a few ofem were soldiers aye but we dont do anything special to the forthwegians who yielded or not to most ofem anyway the women and children sure never hurt us all kaunians are out to get us pesaro said the kaunians in jelgava almost took tricarico away from us in case you forgot theyve hated us ever since we knocked their dusty old empire flat all those years ago and theyve really hated us since the six years war thats what king mezentio says and i think hes dead right but almonio only shook his head again then he folded his arms on the table bent forward and fell asleep bembo said hell be better when he comes aroundtill the next time he gets drunk anyhow take him back to the barracks and pour him into his cot pesaro said what by myself bembo said pesaro grunted he knew bembo put no more effort into anything than he had to but at the last minute the sergeant relented oh all right theres evodio over there by the wall hey evodio aye youwhod you think i was talking to come on and give bembo a hand evodio gave bembo two fingers at any rate an algarvian obscene gesture at least as old as any kaunian ruins bembo cheerfully returned it they draped one of almonios limp arms across each of their shoulders and half dragged half carried him across the street we ought to leave him here bembo said while they were crossing the cobbles maybe a wagon running over his head would pound some sense into him its a dirty business were in evodio said maybe even dirtier than soldiering because soldiers have real enemies who can blaze back in front ofem bembo stared at him in some surprise how come you werent crying your head off with him if you feel like that evodio shrugged almost dropping his half of almonio i can take it i dont think weve got anything to be proud of though since bembo didnt think the algarvian constables had anything to be proud of either he kept quiet between them they got the sodden almonio into his cot one of the constables in a dice game on the floor of the barracks looked up with a grin hes going to be miserable when he wakes up the poor sorry son of a whore he predicted he was pretty miserable already or he wouldnt have gotten this drunk bembo answered ah one of those eh the other constable said well let him spend a while longer in this business and hell figure out youre wasting your time if you get upset over stuff you cant do anything about the next roll of the dice went against him and he cursed furiously with a laugh bembo began youre wasting your time if you get upset oh shut up the other constable said when bembo stuck his nose outside the barracks the next morning he shivered most of the time gromheort wasnt that much cooler than tricarico but the wind that blew out of the southwest today had a nasty chill reminiscent of the broad plains of unkerlant from which it had come just my luck bembo grumbled as he headed out on patrol he was always ready to pity himself since no one else seemed interested in the job he took some consolation in seeing that the forthwegians and kaunians on the street looked as unhappy and put upon as he felt some of them had mufflers wrapped around their necks and heavy cloaks over their tunics or trousers but more like bembo simply had to make do when a particularly nasty gust blew in under his kilt he envied the kaunians their trousers by now hed found a number of places whose proprietors were good for a handout he stopped in at one of them for a mug of tea sweetened with honey he drank it so fast it burned his mouth he didnt much care it put some warmth in his belly too which was what hed had in mind as he started tramping the pavement again a wagonful of laborers clattered past its irontired wheels loud on the cobbles most of the laborers were forthwegians a few kaunians the blonds looked even scrawnier and more ragged than the forthwegians they didnt get paid as much for the same work bembos sympathy was fleeting at best those kaunians could have been a lot worse off and he knew it good morning to you constable one of the laborers called he was a forthwegian but used classical kauniana good thing too because bembo still hadnt learned more than a handful of words in the forthwegian language after a moment he recognized the laborer as the fellow whod helped him find the barracks when he was new to gromheort and very lost he didnt want to speak kaunian where a lot of people could hear him doing it he did take off his hat and wave it to the forthwegian that seemed to do the job the blackbearded young man waved a hand in return a couple of blocks later bembo heard a man and a woman shouting at each other in forthwegian setting a hand on the bludgeon he wore on his belt he turned a corner and tramped down a muddy alley to find out what was going on whats all this about he said loudly in algarvian whether anybody would understand him was liable to be a different question but hed worry about that later sudden silence fell the man bembo saw was a prosperouslooking forthwegian the woman a kaunian who had strumpet written all over her strumpet or not she turned out to speak algarvian pointing to the man she said he cheated me i gave him what he wanted and now he wont pay this bitch lies the forthwegian said also in algarvianmaybe hed done business across the border before the war broke out i ask you officerdo you think id want a drab like this never can tell bembo saidhed heard of plenty of rich algarvians with peculiar tastes so why not a forthwegian too turning to the woman he asked what do you say he wanted from you my mouth she answered at once i know himhes too lazy to screw ignoring the forthwegians bellow of fury bembo glanced at the knees of the kaunian womans trousers they had fresh mud on them he hefted the bludgeon pay up he told the forthwegian the man cursed and fumed but reached into his belt pouch and slapped silver into the kaunian womans hand he stomped off still muttering under his breath the kaunian woman eyed bembo now i suppose youll take half of thisor maybe all of it she said no he answered and then wondered why a small offering to make up for all the blonds hed herded into caravan cars he didnt know then he had a new thought theres something else you might do i wondered if youd say that she answered with weary cynicism well come here when he walked out of the alley a few minutes later he was whistling this had all the makings of a fine morning retreat again retreat through heavy snow even this far north leudast shivered and cursed and tugged at the hem of his white smock as he stumbled along what might have been the road running back toward cottbus algarvian dragons thought it was the road eggs kept falling out of the sky along with the snow every so often unkerlanter soldiers would shriek as one of the eggs burst close enough to wound sir leudast called out captain hawart when the regimental commander came close enough to recognize sir are we going to be able to hold them out of the capital they wont take cottbus till every last man defending it is dead hawart said for a moment that reassured leudast then he realized that all those deaths might not be enough he trudged past a small field littered with corpses unkerlanter peasants slain by unkerlanter mages in a desperate effort to blunt the power of the murderous sorcery the redheads aimed at their kingdom what sort of funeral pyre would king swemmel light to hold the algarvians out of cottbus thinking about it made leudasts blood run colder than the miserable winter weather around him he hoped it wouldnt come to that if it didnt he and his battered comrades would have to be the ones who kept it from happening some great shapes came lumbering across a field toward him he started to bring up his stick an automaticand mostly futilereaction whenever he saw behemoths from behind him sergeant magnulf called dont blaze at those buggers theyre ours the behemoths were indeed moving east to oppose the advancing algarvians we do keep sending em into the fight leudast allowed now if only theyd last a little longer wed be better off he didnt realize a village lay ahead till he was marching through its outskirts peel off hawart shouted to his men peel off were going to make a stand here were going to make a stand at every village we come to from now on were going to keep making stands till none of us is left standing leudast went into a peasant hut much like the one in which hed lived till king swemmels impressers dragged him into the army being out of the wind made him feel warmer he peered through a window then nodded he had a good view to the east though with the snow he didnt know how soon hed see the algarvians but they would see him no sooner hed hardly found a spot he liked before the algarvians started tossing eggs at the village the flimsy walls of the hut shook around leudast he wondered if the roof beams were going to come down on his head efficiency he said with no small bitterness king swemmel preached it the algarvians seemed to know what it really meant all through the war their eggtossers had kept up with the fighting better than unkerlants one more reason weve got our backs to cottbus leudast thought he knew what was coming next after theyd softened up the position with eggs the algarvians would probe it and try to outflank it he didnt know what sort of defenses lay to either side he did know the redheads would get a bloody nose if they tried pounding straight through here they come somebody shouted leudast peered through the window sure enough little dark shapes were moving toward him through the snow the algarvians hadnt thought to use white smocks and hoods of their own to make themselves less conspicuous against an equally white background knowing mezentios men could overlook something like that made leudast feel oddly better he rested his stick on the bottom of the window frame and waited keeping it there would steady his aim before the algarvians got close enough for him to start blazing captain hawarts rear guard east of the village sent beams their way a few redheads fell the rest had to slow down and develop the unkerlanter position to see what sort of opposition they faced eggs started falling again this time in front of the village leudast cursed the algarvians also had far more crystals than did his countrymen had them and used them leudast wished the unkerlanter eggtossers were so flexibly directedfar from the first time hed made that wish and then as if to prove even an unkerlanter corporal could get lucky once in a while a great torrent of eggs rained down on the advancing algarvians snow and dirt flew so did bodies leudast whooped he yelled himself hoarse someone for once had done the right thing at the right time see how you like that you stinking whoresons he shouted in delight you dont buy anything cheap today he wondered if the algarvians would have to murder another few dozen or few hundred kaunian captives to get the magical boost they needed to push forward he wondered if his own kingdoms mages would have to murder more unkerlanter peasants to withstand that magic and even to hurl it back on its creators he wondered if anything would be left of unkerlant by the time the two armies and the two sets of mages were done with the kingdom instead of magic the algarvians chose behemoths half a dozen of the big beasts lumbered toward the village an egg had to burst almost on top of one of them to do it much harm twice leudast shouted when a behemoth was knocked off its feet each time he moaned a moment later when the animal staggered up and came on once more the behemoths advance was all the more frightening for being so slow and deliberate enough snow lay on the ground to hamper their movements hawarts rear guard had no real chance to do anything against the behemoths they were so heavily armored the only way a footsoldier with an ordinary stick could hope to bring one down was with a blaze through the eye that was possible it was very far from likely as they usually did the algarvian behemoths paused well outside the village four of them carried eggtossers which they used to pound the place some more the other two bore heavy sticks when they blazed the beams they sent forth were like swords of light they quickly set a couple of houses afire had one of those beams pierced leudast he would have died without knowing what struck him there were worse ways to go in war he was convinced of that hed seen too many seen them and listened to them too but before a heavy stick could swing his way the behemoths and their crews were distracted by something off to their left leudast couldnt tell what it was without sticking his head out the window which struck him as a good way to get a hole blazed through it he stayed where he was and waited with peasant patience he understood hed find out sooner or later what was going on and he did several unkerlanter behemoths advanced against their algarvian counterparts they started tossing eggs at the behemoths on which king mezentios men rode the algarvian crews knew they were a greater danger than whatever footsoldiers might be defending the village when artists illustrated battles among behemoths and when people talked about them they always depicted and described the beasts charging full tilt at one another so they could use their horns to deadly effect that did happenin mating skirmishes when the bulls fought without crews and without manmade weapons mounted on their backs in war such charges were all but unknown eggs and sticks did the bulk of the righting not the animals themselves a beam from a heavy stick tore through the chainmail an algarvian behemoth wore leudast could hear the beasts agonized bellow he cheered as the behemoth tottered and fell then a great blast of noise announced that an egg had indeed landed right on top of an unkerlanter behemoth not only slaying the beast but also touching off the eggs it carried leudast groaned as loudly as hed cheered a moment before as the longrange duel among the behemoths went on leudast noticed something strange the algarvian beasts and their crews fought as if they were the fingers on a single hand while each unkerlanter behemoth might have been the only one on the field he didnt know whether the redheads had crystals aboard all their behemoths or whether they were simply better trained to work together than the unkerlanters but the difference told they lost two more of their behemoths but after a while none of the unkerlanter beasts remained in the fight the surviving algarvian behemoths went back to pounding the village an egg burst just behind the house in which leudast was sheltering the sudden release of sorcerous energies knocked him to his knees he scrambled up again his ears ringing the next algarvian assault wouldnt wait long here they come that dreaded shout rang out again this time though leudast knew at least a little relief to go with the dread someone besides him had survived he cautiously peered out the window once more sure enough the redheads were moving forward in loose open order no beam no egg would slay more than one of them none of the rear guard hawart had set was still fighting the algarvians advance remained unhindered till they got within range of the unkerlanter soldiers holed up and waiting for them mezentio mezentio the yell raised leudasts hackles urra he cried as he began to blaze king swemmel urra he picked off one algarvian after another he seemed unable to miss every time he blazed another redhead fell hed never had such a run of luck but he couldnt kill the whole algarvian army by himself the soldiers he didnt kill kept on toward the village idly he wondered what the name of this place was if he died he would have liked to know where he was doing it a beam almost as thick as his thigh struck the hut from which he was fighting he stared in astonishment at the hole it made the edges of that hole began to burn merrily leudast swatted at the flames with a rag but couldnt put them out they licked hungrily at the old dry boards of the wall smoke started to choke him he realized he couldnt stay were he was not unless he wanted to burn too reluctantly he ran out into the street over here sergeant magnulf shouted and waved to show where he was come onthis is a good hole leudast needed no further invitation he dove into the hole he didnt know how good it was but it was very welcome were still here he said and magnulf nodded but the algarvians were still there too and still there in large numbers and their behemoths kept sending powerful beams through the village and tossing eggs into it one of those eggs burst right in front of the hole magnulfs head had been up above the edge he shrieked and clutched at his face blood poured around the edges of his mittens after a moment of standing there swaying he slowly crumpled his hands fell away from the hideous wounds his eyes were gone as if hed never had any his nose was burned away too leaving only a gaping hole in the middle of his face leudast grimaced hed seen a lot of horrors since the fighting started but few close to this magnulf likely wouldnt live not with those wounds if by some chancesome mischancehe did he likely wouldnt want to leudast pulled a knife from his belt and drew it across the sergeants burned and blistered throat more blood fountained but not for long even before magnulf drew in his last bubbling breath leudast was peering out as his friend had done hoping he wouldnt be unlucky as his friend had been and getting ready once more to fight to hold the algarvians out of the village fernao was wishing hed never been born that failing he was wishing hed never studied magecraft and that failing he was wishing hed never ever set foot in the land of the ice people had he escaped that colonel peixoto wouldnt have thought to include him in the lagoan expeditionary force cruising the ley lines toward the austral continent a plague of boils on king pendas pendulous belly fernao muttered as the implacable bucked beneath his feet like a unicorn gone mad had he not set out to rescue penda he wouldnt have had to go to the land of the ice people setubal could be a dreary place during the winter next to a cramped cabin on a ship implacably gliding farther south and east every moment dreariness seemed most attractive the leyline cruisers bow pitched down into a trough that pitched fernao off his feet fortunately he landed on his bunk not on his head gliding he said packing the word with enough loathing to suit a major curse on land a caravan traveling along a ley line stayed a fixed distance above the ground and the ground stayed fixed too but the surface of the sea wasnt fixedwas in these southern waters anything but fixed the implacable like the rest of the ships in the lagoan fleet drew from the ley line the energy she used to travel she couldnt possibly hope to draw enough energy to stay steady when the sea refused to do the same rubbing his shin which had banged off the bunks iron frame fernao got up and left the cabin he felt trapped in there if anything happened to the implacable hed die before he found out what was wrong and if you go up on deck youll die knowing exactly whats wrong his mind gibed is that an improvement in an odd sort of way it was the ships corridors and stairs had handrails that helped in a fierce sea fernao used them had he not used them he would have suffered far worse than a barked shin when he came out on deck sleet blew into his face sailors ran about doing their jobs with no more concern than if the cruiser had been tied up at a quay in setubal fernao envied them their effortless easeand kept a hand on a rail or a rope at all times the wind howled like a hungry wolf captain fragoso came up to fernao walking along the slanting deck as casually as the sailors did a fine morning sir mage he shouted cheerily aye a fine morning if he noticed the sleet he gave no sign of it if you say so fernao answered also raising his voice to make himself heard above the gale i must tell you though captain i have more than a little trouble discerning its charms do you do you indeed fragosos hat was secured by a chin strap the wind almost blew it away anyhow after settling it back on his head he went on if you like then i will tell you why it is a fine morning if you would be so kind the mage said oh i will i will never you fear fragoso said cheerful still its a fine morning because during this past long black night we sailed by sibiuas close as we were ever going to comeand the algarvians didnt spot us if that doesnt make it a fine morning curse me if i know what does ah fernao said and then gravely nodded youre right captain it is a fine morning of course the algarvians probably werent looking for us very hard either being under the impression no sane men would sail in such a sea i confess i was under the same impression myself aye well such is life captain fragoso said but they could have hurt us if theyd seen us the one great disadvantage of leyline ships is that they can only dodge where the lines cross we wouldnt enjoy it if dragons started trying to drop eggs on us not even a little we wouldnt fernao shivered at the prospect he was shivering anyhow but this was something new and different but then looking up toward the dark scudding clouds overhead he remarked i dont think the dragonfliers would enjoy going up in weather like this either something to that i shouldnt wonder fragoso said a wave smacked the implacable broadside sending spray and water over the rail and drenching the naval officer and fernao fernao cursed and shuddered fragoso took it in stride part of my business sirjust part of my business along with chilblains and pneumonia i suppose something else occurred to fernao we may well be able to get through all right captain were a surprise he was surprised the fleet had sailed in dead of winter so he didnt wonder that the algarvians were too but we wont be able to keep it a secret once weve landed on the austral continent if we need reinforcements king mezentios men will be on the lookout for them ah i see what youre saying fragoso shrugged theyll just have to do the best they can thats all no one had thought about anything past this first fleet was what that meant fernao had hoped for better but hadnt really expected it up in the crows nest atop the only mast the implacable carried the lookout let out a screech ice ice off the port bow fernao had hoped for better than that too but hadnt really expected it in sailing to the land of the ice people he would have been a fool not to expect ice drifting in the water but the fleet still was farther north than drifting bergs commonly came so early in the season arent we lucky the mage thought fragoso shouted into a speaking tube ordering the mages who drew energy from the ley line to bring the implacable to a halt and let the ice float past then he shouted into another tube this one sending his voice to the crystallomancer warn the other ships in the fleet what weve seenand warn them not to ram us while were stopped too fernao hurried toward the bow to get a good look at the iceberg hed seen them before but the fascination remained that great silent mass far larger than the leyline cruiser looked as if it had no business existing let alone being dangerous but it did and it was it could smash in the implacables sides as if they were made of eggshells rather than iron as the ship slowed fernao remembered what fragoso had said about leyline ships inability to dodge he wished he hadnt closer and closer drifted the mountain of ice its surface rocking slightly in the surging sea fernao gripped the rail as hard as he could the iceberg came close enough to let him see a gullor perhaps it was a petrelstrolling about on the ice as casually as a man might stroll down the boulevard of kings in setubal if the iceberg hit the cruiser the bird would fly away the implacable sailors wouldnt be so lucky neither would fernao a sailor loosed a triumphant shout its past sure enough fernao had to look to his rightto starboard he reminded himselfto see it it couldnt have missed the leyline cruiser by more than fifty yards he wondered how many more bergs the fleet would have to evade before drawing up to the ice shelf that formed even on the northernmost fringes of the austral continent every winter he hoped finding the answer to that question wouldnt be too expensive in the middle of the following night an iceberg did hit another cruiser the bergs weight and momentum carried the stricken ship off the ley line leaving it helpless and the rest of the fleet unable to go after it for a rescue the cruiser did have lifeboats if by oars or sails or current they reached another ley line the men who managed to board them might live if not fernao grimaced how long till we near the land of the ice people he asked at breakfast the next morning tables and benches in the galley were mounted on gimbals to minimize the chance of porridge and smoked pork and wine flying every which way commander diniz was in charge of the implacable eggtossers tomorrow morning if all goes well he answered spooning up porridge as if immune to the ships motion if we strike ice first well take a little longer fernao admired his easygoing good humor he also admired the way the officer ate his own stomach seemed uncertain whether it was supposed to cower between his feet or crawl hand over hand up his throat the mage finished his own porridge and pork with grim determination food in the royal lagoan navy was made to be tolerated not relished compared to what lay ahead on the austral continent have you ever eaten boiled camels flesh he asked diniz no sir mage cant say that i have the officer replied of course i wont be going ashore so its a treat ill just have to do without oh thats right fernao said in a hollow voice hed forgotten that misery loved company and here he had to be alone his gloom didnt last long few others from the implacable would be going ashore but she and her fellow warships escorted freighters full of soldiers they would soon discover the joys of cuisine in the land of the ice people he wondered what the ice people themselves would make of the lagoan expeditionary force from everything hed seen civilization meant little to them but his brief contempt faded no one would deny algarve was a civilized kingdom but the ice people could never have done what king mezentio s mages had used the tools and spells of civilization to accomplish he also wondered how algarve would respond to the lagoan thrust mezentio couldnt well afford to lose his main source of cinnabar but could he well afford to send an army across the narrow sea to help yanina fight the lagoans if cottbus falls he can fernao thought uneasily but the capital of unkerlant hadnt fallen yet maybe it wont he wondered if he was whistling in the dark there was plenty of dark in which to whistle this far south just past the winter solstice the sun hardly peeped above the northern horizon before setting again clouds turned what little light it sent into dusk and yet the lagoan fleet came up to the edge of the ice shelf jutting out from the austral continent on schedule and without further mishap fernao tipped his hat to colonel peixoto and the colonels comrades back in setubal he wouldnt have believed such a thing had he not seen it with his own eyes over the side you go captain fragoso seemed happy about the business as commander diniz had said he didnt have to climb down that rope ladder fernao did once he got down on the ice he promptly slipped and fell despite the spiked shoes he was wearing the sight of a fairsized army descending from the freightersand of the soldiers there also stumbling on the icewent further to console him than hed expected sure enough misery did love company he had plenty of company he was plenty miserable too night had already begun to fall by the time the lagoan army began its slow awkward slog across the ice in the direction of the barrier mountains the army didnt reach land till dawn the next day a couple of men of the ice people sat mounted on their hairy twohumped camels watching the lagoans approach fernao peered at them through a spyglass he borrowed from an officer they were laughing fernao fell down on the ice for about the twentieth time he decided he couldnt blame them marshal rathar was used to smelling wood smoke and coal smoke as he walked through the streets of cottbus for the past couple of days hed been smelling a new sharper odor with diem paper smoke frightened clerks in the unkerlanter capital were starting to burn their records lest they fall into algarvian hands they thought cottbus would fall even if they proved right rathar doubted getting rid of their files would do them much good king mezentios men would still have them after all some of the clerksand some higher officials tooseemed to have come to the same conclusion and seemed determined not to let the algarvians catch them every leyline caravan heading west was full of importantlooking people with officiallooking orders urgently requiring their presence away from cottbus some few of those orders might even have been genuine rathar wouldnt have bet more than a couple of coppers on it though he kicked his way through a kneehigh snowdrift as he neared the great open plaza around the royal palace as far as he was concerned cottbus was better off without functionaries who skedaddled when trouble came near he wanted people around him who could keep their heads but if king swemmel ever found out how many people were fleeing a lot of them were liable not to keep their heads in the most literal sense of the words imaginable a team of horses was dragging the body of a dragon painted in algarvian colors across the square mezentios dragonfliers kept trying to drop eggs on the palace they had no easy time of it heavy sticks all around made the immense building perhaps the toughest target in all of unkerlant one of the men in charge of the horses waved to rathar he waved back seeing men going about their business as if the algarvians were two hundred miles awayas if there were no war at allcheered him good morning lord marshal his adjutant said when he strode into his office good morning major merovec rathar answered hanging his cloak on a hook the colder it got outside the warmer the palace was heated that was the ancient unkerlanter way of doing things doctors said it helped lead to apoplexy but who listened to doctors glancing toward the map rathar asked what change in the situation since last night merovec often looked gloomy today he looked like midwinter midnight on the far side of the barrier mountains pointing he said in the north sir the algarvians have pushed us out of lehesten and in the southhe pointed againtheyre threatening thalfang with a certain somber satisfaction he added we do seem to be holding them in the center thats not good enough rathar said curse it lehesten should have held i thought it would hold longer than this anyhow and thalfang powers above you can see thalfang from the tops of the palace spires if they take it and sweep west from there they can put a ring around cottbus the same way they put a ring around herborn down in grelz we have to hold them out of thalfang no matter what draft orders to shift troops south lord marshal everything we have in the vicinity is already committed merovec answered worriedly i dont know where were going to come up with more if we dont come up with more in the next few days we wont have the chance to do it later rathar said and merovec nodded he understood the problem as well as the marshal of unkerlant did rathar smacked a fist into the palm of his other hand we have a lot of things were right on the edge of trying if we cant buy a little time to finish getting them ready well lose the war before we have the chance to use them aye merovec nodded again but we have so many men committed on other fronts i dont know where we can find more for this one king swemmel wont turn enough men loose for this front thats what you mean rathar said and his adjutant nodded once more the marshal sighed id better have a talk with him hadnt i lord marshal someone had better anyhow merovec answered he opened his mouth to say something more then shut it again rathar knew what would have come outsomething like he might listen to you and he probably wont listen to anybody else that was true and rathar knew it as well as merovec but with the war going as it was swemmel might also decide he wanted his marshals head rathar had no way to know beforehand even so he said ill do it anyone else would have to work up his nerve before he tried and we dont have the time to wait better to do it now than before everybody has to run west for his life he walked out of that part of the sprawling palace where the high officers in the unkerlanter army worked and into the core of the building the kings residence i dont know if he will see you lord marshal a servitor said doubtfully i dont know if he will see anyone rathar fixed him with a stare that would have chilled the heart of every unkerlanter breathingexcept king swemmel well go find out he growled and folded thick arms across his broad chest as if to say he wouldnt move from where he stood till he got an answer the servant eyed him then fled he came back looking very unhappy rathar would have bet swemmel had scorched him too but he said his majesty will receive you in the audience chamber in a quarter of an hour rathar nodded a single sharp jerk of his big head he cared not a copper for the servitors feelings getting to see king swemmel aye he cared about that in the anteroom in front of the audience chamber the marshal endured removing his sword and permitting the guards their intimate search of his person he endured the prostrations and acclamations he had to make before swemmel once admitted to the royal presence at last with security and ritual satisfied the king rasped get up and say whatever it is you have to say we shall listen though why we should with the kingdom in such straits is beyond us your majesty i ask you one question rathar said would the kingdom be in better straits with another man commanding your armies if you think so give him my sword and my baton and give me a stick so i can go out and fight the algarvians as a common soldier swemmel stared down at him from his high seat the kings eyes glowed his shoulders hunched forward giving him the aspect of a vulture peering around for carrion his embroidered robe encrusted with pearls and jewels seemed hastily thrown on for this audience rest assured marshal did we think that you would long since have gone forward thus good rathar said a sour odor came to him from swemmel was the king drunk or worse was he hung over were his wits working at all or would he blindly lash out at whatever displeased him rathar took a deep breath hed find out what do you propose now the king demanded you could not defend the border you could not hold herbornand now you must defend cottbus how will you go about it your majesty the enemy has taken lehesten he threatens thalfang we must retake the one and keep the other from falling or else we are ruined and cottbus falls there now it was said how would swemmel take it cowards swemmel muttered cowards and traitors theyre everywhereeverywhere curse it his gaze paralyzed rathar as readily as the marshal had overawed the servant how are we to overcome tliem wed better beat mezentios men first rathar answered if we dont do that nothing else matters we need every soldier nowevery soldier your majesty and every dragon and every behemoth and our little surprise for the algarvians as well such things are best saved for when they are needed most and this is the time can our person be properly protected if these men and beasts are taken away swemmel asked anxiously can your person be properly protected if you have to try to flee for your life from cottbus with the redheads closing a ring around it after they push on from thalfang and lehesten rathar returned king swemmel grunted a sound full of pain traitors he muttered again who will save us from traitors he glared at rathar one way or another my head will answer for this your majesty the marshal said whatever happens i am not going west from cottbus if we have to fight here in the city then here i will fight if only this whole kingdom had but a single neck swemmel cried then id take its head and use its energy to build a magical fire that would burn mezentio in his palace in trapaniaye and all his kingdom with him rathar believed every word could swemmel have done it he would joyously have swung the sword rathar said your majesty we have reduced the power of their magecraft he wondered how many unkerlanter peasants had paid with their lives for that reduction better not to know aye better by far war of a more ordinary sort was his proper business and he stuck to it its more nearly man against man and beast against beast than it was for a time but we need the men and beasts we need all the men and beasts he realized he was pleading king swemmel seldom listened to pleas after a long pause the king said we have learned there were riots against the algarvians in eoforwic yesterday thats good news exclaimed rathar who hadnt heard it anything that keeps the redheads from using all they have against us is good news aye swemmel agreed though he sounded almost indifferent kaunians and forthwegians went into the streets together we have heard perhaps your notion of sending kaunians back to forthweg with their tales of woe bore fruit after all i hope so your majesty rathar wondered if any unkerlanter peasants had escaped the clutches of their own kingdoms mages and brought tales of woe back to their villages he doubted it swemmel preached efficiency more readily than he practiced it but hed been most efficient about killing since the days of the twinkings war somewhere in the middle distance eggs started bursting algarvian dragons over cottbus again swemmel turned and stared east curse you mezentio he whispered you i trusted and you betrayed me too how had he trusted mezentio to be unready to fight when the time for fighting came so it had seemed then it also seemed as it always had to rathar a dreadful miscalculation the marshal said give me the men your majesty give me the men and the dragons and the behemoths we can throw them back he didnt know if unkerlant could but he wanted the chance to try who will protect us the king said again but then jerkily he nodded take them we give them to you throw them into the fire and may they smother it with their bodies and now we dismiss you rathar went through the ceremonial involved in leaving the chamber without a shadow of unhappiness swemmel had given him the chance how could he make the most of it a blizzard howled around istvan and his squadmates and all the other gyongyosian soldiers trying to carry the war in the starsforsaken mountains to unkerlant wool and sheepskin went only so far in warding them flaps from istvans sheepskin cap protected his ears but his beaky nose had long since gone numb he hoped it wasnt frostbitten even my valley doesnt have weather like this he said no small admission when gyongyosians from the interior would sometimes come to blows over whose home valley suffered through the nastier winters whats that sergeant szonyi asked he tramped along only a few feet from istvan but the shrieking wind blew words away never mind istvans next complaint had more substance to it how are we supposed to fight a war in weather like this were a warrior race szonyi answered youre a warrior blockhead istvan said but not too loud he didnt want szonyi to hear him even if the other soldier wasnt too bright he was a good man to have along when a squad of unkerlanters burst out from behind snowcovered rocks yelling urra at the top of their lungs the pathistvan hoped it was the path though he had trouble being surerose toward the outlet of yet another pass istvan wondered what lay beyond actually he could make a pretty good guess another valley not worth holding with plenty of snowcovered rocks behind which unkerlanters could hide every now and again he wondered why gyongyos wanted this miserable country he shrugged inside his coat that wasnt his concern all he had to worry about was taking the mountains away from the unkerlanters and staying alive while he was doing it somewhere back behind him was the whole intricate structure even a warrior race like the gyongyosians needed to wage war in this day and age baggage train supply dumps roads and leyline caravans eventually reaching back to gyongyos itself istvan seldom thought about that structure not least because it was behind him he and his comrades were the very tip of the gyongyosian spearpoint piercing the kingdom of unkerlant downhill hed been walking downhill for some little while before he realized he was doing it either hed found the top of the pass and was heading down into the next valley or kun he shouted breathing out almost as much smoke as if he were a dragon you frozen to death yet kun aye a couple of hours ago sergeant kun answered appearing at his elbow heh istvan said all right then what i want to know is are we still marching east or have we gotten turned around in the snow if were heading back toward our own men theyll cursed well blaze us for unkerlanters winds still blowing from behind us replied the corporal who had been a mages apprentice istvan hadnt thought of that but it didnt fully reassure him either here in the mountains the wind blows all sorts of crazy ways thats so kun plucked at his tawny beard like istvans it was covered with rime unlike istvans full shaggy one it grew by patches and clumps and so did less to keep kuns cheeks and chin warm i cant do anything about the wind you know i dont want you to do anything about the accursed wind istvan snapped i told you i want to know if im going east or west oh aye so you did kun plucked at his beard some more as if hoping to find the answer there after a few paces he spoke again have to see where the sun is if i could see where the sun is would i need to ask you stupid questions istvan shouted kun could make him as ready to burst with fury as an egg was with sorcerous energy but having burst he calmed again i cant see the sun if you can tell me where its at kun wore heavy wool mittens he took them off so he could fumble in his belt pouch he finally pulled out a piece of what looked to istvan like murky milky glass he held it in front of his right eye and peered through it now at one part of the sky now at another what are you doing istvan asked looking for the sun kun replied as if to an idiot child after a moment he condescended to explain more the property of this spar as it is called after a ships pole is to let in light of a certain sort only what istvan frowned light is light eh not to a mage kun said loftily then he gnawed at his lower lip and admitted i do not understand the theory as well as i wish i did but a man does not need to know how a knife cuts to know that it cuts and so i can use this spar and tell you more light shows ahead of us which means the sun lies in that direction since it is surely after noon we are marching west thats what i wanted to find out istvan said thanks the wind shifted blowing snow into his face he let out a couple of weary curses and went on fine to know im liable to be blazed by the unkerlanters and not by our own men im glad to know i relieved your mind kun replied istvan made a crack about relieving some part of himself a long way removed from his mind he and corporal kun both laughed so did szonyi who was close enough to hear he said i wish the stars wouldnt let things like getting blazed by your own side happen if theyre as wise and strong and allknowing as everybody says why do they let things like that happen sometimes thats for them to know not for the likes of us istvan said which was what his family and other people in his home valley had told him when as a boy hed asked such questions kun said why isnt it for us to know we know a lot more than our grandparents and even more than their grandparents why shouldnt we know things like that because we arent meant to istvan answered who told you that kun asked how did he know how do you know he knew istvan grappled with those unfamiliar questions for a little while not having any good answers for them he said if you go on talking that way you might as well not believe the stars have any power at all kun shook his head snow flew from his hat i have to believe because ive seen spells that call on them work he slogged on for another couple of paces in thoughtful tones he added but the unkerlanters spells work too and theyre goateating savages who reverence the invisible powers above that arent even there now istvan asked the hard question not kun what does that mean may i be accursed if i know the former mages apprentice answered im going to have to think about that for a while think about unkerlanters blazing you instead istvan said think about mountain apes sneaking down and carrying you off before you even know theyre there think about avalanches think about things you can do something about what can i do about an avalanche kun asked you can walk soft and try not to start one and you might be able to run to the side of one if it isnt too big and you see it soon enough istvan said kun trudged on for another few paces then nodded yielding the point istvan felt proud of himself he knew kun was smarter than he was and knew kun knew it too when they fenced with words the sergeant seldom made his corporal back up he had this time sometimes in clear quiet weather you could hear an egg sighing through the air toward you in the middle of the snowstorm the first istvan knew that the unkerlanters had started tossing was when the egg burst in front of his squad even then the wind muffled the roar and the deep snow in which the egg landed helped muffle the blast of sorcerous energy that came from it the snow the burst threw up masked the flash of that energy too before the second egg landed istvan was down on his belly in a snowdrift crawling toward the nearest rocks he could find stagger your cover if you can he shouted to his men those unkerlanter goatbuggersll be coming after us as soon as they think were in enough trouble between the bursting eggs and the shrieking wind he didnt know how many soldiers in his squad heard him he worried less than he would have with a squad of men seeing battle for the first time his troopers were all blooded they didnt need him to do their thinking for them some of themkun for instanceresented it when he tried urra urra through the wind through the thunderstorm of bursting eggs came the unkerlanter battle cry istvan bared his teeth now he was worried it sounded as if king swemmels men outnumbered the gyongyosians who faced them their hoarse angry shouts grew louder istvan shouted too here they come he blazed at the first figure in rockgray he saw through the swirling snow he heard his beam hiss and cursed the sound every snowflake the beam seared weakened it before it got to its target and there were a lot of snowflakes in the air the unkerlanter went down but istvan didnt think he was out of the fight a beam burned a furrow in the snow not far from him that reminded him he needed to roll away to make sure he didnt make a fat juicy target by staying in one place too long as he rolled he also made sure his knife was loose in its sheath with sticks so weakened this little battle would be fought at close quarters rolling did one more thingit coated his long sheepskin jacket with snow making him all but invisible sure enough an unkerlanter ran right past him not having any idea he was there istvan rose from the snowy ground like one of the mountain apes hed been talking about a little while before but he had better weapons than a mountain apes teeth and muscles better even than the club the ape hed killed might have been carrying he stabbed the unkerlanter in the back the fellow let out a scream that held almost as much surprise as pain he threw out his arms his stick flew from his hand red stained the snow as he fell istvan sprang onto him and slashed his throat spilling more scarlet onto white arpad arpad arpad those were gyongyosians coming to the rescue of their beleaguered comrades istvan feared the unkerlanter eggtossers would take a heavy toll on them but king swemmels men back at the tossers had trouble spying them because of the blizzard and they made short work of the unkerlanter footsoldiers forward a gyongyosian officer shouted stay spread out istvan added dont bunch up and let one egg take out a lot of you that proved good advice the unkerlanters finally realized their attacking party had failed and started lobbing more eggs toward the mouth of the pass by then it was too late istvans countrymen began the business of taking another valley away from unkerlant the only thing that could have made istvan happier was thinking anybody would want the valley once gyongyos had it eleven rain splashed down outside the tailors shop in skrunda where talsu helped his father the bad weather pleased traku who said well have some wet people coming to buy cloaks today aye but half of them will be algarvians talsu answered his father made a sour face theyre the ones with the money he said if it werent for them wed have had a lean time of it he let out a long slow exhalation i keep telling myself its worth itand telling myself and telling myself you keep telling yourself what talsus mother asked coming down the stairs from the living quarters above the shop that youre nosy laitsina traku replied laitsina snorted why do you keep saying that if you have so much trouble remembering it it cant be true before traku could answer his wife went on out with it now talsu smiled his mother was nosy she knew it too but that didnt make her stop after a couple of wordless grumbles his father said oh all right all right he usually did that was safer than really annoying laitsina by not telling her what was going on when traku was done laitsina said well well sit around getting lean tonight if you or talsu dont go over to the grocers and buy some dried chickpeas and some olives and some beans ill do it talsu replied at once his mother and father both laughed are you sure you want to head out in the rain traku said i can go a little later if it lets up thats all right talsu answered i dont mind i dont mind a bit traku and laitsina laughed again louder this time shaking a finger at talsu his mother asked would you be so keen about getting wet if the grocer didnt have a pretty daughter that made talsus parents laugh harder than ever his ears heated just let me have the money and ill go he muttered traku pulled coins from his pocket here you are he said i remember how much soap i used to buy because the soapmaker had a pretty daughter he grinned at laitsina who waved her hand as if to say shed never imagined such a thing traku added i mustve been the cleanest fellow in skrunda in those days oh there were some others buying plenty of soap too laitsina said but i do think you got the most probably the reason i chose youi cant think of any other not after all these years leaving his parents to their goodnatured bickering talsu grabbed his own cloak from a peg near the door and headed down the street toward the grocery which wasnt far from the market square his fellow jelgavans hurried wherever they were going with hats pressed low on their foreheads or hoods drawn up from their cloaks rain didnt come to skrunda all that often even in wintertime save that it made the crops grow they looked on it as a nuisance four or five algarvian soldiers came up the street toward talsu a couple of them looked as miserable to be out in the wet as any man of skrunda the rest though seemed perfectly content even though water dripped from the broad brims of their felt hats and ruined the jaunty feathers in their hatbands talsu had heard it rained all the time in the forest country of southern algarve maybe those redheads had got used to bad weather there on the other hand since they were algarvians maybe they just didnt know any better he had to press himself against a stone wall to give them room to pass that got him wetter they took no noticethough they would have if he hadnt gotten out of the way he glared at them over his shoulder fortunately for him none of them looked back with a sigh of relief at escaping the rain he flipped back his hood as he ducked into the grocers shop with even more relief he saw that the fat old fellow who ran the place wasnt behind the counter and his daughter was hello gailisa talsu said swiping at his hair with his hand in case the cloak had left it in disarray hello gailisa answered she was a year or two younger than talsu theyd known each other since they were both small but gailisa hadnt been so nicely rounded then and her hair hadnt shone so goldenor if it had talsu hadnt noticed he did now he made a point of noticing she went on im glad youre not an algarvian powers above so am i talsu exclaimed she went on as if he hadnt spoken you dont always keep trying to handle the merchandise for a moment he didnt understand exactly what she meant when he did he wanted to kill every lecherous algarvian soldier in skrunda he couldnt but he wanted to those miserable he began and then had to stop again he couldnt say what he thought of the redheads either a soldiers ripe vocabulary was the only one that fit and gailisa wouldnt have cared to listen to it she shrugged theyre algarvians what can you do talsu had already thought of one of the things hed like to do he would also have liked to handle the merchandise himself if he tried though he was gloomily certain gailisa would do her best to knock his head off he wasnt a conquering soldier just a fellow shed known forever what can i get you she asked he told her what his mother wanted she frowned how much of each it makes a difference you know i know that aye he said flustered i dont know how much though you chowderhead she said shed called him worse than that when he got orders mixed up well how much money did you get to buy this stuff he had to fish the coins his father had given him out of his pocket and look at them before he could tell her which only made him feel more foolish as far as im concerned you can give me mostly olives he said i like em and then tomorrow i can explain to your mother why she couldnt make the stew she wanted gailisa rolled her eyes no thank you she dipped up some salted olives from a jar enough to fill a waxedpaper carton then she beckoned to him and gave him a couple of olives to eat nobody has to know about these thanks he popped them into his mouth worked the soft tasty pulp off the pits with his teeth and spat the pits into the palm of his hand gailisa pointed to a basket next to the counter he tossed the pits into it more he asked hopefully gailisa gave him another one when my father asks why were not making any money ill tell him its your fault she said she dipped beans and chickpeas out of barrels and into larger cartons there you are talsu now youve spent all your silver ill give you three coppers change dont bother he said let me have three coppers worth of dried apricots instead i love those but right after olives gailisa made a face she gave him the little handful of dried fruit though he ate one apricot just to see her make another face then he pushed the rest of them back across the counter here you take them you enjoy them more than i do anyhow you dont need to do that she said i can reach into the crate any time i please and i know times are tight for everybody talsu looked out through the doorway at the rainy street as if he hadnt heard a word she said youre impossible she told him and he thought shed got angry but when he turned around she was eating an apricot he took the groceries and hurried home through the rain when he got back he found his father arguing with an algarvian military mage he took the beans and olives and chickpeas up to his mother then went back down to see if his father needed any help the mage was gesturing violently no no no he exclaimed in excellent excitable jelgavan that is not what i said thats what it sounded like to me traku said stubbornly whats going on talsu asked his father seldom got that worked up when talking with an algarvian for one thing traku didnt think it was worth the effort most of the time for another arguing with redheads was dangerous bowing the algarvian military mage turned to talsu perhaps you sir can explain to your father is it that i am not saying he ought to do anything that would in any way violate his conscience i only suggested suggested traku broke in powers above this fellow says i dont know how to run my own business when ive been at it as long as hes been alive that was an exaggeration but not by much the mage was somewhere in his thirties about halfway between traku and talsu i was seeking to buy a new tunic the algarvian told talsu with dignity and i discovered the handwork your father proposed to put into it and i was appalledappalled he made as if to tear his hair to show how appalled he was stiffly traku said thats what makes fine tailoring by the powers above handwork you want readytowear you can get that too and its just as ready to fall apart before very long no thank you not for me handwork aye the mage said but needless handwork no no and no i know you are a kaunian but must you work as folk did in the days of the kaunian empire i will show you this is not needful traku stuck out his chin and looked stubborn how have you got a tunicof any stylecut out and ready to be sewn and spelled together the algarvian asked if i ruin it two gold pieces to you he took them out of his belt pouch and dropped them on the counter they rang sweetly talsus eyes widened hed seen algarvian arrogance before but this went further than most take him up on it father he said youve got a couple of tunics under the counter so i do traku said grimly he took out the pieces for one and glared at the mage now what sew me a thumbs width of your finest seam anywhere on the garment the redhead told him then lay out thread along all the seams as you would before you use your own spells thats not near enough handwork traku warned but he did it the algarvian praised his work which made him no happier then the mage murmured his own spell it had rhythms not far removed from those jelgavan tailoring sorcery used but quicker and more urgent the thread writhed as if aliveand the tunic was done examine it the mage said test it do as you will with it is it not as fine as any other traku did examine it talsu crowded up beside him to do the same he held the seams close to his face to look at the work he tugged at them the mage was scribbling something on a scrap of paper reluctandy talsu turned to his father i dont quite know how itll wear but thats awfully goodlooking work aye the word came out of trakus mouth with even greater reluctance his eyes were on those gold pieces the ones he couldnt claim even as he eyed them the mage scooped them up again he set down the paper instead here is the spell sir it is in common use in algarve if that is not so here you will have more profit from it than these two coins far more a pleasant day to youand to you young sir he bowed to talsu then swept out of the shop traku snatched up the spell and stared at it then he stared out the door though the algarvian was long gone no wonder they won the war he muttered oh theyre always coming up with something new talsu said but theyre still algarvians so a lot of the new is nasty too itll bite em in the end you wait and see i hope so his father said its already bitten us after so long away after so long at the leading edge of the war where its teeth bit down on land previously peaceful sabrino found trapani curiously unreal almost as if it were a mages illusion seeing people going about their business without a care in the world felt strange unnatural his eyes kept going to the cloudy sky watching out for unkerlanter dragons that would not come oh the war hadnt disappeared it remained the biggest story in the news sheets commentators spoke learnedly on the crystal soldiers and occasional sailors showed off far more uniforms than would have been on the streets in peacetime but you could ignore all that over in unkerlant the war was not to be ignored sabrino didnt want to ignore it even though hed got leave hed come to the capital to enjoy himself aye but hed fought too hard to forget the fighting just because he wasnt at the front big announcement expected a newssheet vendor shouted big news coming he waved his sheets so vigorously the colonel of dragonfliers couldnt make out the headlines whats the news sabrino demanded its three coppers thats what it is the vendor answered cheekily he checked himself no two to you sir on account of youre in the kings service here you are sabrino paid him he walked down the boulevard reading the news sheet it was coy about giving details but he gathered that king mezentio was about to announce the fall of cottbus sabrino let out a long sigh of relief if die unkerlanter capital fell the derlavaian war was a long step closer to being over he could think of nothing he wanted more a small boy looked up at him reading the badges on his uniform tunic are you really a dragonflier sir he asked aye sabrino admitted ohhh the boys hazel eyes grew enormous i want to do that when i grow up i want to have a dragon for a friend too youve been listening to too many foolish stories sabrino said severely nobody has a dragon for a friend dragons are too stupid and too mean to make friends witli anybody if you didnt teach them to be afraid theyd eat you theyre even dumbera lot dumberthan behemoths if you want to serve the kingdom and ride animals you can make friends with pick leviathans instead why do you ride dragons then the kid asked him it was a good question hed asked it of himself a fair number of times most often after emptying a bottle of wine i do it well he said at last and algarve needs dragonfliers but that wasnt the whole answer and he knew it he went on and maybe im about as mean as the dragons are he watched the boy think that over huh he said at last and went on his way sabrino never did find out what the effect of his telling the truth was he went into a jewelers ah my lord count said the proprietor a scrawny old man named dosso he started to bow then cursed and straightened one hand going to the small of his back forgive me sir i pray youmy lumbago is very bad today how may i serve you i have here a ring with a stone that has come loose from the setting sabrino took from his belt pouch a gold band and a goodsized emerald i wonder if you would be kind enough to restore it while i wait and can you also size the ring so that it will fit on fronesias finger let me see let me see dosso took a loupe from a drawer under the counter and clipped it onto his spectacles sabrino gave him the ring and the emerald the jeweler examined them without looking up he said unkerlanter work aye sabrino admitted faintly embarrassed one way or another i happened to get my hands on it good for you dosso said ive got a son and two grandsons out in the west my boy is a secondrank mage you know hes repairing the ley lines when swemmels forces wreck them his son rides a behemoth and my daughters boy is a footsoldier powers above keep them safe sabrino said all hale so far dosso answered he pointed to the ring youve got one good prong here i should hope i do my dear fellow sabrino exclaimed he won a snort from the jeweler dosso continued that will help for i can use the law of similarity to shape the others magecraftmy son would laugh to hear me call it that hed reckon it just a trick of the tradeis faster than handwork and will serve just as well here and your lady let me see shes a size six and a half eh aye i can do that ill size the ring first and use the gold i take out to make up whats missing from the broken prongs that way i wont have to charge you for it as i would if i used gold of my own thats kind of you very kind indeed sabrinos back didnt pain him he bowed himself almost double hed been coming to dosso for many years not least because the jeweler thought of things like that have a seat if you like dosso said or you can go round the corner and drink a glass of wine if youd rather do that dont drink two or ill be done before you finish the second unless you really pour it down ill stay by your leave sabrino answered the company is apt to be better here than any id find in that tavern he perched on one of the wooden stools in front of the counter almost as if he were at a bar dosso snipped gold from the ring opposite the prongs that held the stone then reshaped it in fronesias size using a blowtorch to heat the ends and weld them together after hed finished shaping the metal and it had cooled he held up the ring i defy you to tell me where the join is my lord count sabrino looked at the gold circlet he ran his finger around it touch often being more sensitive than sight in such matters id like to catch you out but i cant do it now for the prongs dosso held out his hand sabrino gave him back the ring dosso set it down so that it lay on top of the gold hed snipped he used a thin gold wire to touch first the good prong then the extra gold and last one of the two damaged prongs as he did that he muttered to himself the little chant didnt sound like algarvian after a moment sabrino realized it wasnt it was classical kaunian with some of the words turned into nonsense syllables from who could say how many generations of rote repetition a chill ran through the dragonflier but those endless repetitions had made the charm extremely effective even if some of the words were ground into meaninglessness as sabrino watched the damaged prong reshaped itself dosso slid the emerald into place between what were now two good prongs as he repeated his ritual the third one grew out and embraced the stone with a grunt of satisfaction dosso handed sabrino the restored ring i hope it pleases your lady im sure it will shes fond of baubles sabrino paid the jeweler and went off well pleased with himself when he let himself in fronesia greeted him with a hug and a kiss that told without words how long it had been since theyd seen each other then she asked the question hed known she would and what have you brought me oh a little something he said his voice light and slipped the ring onto her finger fronesia stared at him the emerald was of an even deeper green than her eyes part of that stare was simple admiration part of it was a calculated assessment of how much the piece was worth its lovely its splendid she whispered both sides of her character evidently satisfied youre lovely he said youre splendid he meant it her hair glinted in the lamplight like molten copper her nose had a little bend in it just enough to make it interesting her mouth was wide and generous her short tunic displayed perfectly turned legs she was within a couple of years either way of thirty that gave him more than a twentyyear head start on her a truth he would sooner have forgotten i hoped youd like it i do very much one of her carefully plucked eyebrows rose and what did you bring your wife oh this and that he said casually the countess knew about fronesia of course but hadnt asked sabrino what hed got her maybe that was the restraint of noble blood on the other hand maybe she just didnt want to know have you seen her yet fronesia asked that took it further and faster than she usually went aye i have he replied it is good form you know algarvian nobles ran on form hardly less than their valmieran or jelgavan counterparts fronesia sighed form was harder on mistresses than it was on wives sabrino found that fair mistresses were supposed to be having more fun than wives nobles married for money or for family alliances far more often than for love if they wanted loveor sometimes even a physical approximation of itthey looked elsewhere sabrino asked and what have you been doing while ive been away trying not to get myself killed didnt sound right even if it was what he meant oh this and that fronesia answeredcasually she wasnt a pretty fool sabrino wouldnt have been interested in her had she been well i wouldnt have been interested in her for long he thought he wasnt blind to a pretty face or a pleasing figure far from it but gaining his interest was one thing holding it was another and with whom have you been doing it he asked her letters hadnt said much about her friends did that mean she didnt get out much or that she knew when and what to keep quiet some of my set she answered her voice light and amused i dont think theres anyone you know sabrino had more practice than she might have thought at reading between the lines that couldnt mean anything but everyone else i know is younger than you was she doing more than going to feasts and parties with her set was she being unfaithful to him if he found out she was if she made him notice she was hed have to turn her out of this fancy flat or at least make her find someone else to pay for it he was glad he hadnt had to pay anything for the emerald ring but the cost of repair the unkerlanter noble from whose house hed taken it wouldnt worry about ringsor anything elseever again fronesia turned it this way and that admiring the emerald suddenly she threw her arms around his neck you are the most generous man she exclaimed maybe she hadnt thought he might be bringing back loot rather than spending money on her he didnt bother pointing that out instead though his back groaned a little he picked her up and carried her to the bedchamber hed come to trapani to enjoy himself after all and enjoy himself he did if fronesia didnt she was an artist at concealing it she made him breakfast the next morning fortified by sweet rolls and tea with milk he went off to greet his wife the countess would know where hed spent the night but she wouldnt let on that was how the nobility played the game the new day was bright but very chilly that didnt keep vendors on the street from shouting about a special announcement due at any time they were still shouting it when sabrino took his wife to dinner that night and the next morning and the day after that pekka had helped bring kuusamo into the derlavaian war but the war had not yet come home to kajaani oh not much shipping was down at the harbor but not much shipping would have been down at the harbor in the middle of any years winter the sea hadnt frozenthat didnt happen every winterbut enough icebergs rode the ocean to the south to make travel by water risky and few additional men had yet been called into the service of the seven princes that would happen she knew it would it would have to so far though the war remained as theoretical as applications of the relationship between the laws of contagion and similarity war was its own experiment and gave its own results it asked questions and answered them her experiment with the acorns had asked new questions of the sorcerous relationship ilmarinens brilliant insight had suggested the direction in which the answer might lie now she needed more experiments to see how far she could push magecraft in that direction examining her latest set of notes she thought she knew what needed trying she smiled as she rose from her squeaky office chair and headed for the laboratory professor heikki would not come complaining about her spending too much time and too much of the departments budget there not any more she wouldnt professor heikki these days left pekka severely alone which suits me fine pekka murmured as she went into the laboratory theoretical sorcery was most often a lonely business here when it was linked so closely to kuusaman defense it grew lonelier still she couldnt even talk about her work with leino though her husband was a talented mage in his own right that did hurt several cages of rats sat on tables by one wall of the laboratory all the animalssome young and vigorous others slower creakier their fur streaked with graycrowded forward when the door opened they knew that was a sign they might be fed pekka did feed them a little then she took out two of the old graymuzzled rats and ran them one after the other through the maze a college carpenter had knocked together out of scrap lumber they both found the grain at the end of it with no trouble at all shed spent weeks training all the old rats to the maze they knew it well she let the second one clean out the grain set in the little tin cup once hed got to it then she gave him a honey drop as an extra reward he was a happy old rat indeed when she put him back in his cage and carried it over to a table on which once upon a time an acorn had rested she made careful note of which rat he was then searched among the cages housing young rodents finding his grandson didnt take long the law of similarity strongly bound kin the younger rat went on the other table that had once held an acorn again pekka noted the rat she had chosen when this experiment was over she would either have ensured her fame which she didnt care about and learned something important which she cared about very much or she laughed or else ill have to start over again and try something else she said powers above know ive had to do that before despite laughter she remained nervous she took a deep breath and recited the ritual words her people had long used before the kaunians came we of kuusamo were here before the lagoans came we of kuusamo were here after the kaunians departed we of kuusamo were here we of kuusamo are here after the lagoans depart we of kuusamo shall be here as always the ritual helped calm pekka whether this experiment succeeded or failed her people would endure confident in that she could go on with more assurance she raised her hands above her head and began to chant the spell she used was a variant of the one shed employed with the two acorns the spell that had made one of them grow at a furious pace while the other disappeared ilmarinens inversion suggested an answer to what had happened to that acorn after a good deal of thought pekka hador hoped she hadcome up with a way to find out if the inversion was merely clever mathematics anything ilmarinen did would be clever regardless of whether it was true or if it described something in the real world at which she could point she had to tell herself not to look at either of the cages while she was incanting if something did happen she wouldnt see it while she was shaping the spell only afterwards the old rat scrambled about in his cage which sat on the table that had held the disappearing acorn the young rat peered out through the bars of his cage which sat on the table that had held the acorn that sprouted at preternatural speed dont make a mistake she told herself again and again how many discoveries had been delayed because of chance errors in spells on and on she went watching herself perform as if she were an outsider everything was going as it should her tongue hadnt stumbled she wouldnt let it stumble iwont she thought no matter what i wont so may it be she exclaimed at the very end and slumped forward utterly spent performing magic was much harder work than considering how it might be performed she wiped sweat from her forehead though the laboratory was cool and the ground outside covered with snow so may it be she thought wondering what would be what had become now she could examine the cages and the rats inside them make sure you see whats really there she thought dont see what you wish were there the first thing she saw was that both cages still held rats that was a relief she didnt know what she would have done if one of the little beasts had vanished as one acorn had during her earlier experiment she supposed shed have gone back weakened her spell some more and tried again she examined the older rat first the changes in him if there were any would be easier to spot than those in his grandson he looked up at her his little black eyes shining his whiskers quivering his muzzle which had been flecked with gray was as dark as that of any rat for which a housewife had ever set a trap heart pounding pekka noted the changes in appearance she saw then she went to the cage that housed the other rat hed had a sort of awkward gangliness about him a sense of being not quite comfortable in a fullsized body about him adolescent rats and people were similar at least in that now now he looked like a mature rat a rat of about the same apparent age as his grandfather powers above pekka said softly that is what it does she checked herself i think thats what it does but had the spell rejuvenated the older rat at the expense of the younger one or had it sent both of them traveling through time in opposite directions ilmarinens work suggested the first but didnt rule out the second pekka had a way to find out shed built one into the experiment she took the grandfather rat out of his cage and took him over to the maze if he had trouble running it she would know hed been carried back through time to a point in his personal lifeline before hed learned which route led to the food if he didnt he would show he was essentially the same rat with a newer body tell me she whispered come on rat tell me she set him down in the maze and waited to see what he would do for a moment he did nothing at all he sat there at the beginning of the path his little black nose twitching his tail wiggling had pekka found him in her kitchen she would have tried to land him with a frying pan as things were she gave him an indignant look his indecision was liable to make her have to repeat the experiment she wondered if poking him to get him started would distort her results as if the rat sensed what she was thinking he started to move he went through the maze with as much assurance as he had before she subjected him to magecraft pekka had forgotten to refill the grain cup that served as his reward now he looked indignantly at her im sorry she said and gave him what he wanted and another honey drop to boot after hed eaten she picked him up and returned him to his cage he was at the moment the most valuable rat in the world though of course he didnt know it she and her colleagues would have to repeat the experiment a good many times but if the results held if they hold were going somewhere at last pekka thought where that might be she didnt know but the research whatever else one said about it was stalled no more she went back to her office carrying her notebooks with her there she activated her crystal and attuned it to that of one of the men waiting to hear what she had done a moment later siuntios image tiny but perfect appeared in the depths of the sphere ah he said smiling as he recognized her in his crystal what have you got to tell me master the famous lagoan navigator has just landed on the tropical continent she answered should some mage be tapping their emanations that would confuse him fortunately it didnt confuse siuntio his smile got broader is that so were the natives friendly everyone landed safe and happy pekka cast about for a way to continue the improvised code and found one he seems to have discovered the bigger part of the continent not the smaller one that would tell siuntio ilmarinens more probable set of results looked to be true not the less probable grouping in the crystal siuntio nodded and does the man who made the compass know what the navigator did with it not yet pekka said i wanted to tell you first you flatter me but he should be the one to hear this news siuntio said with a wave of farewell he broke the attunement between their crystals pekka did call ilmarinen then she used the same phrases to get the news across to him as she had with siuntio he also understood them shed expected nothing less but where siuntio had seemed pleased with the news ilmarinens mobile features twisted into a scowl were so cursed good at finding answers these days he said morosely if only we could find the questions to go with them i dont follow you master pekka said ilmarinens scowl got deeper suppose im your grandfather he said and put on a quavery old mans voice nothing like his real one as he pointed to her sweetheart im running out of years can i take five from you you wont miss em youve got plenty left he resumed his natural tones to add we can do that now you know youve just shown us how and will the rich start buyingor going out and stealingyears from the poor pekka stared in horror all at once she felt like burning her notebooks but it was too late for that what had been found once would be found again sure as the sun wouldbrieflyrise tomorrow in the crystal ilmarinen pointed at her and i assume your spell used all convergent elements it would have with the setup youd want to check things with your mice before pekka could correct him about the animals he went on try it with a divergent seriesbut calculate some of the possible energy releases before you start incanting powers above keep you safe he waved his image disappeared from the crystal pekka began to wonder why shed ever thirsted after abstract knowledge cornelu was splitting lumber with an axe when he saw the algarvian patrol trudging up the road from tirgoviste town and its harbor his grip tightened on the axe handle what were king mezentios men doing coming up into the hilly heart of tirgoviste island till now theyd mostly been content to hold the harbor and let the rest of the island take care of itself he wasnt the only one to have spotted them either algarvians giurgiu called and the rest of the woodcutters took up the warning what do they want cornelu demanded they cant be looking for rebels hed been looking for rebels ever since he splashed back up onto his home island hed found plenty of people who despised the algarvian occupiers but almost no one who despised them enough to want to pick up a stick and blaze at them king mezentios soldiers seemed to feel the same way about that as he did they tramped along in easy open order had irregulars been lurking in the woods the algarvians wouldnt have lasted a heartbeat but they had nothing to fear from woodcutters their leader a young lieutenant with mustaches waxed to sharp spikes waved to giurgiu the big burly lumberman took no notice of him cornelu snickered giurgiu didnt love algarvians cornelu knew that you there the lieutenant called giurgiu pretended to be deaf as well as blind that was a dangerous game algarvians were famous for their short tempers the lieutenant went on aye you you great ugly lout better answer him cornelu said softly hell use that stick if you push him too far giurgiu looked up from his work it was as if he were seeing and hearing the algarvian officer for the first time he made a better actor than cornelu had thought he could when he did answer it was in upcountry dialect what you want eh even cornelu whod grown up on tirgoviste had trouble following him to the lieutenant his words were likely gibberish though most algarvians and sibians could understand one another with a little work were looking for somebody the lieutenant said speaking slowly and clearly what say giurgiu kept right on acting like a moronan outsize and possibly dangerous moron for he leaned on the handle of an axe bigger and heavier than those of the other woodcutters were looking for someone the algarvian repeated he sounded as if his patience was wearing thin staring from one woodcutter to another he asked does anybody here speak algarvian or even a civilized dialect of sibian no one admitted to that under other circumstances cornelu might have but not now he wondered which man in particular mezentios soldiers were looking for he didnt think the algarvians knew he was here but what say giurgiu repeated in dialect even broader than before he didnt crack a smile he didnt even come close cornelu admired his straight face bunch of bumpkins sir one of the algarvian troopers said bunch of ugly stupid bumpkins maybe he was just saying what he thought maybe he was trying to make the sibians angry enough to show they understood algarvian maybe he was doing both at once cornelu wouldnt have put it past him whatever the trooper was doing the officer shook his head no he said in tones of cheerful unconcern theyre just lying they can follow me well enough or some of them can well well pay plenty of silver if they bring us this chap called cornelu and if they dont well hunt him down sooner or later come on boys he gathered up the soldiers by eye and headed up the track past the woodcutters well hunt him down sooner or later cornelu fumed at the algarvians arrogance but the fellow was a pretty good officer hed sown the seeds of betrayal he was probably doing that everywhere he went now he would wait to see where they ripened the woodcutters returned to work cornelu kept on splitting rounds of lumber he didnt look up from what he was doing he seldom did but now even less than usual whenever he straightened and looked around he found other mens eyes on him cornelu wasnt the rarest sibian name but it was a long way from the most common at suppera big bowl of oatmeal mush with a little salt pork stirred ingiurgiu strode over and sat down beside him on a fallen pine you the fellow mezentios hounds are sniffing after i dont know stolidly cornelu spooned up some more oatmeal i could be i suppose but maybe not too he wished hed given a false name when he joined this gang giurgiu nodded thought id ask fellow who fights like you likely learned how in the army or navy somebody who learned there might be somebody those loudmouthed foolsd want to work over aye thats so cornelu still didnt look up from his oatmeal he didnt want to meet giurgius eyesand he was hungry enough to make such bad manners seem nothing out of the ordinary all the woodcutters ate like that the work they did made them eat like that between a couple of mouthfuls cornelu added im not the only one who knows those tricks though theres you for instance oh aye theres me all right giurgius big head bobbed up and down almost as if he were once more making himself out to be more rustic than he really was but that algarvian didnt know my name he knew yours anger flared in cornelu turn me in then if im the one they want theyll probably pay you plenty theyd like us to be sweet sibians are an algarvic folk too with savage sarcasm he quoted the broadsheet hed seen down in tirgoviste town bugger that with an axe handle giurgiu said if they loved us so bloody much they shouldnt have invaded us thats how i see things anyway but theres liable to be some as see em different traitors cornelu said bitterly giurgiu didnt argue with him all he said was theyre there you try and pretend they arent itll cost you he got to his feet towering over cornelu try to stay warm tonight ive got a feeling the weathers going to turn nasty by sunup cornelu had the same feeling he wouldnt have expected it in a man who spent all his life on land the weather was often bad at this season of the year tirgoviste lay far to the south and they were well up in the hills even on rare clear days the sun hardly seemed to have risen before it set again in the northwest when clouds covered the sky murk and night were hardly distinguishable like everyone else cornelu had plenty of thick wool blankets he swaddled himself in them curling up close to the cookfire on nights like this it burned till daybreak even if that meant throwing on timber the woodcutters might otherwise have sold snow started falling a couple of hours after he fell asleep borne on the wings of a wind doubtless whipping whitecaps on the seas surrounding sibiu cornelu woke pulled a length of blanket over his head and went back to sleep when morning came the world was white down in tirgoviste town cornelu knew it probably wouldnt be snow it would be sleet or freezing rain to his mind even nastier he wished he were down there back in his own house making love with costache in front of a crackling firea fire made from wood he hadnt cut himself as an afterthought he remembered brindza fitting her into all that he wished her asleep in a cradle or wherever toddlers of that size slept did the cook give him an odd look while dishing out the morning oatmeal he couldnt be sure and didnt dwell on it he did dwell on shoveling down the oatmeal as fast as he could so it would put a little extra warmth in his belly he gulped two mugs of herb tea too for the same reason even though the stuff tasted nasty get moving dears giurgiu called to his men voice full of false solicitude down by the sea theyll be wanting what weve got to sell that they will i know you dont care to get your fingers cold but it cant be helped remember what brave fellows you are thats all instead of going back to work on the rounds of lumber hed been chopping up the day before cornelu got called over to help bring down a big fir before long he was sweating in spite of the snow and the wind that was blowing it he let out a grunt of intense satisfaction when the tree crashed down throwing up a brief blinding cloud of snow when it did woodcutting had its points he could actually see what he was accomplishing through the strength of his arms he walked along the trunk methodically lopping off the big branches one after another work felt good in weather like this if he hadnt been working he would have been freezing he swung the axe again and again breathing in great gulps of resinand sapscented air breathing out great clouds of steam and fog losing himself in the labor he might have been mechanism not man losing himself in the labor he forgot about what vlaicu the other man whod felled the tree might be doing he was reminded when he heard a boot crunch in the snow in back of him that was almost too late hed just raised his arms for another axe stroke and the other woodcutter tackled him from behind vlaicu had probably hoped to get cornelu down and get him hogtied before he could do anything about it hed lost his fight with giurgiu after all but giurgiu knew all the tricks of the trade and was bigger and stronger besides vlaicu didnt and he wasnt far from cornelus size cornelu went down on his knees but not to his belly hanging on to his axe with his right hand he used his left to break the other woodcutters grip on him then drove an elbow into vlaicus midsection it wasnt perfectly placed but it forced a grunt of pain from his foe cornelu threw another elbow twisted and scrambled to his feet vlaicu leaped back almost stumbling in his haste to recover his own axe he could have killed cornelu instead of jumping him but the algarvians had seemed to want him alive and so hed tried to make him a captive instead but since that hadnt worked a head might do as well cornelu made an awkward leap away from a stroke that would have cut him in two then he surged forward again chopping at his foe dimly he heard more woodcutters shouting as they came up so did vlaicu who bored in swinging wildly he must have realized most of the others wouldnt favor him cornelu ducked straightened and slammed the side of his axehead against vlaicus temple the other woodcutter tottered then fell like the fir blood stained the snow giurgiu bent beside him but only briefly dead you caved in his skull he told cornelu he jumped me he was going to give me to the algarvians cornelu answered but vlaicu had friends on the crew too liar they cried murderer other woodcutters shouted at them more axes were raised hold giurgiu roared such was his might that they did hold instead of leaping at one another i think cornelus telling the truth why else get in a fight now but vlaicus friends kept on shouting and he had quite a few of themmore than the dismayed cornelu had thought giurgiu jerked a thumb at the trail that led out of the hills and down to tirgoviste youve always been wanting to go into town you know whats good for you youd better get out of here now he told cornelu ill make sure you have a start looking at those furious faces cornelu knew he wouldnt last a dayor more to the point a nightif he stayed aye he said bitterly after an ironic salute he shouldered his axe as if it were a stick and trudged north toward the seashore snow poured down on thalfang fire and smoke rose up from the burning unkerlanter town tealdo crouched in a doorway ready to blaze anything that moved his whole company had been thrown into the meat grinder here he didnt know how many men were still alive but he did know the company would never be the same again after it came out the other side of the townif it ever did from the next doorway over trasone called maybe well make it to cottbus after all if we can take this stinking place first how much do we have left to take it with tealdo answered not a whole lot of reinforcements behind us thats for cursed sure and where are our behemoths ive hardly seen any the past few days we came past some that were frozen to death remember trasone said tealdo did remember and wished he didnt he also wished his comrade wouldnt be quite so sardonic he said i was hoping id see some that would do us some good with this much snow on the ground the powers below might as well be pulling at the beasts feet trasone commented how are they supposed to go forward in weather like this how are we for that matter he risked a quick look around the corner to make sure no unkerlanters were sneaking up then turned back to tealdo and i wouldnt mind a few more dead blonds helping the mages push us forward either he scowled at tealdo as if defying him to disagree with a shrug tealdo answered hard getting em up here these days what with the weather and with the unkerlanters playing games with the ley lines besides swemmel keeps on killing his own too he didnt know what trasone would say to that before trasone could say anything the unkerlanters started lobbing eggs at the forwardmost algarvians tealdo huddled in his doorway making himself as small as he could king swemmels men had a great swarm of eggtossers north of thalfang and the algarvians did not respond so readily or so strongly as they would have a few weeks or even a few days before pulled by horses or mules or behemoths eggtossers had an everharder time keeping up with footsoldiers as they pushed the front forward tealdo hoped for dragons but the cold and the snow were hard on them too after about a quarter of an hour the eggs stopped falling as abruptly as theyd begun in the sudden silence captain galafrone raised a shout forward men the unkerlanters are still getting ready to hit us well cursed well hit them before they are ready he shouted again mezentio mezentio tealdo yelled and sprang up from his hiding place other officers were shouting their men forward too more than half a year of war had taught them how their foes fought and sure enough they caught king swemmels soldiers out of their holes and gathering for their own attack that made the whitesmocked unkerlanters easier targets than they would have been resting in the sootstreaked snow or scurrying from house to house tealdo blazed a couple of enemy troopers more fell to beams from his comrades sticks but the rest instead of retreating surged forward tealdo dove behind a snowcovered pile of bricks he came up blazing and knocked over another unkerlanter in an abstract way he might have admired the courage king swemmels men showed theyd shown it ever since the fighting started theyd been forced back but they hadnt given up on themselves the way the valmierans and jelgavians had he wished they would have despaired in that case algarve would be victorious and he wouldnt have to worry about getting killed any more forward captain galafrone shouted again once we break out ofthalfang they wont have anything left to stop us tealdo didnt know whether the algarvians could break out ofthalfang and kept thinking about all the eggs the unkerlanters had thrown at them but he scrambled to his feet he sprinted for the next bit of cover he sawan overturned wagon in the middle of the street he crouched behind it blazing at the unkerlanters their attacking force melted as the snow hereabouts wouldnt do till spring trasone ran past him come on tealdos burly friend called do you want to be late for the party cant have that tealdo got up and advanced again as he ran he realized something had changed he needed a moment to know what it was then he exclaimed in glad surprise the snows stopped oh happy day that wasnt trasone it was sergeant panfilo any minute now the sun will come out and then you can go climb a fornicating palm tree just like theyve got in fornicating siaulia a few minutes later the sun did come out tealdo saw no palm trees fornicating or otherwise all he saw was a battered unkerlanter town sunshine made it dazzling without making it beautiful ahead lay a broad expanse of empty snowcovered ground the market square tealdo shouted were halfway through this stinking place anyway aye so we are trasone answered and theres half as many of us as there were when we got here too tealdo nodded but he wasnt really listening he was staring northwest across the market square across the rest of the ruins ofthalfang toward higher ground in the distance he pointed curse me if those arent the towers or whatever they call them of king swemmels palace trasone stopped and stared too youre right he said his rough voice softened for once weve come all this cursed way and there it is close enough to reach out and touch he stretched out a hand then shook his head and laughed of course weve still got a few unkerlanters to go through aye a few tealdo nodded they know they cant afford to lose this town and im not looking forward to crossing the square theyre bound to have snipers on the far side and were not decked out in white like they are makes us too easy to spot ought to cut the balls off whoever didnt think to lay in white smocks for us trasone growled some bespectacled whoreson in a nice warm office back in trapani probably figured wed lick the unkerlanters before we needed them so he didnt bother having any made come on boys theres cottbus ahead captain galafrone pointed in the direction of king swemmels palace itll be as easy to grab as a whores snatch now forward as if spying the towers had sorcerously restored his youth he charged out into the market square every algarvian within the sound of his voice followed thalfangs square was bigger than the one an algarvian town with about as many people would have had not being so crowded in their kingdom the unkerlanters could and did use space more lavishly and slogging through deep snow made the market square seem bigger still something moved there in one of the streets leading into the market square from the far side tealdo blazed at it but couldnt be sure whether hed hit it or not then eggs came whistling into the square out of the north and west they burst all around the advancing algarvians wounded men screamed and flopped in the snow like newly landed fish tealdo threw himself down the captains hit somebody yelledtealdo thought it was trasone but he couldnt be sure not with his ears stunned from so many bursts close by the unkerlanters had more left than anyone had thought they did and they were throwing in every bit of it to try to hold thalfang that thought had hardly crossed his mind before fresh shouts of dismay rose from some of the algarvians caught in the open behemoths raw terror edged those cries unkerlanter behemoths into the market square they came tealdo lifted his head and blazed at them now he knew what hed seen there in the street across the square he expected to have all the time in the world to pick off their crewmen even if he couldnt do anything much to the beasts themselves if algarvian behemoths bogged down in snowdrifts surely unkerlanter behemoths would do the same but they didnt they came forward almost as swiftly as they would have over dry ground in summer gaping tealdo saw that they had wide netlaced contraptions strapped to their feet snowshoes he thought numbly the unkerlanters have tricked out their cursed behemoths in snowshoes why didnt we come up with something like that he got no time to brood about it the behemoth began tossing eggs with deadly accuracy beams from heavy sticks hissed like giant serpents when they struck snow kicking great clouds of steam up into the frosty air some of that steam was tinged with red those beams boiled a mans blood as readily as a snowbank behind the behemoths came whitesmocked unkerlanter soldiers also on snowshoes unlike the algarvians they didnt flounder through the drifts but strode along atop them and there were so cursed many of them captain galafrone had said that once the algarvians got past thalfang not much stood between them and cottbus from somewhere or other king swemmel had found reserves galafrone hadnt known about well galafrone was already down tealdo didnt know how badly he was hurt or whether he realized how wrong hed been along with the behemoths the unkerlanters were throwing a couple of brigades at a bangedup battalions worth of algarvians and how many more soldiers did they have flooding into thalfang from the north those behemoths were terrifyingly close now theyd already passedor run overthe forwardmost algarvians did they intend to trample mezentios men as well as tossing eggs at them and blazing them with heavy sticks tealdo rose a little to blaze down an unkerlanter behemothrider who was fitting an egg to his tosser but other behemoths were already past him with footsoldiers close behind them cries of urra and swemmel mingled and began to drown those of king mezentio tealdo didnt feel the beam that burned its way through his middle not at first all he knew was that his legs didnt want to work anymore then he found himself face down in the snow and then a couple of heartbeats later he began to scream tealdo trasone cried his voice seemed to come from very far away from even farther away sergeant panfilo shouted in despair back we have to fall back dimly tealdo knew the sergeant was right despair filled him too despair and anguish thalfang wasnt going to fall if it didnt cottbus wouldnt either if cottbus didnt fall what would the war look like then itll look a lot harder thats what tealdo thought as he tried to use his arms to crawl back toward the edge of the square from which hed set out he left a trail of red behind him in the white he looked around for his stick it was gone somewhere color washed out of everything leaving only gray fading toward black however the war turned out he wouldnt know about it he lay in the square in burning thalfang unkerlanters on snowshoes shuffled past him and his countrymen retreated rain pattered down on bishah and on the surrounding hills that happened every winterseveral times in a wet winterbut always seemed to take the zuwayzin by surprise hajjaj had been through winters in algarve hed even seen winter in unkerlant he knew how lucky his kingdom was to enjoy a warm climate and also knew it needed what rain it got all the same watching drops splash down on the flagstones of his courtyard he wished the rain would go away tewfik came up behind him hajjaj knew that without turning his head no one elses sandals scraped across the floor the same way the crusty old majordomo stopped waiting to be noticed hajjaj was not so rude as to keep him waiting how now tewfik he asked glad to turn away from the wet outside well lad theyve found another leak in the roof tewfik spoke with a certain morose satisfaction ive sent a runner down to the city to lay hold of the roofers provided he doesnt break his neck in the mud my thanks hajjaj said the trouble is everyones roof leaks when it rains because no one bothers fixing a roof when the sun shines powers above only know when our turn with the roofers will come it had better come soon or ill have a thing or two to say about it tewfik declared everyones roof may leak but not everyone is the foreign minister of zuwayza all the other clanfathers are just as grand as i am hajjaj answered and all the rich merchants in the city are closer to the roofers than we are tewfiks first sniff said he cared little for the pretensions of zuwayzi nobles not fortunate enough to have him serve them his second sniff said he cared even less for any merchants pretensions i know whats required and the roofers had cursed well better too he growled arguing with him was pointless so hajjaj yielded all right how are the walls holding up well enough tewfik said grudgingly the winds not too bad so the eaves keep the water away theyd better hajjaj said like most zuwayzi houses his was made of thick bricks baked only by the sun if they got soaked they turned back into the mud from which theyd been made in every rainstorm people died when their houses fell in on them a serving woman came into the chamber where hajjaj and tewfik stood excuse me your excellency she said bowing to hajjaj but general ikhshid awaits in the crystal he would speak with you ikhshid himself not an aidedecamp hajjaj asked the maidservant nodded one of hajjajs graying eyebrows rose somethings gone wrong somewhere then ill speak with him of course i will he hurried to the crystals chamber next to the library and took care to shut the door behind him he didnt want the servants listening in sure enough there in the crystal was the reduced image of general ikhshid good day your excellency the plump old soldier said when he saw the foreign minister keeping dry as best i can hajjaj replied harder now than when i saw you last down in the desert near the old border with unkerlant whats toward with crystals as opposed to facetoface meetings coming straight to the point was good form ikhshid said it might be best if you drove down to the palace no matter how tight our control spells are you never can tell whos liable to pick up the emanations from a crystal hajjaj weighed that is it really so bad if it werent would i ask you out in the rain ikhshid returned youd better not hajjaj thought if i come down there and its not important youll be sorry ikhshid came from a powerful clan hajjaj had known him for upwards of forty years and judged him a pretty good officer if the news wasnt important hed make him sorry even so meanwhile the foreign minister sighed im on my way good ikhshids image disappeared light flared and then the crystal was merely a transparent globe once more tewfik yowled like a scalded cat when he found out hajjaj proposed leaving the house while it was still raining youll catch your death lad from inflammation of the lungs he said when he found hajjaj obdurate he stood out in the rain naked as any zuwayzi lecturing the driver on his responsibility to get hajjaj to and from the palace safely though a good many years older than the foreign minister he didnt worry about the possibility of coming down with pneumonia himself the driver took longer than hajjaj would have liked the roadway usually rock solid was full of gluey mud and once the carriage got into bishah it moved slowly even on paved roads a couple of tangles on rainslick cobbles had created snarls that would take hours to unknot at last hajjaj raised an umbrellafar more often used as a parasolabove his head and walked into the palace several servitors exclaimed in surprise at seeing him there he didnt tell them why hed come of course they would start guessing but he couldnt do anything about that he made his way through the winding corridors that led to general ikhshids office and past a couple of pots with water dripping into them proving not even the royal roof was exempt from leaks then he went through the inevitable ritual of tea and wine and cakes until finally he could ask and what is it you would not speak of through the crystal ikhshid wasted few words the algarvians have begun falling back from cottbus have they hajjaj murmured for a moment ice ran through him as if an unkerlanter winter lived in his belly then he rallied is it very bad well your excellency its not what youd call good the general answered like most zuwayzi soldiers he felt more passion for the alliance with algarve than did hajjaj who saw the need for it but these days found little more to love in king mezentios followers than in king swemmels ikhshid went on if cottbus doesnt fall unkerlant doesnt fall you know he gave hajjaj an anxious glance as if uncertain whether the foreign minister really did know that oh aye hajjaj said absently the fight just got harder in other words general ikhshid nodded hed served in the unkerlanter army in the six years war he knew about hard fighting at the moment he looked thoroughly grim hajjaj found another question how do we know this are you sure its true how ikhshid said the unkerlanters are trumpeting it so loud its a bloody wonder you need a crystal to hear them thats how the unkerlanters hajjaj observed with delicate understatement have been known to trifle with the truth not this time ikhshid sounded positive if they were lying the algarvians would be yelling even louder than they are and the redheads arent except for saying theres heavy fighting theyre keeping real quiet hajjaj clicked his tongue between his teeth quiet from the algarvians is never a good sign they boast even more than unkerlanters i wouldnt say that ikhshid checked himself he was at bottom an honest man well maybe i would but they arent so obnoxious to listen to something to that hajjaj said theyre more like usthey want to impress with how they say things too but never mind that if we start talking about why foreigners are the way they are well be at it for the next year we have more important things to worry about for instance have you told his majesty yet ikhshid shook his head no i thought youd better find out first hajjaj made another clicking noise not good general not good king shazli needs to know these things so do you your excellency ikhshid said it could even be that you need to know more than he does that had truth written all over it no matter how impolitic it was but truth hajjaj was convinced held many layers would your heart be gladdened if i undertook to tell him it would ill not deny ikhshid replied at once ill tend to it then hajjaj said trying not to sound too resigned getting him to tell the king of the algarvians misfortune was liable to be more than half the reason the general had summoned him down from his hillside home in the rain being who he was he had no trouble gaining audience with king shazli beastly weather isnt it the king said after hajjaj had bowed before him he sent his foreign minister a curious look what brings you down from your nice dry house on a day like this your excellency my house leaks too your majesty hajjaj answered when duty called i answeredwhich seems to be more than one can say of roofers heh shazli replied the curious look hadnt gone away and what sort of duty was it he shook his head no dont tell me now lets refresh ourselves with tea and wine and cakes before you get into it being the king shazli had the right to interrupt the rituals of hospitality the foreign minister wished he would have exercised it holding in such important news felt wrong but as hajjaj nibbled on a cake flavored with honey and pistachios as he sipped first tea and then date wine he decided it didnt matter so much after all shazli was no fool he would realize the duty that had brought hajjaj down from the hills didnt involve good news presently the king repeated his earlier question general ikhshid summoned me on the crystal hajjaj told him he convinced me i ought to hear his news straight from his mouth to my ear did he king shazli still had wine left in his goblet he drank it off now let me guess mezentios men have fallen short of cottbus so it would seem your majesty hajjaj inclined his head to the king no shazli was not a fool the unkerlanters have declared it and the algarvians havent denied it which means its likely true shazli let out a long sigh things would have been so much simpler if theyd driven king swemmel howling into the uttermost west of unkerlant that they would hajjaj said things are seldom so simple as we would wish though he wondered if king shazli really understood that not only was shazli still a young man hed had whatever he wanted since he was very small who could be surprised if things looked simple to him but he said we have got as much as we could out of this war nowwould you not agree the best thing we can hope for now is to keep as much of it as we can that struck hajjaj as a good sensible attitude it was in fact not so far removed from his own attitude he said your majesty ill do everything i can to make sure we manage exactly that good shazli said i know i can rely on you hajjaj inclined his head once more you do me too much honor he murmured and hoped he was being overmodest twelve garivald wasnt drunk yet from this latest jar of spirits but he wasnt far away either there just wasnt that much else to do not with snowdrifts taller than a man on the ground in zossen oh the livestock took up some time but less than in summer the pig and the chickens and garivalds couple of sheep and the cow shared his thatchroofed house with him annore syrivald and leuba they would freeze if they tried to go through the winter outdoors here in the hut they helped the hearth keep things warm they also made a dreadful mess even if the floor was only of rammed earth annore did her best to clean up after them but her best though better than that of most village wives wasnt nearly good enough garivald didnt mind the stink hed long since got used to that as he did every winter he didnt like stepping in freshly dropped dung but a careful man didnt do that very often he lifted his mug and let another swig of spirits burn its way down his throat well its not as bad as it could have been i suppose he said what isnt annore asked darkly she was washing leubas feet leuba at not quite three didnt watch where she stepped and didnt much care either having the algarvians in zossen garivald answered what the redheads annores thick eyebrows shot upwards powers above curse them i say she set hands on hips to show how strongly she meant it her nostrils flared she pointed at garivald you say that when theyve worked you like a slave chopping wood for them aye i do he answered thinkin spite of everything we have more to get us through the winter than we did in any other year i can remember aye they work us like slaves sometimes aye they robbed the harvest but we still managed to store away more than usual go ahead tell me im wrong he folded his thick arms across his chest and looked a challenge at annore a lot of unkerlanter husbands especially after theyd started drinking would have followed up that challenge by going over and smacking their wives around garivald didnt what restrained him wasnt so much chivalry as the nagging fear that hed wake up one morning with his throat slit if he got too rough with her she shrugged maybe we did she said in grudging tones no maybes about it garivald exclaimed aye powers above curse the algarvians but theyre lousy thieves inefficient i say king swemmels inspectors would have found a lot more of the hiding places where we squirreled things away maybe annore repeated maybe leuba said gaily she didnt know what her mother and father were talking aboutfor which garivald envied herbut she wanted to join in no maybes garivald said again theyre not up to a proper job of robbery the way unkerlanter inspectors would be words formed inside his head theyre lousy thieves he thought and who believes i theyre here to stay i for swemmels soldiers i grow ever bolder i to drive them away it wasnt a great song he knew that but it was a beginning maybe he could turn it into something worth hearing he hadnt known he could make songs till the summer before now they kept springing into his mind all unbidden softly he sang those first couple of scrappy verses to annore setting them to the tune of a sprightly dance she nodded approval but warned youll have to be careful about letting people hear that one somebodys liable to go to the algarvians with it and then where would you be i know garivald said youd best believe i know but maybe our own soldiers will come back to zossen before too long the redheads are still retreating they say they were his fellow villagers who knew no more than he did and roaming small bands of unkerlanter soldiers still on the loose after being bypassed by the advancing redheads who might heres hoping theyre right annore said but be careful anyhow until the rightful kings men take zossen back what now garivald raised an eyebrow you dont call raniero your king this for raniero annore said and made a rude noise delighted so did leuba and so did syrivald who these days was almost as tall as his mother garivald laughed after the redheads overran southeastern unkerlant mezentio had proclaimed his cousin raniero king of grelz once upon a time grelz had been a kingdom before shrinking to a duchy in the union of crowns with unkerlant but grelzers and unkerlanters were closest kin grelz had never had an algarvian king as far as garivald was concerned it still didnt only an algarvian catspaw leuba wasnt likely to talk enough to get garivald into trouble he did eye his son you have to remember syrivald nobody needs to hear what we say inside the house i know father syrivald said seriously after eyeing him his father nodded syrivald by now was used to keeping his mouth shut before the redheads swept through this part of the kingdom people hadnt wanted waddo to hear a lot of what they said that became especially true after zossen got a crystal of its own a direct connection between the village and king swemmels vast corps of inspectors and impressers now different people might betray things to the redheads but the principle remained the same garivald was glad syrivald understood it outside boots crunched on snow garivald grew alert visitors in dead of winter werent that common people stayed indoors most of the time he didnt care to leave the house to go outside in the cold and wind he wondered who among his fellow villagers would when he heard the knock he knew unkerlanter knocks even worthless waddos were casual friendly things this one served notice if he didnt come to the door right away whoever was on the other side would break it down annores lips shaped a soundless word algarvians aye garivald agreed but ive got to let them in he regretted saying they werent so bad when they pounded on his door they were very bad indeed reluctantly he went to the door even more reluctantly he opened it sure as sure three algarvian soldiers stood there shivering and trying to look fierce their own kingdom hadnt given them proper coldweather gear theyd added hats and cloaks stolen from villagers to their short tunics and kilts that made them look less uniform and somehow less ferocious it didnt make them look much warmer we coming in one of them said in bad unkerlanter the other two pointed their sticks at garivald as if to tell him hed better not complain he already knew that well come in if youre coming he said gruffly dont stand there letting all the heat out cold flowed over his feet and legs in waves as soon as the tall redheaded soldiers were inside he shut the door behind them one of them wrinkled his nose and spoke in his own language the other two grinned garivaid didnt know what they were grinning about and didnt want to find out these garrison soldiers had been in zossen since the village was captured not all of them were bad fellows not as people hed come to know them that didnt mean he wanted them in his house they were looking around he didnt like it when their eyes settled on annore the garrison troops lived up to the algarvians name for lechery regardless of whether they carried sticks if they aimed to torment his wife theyd have to kill him first but after a couple of leers their gaze showed what they really had in mind you giving us a pig said the one who spoke unkerlanter you giving us a sheep too or he gestured with his own weapon take them garivaid said in disgust aye he shouldnt have said anything about how the algarvians werent so good at robbing peasants as unkerlanter inspectors were the words came back to mock him but even if he had to eat peas and beans and pickled cabbage till spring he wouldnt starve and neither would his family take them he repeated the sooner the algarvians were out of the house the smaller the chance theyd start looking toward annore again theyd come prepared one tied a rope around the sheeps neck the other two had a harder time catching the pig but they managed both animals let out piteous sounds of protest when the redheads took them out into the snow but they went garivaid closed and barred the door once the algarvians were gone well he said with peasant fatalism the house isnt so crowded now but fatalism went only so far powers below eat the stinking thieves as theyll eat my beasts he burst out aye and may their bellies gripe annore agreed a couple of days later new algarvian troops came stumbling into zossen out of the west they were leaner tougherlooking men than the little squad of garrison soldiers wolves rather than dogs but they were sadly battered wolves a couple of them wounded all of them half frozen and weary unto death after theyd paused to get warm and to eatmaybe some of garivalds pork and muttonthey went on heading east the soldiers theyd left behind began looking like worried dogs dagulf came to visit in a state of high excitement maybe our own menu be coming back in a few days he said sipping the mug of spirits garivaid gave him that was a thought worthy of getting a man out of his own houseand dagulfs wife nagged he went on maybe theyll chase these raggedy kilted buggers back to algarve where they belong thatd be good garivaid was halfway to being drunk himself and would have agreed to almost anything dagulf had a scar on his cheek it twisted his smile aye it would he said and then we can let people know who played along with the redheads you know names so do i not as bad here as some places they say some places lots of people are willing to lick ranieros algarvian arse but the folk of zossen did not get the chance to inform on their collaborationist neighbors no unkerlanter soldiers fought their way into the village to slaughter the garrison or drive king mezentios men back toward the border instead struggling forward through the snow half a dozen algarvian behemoths and a company of footsoldiers camped in zossen one of their officers a young lieutenant spoke unkerlanter pretty well at his order the villagers had to assemble in the central square you wish we were gone dont you he said with an unpleasant smile you wish swemmels men were here instead dont you if they do come how glad will you be to see them after they cut your throats to power their magecraft against us eh think on it by the next morning the algarvians were gone heading west to get into the fight garivald feared more would be coming though he was lying wasnt he annore said garivald only shrugged he remembered the convicts whod been sacrificed for the sorcerous energy to power zossens crystal he wished he didnt but he did who could say what swemmel would or wouldnt do to drive the redheads back when krasta walked through the west wing of her mansion the wing given over to the algarvians who helped rule occupied priekule she knew at once that things were not as they should have been on any normal day the clerks and spies and military constables who labored there would have leered and muttered among themselves as she walked past they were redheads leering at goodlooking women was in their blood the only thing that kept them from reaching out and fondling her as she went by was in their blood the only thing that kept them from reaching out and fondling her as she went by was her being lurcanios mistress the count and colonel could punish anyone who go to gay with his hands today though the algarvians scarcely seemed to notice her though she was wearing a pair of green velvet trousers cut like a second skin mezentios men talked in low voices but not about her the looks on their faces put her in mind of those the servants had worn after her parents died theyd had a shock and they were wondering what would come next when she strode into the anteroom where captain mosco worked she demanded nothings gone and happened to your precious king has it colonel lurcanios aide looked up from his paperwork to mezentio he said no indeed miladyas far as i know hes hale as can be but his face had that pinched pained expression on it too and his voice was full of things he wasnt saying setting his pen in the inkwell he rose from his desk ill tell the colonel youre here he returned a moment later aye hell see you krasta went into lurcanios office the algarvian was as always courteous as a cat he got to his feet bowed over krastas hand and gallantly raised it to his lips he handed her into the chair across from his desk but it all struck krasta as a performance and not a very good one at that what is the matter with you people today she fumed have you not heard lurcanio asked even his accent seemed thicker than usual as if he wasnt trying so hard to shape the sounds that went into valmieran if id heardwhatever there is to hearwould i be asking you krasta said by all the long faces out there i thought something was wrong with your king mosco said that wasnt it but he didnt say what was no mezentio is hale lurcanio said echoing his aide but against all expectations we have been thrown back before cottbus which naturally pains us oh krasta said is that all lurcanio stared at her from under gingery eyebrows going gray you may not think it so much of a much milady but there are those who will tell you it is no small thing indeed i fear i am one of them but why krasta asked in genuine perplexity by the powers above lurcanio its on the other side of the world few things outside priekule and next to none outside valmiera carried much weight with her lurcanio perplexed her by rising and giving her another bow ah milady i almost envy you you are invincibly provincial he said by his tone it was a compliment even if krasta didnt quite understand it as far as im concerned she said with a sniff king swemmel is welcome to cottbus a nasty place for a nasty man he is a nasty man it is a nasty place lurcanio agreed with a sniff of his own but unkerlant has a great many nasty places and none of them so strong or so strongly held as cottbus it should have fallen that it did not fall will mean complications in the war ahead to krasta tomorrow was a mystery a week hence the far side of the moon you will beat the unkerlanters she said after all if you beat us you can beat anyone for a moment what looked uncommonly like a smirk lit lurcanios face it vanished before krasta could be sure shed seen it he said actually the unkerlanter army has given us a rather better fight than valmieras did i cant imagine how that could be krasta said i know you cant i almost envy you that too lurcanio said he might have been speaking gyongyosian for all the sense he made to her but whether you can imagine it or not the thing is there and we have to see what comes of it krasta tossed her head i know what will come of it no one will be having any parties worth going to until you people decide you can be happy again and powers above only know how long that will take before lurcanio could answer she spun on her heel and stalked out of his office she swung her hips more than usual when she headed back toward the part of the mansion that still belonged to her even so hardly any of the algarvians looked up from their work as she went by that only made her unhappier if no one was watching her she hardly felt she was alive bauska she shouted when she got back into her own section of the mansion curse it you lazy slut where are you hiding coming milady the maidservant said hurrying down the stairway and up to her she was very pale and gulped as if hoping her stomach would stay quiet as far as krasta was concerned shed been next to useless since captain mosco put a loaf in her oven gulping again she said how may i serve you fetch me my wolfskin jacket krasta said enjoying the prospect of sending bauska back upstairs i am going to go for a walk on the grounds here you are milady bauska sounded astonished walking the grounds was not krastas usual idea of amusement the only good krasta usually saw in having wide grounds as a matter of fact was in keeping neighbors at a nice respectful distance but she was feeling contrary today all the more so after than unsatisfactory conversation with lurcanio and so she snapped i certainly am now get moving with a sigh bauska trudged up the stairs to get the jacket she gave it to krasta and gave her a reproachful look with it that was wasted krasta never noticed it fastening the wooden toggles on the wolfskin jacket krasta went outside she exclaimed as the cold bit at her cheeks and nose but neither of the algarvian sentries at the front door stirred an inch she cursed their indifference under her breath the skins in the jacket came from unkerlant few wolves survived farther east in derlavai krasta patted the soft gray sleeve at the moment she quite enjoyed wearing something from swemmels kingdom she wished she could throw that in lurcanios face but knew she didnt dare he got quite stuffy where what he saw as algarves honor was concerned snow crunched under her shoes it was a couple of days old soot from the countless coal and wood fires in priekule had already streaked it with gray everything was cold and quiet so quiet she could hear the scream of a dragon high overhead the algarvians kept a couple of them in the air above priekule all the time to give warning of lagoan raiders the lagoans didnt fly north very often krasta sniffed she scorned valmieras former allies even more than she did its conquerors the algarvians at least had proved their strength she walked on getting chillier with every step in spite of the wolfskin jacket the algarvians had to be mad to want to fight a war in unkerlant in the wintertime they should have settled down where they were and waited till spring next time i meet a general at some feast or other maybe ill tell him so krasta thought some people just cant see whats in front of them what was in front of her were more snowcovered grounds and barebranched trees in the summer the trees screened priekule from her sight for the most part that suited her fine the city had altogether too many commoners in it for her to want to look at it very much now though the spires of the royal palace and the taller paler shaft of the kaunian column of victory were plainly visible inside the palace king gainibu drowned his humiliation in spirits krasta didnt care to dwell on gainibu a king as far as she was concerned shouldnt be a sot that left the column of victory to draw her eye there it stood as it had since the days of the kaunian empire proud and fair and beautifully carved and algarvian soldiers patrolled the park whose centerpiece it was and all of priekule and all of the kaunian kingdom of valmiera sudden unexpected tears stung her eyes her eyelashes started to freeze together angrily she knuckled them foolishness she thought she was getting by she was doing better than getting by with an algarvian protector the hardships that had hold of the kingdom hardly touched her she nodded she was looking at things the right way the redheads had won the war and nothing that happened in faroff unkerlant could have anything to do with that she was certain she was right there why then did the tears keep trying to come back before she could find an answeror more likely stop looking for onea couple of algarvians mounted on unicorns came trotting up the road from priekule one of the unicorns still bore some splotches of the duncolored paint that had made it harder to spot during the fighting the other was the white to which even clean snow could only aspire both riders slowed to leer at krasta most times she would have withered them with a glance colder than the weather now oddly she welcomed their attention she welcomed any attention the smile she gave them was just this side of an invitation to a lewd act in the snow well hello sweetheart one of them said in accented valmieran whose girl you being you being anybodys girl my companion is colonel lurcanio krasta answered before she thought that would kill the unicorn riders interest in her and she didnt want it killed but it was both redheads grimaced the one whod spoken gave her a formal salute as if she rather than lurcanio were his superior officer meaning no offense he said and spurred his unicorn toward the mansion the other cavalryman followed close behind krasta stooped and scooped up a snowball and threw it after them it fell short they had no idea shed flung it the snow stung her hands she rubbed them on the fur of her jacket opening and closing them to get the blood flowing and make them less icy the two algarvians tied their unicorns in front of the mansion and went inside they dont even know its my house krasta thought oh they might suspect because colonel lurcanios woman wouldnt be anyone ordinary but they didnt know they would have leered at bauska too and ive come out of the war better than most krasta murmured powers above she looked over toward the kaunian column of victory once more the triumphs it celebrated were vanished now the emperor whod won them was only a name in history books history books she hadnt read pretty soon the algarvians would write the history books and then no one would ever hear his name again she headed back toward the mansion even after she went inside she was a long time feeling warm ice was forming in count sabrinos waxed mustachios snow lay on the plains of unkerlant far below the algarvian colonels dragon had carried him into air colder still he reached up with his right hand to knock the ice away he used the goad in his left to whack the side of the dragons long neck swinging its course more nearly southwest the dragon let out an immense furious hiss stupid like all its kind it wanted to do what it wanted to do not to follow its dragonfliers commands sabrino whacked it again harder this time obey curse you he shouted though the freezing wind blew his words away the dragon didnt hiss this time it screamed he wondered if it would twist its head back and try to flame him off it that was a dragons ultimate sin he waited ready to whack it on the sensitive end of its nose if it so forgot its training but screaming again it took the course he wanted he looked back over his shoulder to make sure the wing he commanded was following sure enough thirtyseven dragons painted in stripes of green white and redthe algarvian colorsmatched his change of course his mouth twisted like any man of his kingdom he showed what he thought his wing should have numbered sixtyfour but fighting had been desperately heavy these past few weeksmen and dragons were dying faster than replacements could reach the front a burning peasant village sent smoke high into the air almost as high as sabrino flew he eyed the column of smoke in mild surprise hed thought most of the unkerlanter villages hereabouts had gone up in flames during the algarvian advance on cottbus now down there on the ground the unkerlanters at home in winter were the ones moving forward no sooner had that thought crossed sabrinos mind than he spied a group of unkerlanter behemoths tramping east they skirted the village which might still have algarvian defenders holed up in it over the drifts came the great beastsliterally some bright unkerlanter had had the idea of fitting them with outsized snowshoes those let them cope with deep snow far better than algarvian behemoths could sabrino grimacedwhat an embarrassment to be outthought by unkerlanters when it came to coldweather fighting king swemmels men had outthought the algarvians several different ways sabrino was nearly sure unkerlanter footsoldiers accompanied those behemoths he couldnt see them though not from this height the unkerlanters wore white smocks over the rest of their clothes and were nearly invisible in the snow that sort of need hadnt occurred to sabrinos countrymen with thick wool tunics and stockings with heavy felt boots with fur hats and furlined capes the unkerlanters had an easier time staying warm than the algarvians too the dragons flew over another village this one wrecked in the earlier fighting lumps in the snow around it might have been dead behemoths sabrino flew too high to spot snowcovered human corpses in any case they were too common to attract much notice there ahead lay the shattered town of lehesten north and slightly east of cottbus algarvian troops had briefly held it just as theyd fought their way into thalfang south of the unkerlanter capital sabrino had heard theyd spied the spires of king swemmels palace from thalfang he didnt know whether that was true if it was they hadnt seen them for long fierce unkerlanter counterattacks had shoved the algarvians out of thalfang and out of lehesten too now the unkerlanters were pouring footsoldiers and behemoths and even horse and unicorn cavalry through lehesten using the town as a marshaling point for their counterattack sabrino whooped to spot a column of behemoths hauling heavy eggtossers toward the fighting front even with snowshoes on the behemoths feet even with skids under the eggtossers that column wasnt going anywhere fast activating the crystal attached to his harness took only a muttered word of command the faces of his three surviving squadron leaders tiny but perfect appeared in the crystal we are going to tear up that column sabrino told them aye colonel captain domiziano exclaimed aye colonel captain orosio agreed lets hurt the whoresons he was perhaps five years older than domiziano in the flesh thirty years older in the spirit sabrino spoke to the newest squadron leader captain olindro your men and dragons will fly top cover for us if the unkerlanters come against us youll hold them off till we can get some height and join you youll do that or youll die trying sabrino thought olindros predecessor had as domiziano and orosio had before him olindro said aye colonel if he thought about his predecessors fate he didnt let on a good soldier couldnt let his fears and worries show though sabrino had never known a fighting man without them lets go he shouted and whacked his dragon again this time in the command to dive for once the dragon obeyed with alacrity even its tiny brain had come to associate diving with fighting and it liked fighting better than feeding perhaps even better than mating domiziano and orosios squadrons followed sabrino down the icy wind thrummed in his face had he not worn goggles it would have blinded him behemoths and eggtossers swelled from specks to toys to real things in what seemed no time at all sabrino led the dragons against the column from the rear hoping to put off for as long as he could the moment when the unkerlanters realized they were under attack he always used that tactic sometimes as today it worked very well indeed secure in their possession of lehesten secure also in their possession of the initiative the enemy soldiers paid the air no attention till sabrino ordered his dragon to flame a sheet of fire fueled by brimstone and quicksilver burst from the dragons mouth it engulfed a behemoth the men riding on the beast and the eggtosser perhaps ten feet in front of it the behemoth never made a sound it might have been inhaling when the fire rolled over it it simply toppled dead before its flank hit the snow a couple of men in white smocks trudging along beside the eggtosser did shriek as flames devoured them the eggtossers carriage being made of more wood than metal caught and began to burn so did the casings of some of the eggs on the carriage mages made them to stand up to a good many things but not to dragonfire bursts of sorcerous energy from the unleashed eggs finished the work of wrecking the tosser the flame had begun the rest of the dragons in the two squadrons sabrino had ordered into action flamed the column with him only a handful of men and a couple of behemoths escaped their first onslaught no one had ever said the unkerlanters lacked courageor if anyone had said it hed been a fool the survivors of the algarvian attack promptly started blazing at the men and dragons whod tormented them so only luck would let a footsoldier bring down a dragon the beasts bellies were painted silver to reflect beams and even a blaze through the eye might not pierce their small bonearmored brains dragonfliers were more vulnerable a beam hissed past sabrino he used the goad to hit the dragon in the throat urging it to climb it didnt like that it wanted to go back and use more flame in the end badtempered as usual it obeyed him he was willing to go round and make another pass at the unkerlanters but before he could give the order olindros tiny image appeared in his crystal dragons the squadron leader said face twisting in alarm unkerlanter dragonslots of them sabrino looked up sure enough olindros squadron was under assault from perhaps twice its number of dragons all painted the rockgray of unkerlanter military tunics his dragon saw the enemies too it didnt much care for the beasts on its own side but hadslowlylearned not to quarrel with them screaming with fury it flew hard toward the dragons the unkerlanters rode the great muscles that powered its wings pumped hard as sabrino drew near he unslung his stick and aimed it at an unkerlanter flier his forefinger went into the activating hole at the base of the stick a beam blazed forth from the other end it missed the unkerlanter good blazing was hard from dragonback with both target and blazer moving so swiftly cursing even so sabrino forced his dragon up through and past the enemies attacking his men and beasts most of the two squadrons he led followed his example they were almost to a man veteran dragonfliers they knew what needed doing dragonfights were war in three dimensions height mattered by the way the unkerlanters flew a lot of them were new aboard their badtempered mounts they didnt try to keep sabrinos men from gaining altitude they were intent on destroying olindros squadron under that waxed mustachewhich was icing up againsabrinos lips skinned back from his teeth in a savage grin inexperience could and he vowed would be an expensive business he chose the enemy dragon he wanted then urged his own beast into a dive the unkerlanter dragonflier had no notion he was there without the slightest twinge of consciencethe unkerlanter would have exulted at doing it to himhe blazed the fellow in the back the unkerlanter threw out his hands his stick flew from one of them he slumped down onto his dragons neck the beast no longer under his control showed its true nature it struck out wildly at friend and foe alike then flew off to prey on the frozen countryside below the war had left it plenty of carrion on which to feed sabrino blazed at another unkerlanter dragonflier he missed again and cursed again but his dragon was flying faster than the enemys mount nearer and nearer he drew this unkerlanter was a little more wary than the other one had been but not wary enough hed only started to swing his dragon around to face sabrino when the count ordered his own dragon to flame again fire burst from the dragons jaws it caught the unkerlanter beast in the flank and more important in the membranous wing bellowing horribly flaming back with fire falling short the unkerlanter dragon fell out of the sky toward the ground far below sabrino thought he heard the dragonfliers fading scream more unkerlanter dragons were plummeting to earth or flying off under no mans control so were some of his own he howled his fury at the losses algarve couldnt afford themand the men were friends as well as comrades but before long the unkerlanters had had enough and fled back toward the west the direction from which theyd come sabrino didnt order a pursuit he didnt care to face the fresh squadrons king swemmels men might send up with his own beasts tired instead he waved back toward the east toward the algarvians own chilly makeshift of a dragon farm when they flew over the front he quietly thanked the powers above that he wasnt down there fighting on the ground one reason hed started flying dragonsand the best one hed ever foundwas that it beat the stuffing out of the footsoldiers life bembo wished he were back in tricarico walking a constables beat in a provincial town in northeastern algarve hadnt been the most exciting job in the world but now he realized he hadnt appreciated it enough while he had it compared to some of the things he had to do here in gromheort and in the surrounding villages that beat seemed like paradise the plump constable didnt mindwell he didnt mind too muchbeing plucked out of his comfortable home and sent west to help keep order in one of the kingdoms algarve had conquered somebody had to do it and besides serving as a constable in occupied forthweg while harder than doing it in his own home town was in most ways infinitely preferable to being issued a stick and sent off to the front in unkerlant in most ways but not in all along with the rest of a squad of constables from tricarico bembo led several dozen trousered kaunians through the streets of gromheort toward the towns leyline caravan depot some of the blonds walked along as if they had not a care in the world but most had trouble hiding the fear they surely felt husbands comforted wives mothers comforted children even as they did so though those husbands and mothers were biting their lips and fighting back tears themselves a man turned toward bembo and stretched out his hands why he asked in algarvian a fair number of people in gromheort spoke some of the constable s language what did we do to deserve this keep moving was all bembo said keep moving or youll be sorry he was always sorry to draw this duty but the kaunian didnt have to know the people over me know what theyre doing bembo thought if were going to win the cursed war we have to do what we have to do its only kaunians after all cant make an omelette without breaking eggs at the thought of an omelette his stomach rumbled hungrily aye youd better keep moving you buggers or youll get what for sergeant pesaro said also in algarvian pesaro was a good deal plumper than bembo evodio translated the sergeants warning into classical kaunian for the blonds who couldnt follow algarvian the kaunians and their guards tramped past a young forthwegian man in a long tunic coming the other way like most forthwegians the fellow was blocky and dark with a big tuber of a nose right in the middle of his face he would have looked just like his unkerlanter cousins farther west had he not let his beard grow out he shouted something in his own language at the kaunians bembo didnt understand a word of it but the way the forthwegian drew a thumb across his throat could mean only one thing so could his coarse laughter oraste laughed too the forthwegians are happy as clams that were cleaning the kaunians out of their kingdom for them he said and spat on the cobblestones its good riddance as far as im concerned powers above know i dont especially love kaunians but bembos voice trailed away he watched a pretty young motherif he was going to watch kaunians he preferred to watch their womenkeeping a boy of about six walking along the child seemed happy enough the mothers face was set tight against a scream bembo ground his teeth no parts of this duty werent what he would have wanted oraste had no doubts for which bembo envied him oraste seldom had doubts about anything like a hound like a hawk the veteran constable brought in whatever his superiors aimed him at he said werent for the cursed kaunians here and in valmiera and jelgava we wouldnt have a war now far as im concerned the whoresons deserve whatever happens to em sneaks and sluts the lot or em aye bembo said abstractedly but he was still watching that nicelooking blond and her little boy another forthwegian passerby jeered at the kaunians on the way to the caravan station maybe nine out often people in the shattered kingdom of forthweg were actually of forthwegian blood the tenth being the blonds whod dwelt in this part of the world since the longvanished days of the kaunian empire as oraste had said most of the forthwegians had scant use for their trousered neighbors keep moving sergeant pesaro called again youd better keep moving if you know whats good for you this isnt stinking eoforwic you know not a single bloody soul in these parts believes your lies again evodio translated his words into classical kaunian the empires language had changed very little here like almost all algarvians like almost everyone in the west of derlavai bembo had studied classical kaunian in school like most people hed forgotten just about all of it as soon as he didnt need it any more evodio was an exception he didnt look scholarly he looked almost as much like a bruiser as oraste did one of the kaunians spoke in his own tongue evodio translated what he said for pesaro he asks why you say theyre lies everyone knows theyre true you must know it too he says i dont care what he says pesaro growled anybody who riots on account of a pack of lies is fair game and that by the powers above goes for kaunians and forthwegians both only rumors about the riots in eoforwic had drifted east to gromheort some kaunians seemed to have escapedor to have been released by unkerlanter raiders the rumors werent clear on thatfrom the labor camps the algarvians had set up for them near the western front they claimed their folk were being used not for labor but for their life energy with the algarvians slaying them so mages could use that energy to power great sorceries against king swemmels soldiers bembo was pretty sure those claims were true but most of the time did his resolute best not to think about it even forthwegians went up in smoke when they heard what we were up to out in the west he saidvery quietlyto oraste always a few hotheads oraste answered with a fine indifferent algarvian shrug were back in the saddle in eoforwic and thats what counts no he didnt waste time on doubts instead he pointed ahead almost there gromheorts leyline caravan depot a massive pile of gray stone not far from the counts palace had taken considerable damage when the algarvians seized the city nobodyd bothered repairing it since so long as the ley lines themselves were clear of rubble everything else could wait till victory finally came pesaro said step it up evodio translated for the kaunians benefitthough that wasnt really the right word inside the depot bembos boots made echoes kick back from the walls as he strode across the marble floor no lamps burned leaving the depot a dank and gloomy place the roof leaked it had rained a couple of days beforegromheort rarely got snowand little puddles dotted the floor a cold falling drop got bembo in the back of the neck he cursed and wiped it away with his hand an algarvian military policeman carrying a clipboard came up to pesaro how many of these blond whoresons have you got he asked fifty the constabulary sergeant answered that was the quota they gave me and i deliver he puffed out his chest but however much he puffed it it would never reach out past his protruding belly fine the other algarvian said obviously not impressed he studied his clipboard then scribbled something on it fifty eh all right take em over to platform twelve and load em onto the caravan there twelve you hear im not deaf pesaro said with dignity he would have scorched a constable who sassed him but had to be more careful around soldiers since he couldnt tell the military policeman off he shouted instead at the kaunians the squad had rounded up come on you lousy buggers get moving platform twelve the man said likes to hear himself make noise doesnt he oraste said under his breath you just noticed bembo answered and the other constable chuckled but then more charitably bembo added well who doesnt he knew he did and knew very few algarvians who didnt the forthwegians and kaunians hed met since coming to gromheort seemed less given to display sometimes he just thought that made them dull others though he got suspiciouswhat were they hiding no one could have hidden anything out on platform twelve which stood open to a chilly breeze blowing out of the west once upon a time the platform had had a wooden roof the stumps of a few charred support pillars were all that remained of it there by the edge of the platform the cars of the caravan floated a couple of feet above the ley line from which they drew their energy and along which they would travel looking at those cars bembo said where are we going to fit this lot of blonds i dont think theres room for em he didnt think there was room for about a thirdmaybe even halfof the kaunians already jammed in there well shoehorn em in somehow oraste said where theres a will theres a lawyer he chuckled nastily and we can feel up the broads as we shove em in the blond man who knew algarvian turned to him and said i already knew better than to expect mercy from you is the smallest decency too much to ask for you kaunians spent years and years and years grinding a foot down on algarves neck and nobody ever heard a word about mercy or decency from you oraste said he chuckled again now youre going to get it in the neck and see how you like it guards opened doors on some of the cars they and the constables herded the kaunians into them it did take a lot of pushing and shoving the seat of the trousers was one obvious place to shove oraste enjoyed himself bembo confined his shovings to the back though he couldnt have said why he bothered even before the last of the kaunians were inside the cars workmenforthwegians with an algarvian bossbegan nailing over the windows wooden grates with only the narrowest of openings between the slats whats that all about bembo asked at last the job was done the guards forced the caravancar doors closed then barred them from the outside from within bembo could still hear the moans and cries of the kaunians as they sought whatever comfort they could find he doubted they would find much oraste waved to the cars though with those grates on the windows the men and women inside could hardly have seen him so long he called you think its bad now it only gets worse later off to unkerlant with the lot of you he threw back his head and laughed a couple of the forthwegian carpenters must have understood algarvian for they laughed too but sergeant pesaro rounded on oraste growling shut up curse you they wont want trouble on the caravan while its going west so dont stir up the stinking kaunians hes right said bembo who as usual on roundup duty wished he were doing anything but oraste nodded to pesaro and gave bembo a dirty look as soon as the carpenters had nailed a grate over the last window the leyline caravan silently glided away for a moment bembo simply watched it then he gaped its going east he exclaimed east toward algarve why are they sending kaunians that way no one had a good answer for him all the algarvians on the platform looked as surprised as he was skarnu laughed softly as he strode through pavilosta toward the market square merkela who walked beside him sent him a curious look whats funny she asked the town hasnt changed much not that i can see no the town hasnt changed skarnu agreed but i have ive been on your farm so long now and spent so much of my time there that pavilostas starting to look like a big city to me it looks big to me she answered matching him stride for stride she wasnt far from his height or from his strength shed done farm work all her life not just over the past year and a half looking first to one side of the street and then to the other she murmured buildings all around and some of them three four stories high aye it looks plenty big enough it does to me toonow skarnu said i grew up in priekule though pavilosta didnt used to seem so much of a much not after the capital its all what you get used to i suppose an algarvian soldier carrying several links of sausage looked merkela up and down and gave her a saucy smile as he walked by her answering stare would have chilled live steam to ice on the instant it didnt chill the soldier who went on up the street laughing some things you never get used to merkela said some things you keep on fighting even if they slay you for it aye skarnu said unlike most of valmiera merkela and he were still fighting vengeance merkela murmured softly it was these days the most important thing she lived for one reason she favored skarnu these days was that he lived for it too they walked past a broadsheet pasted on a wall for the killer of count simanu gold pieces it proclaimed merkela reached out and squeezed skarnus hand hed slain simanu after all and if he hadnt merkela might have a greengrocers was quiet while the rest of the shops on the street bustled painted across the window were half a dozen words revenge for simanunight and fog skarnus shiver had nothing to do with the weather whoever met night and fog vanished off the face of the earth hed found that out when he visited a comrades farm dauktu was gone and all his family with him skarnu didnt want to think about that as he and merkela neared the square he remarked do you know what i miss from priekule she shook her head her straight blond hair even fairer than his flew back and forth skarnu said i miss news sheets merkela shrugged pavilosta never had one of its own it isnt big enough for that i suppose sometimes they bring them in from other towns these days a news sheet would be full of algarvian lies anyhow aye so it would skarnu agreed the biggest news is the redheads have to keep on fighting in unkerlant if theyd taken cottbus wed all be singing a sorry tune right now good they didnt merkela said fiercely the only thing wrong is the unkerlanters wont give mezentios men everything i would skarnu wasnt so sure of that the soldiers who followed king swemmel were anything but gentle then skarnu glanced over to merkela on second thought she was probably right whatever swemmels men did to the algarvians it wouldnt match what shed do if only she could he didnt remark on that whatever he said merkela would come back with something like well of course one of the reasons shed been drawn to him even before the algarvians killed her husband was that hed refused to quit fighting them he didnt think it was the only reasonhe hoped notbut he was a long way from sure it was the smallest one instead of a daily or a weekly news sheet pavilosta had the market square people gathered to gossip as much as they did to buy and sell algarvian soldiers walked through the square but not so many as had walked it before fall turned into winter that wasnt the cold keeping them indoors so much as it was the war in the distant west pulling them out of valmiera skarnu wished it would pull them all out of his kingdom merkela went off to buy pins and needles which she couldnt make for herself on the farm skarnu cared nothing about pins and needles he wandered over to the table from which an enterprising pavilosta taverner sold ale the taverner nodded to him as he came up he would never be a proper local not if he stayed on the farm near town till his hair went from gold to silver but hed been here long enoughand kept his mouth shut well enoughto win a little respect he laid coins on the table the taverner poured him ale from a big stoneware jug he sipped then nodded good he said his accent still announced that he came from the capital not the provinces imitating the local dialect only made him sound like a bad actor imitating peasant taciturnity worked better aye it is though the weathers too cold for the proper tang to come through the taverner answered he was no peasant and the hinges of his jaws worked fine he looked around for the closest algarvians not seeing any kilted soldiers within earshot he leaned forward across the table and asked have you heard the latest dont think so skarnu leaned forward too till their heads almost touched tell me why dont you ill do that i will indeed had the taverner brought his mouth any closer he could have given skarnu a kiss they sayi cant prove its true but they do say it and nobody says anything different not that ive heardthey say the redheads are going to knock over the column of victory down in priekule what skarnu jerked as if stung by a wasp they cant do that his memories of the column went back to earliest childhood back to the days before his parents had died in a leyline caravan collision orphaning him and krasta they can the taverner said pretty rotten piece of business anybody wants to know what i think which isnt too likely especially if you listen to my wife go on skarnu was only half listening he picked up the mug of ale gulped it down and shoved it and coins across the table for a refill he took a long pull at that too trying to imagine the capitals skyline without that pale stone needle thrusting up from the middle of the park he couldnt do it he had an easier time visualizing the royal palace gone powers above he said at last they wouldnt just knock down a monument theyre trying to make us forget who we are now the taverner gave him a blank look the fellow might be shrewd in business but how much education did he have not much probably that wasnt so for skarnu whod always been a better student than his sister valmieras roots like those of jelgava to the north were anchored in the soil of the longago kaunian empire monuments survived all over both kingdoms the column of victory was just one of the more spectacular if the algarvians were trying to destroy them theyre trying to kill our kaunianity skarnu said intelligence kindled in the taverners eyes he understood what that meant all right hadnt thought of it so he said but curse me if ill tell you youre wrong no curse the redheads aye curse the redheads skarnu agreed aye curse the redheads merkela said coming up beside him buy me some ale and tell me why were cursing them this time she didnt bother keeping her voice down both skarnu and the taverner looked around the square in alarm fortunately none of the algarvians seemed to have heard skarnu explainedin a voice hardly above a whisperwhat mezentios men spoke of doing merkela nodded powers below eat them she snarled may it be so skarnu said and did his best to change the subject have you got what you need such ploys failed more often than they worked this time he got lucky i do merkela answered and for a better price than i thought i would too every copper counts these days that set her cursing the algarvians again but in a more restrained way what about you oh i just came along to keep you company and get out of a mornings work skamu answered and to keep you out of trouble he added to himself as for the work only in winter could a farmeror even someone turning into a farmersay such a thing and get away with it even at this season of the year merkela reproachfully clicked her tongue between her teeth work shouldnt wait she said which might have been a peasants creed all over derlavai she drank the mug of ale skarnu had got her then slipped her arm into his for a moment he thought that was fond possessiveness then she declared come on lets go you can finish most of the chores this afternoon and not leave so much for tomorrow she was in deadly earnest she usually was skarnu wanted to laugh it off but didnt quite dare meek as any henpecked husband he let her lead him out of the square out of pavilosta and back toward the farm he was chuckling inside but made sure it didnt show like most towns pavilosta had gone up at a power point which let mages work there without fueling their sorcery with sacrifices pavilostas power point was small and feeble one reason the place remained no more than a village another reason was that it did not lie on the ley line connecting two stronger local power points that line lay between pavilosta and merkelas farm most times going to and from the village skarnu hardly noticed it the algarvians kept the brush down along it as had the valmierans before them but in winter there was no brush to keep down today though he and merkela had to pause at the ley line because a long caravan was passing by it was heading southeast in the direction of priekule and beyond the capital the strait of valmiera merkela stared at the cars as they silently slid past why are all the windows covered with those wooden grates she asked i dont know skarnu answered ive never seen anything like that either but after the caravan had passed a stench lingered in the cold crisp air it put him in mind of the smell of the trenchesunwashed men and undisposedof wastebut it was stronger and even more sour maybe its a prison caravan he suggested maybe merkela looked along the ley line if those are prisoners of the algarvians i hope they get away skarnu peered after the caravan too slowly he nodded when ealstan fled gromheort hed though everything would turn out fine after he got to oyngestun vanai lived there after all if he hadnt fallen for her he wouldnt have fought with his cousin and had to flee the city falling for a kaunian girl would have been hard enough for a forthwegian even in peacetime with the redheads occupying the kingdom iwonder if i killed sidroc ealstan thought for the hundredth or maybe the thousandth time sooner or later he would hear from his family leofsig would know where hed gone leofsig or their father would find a way to get in touch with him ealstan didnt dare write back to gromheort that would tell the local constables and maybe the algarvians too where he was staying of course if sidroc wasnt dead and didnt have his wits scrambled when he hit his head after ealstan punched him he would likely know where ealstan was too but if sidroc wasnt dead and didnt have his wits scrambled he and uncle hengist would have gone to the algarvians because of the fight that constable coming up the street of tinkers might have ealstans name and description he might take out his stick and threaten ealstan with death if he didnt come along quietly he did nothing of the sort he walked past ealstan without even noticing him for all he knew ealstans ancestors might have lived in oyngestun for generations uncounted the forthwegians whose ancestors had lived in the village for generations uncounted knew better of course but a stranger here wasnt such a prodigy as he would have been before war stirred the countryside like a woman stirring soup in a pot above a kitchen hearthfire ealstan walked the street of tinkers from one end to the other as he had every day since coming to oyngestun vanai lived in one of the houses along the street ealstan knew that from the letters theyd sent back and forth but he didnt know which one they all looked much alike presenting only wallssome whitewashed some paintedand doorways and tiny windows to the street most forthwegian houses were like that built around a central courtyard and not showing the outside world whatever ostentation lay within he kicked at the cobblestones in frustration he hadnt dared ask after vanai that might have involved her in his troubleand it might have got back to the constables or the redheads even had he known which house was hers she shared it with her grandfather ealstan had no doubt brivibas was as appalled at the notion of his daughters falling in love with a forthwegian as most forthwegians would have been at the idea of one of their kinds loving a kaunian powers above ealstan muttered to himself doesnt she ever come outside doesnt she even look outside as best he could tell vanai didnt he couldnt spend every waking moment pacing up and down the street of tinkers however much he wanted to that would get him noticed the last thing he wanted i ought to go away he murmured i ought to go far away go someplace where nobodys ever heard of me and wait for things to blow over hed said that before logically intellectually it made good sense no matter how much sense it made he couldnt do it vanai was here somewhere of course she drew him now as a lodestone drew bits of iron shaking his head he went back to the tavern where he was renting a nasty little chamber above the taproom the drunken racket below made his nights hideous but he couldnt very well complain the taverner made more from the noisy drunks than he did from ealstan a few doors up the street from the tavern was an apothecarys shop run by a plump kaunian named tamulis ealstan had been in there a couple of times in search of a nostrum to knock down the headaches he got from not sleeping enough he hadnt had much luck he was just coming up to the apothecarys door when it opened and someone came out of the shop he had to step smartly to keep from running into her im sorry he said in forthwegian then he stopped in his tracks his mouth falling open vanai she hadnt recognized him either not for a moment her jaw dropped too her bluegray eyes opened enormously wide ealstan she exclaimed and flung herself into his arms they separated almost at once as if each found the other burning hot to be seen embracing was to court danger from algarvians forthwegians and likely kaunians as well but the memory of vanai pressed against him warmed ealstan betterdeeperthan his long heavy tunic and the wool cloak he wore over it what are you doing here vanai demanded she spoke forthwegian as readily as kaunian ealstan could use kaunian but only more slowly she held a green glass bottle in her hand ealstan had an identical bottle of willowbark decoction up in his room it might have helped fight fever from the grippe he couldnt tell that it did any good against a headache in a few terse sentences he explained what he was doing in oyngestun finishing after sidroc wouldnt wake up i knew i had to get out of gromheort there was only one place i wanted to come and here i am vanai flushed with her fair skin far paler than ealstans the progress of the blush was easyand fascinatingto watch she knew why he wanted to come to oyngestun but what will you do now she asked you cant have a lot of money more than you think he answered but ive been doing odd jobs too anything i can to get my hands on some extra cash so i dont go through what ive got so fast as a bookkeepers son he understood he needed income to balance his expenses all right good vanai nodded she had a briskly practical streak then she repeated the question shed asked before what will you do now ealstan knew what he wanted to do holding vanai would have put the thought in his mind had it not been there already but that wasnt what she meant and hed had time to think pacing along the street of tinkers he said if you want we could go to eoforwic together from all ive heard there are more mixed couples there than in the rest of forthweg put together vanai flushed again maybe there were back before the warin fact i know there were back before the war she said but now under the algarvians do you want to put yourself through that why else would i have come to oyngestun ealstan asked vanai murmured something too low to hear and looked down at her shoes ealstan said you arent talking about your grandfather the way you always did before no im not talking about my grandfather vanai agreed wearily i think i may have said everything there is to say about him and done everything there was to do for him and hes certainly said everything there was to say about me her jaw set ealstan thought she was a year or so older than he suddenly she looked a good deal older than that and harder than hed dreamt she could he started to ask what her grandfather had said about her a second glance at her face convinced him that wouldnt be a good idea instead he said will you come with me her laugh had a raw edge to it this is only the fourth time weve ever set eyes on each other we havent spent more than a few hours together and weve sent a few letters back and forth and because of that you want me to leave behind everything and everybody ive ever known and go off with you to a place neither one of us has ever seen dull embarrassment filled ealstan hed let his hopes run away with him life as you lived it wasnt really much like what it was once the writers of romances got through with it kicking at the cobbles once more he began well i of course ill come with you vanai broke in by the powers abovethe powers above who are deaf and blind to everything we kaunians have sufferedhow could whatever happens to me there be worse than whats happened to me here he knew he didnt know everything that had happened to her here in oyngestun once more he realized asking wouldnt be smart in any case joy and astonishment left him little room to worry about such things i dont want anything bad to happen to you he said not ever to his astonishment her face worked she bit her lip plainly fighting back tears nobody but you has ever said anything like that to me she whispered no ealstan shook his head in bewilderment a lot of people have wasted a lot of chances then he saw hed flustered her again since he didnt want that he asked will your grandfather be all right if you leave him alone i hope so in spite of everything i hope so vanai answered but the redheads are as likely to scoop me up on the way to eoforwic as they are to grab him here i cant do anything about that i managed to keep him from going out and having to work himself to death on the road but those days are gone now how did you stop the algarvians from sending him out to do road work ealstan asked i managed vanai repeated and said no more her face went hard and closed again none of the pictures that flooded into ealstans mind was any he wanted to see he asked no more questions which seemed to relieve vanai now she tried to break the tension how can we go to eoforwic i dont think theyll let us ride together in a caravan car and i wouldnt feel safe in one anyhow too easy for the algarvians to stop the caravan and haul away everybody with yellow hair ealstan nodded i think caravans are dangerous too that leaves walking unless we find someone to give us a wagon ride for part of the way he grimaced with the two of us i dont know how likely that is not very vanai said succinctly and ealstan nodded again she went on let me take this to my grandfather and get a heavier cloak and some stouter shoes she sighed ill leave him a note to tell him some of what im doing so he wont think the algarvians got me hell have some learning to do but i think he can hes not stupid even if he is a fool wait for me here ill be back soon she hurried away instead of waiting he went up to his room and gathered his own meager belongings then returned to the apothecarys shop good as her word vanai came up a few minutes later she was wearing the heavier cloak and had a cloth bag slung over her shoulder lets go ealstan said side by side they started out of oyngestun heading east as soon as a grove of paleleaved olive trees hid the village behind them they began holding hands they leaped apart when a forthwegian on a mule came past them but then resumed not long after that they were kissing not too much longer after that they went off the road into another thicker grove it wasnt perfect privacy but it was good enough when they started walking again they both wore foolish smiles ealstan knew he was in trouble but had a hard time worrying about it he was after all only seventeen thirteen priekule was a gray unhappy town after more than a year and a half of algarvian occupation krasta still frequently left her mansion to visit the shops and cafes in the heart of the city but what she found there satisfied her less and less often the food in the cafes seemed to get nastier every week sometimes a mere sniff after she went inside one was enough to send her stalking out again elegantly straight nose high in the air jewelers hardly ever showed anything new and the clothes shed occasionally worn kilts back in the days when valmiera and algarve were at peace but only trousersproper traditional kaunian garmentsever since these days though more and more clothiers were showing kilts for both men and women she knew people who wore them she couldnt make herself do it after walking out of one such display she angrily strode along the boulevard of horsemen tall lean arrogant a newssheet vendor called fierce algarvian counterattack in unkerlant read all about it krasta stomped past him she didnt care two figs about unkerlant out there in the distant west it might have been on the far side of the moon as far as she was concerned the same held true for virtually the entire world outside of priekule she did know mild surprise that the algarvians hadnt conquered it yet as they had every other kingdom theyd assailed but the details of the fighting mattered not at all to her a few days farther on she paused staring at three words whitewashed onto the window of a confectioners shop night and fog the shop was closed it looked to have been closed for some little while she wondered when or if it would open again another vendor peddling a different news sheet waved it in her face krasta impatiently pushed past him and strode on down the sidewalk she decided she wished after all that the algarvians had taken cottbus then the war would have been over or as near as made no difference after that maybe the world could have started coming back to normal a couple of algarvian soldiers cloaked against the chill of priekules winter strode up the street toward her they both leered shamelessly as far as the occupiers were concerned any woman was fair game krasta stared straight through them as if they didnt exist they doubtless didnt know she was a noblewoman and wouldnt have cared had they knownwhat were the ranks of the conquered to the conquerors one of them proved as much still undressing krasta with his eyes he spoke in bad valmieran sleeping with me sweetheart he reached under his cloak and shook his belt pouch coins jingled and clinked krastas temper kindled as it had a way of doing powers below eat you you son of a whore she said slowly and distinctlyshe wanted to make sure he understood may it rot may it fall off may it never stand again she started by the soldiers the one who hadnt spoken grabbed her by the armmaybe he understood some valmieran too he did he said not talking like that bitch his trilling accent grated on her ears take your hands off me she told him ice in her voice i dont thinking so he said with a nasty smile you insulting us you paying for that he was one of the conquerors all right used to doing whatever he wanted with and to valmieran women later krasta realized she should have been afraid at the time only fury filled her take your hands off me she repeated she had a trump to play and played it without hesitation i am the woman of colonel lurcanio the count of albenga and not for the likes of you that did the trick shed been sure it would the algarvian soldier let go of her arm as if magecraft had suddenly turned it redhot he and his comrade both hurried away babbling ungrammatical apologies nose in the air again krasta went on down the avenue of horsemen triumph filled her narrow soulhadnt she just given those boors a lesson in whom they might annoy had she been more introspective she might have realized that defending herself by proclaiming she was a prominent occupiers mistress only showed how low valmiera had fallen such insight though was beyond her and probably would be for all her days to come she kept on walking to the end of the boulevard full of expensive shops farther than shed intended but she needed to burn off the rage with which the arrogant algarvians had filled her arrogant herself she recognized no one elses right to be that wayexcept lurcanios and he intimidated her far more than she was willing to admit at the end of the boulevard of horsemen was one of priekules many parks the grass dead and yellow now with muddy ground showing through here and there trees sent bare branches reaching toward the cloudy sky as if they were so many skeletons supplicating the powers above pigeons and sparrows begged for crumbs from the few people who sat on benches by the brick walkways probably because they had nowhere better to go in the center of the park towered the kaunian column of victory the marble column had stood there for more than a thousand years since the days of the kaunian empire how many years more than a thousand it had stood there krasta couldnt have said she hadnt done well in historyor in many other subjectsat the series of finishing schools and academies shed attended till everyone gave up on her education she did know the victory it celebrated was of civilized imperials over the algarvian barbarians who even in those ancient days had swarmed out of their forests to attack the empire algarvian eggs had damaged the column during the six years war but it had been restored since now a good many kilted algarvians stood at the base of the column of victory they gestured with the theatrical enthusiasm of their kind life to algarvians was melodrama a couple of valmierans looked to be arguing with them a tanclad soldier knocked down one of krastas countrymen because she gave herself to colonel lurcanio no redhead of lower rank could cause her much trouble conscious of that nearimmunity she strode down the sidewalk toward the column what on earth is going on here she demanded in a loud harsh voice the valmieran whod been knocked down got to his feet one trouser knee was torn though he seemed not to notice he had a pinched intelligent facenot the sort of man krasta would normally have looked at twice or even once he was intelligent enough to recognize her rank saying milady these men mean to topple the column what krasta stared not at the algarvians but at her fellow valmieran you must be out of your mind ask them the man pointed to the redheads some were ordinary soldiers like the one whod pushed him to the bricks some were officers including krasta saw a brigadier she wondered if she was as immune from trouble as shed thought and a couple had the indefinable air of mages about them the air of seeing and knowing things ordinary people didnt see and couldnt know they set krastas teeth on edge she turned to the algarvians you cant be thinking of doing what he says who are you to say we cant that was the brigadier a bigbellied fellow in his midfiftiestwice her age more or lesswith graying red mustachios and chin beard all waxed to spikelike points he spoke valmieran wellalmost as well as lurcanio did she drew herself up to her full height which came close to matching his i am the marchioness krasta and this is my city she sounded as if she were king gainibus queenalthough as shed seen herself priekule wasnt really even gainibus city anymore no sooner had that thought crossed her mind than the algarvian proceeded to rub it in turning back to the column of victory he said these cursed carvings tell lies they make my ancestors my heroic ancestorshe drew himself up too though with his bulging belly it wasnt so impressiveout to be cowards and robbers which every honest man knows to be a base and vile lie now we have the chance to correct this and correct it we shall but its a monument krasta exclaimed a monument of lies a monument of curses a monument of humiliation the fat brigadier said it does not deserve to stand now we are the victors and it shall not stand two days from now my lads herehe pointed to the mageswill set eggs by the base burst them and topple it like an old pine you cant do that krasta said the algarvian brigadier laughed in her face she started to slap him but then remembered the unfortunate things that had happened after she was rash enough to slap lurcanio this redhead outranked her lover she spun on her heel and hurried away do what you can milady the cleverlooking valmieran man called after her then he cried out in painthe algarvian soldiers had set on him again krasta found her carriage waiting on a side street seeing her approach the driver corked a small flask and stuck it in his pocket krasta ignored that take me back to the mansion she snapped this instant do you hear me aye milady the driver answered and prudently said no more the mansion lay on the outskirts of priekule it had been a country estate when it was built almost four centuries before these days algarvian administrators of valmieras conquered capital used and dwelt in the west wing leaving the rest for krasta her brother would have shared it with her but skarnu had never come home from the war she occasionally missed him now though he didnt enter her mind she stormed through offices that had been drawing rooms and salons taking no notice of the algarvian clerks who filled them only when she neared the smaller chamber where lurcanio worked did she slow she had to snarl her way past captain mosco before she could see him snarl she did and see lurcanio she did too he looked up from his paperworksometimes he reminded krasta more of a clerk than of a coloneland smiled that made his wrinkles shift without removing them he wasnt too much younger than the algarvian brigadier in the park hello my dear he said in his excellent valmieran what is it it must be something by your face bluntly krasta answered i want you to keep them from wrecking the column of victory i wondered when you would learn of that lurcanio shrugged an extravagant algarvian shrug i can do nothing about it andhis voice hardenedi would not if i could that column affronts algarves honor what about valmieras honor krasta demanded well what about it lurcanio said if valmiera had honor you would have held the algarvian army in check that we have this conversation here in the heart of a conquered kingdom that you welcome me to your bed rather than my wife welcoming a valmieran conqueror to hers proves whose honor has more weight now do please let me work i have too much to do and not enough time in which to do it close the door when you go out furious krasta slammed the door so hard the whole mansion shook unable to do anything more than that to take out her wrath on lurcanio she screamed at her servants instead that did no good two days later the kaunian column of victory came crashing down she heard the roar of the bursting eggs and the falling stone and cursed with a fluency a teamster might have envied when lurcanio sought her bed that night she welcomed him with a barred bedchamber door she kept the door barred for another week but then she relented partly because she craved pleasure and partly because she feared that if she kept on rejecting lurcanio he would simply find someone else she didnt care to be without an algarvian protector not with priekule as it was these days what that had to say about honor never once crossed her mind garivald was well on the way to being drunk when someone pounded on the door to his house whos that he growled irritably like most of the peasants in zossen hed managed to hide plenty of spirits from the algarvians who occupied the village when winter came what else was there to do but drink the pounding came again louder than before opening up or we breaking down an algarvian shouted open it annore garivald said he was sitting on a bench closer to the door than his wife but he was also drunker than she he didnt feel like getting up and moving just then annore sent him a dark look but rose and unbarred the door after a few heartbeats garivald did get up after all and stand behind heryou never could tell what an algarvian might be after the redheads glaring at him looked miserably cold their capes werent up to the weather here one of them said you coming to die village square why garivald asked both algarvians were carrying sticks with a chill that had nothing to do with winter garivald realized they werent men who garrisoned zossen but real combat soldiers mean as wild boars he wished he hadnt given them any backtalk the one whod spoken aimed his stick at garivalds face why because i saying so aye garivald said hastily ducking his head in submission as he would have to an unkerlanter inspector he took out his fear by shouting at annore come on curse it dont just stand there grab our cloaks annore did as he asked without arguing they threw on the thick wool garments garivald hoped the algarvians wouldnt steal them syrivald watch the baby annore said syrivald nodded eyes wide leuba playing happily on the floor was the only one who didnt know anything was wrong when garivald and annore got to the square it had already started filling under the sticks of more algarvian combat soldiers several villagers were putting up an oddlooking wooden frame after a moment garivald realized what it was a gibbet another icy pang of fright ran through him a couple of unkerlanter men hed never seen before stood near the gibbet their hands tied behind them they were scrawny and illshaven and looked to have seen hard useblood covered the face of one of them while the other had an eye swollen shut more redheads kept watch on them waddo the firstman limped into the village square close behind him came the algarvians stationed in zossen they looked almost as alarmed at what was going on as the villagers did one of the newly come algarvians proved to speak pretty good unkerlanter pointing to the captives he growled are these miserable whoresons from this stinking hole of a village we caught them in the woods anybody know them anybody know their names for a moment nobody spoke then all the men and women in zossen started talking at once with a single voice they denied ever setting eyes on the men before they know what happened to a village that harbored men who kept fighting against the algarvians so did the redhead whod asked the questions with a sneer he demanded why should i believe you youd lie and say your mothers werent whores we ought to wreck this place just for the sport of it by his tone he wasnt more than a fingers breadth away from ordering his troopers to do just that everyones eyes swung toward waddo the firstman looked about ready to burst into tears but he did what he had to doin the most abject tones garivald had heard even from his lips he cried have mercy sir mercy the algarvian threw back his head and laughed he spoke one word in his own languageprobably translating for his men they laughed too and their laughter was like the baying of wolves mercy the redhead repeated what have any unkerlanters ever done to deserve mercy these are not men of our village waddo pointed at the captives as the algarvian had by the powers above they arent if you dont believe me ask your own men who have been here for months they will know hes selling those two poor buggers to the algarvians garivald whispered to his wife if he didnt hed be selling all of us annore whispered back reluctantly garivald nodded he wouldnt have wanted to stand in waddos felt boots not for all the money in the world and he wondered if waddos betrayal of the unkerlanter irregulars caught in the forest would go for naught the algarvian still seemed poised to order his men to start blazing but the soldiers stationed in zossen spoke up they spoke up naturally in algarvian which garivald didnt understand but his hopes rose when he saw how unhappy the leader of the combat troops looked algarvians always seemed to show just what was in their mindsone more reason they struck garivald as strange hardly human at last the badtempered redhead who spoke unkerlanter threw his hands in the air he shouted something in his own language at the garrison troops they all grinned garivald knew theyd helped save zossen not least because they wanted to go on living here but why didnt matter what theyd done did well still hang these lousy bandits the combat leader said he jerked a thumb toward waddo you aye you fat and uglyyou with the big mouth fetch me a coil of rope and be quick about it waddo gulped he had no choice not if he wanted zossen to stay standing aye he whispered and limped away as fast as he could go if hed said he had no rope the algarvian would have blazed him on the spothim and who could say how many others he came back in a hurry clutching a coil the hangings were worse than garivald had imagined they could be the algarvians simply fastened nooses around their captives necks and tossed the ropes up over the top beam of the gibbet then they hauled the captives up off the ground to kick their lives away this is what comes to anyone who tries to fight against algarve the combat leader shouted while the unkerlanters were still thrashing these swine deserved it youd better not deserve it now get out of here several peoplenot all women by any meanshad fainted in the snow garivald and annore didnt wait to see them revived they fled back to their own hut as fast as they could what was it syrivald asked what did they do fear and curiosity warred on his face nothing garivald mumbled they didnt do anything his son would find out it was a lie as soon as he went outside the algarvians had been wrapping the ropes around and around the top beam of the gibbet to keep the corpses hanging on display but garivald couldnt bring himself to talk about what had happened not yet syrivald turned to his mother what did they do you can tell me they killed two men annore answered bleakly now dont ask me any more questions do you hear her voice warned what would happen if syrivald did he nodded he understood that tone annore found the jar of spirits and took a long pull at it leave some for me garivald warned he wanted to drink himself into oblivion too after another swig annore passed him the jar they kept passing it back and forth till they fell asleep side by side when garivald woke he almost wished the algarvians had hanged him his head pounded like a hammer on the smiths anvil his mouth tasted the way it would have if the livestock had fouled it when he took a sip from the jar his stomach loudly told him what a bad idea that was and as soon as he was conscious visions of the dead irregulars came flooding back he couldnt find a better reason for drinking himself blind again he wanted to stay blind drunk till spring came and maybe after that too annore looked no happier than he felt when she opened her eyes she reached for the jar he handed it to her she drank as desperately as he had with a grimace she wiped her mouth on the sleeve of her tunic it really happened she said aye it did garivald didnt care for the sound of his own voice he didnt care for the answer he had to give her either i knew we didnt want them here but i didnt think theyd dothat his wife said neither did i garivald answered now we dont have to listen to the tales people older than we are to tell of the twinkings war now we know too another song began to form in his mind a song of how the two unkerlanter irregulars had met their deaths without a word even more than most of the songs he shaped he would have to be careful where he sang that one but those two men had had friends in the woods friends the algarvians hadnt caught they would want to hear such songsthe dead men were their comrades and thinking of rhymes and rhythms distracted him from his hangover later that day when he had to go out he found more details to add to the song having hanged their captives the algarvian troop of combat soldiers had pulled out of zossen theyd left the gibbet behind the bodies on it still swayed in the breeze no one had dared cut them down each corpse had a new placard tied round its neck the characters were those of the unkerlanter language garivald knew that much even if he couldnt read them they probably told about the dead men and said what fools they were to fight the algarvians he couldnt think what else mezentios soldiers would have had to say he hurried back to his hut words spinning in his head once inside he barred the door and started drinking again by her slack features annore had hardly stopped staying indoors through the winter shielded people from the worst the weather could do just as staying in the village had shielded them from knowing the worst war could do but the war had come home to them now the algarvians had brought it home curse them he muttered his wife didnt need to ask whom he meant aye curse them she said powers below eat them curse leuba said cheerfully she didnt know what the word meant only that her parents stressed it when they spoke tearsthe easy tears of drunkennesssprang out in garivalds eyes he seized his daughter and fiercely hugged her to him she squealed then wiggled to get free such shows of affection didnt come her way very often but garivald had looked death in the face and knew how afraid he was more than half of pekka wished she could have performed this experiment down in kajaani her hometown rather than coming to yliharma failure in the capital of kuusamo failure with all the seven princes hoping for success would be far more humiliating than all the failures shed known back home both the senior mages whod invitedfor all practical purposes orderedher to yliharma met her at the caravan depot they laughed when she spoke of her fears nonsense my dear siuntio said his smile lit up his wide highcheekboned face with his hair graying toward white he looked far more like a kindly grandfather than the leading theoretical sorcerer of his generation im sure everything will go splendidly pekka brushed back a few strands of straight black hair that the frigid breeze kept blowing into her eyes yliharma had a milder climate than kajaani but no one would ever mistake it for the nearly tropical beaches of northern jelgava she said this is the first time well have tried a divergent series too many things can go wrong that set ilmarinen laughing where siuntio looked like a kindly grandfather he put pekka in mind of a disreputable great uncle but his record was second only to siuntios and a fair number of peoplehimself emphatically includedwould have argued about that leering at pekka he asked which are you more afraid of having nothing happen or having too much he had a knack for unpleasantly pointed questions having nothing happen would mortify me pekka said after a little thought if too much happens its liable to kill me dont think small ilmarinen said cheerfully if too much happens youre liable to take out half of yliharmamaybe even all of it if you get lucky pekka didnt think she would call that luck but contradicting ilmarinen only encouraged him siuntio gave his longtime colleague a severe look that is most unlikely as you know full well we do have some notion of the parameters involved its not as if we were back in the days of the kaunian empire when mages were ignorant of the theoretical underpinnings of their craft were ignorant of these underpinnings ilmarinen said with unfortunate accuracy if we werent wed be using them we wouldnt be experimenting pekka thought he was right and hoped he was wrong siuntio simply declined to be drawn into the argument saying lets get mistress pekka settled at the principalityyou neednt fret my dear the seven princes are footing the billand make her as comfortable as we can so shell be well rested for tomorrows conjurations they insisted on carrying her bags though she was less than half the age of either one of them a hired carriage waited just outside the depot had the driver looked any more bored he would have been dead the horse didnt seem very excited about the business either with slow and reluctant steps it started for the hostel the finest one yliharma boasted sitting at a window pekka stared out at the town though dwarfing kajaani yliharma didnt compare to setuba or to trapani still yliharma had started as a hill fort before either of the other capitals was settled most of the people on the streets looked like pekka and her sorcerous companions some though were taller and fairer a few sported beaky noses or auburn hairmarks of lagoan blood some few of the folk in setubal were short and blackhaired rather than rangy and redheaded too at the principality pekka unpacked then indulged in the steam room and cold plunge attached to her chamber invigorated she sent down a supper order by the dumbwaiter and demolished the poached salmon in dill sauce when it arrived if she was staying at the seven princes expense she would eat well she wished she could activate the crystal in the room and talk with her husband but a talented mage could pick emanations out of the air and kuusamo was at war with algarve leino would understand why she didnt try to reach him he knew secrets needed keeping instead of calling him she studied most of the mathematics behind what she would attempt tomorrow was ilmarinens anything he did demanded careful study siuntio after whom pekka tried to model herself was clear and straightforward ilmarinens thoughts writhed like an adder with a broken backand like an adder could bite to deadly effect when least expected she checked and rechecked examined and reexamined a mage who attempted any conjuration unprepared was a fool a mage who attempted a conjuration aimed at drawing energy from the place where the two laws of similarity and contagion met would be a dead fool if she tried it unprepared pekka knew she might die anyhow that was what exploring the unknown entailed but she intended to know as much as she could because she studied so long and so hard she got less sleep than she wanted a breakfast of rolls and hot tea with plenty of honey helped make up for that as ready as shed ever be she went downstairs and found another carriage waiting for her the university isnt it the driver asked aye pekka said she didnt want to try this magic in the seven princes palace if it got away from her at the university it wouldnt slay all of kuusamos lords or as many as were in town she hoped it wouldnt anyhow again siuntio and ilmarinen greeted her when she arrived welcome to my lair ilmarinen said with a grin displaying irregular teeth now well see what well seeif we see anything we will siuntio sounded perfectly confident with your brilliant theorizing and mistress pekkas inspired experiments how can we do anything but wring the truth from nature pekka said as if you had nothing to do with this master siuntio youve done more work and more important work on the two laws and the relationship between them than anyone else you deserve the bulk of the credit ilmarinen looked as if he might be inclined to argue that but said only or the bulk of the blame aye that is so siuntio agreed imperturbably power any power is not evil in itself but surely may be used to evil ends that soft answer also seemed to irk ilmarinen he said thats why we do the experiment to see how we can keep from wringing the truth from nature i mean busy checking cages of rats pekka did her best to ignore the bickering it wasnt easy ilmarinen craved as much attention as her little son uto and had as few scruples as uto about going after it she chose a pair of cages showing that the rat in one was the grandson of the animal in the other if all went well these rats would become as famous as the ones with which shed experimented down in kajaani she shook her head theyd become as important as those other rats theyd be in no position to appreciate their fame pekka hoped she would be if things went wrong resolutely she shoved that thought out of her mind or at least down to its basement shed been working toward this moment her whole professional career if she could draw useful sorcerous energy from the fusion of the laws of similarity and contagion she would prove theoretical sorcery had some eminently practical uses and if she did get into difficulties siuntio and ilmarinen would get her out of them if anyone could what if no one can she forced that thought into the basement of her mind too turning to the senior mages she asked are we ready siuntio nodded ilmarinen leered she took that for an affirmative dipping her head to each of them in turn she said i begin then dont make a mistake she thought that whenever she went from her desk to the laboratory no matter what siuntio said about her experimental technique she knew she was theoretician first practical mage a distant second perhaps that made her more careful than a more practical mage would have been she hoped so as she chanted the carefully crafted spell as she made pass after intricate pass confidence began to rise in her she saw siuntio smiling approval silently cheering her on maybe she was borrowing the confidence from him she didnt care where it came from she was glad to have it and then everything went wrong at first as the chamber began to sway around her pekka thought shed made a mistake after all even while she wondered whether shed die in the next instant she reviewed all shed done for the life of herliterally for the life of hershe couldnt see what shed done wrong a heartbeat later she realized the disaster had come from without not from within at that same moment siuntio gasped the algarvians and ilmarinen howled murderers like a wolf in ultimate anguish when the algarvians murdered kaunians by the hundreds perhaps by the thousands to fuel their military sorcery against unkerlant pekka had felt it as had sorcerers throughout the world shed felt it too when the unkerlanters fought back by murdering their own but those slaughters however horrific had been far to the west the massacre she felt now was close close it was like the difference between feeling an earthquake far away and one right under her feet she was feeling an earthquake right under her feet even as the building groaned as cages flew through the air and shelves toppled her mind leaped the algarvians she cried as siuntio had before her she could hardly hear herself through the din the algarvians are turning their deathpowered magic against us the war against king mezentio hadnt come home to kuusamo till now oh a handful of algarvian dragons flying from southern valmiera had dropped a few eggs on the coast and ships clashed in the strait of valmiera that severed kuusamo and lagoas from the mainland of derlavai but the seven princes had thoughtas what kuusaman had notthey could prepare behind the strait and strike at algarve when they were ready algarve unfortunately had other ideas as earthquakes will this one seemed to last forever how long it really went on pekka couldnt have said at last it stopped rather to her surprise it hadnt shaken the building down around her ears the lamps had gone out though everything in the chamber lay on the floor some cages had broken open rats were scurrying for hiding places the tremor had knocked siuntio and ilmarinen off their feet pekka had no idea how or why she was still standing ilmarinen got up without help he and pekka pulled some shelves off siuntio so he could rise siuntio was bleeding from a cut above one eye but that wasnt why anguish filled his face our city he cried what the algarvians have done to our city we had better find out what theyve done to our city ilmarinen said grimly we had better get out of here too before the building falls down on us i dont think it will not if it hasnt already pekka said this isnt like a natural earthquakeive been through some there are no aftershocks but she hurried out with ilmarinen and siuntio when she was standing on the snowdappled dead grass in front of the thaumaturgical laboratory pekka gasped she could see a great deal of yliharma and much of what she could see had fallen down pillars of smoke rose here and there from rapidly spreading fires and when she looked toward the high ground at the heart of the city she let out an agonized wail not the palace too they have struck us a heavy blow siuntio said wiping blood from his face as if hed just realized it was there heavier than i ever dreamt they could that they have ilmarinen still sounded like a wolf a hungry wolf now its our turn aye pekka said fiercely king swemmel paced back and forth back and forth in marshal rathars office with his body hunched forward and his jewelencrusted robe swirling out behind him the king of unkerlant put his marshal in mind of a hawk soaring over a field waiting for a rabbit to show itself the difference was that unlike a hawk king swemmel wasnt inclined to wait he stabbed out a long thin finger at the map tacked to the wall weve got the redheads on the run now he gloated all we have to do is hit them hard everywhere and theyll shatter like a dropped plate swemmels moods swung wildly he could despairor grow furiousas readily as he exulted one of the things rathar had to do along with the small task of commanding unkerlants armies was to try to keep the king on something close to an even keel aye we have forced them back some your majesty he said but theyre still fighting hard and theyre still too close to cottbus now he pointed toward the map grayheaded pins showed unkerlanter positions greenheaded ones algarvian forces he hardly looked at the pins he knew where the armies were at the moment he looked at the pinholes west of the present positions the pinholes that showed how far the algarvians had come there was a hole in the middle of the dot labeled thalfang terrifyingly near the capital of unkerlant on a clear day you could see thalfang from the spires of swemmels castle the redheads had fought their way into the town but they hadnt fought their way through it aye they are still too close to cottbus the king agreed they were too close the instant they crossed our border that is why we have to hammer them hard all along the line to drive them from our kingdom rathar chose his words with great care hammering them all along the line may not bei do not think it isthe best way to beat them back say on suspicion gleamed in swemmels dark eyes had he not had those eyes and dark hair he would have looked more like an algarvian than an unkerlanter but in his ability to smell plots whether they were there or not he was very much a man of his kingdom and like every king of unkerlant since its earliest days he didnt fancy contradiction knowing that marshal rathar kept on speaking carefully look how the algarvians attacked us your majesty they didnt just swarm across the border from south to north no swemmel growled then why does the fighting run all the way from the icy narrow sea up to the desert the treacherous zuwayzin infest rathar vividly remembered the sorts of things king swemmel did to those who displeased him but more than any other courtier who served swemmel he also remembered what unkerlant needed he spoke more frankly to the king than did anyone else in the palace one day that would probably cost him his head meanwhile dont look only at what the algarvians did your majesty look at how they did it vile treacherous dogs swemmel muttered traitors everywhere they will pay how diey will pay how everyone will pay pretending not to hear rathar went on they used behemoths and dragons massed together to tear holes in our lines then met behind the front and cleaned out the pockets they made if theyd attacked all along the line they wouldnt have been able to find or make so many weak places and you want us to imitate them by king swemmels tone he wanted to do anything but if we aim to beat them back wed better rathar said whatever else they are man for man theyre the best warriors in derlavai whatever else they are the algarvians had also turned out to be the most accomplished murderers in derlavai they wouldnt have come so far so fast without their murders either that sickened rathar swemmel hadnt been shy about imitating them therenot a bit that sickened his marshal too are they swemmel said we doubt it if they were how could our armies have beaten them back he sniffed contemptuously because we have more men than they do because we put snowshoes on our behemoths where they didnt think of that because we had the sense to give our soldiers white smocks because we understand winter better than they do rathar ticked off the points on his fingers one by one he went on but you must recall your majesty theyre learning too unless we can hurt them badly while theyre still off balance our job gets harder he wished king swemmel would trust him to command unkerlants armies and would stay out of his way while he was at it he wished for the moon he had about as much chance of getting one as the other swemmel stayed strong not least because he allowed no subjects too much strength rathar was without a doubt the second most powerful man in unkerlant to those looking up that made him great and mighty but if the king crooked a finger the kingdom would have a new marshal the next instant rathar understood that all too well oh we want to hurt them too swemmels voice was a low hungry croon we want to see their armies fall apart and fall to ruin we want to see algarvian soldiers frozen in the snow we want to see our borders restored before spring comes unless they fall to pieces i dont think we can do so much rathar warned because swemmel could get anything he wanted in the palace just by crooking his finger he too often thought he could do the same in the wider world his inspectors and impressers made him allpowerful in those parts of the kingdom he still ruled king mezentios men though put up a stiffer fight than did unkerlanter peasants swemmel needed to grasp that he looked petulant why do we have armies if we cannot get the best use from them he demanded your majesty you are getting the best use from them rathar answered if you expect more than men and beasts can give you are doomed to disappointment we are always doomed to disappointment swemmel wasnt deaf to the bittersweet songs selfpity sang even our own twin betrayed us but we had revenge on kyotaye we did king guntram swemmel and kyots father had died just after the end of the six years war neither twin would admit he was the younger and the other thus the rightful heir the six years war had cost unkerlant a dreadful price but the twinkings war that followed made its toll seem light by comparison in the end swemmel had boiled kyot alive coming back to the hereandnow the king said very well marshal if you think we must fight like the algarvians fight like the algarvians we shall you have our leave to make it so but our arms had best meet with success or you will be judged for your failures robes flapping behind him he swept out of rathars office momentarily alone the marshal allowed himself the luxury of a long loud sigh of relief hed just finished it when his adjutant came into the office major merovecs strongboned face bore an anxious expression as any officers might have after a visit from the king we go on major rathar said understanding him completely powers above be praised merovec said and said no more suddenly he looked anxious in a different way as if realizing even that little might have been too much only rathar had heard him but the comment gave the marshal a hold on him he hadnt had before such was life in the unkerlanter royal palace his majesty wants us to keep pressing the algarvians hard rathar said he is not the only one who wants that of course the discussion was about the means not the end and major merovec asked he knew as well as rathar that sometimes swemmel would give orders and would insist they be obeyed unkerlant had had its share of disasters over the years because of that and we are to continue as we have been doing marshal rathar replied merovec didnt let out a noisy sigh of relief but the urge to do so was written all over his face any more word out of kuusamo rathar asked glad to talk about anything even bad news that had nothing to do with swemmel two princes dead they say and half the capital wrecked merovec told him i wonder how many kaunians the redheads had to kill to bring that off powers above be praised they didnt try to do it to cottbus no promise they wont rathar said and his adjutant looking sour nodded the marshal of unkerlant went on of course when theyre fighting us they have to worry about our soldiers there arent any kuusaman soldiers in the fight yet not to speak of aye though i wish there were merovec sounded sour too after this itll take longer for the kuusamans to get into the fight too youre likely right rathar said but theyre liable to fight harder once they are finally in now they know what sort of foe theyre up against i hope mezentios men dont decide to do the same to setubal that would hurt us aye lagoas truly is in the fight even if its only in the land of the ice people merovec said and on the sea rathar added his adjutant grunted dismissively we dont pay the sea enough attention rathar insisted we didnt start worrying about losing glogau up in the north till almost too late but where would we be without it in a cursed mess thats where thats so merovecs admission was grudging but real still and all though you win wars or you lose them on land i think so rathar said if you asked mezentios marshals odds are theyd think so too but if you asked in sibiu or lagoas or kuusamo youd hear some different answers foreigners merovec muttered under his breath far and away the largest kingdom on derlavai unkerlant was and always had been to some degree a world unto itself like rathars adjutant a lot of unkerlanters had little use for anyone from outside that world but the algarvians had stormed into it and were doing their best to tear it to piecesand their best had proved terribly terrifyingly good his majesty hopes we can win the war this winter he said wanting to learn what merovec thought of that as a marshals chief aide merovec was at least as much a political animal a courtier as he was a soldier whatever he thought he wasnt about to show much of it all he said was i hope his majesty is right rathar sighed he hoped king swemmel was right too but he wouldnt have bet a broken tunic toggle on it sighing again he said well well just have to do our best to make sure he is right aye so we will merovec could agree with that and he did enthusiastically first things first rathar started to pace then stopped in his tracks what was he doing but imitating the king he needed a moment to recover his caravan of thought we have to push the redheads as far back from cottbus as we can that will make it harder for them to do to us what they did to kuusamo and we have to keep the corridor to glogau open and we have to take back as much of the duchy of grelz as we can we have to do that if we intend to keep eating next year anyhow all true major merovec said then thinking like a political animal he added the more of grelz we take back the bigger the black eye we give mezentio and his puppet king too thats so rathar agreed he could have hurt us much more if hed named one of the local nobles king of grelz instead of his own cousin the peasants wont want to do anything for an algarvian with a fancy crown on his noggin after the twinkings war after swemmels years of harsh rule hed feared the peasants and townsfolk of unkerlant would welcome the algarvians as liberators some had more would have he suspected had the redheads not made it so very plain they came as conquerors if the foe makes mistakes we had better take advantage of them he said he hasnt made enough curse him and weve made too many of our own no one else at swemmels court would have said such a thing merovec looked horrified that rathar had be careful lord marshal he said if word of that got back to the king either he would blame you for what goes wrong or he would think you were blaming him either of those from rathars point of view would be equally disastrous nodding brusquely to acknowledge the point the marshal of unkerlant studied the map an attack into grelz was already underway he examined the disposition of his forces he could also attack to the northeast of cottbus which would keep the algarvians from shifting troops to the south nodding again he began giving orders rank or at least some rank had finally caught up with leudast he was at last officially a sergeant he was also commanding a company a handful of veterans like himself fleshed out with recruits who no longer deserved to be called freshfaceda few days in the line and they were as grimy and disreputablelooking as anybody else he wondered how many other sergeants in king swemmels army were commanding companies a lot of them or else he was a black zuwayzi in disguise he also wondered when the extra pay that went with his new rank would start catching up with him he didnt intend to hold his breath thinking about money made him laugh anyhow what could he do with it up here at the front but gamble he couldnt buy muchthere wasnt much to buy and he wouldnt hold his breath waiting for leave either every man who could carry a stick was in the line these days or so it seemed but for the first time in the fight against algarve the unkerlanter armies were moving forward leudast was almost inclined to cheer every time snow or freezing rain came pelting down even if he had to endure them out in the open he knew marshal winter had done as much to stop the redheads as marshal rathar had somewhere not far away eggs began bursting the algarvians holed up in the village northeast of the trench in which he huddled werent about to give up without a fight they had plenty of eggtossers and no doubt plenty of stubborn soldiers too a wounded man started screaming not far away leudast clicked his tongue between his teeth the algarvians might be retreating but they werent making life easy for their foes captain hawart came up to leudast leaving tracks behind him in the snow hawart had started out commanding the company leudast now led these days the captain was in charge of a brigades worth of men he hadnt been promoted at all and was doing a senior officers work on a junior officers pay hed also grown forgetful like a senior officer for he called a good day to you magnulf magnulfs dead leudast said had he been looking out of the hole hed shared with his sergeant when the egg burst in front of it he would have been the one who didnt come out luck he thought nothing but luck im leudast well so you are hawart took off his fur hat and whacked himself in the side of the head and im marvefa the fairy who makes new leaves grow every spring wouldnt surprise me a bit siryou look just like her leudast said and captain hawart rocked back on his heels and laughed he was a pretty good officer and didnt slip very often leudast went on what now hawart pointed ahead toward the village from which the algarvians were still tossing occasional eggs tomorrow morning were going to throw them out of that midlum place he answered were supposed to have behemoths coming up to give us a hand but well take a whack at it whether they do or not aye sir leudast said resignedly and then because he couldnt help himself if they dont show up were going to leave a lot of dead men in the snow in front of midlum i know captain hawart sounded resigned too but those are the orders i got so thats what im going to do even if we get slaughtered we help the kingdom huzzah leudast said in tones that sounded like anything but celebration more often than not hawart would have laughed again and agreed with him today the captain said like it or not its true were doing our best to shove our way back into grelz this attackand were just part of itis supposed to keep the algarvians from moving reinforcements down there all right sir leudast said once im dead im sure ill be glad to know it was for some good reason probably because i hit you over the head with a rock but captain hawart was laughing again he slapped leudast on the back have your men ready we move before sunup with the behemoths or without em aye captain leudast didnt expect the behemoths the whole course of the war had taught him not to expect them there were rarely enough to go around more stretches of line needed the great beasts than could have them he got his company ready to attack midlum without them for once he was glad he had only a handful of veterans the new troops would go forward without knowing how unlikely they were ever to get into the village and then in the middle up the chilly night the behemoths did come up to the front chainmail clinking below the heavy blankets that helped their shaggy fur keep them warm starlight glittered off their long sharp ironshod horns thanks to the great snowshoes attached to their feet they had little trouble making their way over the drifts real hopea strange feelingbegan to rise in leudast were going to do this he told his men were going to kick the redheads out of that village were going to chase them across the fields and were going to slaughter them this is what they bought for coming into unkerlant and trying to take away our homes now theyll pay full priceevery last copper his own home village not too far from what had been unkerlants border with forthweg lay far to the east of where he squatted now he wondered how his kinsfolk fared under algarvian occupation the only thing he could do to help them was hurt mezentios men as much as he could in the darkness his mens heads bobbed up and down they listened earnestly most of them lacked the experience to know what they were getting into after the coming days fighting though theyd be veterans toothe ones who wouldnt be corpses strewn across the frozen ground almost on time unkerlanter eggtossers started pounding midlum get ready boys leudast said it wont be long now he peered across the fields toward the bursts of sorcerous energy ahead now the algarvians would know something was coming their way with luck the bursting eggs would keep them from doing too much about it with luck they were alert there in midlum leudast had never known the algarvians when they werent alert he wished this might be one of those times but it wasnt eggs began flying back toward his own position fortunately the algarvians were tossing a little long so they didnt hurt too badly the men gathered to attack them whistles blew all along the unkerlanter line officers ordering their men forward leudast was doing an officers job but he didnt have the formal rank so he didnt have a whistle either a shout had to do lets go the behemoths went forward too they paused outside of midlum some the ones that mounted eggtossers on their backs joined in pounding the village and the algarvians inside others sent beams from their heavy sticks against the houses to the east fires began to burn lighting up the eastern sky as if dawn were coming too soon leudast flopped down behind what he thought was a snowcovered boulder but boulders didnt have hair it was a dead behemotha longdead behemoth which meant it had probably belonged to the algarvians blaze and move he shouted blaze and move his men knew what they were supposed to do some were to blaze to make the algarvians keep their heads down while others advanced into new cover then the two groups would reverse roles but knowing what to do and doing it right the first time you tried it were two different things leudast had expected no better than he got he wondered if the algarvians had any behemoths in midlum if they did the beasts needed to come out and fight the only thing with much hope of stopping one behemoth was another but no behemoths came forth from the village maybe theyd all frozen to death leudast hoped so when it was his turn he ran forward toward the burning village he pounded passed a young man lying in the snow clutching both hands to his belly those hands couldnt keep the unkerlanter soldiers lifeblood from pouring out steam rose from the pool it formed leudast shook his head and ran on hed fought to hold the algarvians out of a good many villages he knew how the job was done so did they worse luck and they proved as stubborn in defense as they ever had on the attack but they couldnt simply stay in midlum and fight it out to the last man there for the unkerlanters were not only assailing the strongly held village but also sending men around it to either side to cut it off from other territory the redheads held you taught us that trick you whoresons leudast thought how do you like having it pulled on you he didnt know what he would have done in the algarvian commanders predicament the redhead sent some of his men east toward their comrades and used the rest to make a stand unkerlanter behemoths lumbered after the algarvians struggling through the snow with the eastern sky now going gray with true dawn the retreating algarvians made easy targets inside midlum though the enemy kept on fighting hard a beam zipped past leudasts head he threw himself flat and blazed back a scream answered him he grunted in satisfaction but didnt rise too soon any algarvians whod come this far were likely veterans and full of the tricks veterans knew well leudast had a few tricks too surrender he shouted in his own language and then in what he thought was algarvian returning to unkerlanterhe had no choicehe went on you cant get away maybe some of mezentios men understood unkerlanter maybe they didnt need to understand itmaybe they could see what was so for themselves little by little the blazing died away algarvians started coming out of battered huts and holes in the grounds they carried no sticks their hands were high fear filled their faces powers above leudast whispered in something approaching awe hed never seen so many redheads surrender not all at once after staring he rushed forward with the rest of his men to plunder the algarvians as trasone stumbled south and east through the snow he thought about what might have been hey sergeant he called his breath making a bank of mist around his head did we really see the towers of stinking swemmels stinking palace dont know about you but i sure as blazes did sergeant panfilo answered his voice coming muffled through the wool scarf hed wrapped around the lower part of his face you were there in the market square at thalfang same as me if we could have made it across to the other side aye if trasone shrugged his broad shoulders he was almost as thickly built as an unkerlanter he was hard to faze too or else too stubborn to admit that any trouble could be so very bad ill tell you something sergeant a lot of good lads went into that cursed square a lot fewer came out again thats the truth panfilos big head went up and down up and down captain galafrone was maybe the best officer ive ever known and ive seen plenty id say as much to the kings face even if galafrone hadnt a drop of noble blood in him you ought to say it on account of its true trasone tramped past the stiff carcass of a unicorn that had frozen to death its coat was whiter than the snow in which it lay he jerked a thumb at it somebody ought to butcher that beast plenty of good meat on it if we ever get to a place where we can make a fire and cook it aye panfilo liked to eat but that wasnt what was on his mind i had this companypowers above i had this whole fornicating battalionfor a few days but will they make me an officer not bloody likely not when my old man made shoes for a living i dont know about that sergeant trasone said the way theyre using up nobles these days before long there wont be enough of em to fill all the slots that need filling stay alive and you may get your chance yet wont have one if im dead thats certain panfilo twisted his head this way and that trasone knew what he was doing looking for unkerlanter behemoths with snowshoes or unkerlanter footsoldiers wearing them in this cursed weather swemmels soldiers were more mobile than the algarvians they pursued trasone kept his eyes open all the time too he didnt see any foes now for which he thanked the powers above when he trudged past the frozen corpse of an algarvian soldier he started to laugh whats funny about him panfilo asked poor whoresons in the same pose as that unicorn we went by a little while ago trasone answered heh panfilo said and then heh heh trasone shrugged and kept on walking that was about as much credit as the comment deserved from up ahead came the sharp crack of bursting eggs a moment later trasone heard a dragon screaming high in the air got to be an unkerlanter beast he said wearily where are our own dragons curse the lazy buggers who fly em panfilo tried to look on the bright side they come over now and again but theyre stretched thin along so much front the unkerlanters have dragons to drop eggs on us trasone said resentfully the fronts no shorter for them he waved before panfilo could speak i know i knowsomewhere along the line were dropping eggs on them too but theyre doing it here curse them and one of those stinking eggs is liable to come down on my head they werent worrying about uswere small fry panfilo pointed ahead to a burning town unless were even more lost than i think we are thats aspang a ley line runs through it how are we going to get men and supplies forward if its going up in flames around us for an algarvian trasone was a stolid man still his shrug would have been extravagant for someone from any other kingdom he said who knows odds are we wont powers below have been eating at our supply system ever since the snow started coming down when the battered company got into aspang trasone discovered he would have made a good prophet several of the eggs the unkerlanter dragons dropped had landed squarely on the leyline caravan depot it was burning merrily so was a caravan that had stopped there and so were mountains of supplies that had just come off the caravan and hadnt yet been loaded onto wagons for the trip to the frontnot that wagons had an easy time moving through the snow either his stomach didnt care about troubles with wagons but it growled like a starving wolfan all too apt figureto see food burning the bursting eggs had knocked one car off the ley line and down to the ground on its side it was for the moment safe from the flames a crowd of algarvian soldiers had gathered around it trasone hurried toward the caravan car thats got to be something to eat he called over his shoulder to his comrades im going to get some and youd better do the same he waited for sergeant panfilo to curse and bully him back into the line instead without a word the sergeant followed him more than anything else trasone had seen that told of the troubles the algarvian army had known since winter came to unkerlant one of the soldiers already at the caravan car looked up with a laugh more starving rats eh well come on and get your share whats to get trasone asked by way of reply the other soldier tossed him a square block of orange stuff that had to weigh a couple of pounds automatically trasone caught it cheese said the fellow whod thrown it if youre going to be a rat you may as well be a fat rat eh aye trasone broke a corner off the block and stuffed the cheese into his mouth with it still full he went on toss me a couple more of those pal will you its not the greatest stuff in the world but itll keep a man going for a while help yourselfstuff your pack full the other algarvian said if we dont haul it away with us its not going anywhere trasone took him up on that so did sergeant panfilo they both ate as they loaded up too trasone guessed a lot of the soldiers at the caravan car had been garrisoning aspang they didnt have the abraded look of men whod been fighting and marching and fighting again for much too long eggs began bursting once more this time west of aspang trasone looked up but saw no dragons that meant the unkerlanters had brought their eggtossers almost far enough forward to start hitting the town trasone cursed under his breath hed hoped the rear guard would have done a better job of holding back king swemmels men than that to me shouted the officer whod taken over the battalion or what was left of it after sergeant panfilo brought it out of thalfang come onwe have to hold this place cant let the unkerlanters have it come what may trasone was more than willing to ignore the dapper little nobleman but panfilo after stuffing a last brick of cheese into his pack turned away from the caravan car come on he told trasone major spinellos not so bad as officers go not so bad trasone agreed grudgingly but id got used to being commanded by commonersfirst galafrone then you nobles just arent the same after that harder to take em seriously if you know what i mean oh aye panfilo said dont worry though im still commanding you now get moving get moving trasone did major spinello was still flitting every which way at once and talking like a man possessed come on my dears if the unkerlanters are going to pay us a call we must be ready to receive them in the style they deserve after all we wouldnt want to disappoint them now would we he sounded like a bad caricature of every noble officer trasone had ever known even the dour veteran couldnt help snickering up till very recently spinello hadnt been a combat soldier he kept going on and on about the forthwegian village whose garrison hed headed till the war here in the west yanked him out of it not all of his orders made the best sense in the world but trasone had already seen that he was recklessly brave as long as he listened to panfilo and others who actually knew what they were doing hed shape pretty well what needed doing here was obvious and major spinello saw it he posted his battalion in among the ruins at the western edge of aspang find yourselves some good holes he urged the soldiers make sure theyre as tight and as deep as a kaunian trollops twat he sighed ah the one i was laying before duty called me here he sighed again and kissed his fingertips trasone would sooner have been laying a pretty blonde than lying in wait for some ugly unkerlanters too nobodyd given spinello a choice and nobody was giving him one either he found cover behind a waisthigh wall that was all that remained of a house or shop and settled in looking around he spied a couple of other places to which he could withdraw in a hurry if he had to unkerlanter eggs fell closer and closer to the town then began bursting around him and his comrades he kept his head down and huddled close to the wall before long the storm of sorcerous energy moved deeper into aspang trasone knew what swemmels men were doing they were going after the algarvian eggtossers he also knew that meant the attack was on its way he looked out over the ruined wall and steadied his stick on it sure enough the unkerlanters were forming up just out of stick range row upon closeranked row of blocky men in white smocks over rockgray tunics it was in its way an aweinspiring sight to his surprise he could hear the command the unkerlanter officer shouted the enemy soldiers stormed forward some of them arm in arm urra they shouted a deafening roar urra swemmel urra almost at once eggs began bursting among them tearing holes in their neat ranksthey hadnt succeeded in knocking out the algarvian tossers after all still shouting more unkerlanters hurried up to fill the gaps along with his comrades trasone started blazing at them soldiers went down as if scythed the ones who didnt go down though kept on coming roaring like demons trasones mouth went dry if that human wave broke over his battalion he looked around at his lines of retreat again would he have time to use them he wished algarvian mages back of the front would slaughter some kaunians to get the sorcerous energy for a spell to stop the unkerlanters in their tracks no spell came but king swemmels men didnt break into aspang either some prices were higher than flesh and blood could bear just outside the edge of town the unkerlanters broke and fled back across the snowy fields leaving even more dead behind major spinello did not order a pursuit trasone nodded somber approval the major might be raw but he wasnt stupid fourteen fernao had seen the land of the ice people in summer when the sun shone in the sky nearly the whole day through and the weather sometimes got warmer than cool the lagoan mage had seen it in fall which put him in mind of a hard winter in setubal now he was seeing it in winter hed expected it would be appalling he was finding out he hadnt known what appalling meant outside the tent he shared with a secondrank mage named affonso the wind howled like a live thing a malevolent wild thing the tent fabric was waterproofed and windproofed but the gale sucked heat out of the tent in spite of the brazier by which the two sorcerers huddled i wont believe it affonso said nobody could want to live in this miserable country the whole year round its no accident the ice people are hairy all over men and women both fernao answered and they like the austral continent fine they think were the crazy ones for wanting to live anywhere else theyre mad every cursed one of them affonso picked up another chunk of dried camel dungthe most common fuel hereaboutsand put it on the brazier then he wiped his hands on his kilt under the kilt he wore thick wooden leggings that came up far enough to meet his thick woolen drawers coming down he might as well have had on trousers but no kingdom of algarvic stock took kindly to those kaunianstyle garments no doubt but they do live here and were having a miserable time managing that for ourselves fernao said the camel dung hissed and popped as it burned and shed only a sullen red light across the brazier from fernao his colleague might have been a polished bronze statue tall and skinny affonso had the long face typical of lagoans sibians and algarvians but a wide flat nose told of kuusamans somewhere down toward the roots of his family tree in the same way fernao himself had narrow eyes set on a slant only a minority of lagoans thought such things worth fussing about they were a mixed lot and knew it some few of his countrymen took pride in pure algarvic blood but fernao thought they were fooling themselves even with the brazier affonsos breath smoked inside the tent he must have seen it too for he said when i went out last night to make water the wind had died down it was so calm and quiet i could hear my breath freeze around me every time i let it out ive never heard that but ive heard of it fernao didnt know if the convulsive movement of his shoulders was shiver or shudder or something of both the ice people call it the whisper of stars they would have a name for it affonso said darkly he moved away from the brazier but only to wrap himself in blankets and furs how far away from mizpah are we a couple of days unless we have another blizzard fernao told him ive seen mizpah you know if you had too you wouldnt be so cursed eager to get there believe you me you wouldnt only a snore answered him affonso had a knack for falling asleep at once that wasnt a trick the guild of mages had ever investigated or fernao himself a firstrank mage would have known how to do it he swaddled himself too and eventually dropped off he woke in darkness the brazier had gone out he fed it more camel dung and got the fire going with flint and steel most places sorcery would have been easier on the austral continent sorcery imported from derlavai or lagoas or kuusamo failed more often than it worked the rules were different here and few not born to them ever learned them affonso also woke quickly and completely something else for which fernao envied him another days slog he said aye fernao agreed in a hollow voice he got up and wrapped a heavy hooded cloak over his tunic if we march hard enough ill almost be able to imagine im warm almost thats a powerful imagination you have affonso remarked comes with my rank fernao said and snorted to show he didnt intend to be taken seriously after the snort he had to inhale burning camel dung wasnt the only stink in the tent if i had a really powerful imagination i could imagine myself bathing of course then id have to imagine myself freezing to death the next instant they say the ice people never ever bathe affonso said they say it because its true fernao held his nose powers above they stink and were on our way to matching them he crawled toward the opening of the tent a complicated arrangement with double flaps designed to hold in as much heat as possible as for me im on my way to breakfast affonso nodded and followed him out the sun hadnt climbed above the northeastern horizon yet but wasnt too far below it there was enough light by which to see the cold struck savagely at fernao as he got to his feet every inhalation felt like breathing knives every exhalation brought forth a new fogbank he cocked his head to one side listening but couldnt hear the whisper of stars that horrified him all over again for it meant the weather could get colder still snow didnt cover every inch of the local landscape parts of it were bare rock and frozen ground that had perplexed fernao till he realized the air down here was so cold it held less moisture than it could farther north and the endless ravening wind helped sweep the landscape clear lagoan soldiers were emerging from their tents all of them as muffled against the chill as fernao and affonso like fernaos the fog from their breath hung around their heads they stumbled toward the smoking cook fires shivering and loudly cursing their fate off in the distance ice people on shaggy twohumped camels watched the lagoan army theyd been shadowing the force ever since it landed at the edge of the ice shelf that formed around the edge of the austral continent every winter the nomads of the frozen waste had laughed then to see king vitors men struggling over the ice they werent laughing anymore fernao hoped they werent passing the armys movements on to the yaninans if they were the lagoans couldnt do anything about it the ice people could have run rings around them man by man the lines at the cook fires moved forward a cook who looked not only cold but also bored slapped a glob of mush and a strip of fried camel meatmostly fatinto fernaos tin eat fast the fellow advised otherwise youll break teeth on it after it freezes up again he wasnt joking fernao had seen that the mage was also ravenous in this weather a man needed far more food than he would have in a better climate affonso ate with the same dedication only after their tins were empty did affonso remark i wish this cursed country didnt hold any cinnabar then we could let the yaninans have it then king tsavellas wouldnt want it fernao answered nobody would ever come to visit the ice people except once in a while to buy pelts from them dragons affonso turned the word into a curse fernao nodded quicksilver came from cinnabar without it dragons couldnt flame so hot or so far algarve yaninas ally yaninds master was nearer the truth these days had only small stocks of the vital mineral if lagoas could take the land of the ice people away from king tsavellas men king mezentios dragons would have to do without that would make algarves war harder taking the cinnabar away from algarve was making fernaos life harder the army trudged toward mizpah the town had been a lagoan outpost till the yaninans seized it after lagoas went to war with algarve fernao had been in it then he counted himself lucky to have escaped and something less than lucky to have returned to the austral continent grudgingly as if resenting the necessity the sun rose fernaos shadow far longer than he was tall stretched off to his left because the sun couldnt get far above the horizon its light remained red as blood it was about to set when a couple of ice people rode toward the lagoan column on camelback shouting at the tops of their lungs lieutenant general junqueiro who commanded the lagoan force hurried over to fernao he was a big bluff fellow with a bushy red mustache streaked with white what in blazes are they saying he asked the mage you speak their language not a word of it fernao answered which made junqueiros eyes open very wide if you listen closely though youll discover theyre speaking lagoan after a fashion junqueiro cocked his head to one side why so they are he sounded astonished then his expression changed is what theyre saying true are the yaninans really moving against us fernao eyed him in some exasperation i dont knowthis country isnt friendly to magecraft except the sort the shamans of the ice people use but dont you think youd better get ready to receive them on the chance those nomads arent lying its almost night again junqueiro said not even the yaninans would be mad enough to attack in the darkness i dont think but he began shouting orders and the army shook itself out from column into line of battle and sure enough the enemy did attack eggs started bursting not far from the lagoan forcesreleasing energy like that was sorcery so basic it worked all over the world the yaninans swarmed forward howling like mountain apes beams from their sticks pierced the darkness junqueiro held back response as long as he could then all the light eggtossers the lagoans had brought with them began flinging eggs back at the yaninans the lagoan footsoldiers waiting behind cover blazed away at the men who followed king tsavellas to fernaos delighted astonishment the yaninans broke in wild disorder they must have thought they would be able to steal the battle by night catching the lagoans by surprise when that didnt happen some fled some threw down their sticks and surrendered and only a stubborn rear guard kept junqueiros army from bagging them all even before twilight began to gray the northern horizon the next morning the lagoan commander declared the way to mizpah is open you wouldnt sound so happy if youd ever seen the place fernao said yawning junqueiro paid him no attention he hadnt really expected anything different talsu had got used to algarvians swaggering through the streets of skrunda he felt less embittered toward the redheads than did a lot of jelgavans not least because hed done more against them in the war than had most of his countrymen his regiment had invaded algarve even if it never had succeeded in breaking out of the foothills of the bratanu mountains and seizing tricarico and he hadnt thrown down his stick till jelgava was truly beaten beaten his kingdom remained but he didnt blame himself for it his father had other ideas looking up from the tunic he was sewing for an algarvian officer traku sighed and said if only wed fought harder i wouldnt have to be doing this kind of work by that talsu knew he meant if only youd fought harder his father felt guilty about not seeing battle because he did he had a low opinion of those who had seen it and hadnt prevailedlike talsu with a sigh of his own talsu answered no instead youd be sewing jewels onto some noblewomans cloak and youd be grumbling about that traku grunted and ran his fingers through his hair he was going gray but like his son and most of his countrymen was so blond it hardly showed well what if i would he said at least shed be one of our own noblewomen not a cursed redhead before talsu answered he looked out into the street no one there looked like coming into the tailors shop above which traku and talsu and his mother and sister lived satisfied he could speak frankly talsu said if it werent for all out idiot noblemen clogging up the officer corps maybe we wouldnt have a cursed redhead calling himself king of jelgava these days i had to follow their orders rememberi know what kind of soldiers they made traku opened the cash box took out a small silver coin with bang mainardos beaky portrait stamped on it and ground it under his heel thats what i think of having any algarvian let alone king mezentios worthless brother set up as the ruler of a decent kaunian kingdom oh aye i have no love for him either talsu said who does but if king donalitu hadnt run away to lagoas after the redheads broke in here we wouldnt have an algarvian calling himself king now you ask me father donalitu was as useless as his nobles thats what the algarvians want you to say his father answered a king doesnt have a use except to be king he stands for his kingdom or else hes no use at all and how can an algarvian king stand for a kaunian kingdom its against nature thats what it is talsu had no good comeback for that by everything he knew of magecraftwhich wasnt muchtraku was right but traku thought of the jelgavan nobility in terms of luxuries used up and money wasted that was how talsu had thought of the nobles before the war now he thought of dukes and counts in terms of lives wasted which were far more expensive ill see you later he said starting out of the shop mother asked me earlier this morning to get her some olive oil and some garlic and i havent done it yet go on then traku was willing to let the argument lie youd better if you expect to eat supper tonight laughingthough his father hadnt been jokingtalsu headed for the grocers a couple of blocks away the weather was mild winter in skrunda only rarely got chilly the beaches on jelgavas northeastern coast the ones that looked across the garelian ocean toward equatorial siaulia were subtropical themselves in happier times they were a popular holiday resort for folk fleeing nasty weather farther south the grocers lay in the direction of the market square as always talsu looked toward the square on the off chance he might spy something interesting he didnt but gave a small double take anyhow that was foolish the algarvians had wrecked the triumphal arch from the days of the kaunian empire months before but he still wasnt used to its being gone one reason talsu didnt mind going to the grocers was his pretty daughter gailisa she was behind the counter when he walked in and smiled to see him hello talsu she said what can i get you today a pint of the middlegrade olive oil and some fresh garlic he answered gailisa said theres plenty of garlic but were out of the middlegrade oil do you want the cheap stuff or the extravirgin before he could answer she held up a warning hand if you make jokes about that the way the miserable algarvians do ill clout you with the jar do you hear me did i say anything talsu asked as innocently as if such thoughts had never entered his mind the grocers daughter snorted she knew better talsu went on let me have the good oil if you please all rightsince you asked for it so pretty gailisa reached behind her pulled an earthenware jar off the shelf and set it on the counter do you want to choose your own garlic or shall i grab one for you go ahead talsu told her youd do a better job than i would i knew that gailisa said i wondered if you did she pulled a goodsized head off a string and handed it to him then said something in classical kaunian talsu hadnt spent enough time in school to learn much of the old language and modern jelgavan had drifted too far from it to let him understand the phrase he had to ask what was that the stinking rose gailisa translated i dont know why they called it that back in the days of the empireit doesnt look anything like a rosebut they did it doesnt stink either talsu said i dont know anybody who doesnt like garlic powers above even the redheads eat it they eat everything gailisa said with a fine curl of the lip theyre eating my father out of food and they only pay half what its worth if he complained they wouldnt pay anything at alltheyd just take theyre the occupiers so they can do as they please theyve always paid my fatherso far anyhow talsu said i dont know what hed do if one of them didnt he gets a lot of his business from them these days theyre thieves gailisas voice was flat theyre worse thieves than our own nobles and they give us back less i never thought id say that about anybody but its true aye talsu nodded they could have made a lot of people like them if theyd put down the nobles and walked small themselves but they havent bothered king mainardo as if an algarvian has any business being king here we lost the war that means they can do whatever they want like i said gailisa answered they beat us and now theyre beating us talsu paid her for the garlic and the oil and left the grocers shop in a hurry gailisa sounded almost like his father blaming him for losing the fight maybe she didnt mean it that way but that was how it sounded if id been in charge of things talsu thought and then laughed at himself if hed been in charge of things the jelgavan army would still have lost he didnt know how to run an army or a war but the nobles whod run the army were supposed to he stopped in a tavern and bought a glass of red wine flavored with orange and lime juice the wine was rough and raw and cheap but better than the thin sour beer army rations had served up with breakfast every morning somebodyd probably promised better then pocketed half of what he should have spent that was how things had gone during the war as talsu was leaving the tavern a couple of algarvian soldiers strode in if he hadnt stepped back in a hurry they would have walked right over him he wanted to smash them for their arrogance but didnt dare two against one was bad odds and all the occupiers in skrunda would come after him even if he won hating the algarvians hating himself he went home his father having sewn one half of the algarvian officers tunic was muttering the charm that would finish the stitching it wasnt quite a straight application of the law of similarity because the left half was a mirror image of the right talsu wouldnt have wanted to try it himself he knew he didnt have the skill but his father was the best tailor in skrunda and for several towns around not only for his handwork but also for the craft spells that meant he didnt have to do everything by hand as soon as traku spoke the final word of command the thread hed laid on the left side of the tunic writhed as if alive then stitched itself through the fabric duplicating his careful sewing on the right side he watched anxiously trusting even longfamiliar magic less than his needlework but everything turned out as it should have thats a nice piece of work father talsu said setting the oil and the garlic on the counter by the newly finished tunic aye it is if i say so myself traku agreed cursed pity im wasting it on the redheads talsu grimaced and had to nod eoforwic was like no place vanai had ever known of course she hadnt known many places in her young life only oyngestun and a few visits to gromheort shed thought gromheort a great city next to oyngestun it surely was but measured against the capital of forthwegthe former capital of former forthweg she thoughtgromheort sank down to what it was a provincial town like two dozen others in the kingdom gromheort had at its heart the local counts palace eoforwic had at its heart the royal palace the palace was badly battered forthwegian soldiers had defended it against invading unkerlanters and then less than two years later the unkerlanters had defended it against invading algarvians even battered though it was far larger far grander and far more elegant than the count of gromheorts residence and the rest of eoforwic was in proportion to its heart aye its a big place ealstan said one morning doing his resolute best not to show how impressed he was more chances for us not to get noticed his wave took in the cramped little flat they were sharing like this for instance vanai nodded aye like this after the comfortable house in which shed lived with her grandfather the flat in a rundown part of town seemed especially small and especially dingy but living with ealstan rather than brivibas made a lot of difference her grandfather had neither known nor much cared about what she was thinking ealstan by contrast thought along with her i know its not much im used to better too but nobody whos not really looking hard for us would ever find us here and the companys good she went around the rickety kitchen table and gave him a hug after serving as an algarvian officers plaything shed thought she would never want another man to touch her let alone that she would want to touch a man herself finding shed been wrong was a wonder and a delight ealstan pulled her down onto his lapwhich made his chair as decrepit as the table creakand kissed her then he let her go something major spinello hadnt been in the habit of doing im off he said matteroffactly the last fellow i worked for has a friend whos also glad to find a bookkeeper who can count past ten without taking off his shoes he couldnt possibly pay you what youre worth vanai said this time she kissed him why not the door was closed the window shuttered against latewinter chill no one would know no one would care hell pay me enough to keep us eating a while longer and keep a roof over our heads ealstan answered with a bleak pragmatism she found very appealing he headed out the door as if hed been going off to work every day for the past twenty years vanai washed the breakfast dishes shed been doing that ever since she was able to handle plates without dropping them her grandfather while a splendid historical scholar was not made for the real world then she went back into the bedroom and sprawled across the bed she and ealstan shared at night looking at the bare roughly plastered wall only a couple of feet from her face made her sigh she missed the books shed left behind in oyngestun until she met ealstan books were almost the only friends shed had she missed the books more than she missed brivibas that should have shamed her but it didnt her grandfather had been perfectly hateful toward her since she started giving herself to the algarvian to get him out of the labor gang the only book in the flat was a cheap badly printed volume the previous tenant had forgotten when he moved out at the moment it lay on the nightstand vanai picked it up sighed and shook her head it was a forthwegian translation of an algarvian historical romance called the wicked empire aflame because it was the only book she had shed read it it was laughably bad in any number of different ways she had trouble deciding whether it took liberties with history or simply ignored it all the algarvian mercenaries were virile heroes the men of the kaunian empire were cowards and villains their wives and daughters fairly panted to find out what the algarvians had under their kiltsand find out they did in great detail but vanai didnt laugh at the romance not any more though she had when she first started reading being her grandfathers granddaughter she saw through all the lies the writer was telling but what would some ignorant algarvian or forthwegian think after reading the wicked empire aflame hed think kaunians were cowards and villains thats what and their women sluts hed think they deserved the massacre so lovingly described in the last chapter and if he thought that about the ancient kaunians what would he think about their modern descendants wouldnt he be more likely to think they deserved whatever happened to them too than if he hadnt read the romance vanai wondered how many copies of the wicked empire aflame were floating around in algarve and now in forthweg she wondered how many similar romances algarvian writers had churned out and how many copies of them were floating around she wondered what else the redheads had done to convince their own people and those theyd subjected that kaunians werent quite human her mouth twisted a lot of forthwegians wouldnt need much convincing about that a lot of algarvians probably didnt need much convincing either were things otherwise how could they put kaunians on caravan cars heading toward the miserable end awaiting them in the west she shivered that had nothing to do with the weather the flat whatever its other shortcomings was warm enough but she and her grandfather had come within a hairs breadth of being herded aboard one of those caravan cars themselves one algarvian constable had persuaded another to pick a couple of different kaunians from oyngestun they were surely dead now while vanai and brivibas lived if you call this living vanai muttered she went out of the flat as seldom as she could if the algarvians saw her on the street they were liable to seize her she knew that but staying cooped up with nothing to do had no appeal either the flat probably hadnt been so clean since the week after it was built opening the shutters and looking out the window gave her some relief it would have given her more had she been able to see anything but a narrow winding street and across from it another block of flats as grimy and neglected as the one in which she was living almost all the people on the street were forthwegian from everything shed heard eoforwic was home to a large number of kaunians either most of them were hiding as she was or a lot had already been shipped away one of those prospects was bad the other worse three algarvian constables strode up the street sticks in hand vanai shrank back from the window she didnt know they were trolling for kaunians but she didnt know they werent either she didnt want to find out the constables kept walking everyone who saw them scrambled out of their way that no doubt appealed to their vanity but if they were such heroes as their strides made them out to be why did they always travel in groups of at least three time crawled on a pigeon landed on the windowsill and peered in at vanai with its beady little red eyes she knew several recipes that dated back to the days of the kaunian empire for roast squab squab seethed in honey baked squab stuffed with mushrooms and figs thinking about them made her hungry enough to start to open the window at the noise and the motion the pigeon flew off darkness had already fallen before ealstan came upstairs with a couple of days worth of groceries the flat had no rest crate with spells to keep food from going bad so he couldnt shop very far ahead ive got a nice soup bone here he said a good bit of meat on it and plenty of marrow inside and i bought some ham thatll keep till tomorrow ill get the fire going in the stove and chop some vegetables for the soup vanai said that does look like a good bone dont go yet ealstan was rummaging at the bottom of the cloth sack in which hed brought home the food herei found these for you he held up three forthwegian romancesone the deaf mutes song a great classic apologetically he went on i couldnt find you anything in kaunian i looked i really did but the redheads have made it against the law to print anything in your language and i didnt dare ask too many questions i know theyve done that vanai answered i remember how furious my grandfather was when he had to try to compose in forthwegian thank you so much i was just thinking earlier today that i needed something to do and now youve given me something i was thinking the same thingabout you i mean ealstan said sitting up here by yourself all the time cant be easy vanais eyes opened very wide tears stung them and she had to turn away as best he could ealstan did look out for her and try to make her happy that still astonished her she was altogether unused to it shed gone away with him partly for his own sake true but also because shed thought he couldnt be worse than her grandfather and because shed felt guilty that hed got into trouble in gromheort on account of her she hadnt really expected shed be so much happier in spite of everything but she was ealstan said and this fellow pays pretty well well be able to salt plenty away if things were different we could think about moving to a nicer place but they arenti think were better off with ready cash meeting ealstan gathering mushrooms hadnt shown vanai his solid core of good sense neither had lying with him however much shed enjoyed thatand however astonished shed been that she could enjoy such things after major spinello she quoted an adage in classical kaunian passion fades wisdom endures i hope passion does not fade so soon as that ealstan said in his slow careful kaunian hearing him speak the language with which she was most familiar always pleased her though she was more fluent in forthwegian than he was in kaunian he made the effort for her she wasnt used to that either still in kaunian he went on and do you know what else no she said tell me the man whose accounts i cast today knows ethelhelm the band leader and singer and he says ethelhelm needs someone to keep books for him too ealstan spoke as if a star were shining in broad daylight but the name meant little to vanai is that good she asked forthwegians and kaunians had different tastes in music what pleased one group seldom delighted the other its the best ealstan exclaimed irked back into forthwegian all right vanai was willing to believe him even if she didnt share his enthusiasm as she started into the kitchen to make soup she realized that was at least a good start on love night and fog in winterand for that matter at other seasons of the year toofog rolled off the ocean into tirgoviste town as it did into every other seaside city on the five major islands of sibiu cornelu was out long after the curfew the algarvian occupiers had imposed on his kingdom he hoped and had reason to hope the algarvian patrols that prowled his hometown would never set eyes on him he didnt want them to theyd been looking for him up in the hills of central tirgoviste and no doubt they were looking for him down here too but even if they did he was pretty sure he could get away from them hed lived in tirgoviste almost all his life he knew its neighborhoods and alleys without having to see them mezentios men might get lucky and blaze him before he could slide round a corner or into a doorway but he didnt think so he exhaled breathing out still more fog he could hardly see that fog no streetlights burned lest they guide lagoan dragons to their targets cornelu knew the houses and shop fronts past which he walked were made from mortared blocks of the rough gray local limestone he knew they had steep roofs of red slate slabs to shed rain and snow he knew all that because hed seen it he couldnt see it now shivering he drew his ragged sheepskin jacket more tightly around him hed been a commander in the sibian navy as good a leviathanrider as any officer who served king burebistu hed had a fine wardrobe of tunics and kilts and cloaks of all weights now as a woodcutter down from the hills he wore the same clothes day in and day out and counted himself lucky not to be colder than he was carefully he stepped forward aye there was the curb he started to step off the cobbles when he heard several men in heavy boots coming up the street toward him he drew back somebody among those booted men stumbled and let out a couple of loud vile curses they were in algarvian he was fluent in the language but likely would have understood most of them even if he hadnt been sibian and algarvian were as close as brothers to each other he did understand those curses could mean trouble moving as quietly as he could he drew back again ready to flee if the algarvians heard him they didnt they passed him by with no notion he was there the fellow whod stumbled was still grumbling arent going to be any stinking sibs out on a night like this its a waste of time thats what it is anybody whod come out tonight would break his fool neck five minutes later and serve him right too you almost broke yours thats cursed sure one of his comrades said the others laughed the grumbler cursed some more and kept cursing till the patrol passed out of earshot by then cornelu had already crossed the streetquite safely had the algarvians been able to see his smile through the darkness and murk they would not have enjoyed it the streets got steep in the direction they were going maybe one of them really would break his neck cornelu hoped so he went on another couple of blocks then turned left onto his own street and hurried toward his own house the house in which he hadnt lived in which he hadnt even set foot since the algarvian invasion costache and brindza lived there still so did the three algarvian officers quartered on them all the houses on his block like the houses and shops and taverns in the rest of tirgoviste were dark for the same reason street lamps were dragons from lagoas could reach sibiu cornelu understood why the algarvians wanted to make it hard for them to drop their eggs accurately here as elsewhere understanding failed to bring sympathy here was his walk leading up to his front porch as he strode along the walk he reached under his jacket and pulled out a short stick one of the sort a constable might carry the stick had cost him most of the silver hed brought down from the hills but he didnt care even if it wasnt such a powerful weapon as a footsoldiers stick it ought to be good enough to dispose of the officers whod settled down here then cornelu could take costache and brindza away to the southern side of the island or maybe back up into the hills and then cornelu muttered under his breath then by the powers above i can be alone with my wife he ached for her sometimes literally as quietly as he could he stepped up onto the porch he must have been quiet enough no one inside called out in alarm once up there he could tell lamps were lit within though black curtainsnew since hed last seen the houseswallowed almost all the glare cornelu paused a moment pondering his next step did he knock would he do better to sneak in through a window could he break down the door slay all of mezentios men and get costache and brindza away before the commotion drew neighbors or more algarvians that was what he most wanted to do but he knew the risks while he pondered costaches voice bright and cheerful came out through the window undimmed by the curtains wait there darling ill be with you in a moment rather than brindzas childish prattle which cornelu had expected an algarvian doing his best to speak sibian answered all right sweetheart but youd better not keep me waiting long dont worry costache said archly i wont be long i promise and youll be glad when i get there the algarvian laughed sick at heart cornelu turned away he looked at his stick if he blazed himself through the head if he left his body lying on the walk would costache shed a tear or would she just laugh i should have known cornelu said to himself in a sort of whispered groan oh by the powers above i should have known she hadnt wanted to see him not really she hadnt wanted to be alone with him hed wondered hed worried but he hadnt believed not deep in his heart he hadnt wanted to believe he stared back toward his houseno toward the house that had been his he stared back toward the life that had been his too things would never be the same now looking at the stick he shook his head costache had betrayed him why should he give her the satisfaction of finding him dead what he really wanted was revenge he started to swing back toward the house if he killed not only the algarvians but his wife his faithless wife as well what would he do with brindza then kill her too she hadnt done anything to him she hadnt even kept him from sleeping with costache as hed thought beforecostache hadnt wanted to sleep with him anyhow take brindza with him he had no idea how to care for a toddler hed never had a chance to learn he slammed his forehead hard with the heel of his hand hed just found the last thing he wanted a reason to let his wife live with a muffled curse he hurried down the street running as much from his fury as from his former home he let his feet carry him his mind was empty of anything even resembling thought hed gone several blocks before realizing he was heading down toward the harbor not back up into the hills hed worked as a woodcutter in the hope of rejoining costache and brindza his feet had realized before his head that that wouldnt happen now and if it wouldnt what point to going back to the hills and to work he despised anyhow mezentios men would still be looking for him there too the smell of the sea was always strong in tirgoviste town but once cornelu drew near the piers he caught the reek of old fish from the boats the algarvians still permitted to sail an odor that didnt travel so far inland as the salt tang pervading all the sibian islands the main five and their smaller outliers through the damp deadening fog he caught the familiar slap of waves against the wooden pilings that supported the harbor piers he knew exactly where he was by the way the waves sounded discovering where his feet had brought him he also discovered theyd had a better notion of where they were going than hed imagined he was within a stones throw of the great wire pens where the sibian navy had held its leviathansand where the algarvian occupiers held theirs these days cornelu had come to look at the leviathans in an earlier visit to tirgoviste an algarvian guard had cursed him and sent him away in a hurry he snorted what would the guard have done if hed come up in his seagreen sibian commanders uniform nothing so pleasant as cursing and running him offof that cornelu was sure somewhere not far away an algarvian guardmaybe even the same algarvian guardwas pacing through the fog if he was like every other guard cornelu had ever known he would be cursing his luck at drawing duty on a night when the only way he could find a foe would be to trip over his feet as if thinking of the guard had conjured him into being his footsteps sounded on the walk not far away like frost forming on a window decision crystallized within cornelu the algarvian didnt even bother trying to move quietly he seemed sure he was the only man up and walking for miles around had the fellow been a sibian cornelu would have reported him to his superior officer as things were he killed him instead it was almost absurdly easy all he had to do was keep from stomping his feet on the stone of the walkway as he followed the algarvians footfalls mezentios man hadnt the faintest notion cornelu was coming up behind him as soon as the guard became something more than the sound of booted feet as soon as he became a dim shape ahead cornelu raised his stick and blazed him down his beam was a brief bright line of light in the mist that mist attenuated the beam which was not all that strong to begin with but at a range of three or four feet it was strong enough it caught the algarvian in the back of the head he let out a startled grunt as if cornelu had tapped him on the shoulder then he quietly toppled his own stick clattered as it slipped from his nerveless fingers cornelu dragged his body off the walk so it wouldnt be found at once he picked up the stick and dropped it into the water in one of the leviathan pens it made only a tiny splash but that splash as hed hoped was enough to draw the leviathan to the surface to find out what had made it leviathans were even more curious than their squat cousins the whales because of the fog cornelu couldnt see this one but it was plain in his minds eye lean and long about six times a mans length with a beaky mouth full of sharp teeth wild leviathans were wolves of the sea tamed and trained they turned into hunting dogs moving quickly cornelu got out of his jacket and tunic his kilt and his shoes naked he jumped into the water of the leviathan pen it was cold but the chill did not pierce him to the core he let out a long exhalation of relief his sorcerous protection against the ice waters of the southern seas still held good had that not been so he would have frozen to death before long he swam toward the leviathan by everything sibian spies knew mezentios men guided their leviathans with pokes and prods almost identical to those sibian riders used he was betting his life the spies had it right a man made a good mouthful for a leviathan no more the great beast let him climb onto its back his hand found the harness secured by its fins the leviathan quivered expectantly as if waiting for him to show what he was he tapped it with the signal that in the sibian navy would have ordered it to leap out of the pen if the spies were wrong he wouldnt last long and would pass his final moments most unpleasantly the leviathan gathered itself after a dizzying rush it hurled itself through the air then splashed down again cornelu let out a whoop of joy drowned in that titanic splash he could go to lagoas which while not homehe had no home not anymorewas not mezentios to do with as he would and if he decided to drown himself halfway there costache would never know we are a warrior race sergeant istvan declared and all the gyongyosians in his squad solemnly nodded aye indeed we are a warrior race said kun who was less inclined to argue with his sergeant now that he had reached the exalted rank of corporal istvan kept his face straight though it wasnt easy kun looked about as little like a warrior as anything under the stars he was skinnyweedy when you got down to itbespectacled and had been a mages apprentice before finding himself joined to the host of ekrekek arpad the sovereign of gyongyos even his tawny beard came in by clumps and patches as if he needed some nostrum for mange being thickshouldered and furry himself istvan tended to look down his beaky nose at anyone who wasnt but kun even if he did complain and split hairs whenever he got the chance had fought well on obuda out in the bothnian ocean and hed fought well here in the frozen mountainous wasteland of western unkerlant too and the little bits of magic hed learned from his master had served his squad mates well there is a village up ahead istvan said it is supposed to have unkerlanter soldiers in it captain tivadar says there arent supposed to be too many of the goateating buggers in there stars grant hes right however many there are though the company is going to clean them out unless we dont szonyi said istvan remembered when the hulking private had been as raw a recruit as kun it hadnt been so long before now szonyi might have been an old veteran he wasnt old but he certainly was a veteran we are a warrior race istvan repeated if the captain orders us to take this village take it we shall and he will lead us while we do it szonyis big head bobbed up and down in agreement tivadar was an officer fit to command warriors for he never asked his men to do anything he would not do and did not do himself onward kun said as a private he would have been better pleased to hang back rank made hanging back embarrassing for him it worked the same magic on istvan he wondered if it worked the same magic on tivadar too that didnt matter and he had no time to worry about it anyhow other sergeants were haranguing their squads back when istvan had been a simple soldier hed listened to sergeants as little as he could get away with his own men listened to him that way except when they listened closely so they could argue afterwards but he heard his fellow sergeants and even officers with new ears these days he had to get the troopers in his squad to do as he said any tricks he could pick up he would here came captain tivadar who was only a few years older than istvan is your squad ready the company commander asked glaring as if he intended to tear istvan limb from limb if the answer was no but istvan nodded and said aye sir the unkerlanters arent supposed to have more than a section holding this miserable little place tivadar said they cant afford to fight out here in the middle of nowhere any better than we canworse in fact because theyre fighting the algarvians too a quarter of the way around the world east of here aye sir istvan repeated and then added a quarter of the way around the world is too far for me to think about all i know is im too cursed far from my home valley tivadar nodded a man cant be farther away than too far from home but im glad weve got you with us sergeant even if the unkerlanters have a regiment in there youll make em think weve got a brigade and out theyll come with their hands up high despite the flaps on his fur cap istvans ears had been chilly now they heated in embarrassment he wasnt used to praise from officers sir he said if my bluffand kuns little magichadnt worked back there wed have had to yield ourselves to the unkerlanters instead of the other way round the stars shone kindly on me that day they shine on those who deserve it tivadar slapped him on the back with a mittened hand kun got promoted cant very well promote youyou havent the blood for it of coursebut the bravery bonus will be added to your pay once all the clerks are done playing with their counting boards unless i die of old age first istvan said with a wry chuckle he quickly choked off he could die of a lot of other things besides old age the unkerlanters were going to get the chance to find some of them too reading his thoughts captain tivadar said if the stars wink your clan still gets the bonus it wont be lost and remember your squad is on the left flank if you can lead them around behind the village while the main attack goes in from the front then when the cursed unkerlanters are all hot and bothered you can hit em from the reareasy as buggering a goat istvans lip curled sir thats disgusting after a moment though he laughed its pretty funny too isnt it of all my sergeants youre the one i want in back of the unkerlanters tivadar slapped him again a good solid blow lets get going did you hear that boys istvan said to his squad he felt about to burst with pride were the best and the captain knows it well wreck the unkerlanters good and proper wont we aye the soldiers chorused they took their places on the left of captain tivadars little line of battle and started east with the rest of the company the wind blew snow from the ground and lashed their backs it blew snow through the bare branches of stunted birch trees that clung to the sides of the valley in which the village lay istvan and his squad scurried through the trees they were the only cover the freezing landscape offered eggs began bursting farther south may the stars go dark for the unkerlanters istvan said angrily they werent supposed to have a tosser in there what that meant was captain tivadar hadnt warned him to expect one kun said their officers are probably saying we arent supposed to be coming after them we need to be more like mages and deal with what is not with whats supposed to be he went into a snowcovered hole in the ground that was where it wasnt supposed to be and rose coated with white istvan was unkind enough to laugh not three minutes later he spied movement ahead the distinctive movement only a human body can make all the gyongyosians in this part of the world were with him that made the stooped figure ahead an enemy istvan threw his stick up to his shoulder and blazed the unkerlanter shrieked and fell its a woman szonyi exclaimed as she kept on shrieking whats a woman doing out here well never know istvan said as he ran toward her through the snow he pulled a knife from its sheath wrong place at the wrong time thats all have to shut her up nervously he glanced south hoping the noise of combat there would keep anyone in the village from hearing her cries she found a rock in the snow and threw it at him as he drew near it missed she was groping for another one when he cut her throat her blood splashed red across the winter white that was a waste sergeant one of his troopers said from behind him we havent got time for fun istvan answered with another shrug too cursed cold to go whipping it out anyhow come on keep moving he tried to gauge how the fighting was going by where the unkerlanters eggs were bursting the rest of the company wasnt moving as fast as captain tivadar had hoped istvan scowled instead of just following orders hed have to start thinking for himself he didnt care for that it was properly an officers job as if to reassure him szonyi pointed down in the direction of the village and said weve set it afire aye istvan considered that then slowly nodded thatll help the unkerlanters will have a harder time aiming their tosser he thought a little more his mind didnt move very fast but had a way of getting where it was going and with the wind blowing at our backs the smokell help hide us when we get into place to come at em from behind wed better do that the rest of the company is going to need us even more than the captain thought they would but for that luckless woman what had she been doinggathering firewood most likely no one in the village had any notion his squad was moving around it toward the rear once in position istvan peered toward the place from behind a rock through blowing smoke he saw unkerlanter soldiers running here and there the wind carried their guttural shouts to his ears one of them set an egg on the tossers hurling arm another launched the egg toward istvans countrymen catching sight of the eggtosser told him what he had to do next he pointed toward it were going to take that miserable thing the rest of the boys will have an easier time then forwardand dont shout till youre sure theyve spied us he was the first one to break cover and run toward the village his men followed if he went they would go the crunch of their boots on crusted snow seemed dreadfully loud in his ears so did his own coughing after he sucked in too thick a lungful of smoky air but the tunicclad unkerlanters intent on serving their eggtosser and beating back the threat from the west paid no attention to their rear till too late because of the smoke in the air istvan had to get closer than usual to them before he started blazing first one of the enemy soldiers fell then the other the second unkerlanter was grabbing for his own stick to blaze back when another gyongyosians beam finished him gyongyos istvan did shout then as loud as he could ekrekek arpad gyongyos the rest of the squad echoed the cry to the unkerlanters frightened ears they must have sounded like a regiment they fought almost like a regiment too for the unkerlanters well concealed against tivadars attackers were hardly hidden at all from men coming the other way king swemmels soldiers howled in dismay some tried to turn and face istvans squad but they couldnt do that and hold off the rest of the attackers toothey lacked the numbers some of them died in place others began throwing down their sticks throwing up their hands and surrendering before long the only unkerlanters left in the ruined village were captives and a handful of the trappers and hunters and their womenfolk and children whod lived there and hadnt fled east captain tivadar sent them all back toward land gyongyos held more securely then in front of the whole company he spoke loudly to istvan well done sergeant thank you sir istvan said another few years of tiny victories like this and the armies of gyongyos might be in position for something larger istvan wondered if hed live to see it as the sun sank below the western horizon the algarvian strawboss shouted going home along with the rest of his labor gang leofsig laid down his sledgehammer with a weary sigh of relief the algarvian strode through the gang handing out the days pay a small silver bit for forthwegian laborers half that much in copper for the handful of kaunians a wagon came rattling up to take the gang back to gromheort over the road theyd been paving they were too far from the city to walk without adding unduly to their exhaustion the blonds got the job of rounding up all the tools before the gang boss let them climb into the wagon too like the forthwegians they sprawled limply over the wagon bed here get off me a forthwegian growled at one of them ought to send the whole lot of you whoresons west then wed be rid of you oh dont go unbuttoning your tunic oslac leofsig said were all too tired to see straight oslac glared at him eyes glittering in the twilight but leofsig was bigger stronger and younger than the other laborer whose dark beard was streaked with gray leofsig had been conscripted into king pendas levy not long before forthweg began her disastrous war against algarve and still thought of a man of thirty as one bearing respectable years knowing himself outmatched oslac did no more than mutter stinking kaunians we all stink too leofsig said and oslac could hardly argue with him there he went on let it alone why dont you had some of oslacs comrades backed him he might have taken it further even the laborers who hated kaunians worse than he did though seemed too worn to care a couple of men had already started snoring leofsig rather envied them no matter how much hed done during the day he couldnt hope to sleep on bare boards in an unsprung wagon jouncing over cobblestones an hour or so laterjust enough time for him to start to go stiffthe wagon clattered into gromheort he helped shake the sleepers awake then creakily descended from the wagon and started home the kaunian hed defended a fellow named peitavas fell into step beside him my thanks he said in his own language which leofsig spoke fairly well its all right leofsig answered in forthwegian he was too spent to look for words in another tongue go home stay there stay safe im as safe as any kaunian in forthweg peitavas said as long as i build roads for the algarvians im more useful to them alive than dead with most of my people its the other way round he turned down a side street before leofsig could answer leofsig cast a longing look toward the public baths he sighed shook his head and walked on toward his home his mother or sister would have a basin of water and some rags waiting for him that wasnt as good as a warm plunge and a showerbath but it would have to do anyway with fuel scarce and expensive in gromheort these days the plunge more often than not wasnt warm and getting into the baths cost a copper a good part of what hed spent the day slaving to earn home then through the dark streets of the city curfew hadnt come yet but wasnt far away once an algarvian constable stopped him and started asking questions in bad kaunian and worse forthwegian he wondered if hed land in trouble and whether he ought to kick the chubby fellow in the balls and run but then they recognized each other leofsig had helped the constable find his way back to his barracks when he got lost just after arriving in gromheort going on the algarvian said tipping his hat and went on himself and so instead of returning to the captives camp from which hed escaped or having something worse happen to him leofsig knocked on his own front door a few minutes later he waited for the bar to be lifted then worked the latch and went inside conberge waited in the short entry hall youre late tonight she said redheads worked us hard curse em he answered his sister wrinkled her nose i believe that to leave no possible doubt about what she believed she added the basins waiting for you in the kitchen itll be mostly cold by now but i can put in some more hot water from the kettle over the fire would you leofsig said its chilly out there and i dont want to end up with chest fever come along then conberge said briskly she was between him and ealstan in age but insisted on mothering him in much the same style as their true mother as leofsig went past her and turned left toward the kitchen she lowered her voice murmuring weve heard from him leofsig stopped have you he said also softly where is he is he all right his sister nodded aye he is she whispered hes in eoforwic not in oyngestun leofsig asked and conberge shook her head is the kaunian girl with him she shrugged he doesnt say he says hes happy though so i think she is now come on people will have heard you come in and theyll be wondering why youre dawdling in the hallway fondly leofsig patted her on the shoulder youd have made a terrific spy conberge snorted and stopped acting motherly she elbowed him harder than oslac could have done thus propelled into the kitchen he went his mother was stirring a pot hanging over the fire next to the kettle by the way elfryth nodded by the secretly delighted look in her eye he knew she knew the news all she said was clean yourself off son supper will be ready soon im going to give him some fresh hot water conberge said and used a dipper to draw some from the kettle as leofsig scrubbed dirt and sweat from his arms and legs and face she went on i think he ought to put on a clean tunic too before he comes to the supper table that was also motherly she didnt seem to think he had sense enough to change clothes unless she told him to let me have a cup of wine first leofsig said conberge poured him one before he drank he raised the cup in salute his sister and mother both smiled they understood what he meant after putting on a fresh wool tunic and fresh drawers he went across the courtyard to the dining room which lay just to the right of the entry hall so as to make it convenient to the kitchen as hed expected he found his father and uncle already there uncle hengist was reading the news sheet reading it aloud and loudly no unkerlanter gains reported on any front he said what do you think of that hestan leofsigs father shrugged the unkerlanters have already gained a lot of ground he said in mild tones his brother enjoyed hearing himself talk more than he did but the algarvians havent fallen to pieces the way you said they would a few weeks ago hengist insisted i didnt say they would i said they might hestan answered with a bookkeepers precision pretty plainly they havent youre right about that he nodded to leofsig looking to change the subject hello son how did it go today im tired leofsig answered he could have said that any day and been telling the truth he raised an eyebrow at his father hestan nodded ever so slightly he knew about ealstan too then neither of them said anything where uncle hengist could hear after what had happened to sidroc if he knew where ealstan was he might let the algarvians know too nobody wanted to find out whether he would if you want to work with me you may hestan said numbers are as stubborn as cobblestones but not so backbreaking to wallop into place youd make more money too uncle hengist pointed out his mind always ran in that direction i still dont think its safe leofsig said nobody pays attention to one laborer in a gang but the fellow who casts accounts for you you notice him you want to be sure he knows what hes doing if he saves you money you tell people about him after a while talk goes to the wrong ears i suppose thats wise his father said still when i see you come dragging in the way you do sometimes i wouldnt mind throwing wisdom out the window ill get by leofsig said hestan grimaced but nodded conberge came in and set stoneware bowls and bonehandled spoons on the table supper in a minute she said it smells good leofsig said his stomach growled agreement the bread and olive oil hed eaten at noon seemed a million miles away any sort of food would have smelled wonderful just then same old stew barley and lentils and turnips and cabbage conberge said mother chopped a little smoked sausage into it but only a little youll taste it more than it will do you any good if you know what i mean its probably what you smell elfryth brought in the pot and ladled the bowls full as she was sitting down she asked wheres sidroc uncle hengist called his son loudly after another couple of minutes sidroc came in sat down and silently began to eat he was burly as leofsig had become despite not doing hard physical labor he looked like leofsig too though his nose was blobbier than leofsigs sharply hooked one it took after that of his mother shed been killed when an algarvian egg wrecked their house and he and uncle hengist had lived not always comfortably with leofsigs family ever since after finishing his first bowl of stew sidroc helped himself to another which he also devoured only then did he speak that wasnt so bad he rubbed his temples my head hurts hed had headaches ever since hed hit his head in the brawl with ealstan he still didnt remember what the brawl had been about for which leofsig and his father and mother and sister thanked the powers above ealstans disappearance afterwards though had left both him and uncle hengist suspicious most suspicious indeed leofsig wished his brother hadnt had to run off but ealstan couldnt have known sidroc would wake up without remembering he couldnt have known sidroc would wake up at all have you finished your schoolwork hengist asked sidroc oh ayeas much of it as i could do sidroc replied hed been an indifferent scholar before the knock on the head and hadnt got better since after taking a big swig from his wine cup he went on maybe ill sign up for plegmunds brigade after all i wouldnt have to worry about poems and irregular verbs there everyone else at the table even uncle hengist winced the algarvians had set up plegmunds brigade to get forthwegians to fight for them in unkerlant leofsig had fought the algarvians he would sooner have jumped off a tall building than fought for them but sidroc had been talking about the brigade even before the fight with ealstan maybe he needs another shot to the head leofsig thought and a harder one this time fifteen officially hajjaj was far in the north up in bishah any number of witnesses would swear at need that the zuwayzi foreign minister was hard at work in the capital right where he should be hajjaj didnt want any of them to have to take such an oath that would mean something had gone wrong something had made the algarvians suspicious better by far they never ever come down to jurdhan he strolled along the main street such as it was of the little noaccount town one elderly black man wearing only a straw hat and sandals among many black men and women and children all dressed or not dressed much as he was nudity had its advantages by leaving off the bracelets and anklets and gold rings and chains he would normally have worn hajjaj turned himself into a person of no particular importance he would have had a harder time doing that with shabby clothes when he walked into jurdhans chiefby virtue of being jurdhans onlyhostel no one gave him a second glance that was just what he wanted he went upstairs the hostel was one of a handful of buildings in town to boast a second story and walked down the hall to the chamber where hed been told the man he was to meet awaited him he knocked once twice then once again after a moment the latch clicked the door swung open a short squat swarthy manswarthy but far from blackwearing a kneelength cotton tunic looked him up and down powers above youre a scrawny old bugger he remarked in algarvian thank you so much my lord ansovald i am so glad to see you again your excellency hajjaj answered in the same language speaking algarvian to the formerand perhaps futureunkerlanter minister to zuwayza tickled his sense of irony which needed little tickling but it was the one speech they truly had in common his own unkerlanter was halting ansovald s zuwayzi as near nonexistent as made no difference if ansovald noticed the irony he didnt let on well come in he said and stood aside if you want to put on a tunic and hide that bag of bones you call a carcass ive got one here for you that was the usual practice for zuwayzi diplomats hajjaj had grown resigned to wearing a long tunic when calling on envoys from unkerlant and forthweg a short tunic and kilt when seeing a minister from an algarvic kingdom a tunic and trousers when meeting with kaunians and clothes of some sort at any rate when dealing with lands like kuusamo and gyongyos where style of apparel carried less political weight but growing resigned to it didnt mean he loved it he shook his head and answered no thank you this is unofficial which means i can be comfortable if i please and i do hed thought about wearing a tunic to this meeting too thought about it and rejected the notion nothing would have drawn stares like a clothed zuwayzi strolling through jurdhannothing except a naked unkerlanter strolling through cottbus and maybe his nudity would disconcert ansovald if it did the unkerlanter diplomat didnt show that either come in then he said i told you that already id sooner you were a woman half your age but i dont suppose king shazli would no in a word hajjaj walked into the chamber ansovald closed the door behind him closed it and barred it from any other kingdoms minister ansovalds words would have been monstrously rude from the unkerlanter they were something of a prodigy this was the first time hajjaj could remember him caring in the slightest for what king shazli thought the room was furnished zuwayzistyle with carpet piled on carpet and with cushions large and small a guest could arrange to suit his own comfort hajjaj wasted no time doing that ansovald followed suit rather more clumsily he did not offer hajjaj wine and cakes and tea as any zuwayzi host would have done instead very much an unkerlanter again he bulled straight ahead we arent going to settle the war between us this afternoon i never expected we would hajjaj replied and you cant tell me youre able to make the cursed algarvians pack up and go home either ansovald growled aye you and the redheads are in bed with each other but i know which ones the tail and which ones the dog despite the mixed metaphor hajjaj followed him the zuwayzi foreign minister said if unkerlant hadnt come up and ravaged us by force we would likely be neutral now not allied to king mezentio oh ayetell me another one ansovald jeered youd kick us when we were down just like everyone else that held a grain of truth or more than a grain but what was true and what was diplomatic often had only a nodding relationship or sometimes none at all hajjaj said wouldnt you be better off if you had fewer foes to fight whats your price ansovald was an unkerlanter all right no subtlety to him no style no grace hajjaj vastly preferred dealing with marquis balastro algarves minister to zuwayza on the other hand the urbane and dashing algarvians had been the ones whod started murdering kaunians for the sake of advantage in the war by all accounts king swemmel of unkerlant had wasted not a moment in imitating them but algarve went first try as he would hajjaj couldnt forget that your excellency unkerlant went to war with us because the treaty of bludenz no longer suited your sovereign he said kyot the traitor signed the treaty of bludenz ansovald said which was true like forthweg zuwayza had used the chaos reigning in unkerlant after the six years war to regain her freedom but hajjaj said and king swemmel always adhered to it afterwards he got good results when he did and bad results when he decided not to any longer and invaded us isnt it efficient to do what works well and inefficient to do the opposite swemmel and because of him his countrymen prated endlessly of efficiency but the talk came easier for them than the thing itself ansovalds heavy features were made for scowling and he scowled now you black thieves have stolen more land now than the treaty of bludenz ever gave you and you know it cursed well too hajjaj breathed heavily through his arched nose one reason we have is that you tannish thieves stole so much of what youd honestly yielded in the treaty give us the border we had before give us guarantees that you mean to give what you say youre giving and i may persuade king shazli to be satisfied since the slaughters to power sorcery had started the zuwayzi foreign minister kept casting about for ways to get out of the war he had some hopes for this one the more so as unkerlant had requested the meeting ansovald proceeded to dash them saying king swemmel will give you the borders you agreed to in cottbus and not another inch of ground i agreed to those because unkerlant invaded my kingdom hajjaj exclaimed indignantly i agreed to them because we stood alone without a friend in the world things are different now and king swemmel had better recognize it oh he does ansovald said by even offering so much he admitsunofficially of coursezuwayza has a right to exist that is more than you have had from him before take it and be thankful the worst of it was he had a point of sorts but only of sorts in tones far more frigid than zuwayzi weather ever got hajjaj said it cannot be unkerlant got that border after beating us in war we are not beaten now as you yourself have said and if king swemmel did not recognize that zuwayza has a right to exist why were you his minister in bishah for so long he treated with you you zuwayzin are here after all ansovald sounded like a man admitting something he didnt care for but couldnt deny but being here is not the same as being a kingdom this is the bargain for which i spirited myself out of bishah this and nothing more hajjaj asked when ansovald nodded the zuwayzi foreign minister felt betrayed he said i cannot take it back to my own sovereignwho is king of zuwayza whether swemmel recognizes him or not i had hoped you might have some room to dicker considering how much of unkerlant algarve holds these days less today than yesterday ansovald said drawing himself up with touchy pride less tomorrow than today we will whip them out of our kingdom altogether before springand when we do your turn comes next hajjaj did not think that would happen it was only weeks ago that cottbus was on the point of falling he pointed out its not on the point of falling now ansovald growled by this time next year trapani will be on the point of falling to our brave unkerlanter soldiers you and your chief who calls himself a king had best bear it in mind and behave yourselves accordingly with dignity undamaged by creaking knees hajjaj got to his feet bowing to ansovald he said i had hoped to be dealing with a reasonable man since the unkerlanter came as king swemmels envoy that was probably optimistic but he had hoped he went on if you truly believe what you just told me i can only conclude some malignant mage has stolen your wits king mezentios armies are falling to pieces on the snowcovered plains of unkerlant ansovald insisted we shall see hajjaj said politely but i cannot tell you that i believe you are right and i cannot see much point to any further discussions between us so long as we differ so widely he bowed again your safeconduct will carry you back through our lines to your own kingdom as a parting jab he added you must remember though that it will not protect you from any algarvian soldiers you may meet on your way back to cottbus ansovald gave him a dirty look it was also hajjaj judged an alarmed look ansovald knew where the lines ran gruffly the unkerlanter put the best face on it he could less snow up here than in the rest of the kingdom but well root the whoresons out of these parts too see if we dont good day sir hajjaj said and left ansovalds chamber he thought ansovald said something after he closed the door but didnt bother going back to find out the unkerlanter sounded unhappy with the world sighing hajjaj went downstairs and out of the hostel he was unhappy with the world too zuwayza wouldnt be able to get out of the derlavaian war so easily as hed hoped he sighed once more that all too often was the way things worked easier to get into trouble of any sort than to get free of it afterwards he made his way back to the leyline caravan depot lying on a ley line was jurdhans reason for being the next northbound caravan wouldnt be heading back to bishah for several hours he didnt have a special caravan laid on the algarvians might have noticed and heand his kingdidnt want them to find out hed been talking with the unkerlanters the redheads would seek to become even more overbearing allies than they were already he wished zuwayza could have gone on without any allies at all then he sighed one more time that wasnt the way things worked worse luck along with the rest of the lagoan force on the austral continent fernao trudged west toward heshbon the easternmost colony the yaninans had carved out for themselves on the northern coast of the land of the ice people hed visited heshbon before after spiriting king penda of forthweg out of yanina he would willinglyeagerlyhave forgone visiting the place again but nobodyd asked his opinion well you were right about one thing affonso said as the two mages kicked their way through the snow fernao eyed his colleague and tentmate im right about any number of things he said with a sorcerers almost unconscious arrogance which one have you got in mind i wouldnt eat camel meat if i had any choice affonso answered and neither would anyone else in his right mind the ice people like it fernao paused meditatively of course that proves your point doesnt it aye the younger mages sigh sent a foggy cloud out in front of him cinnabar he made the word into a curse no one would ever come here if it werent for that i wish i never had ill tell you that there are furs too fernao said as the lagoans did whenever discussions of why anyone bothered coming to the land of the ice people began affonso proceeded to tell him in great detail what he could do with the austral continents furs his argument made up in intensity what it lacked in coherence fernao laughed loud and long after affonso regained some of his temper he said do you suppose the yaninans will come out and fight us this side of heshbon trying to figure out what the yaninans will do is always foolish because half the time they dont know themselves till they do it fernao answered that was how lagoans usually thought of yaninans having been in patras the capital of yanina fernao understood how much truth the cliche held can they hire enough ice people to give us a hard time affonso asked that was a better question and one with a less certain answer fernao only shrugged and kept walking the idea worried him by what hed seen in heshbon king tsavellas men hadnt gone out of the way to endear themselves to the natives of the austral continent on the other hand gold could be endearing all by itself and the yaninans hadnt had much luck attacking the lagoan army on their own two evenings later just as the lagoans were making camp half a dozen ice people rode up to them on camels plainly a cut above the common stock one of them proved to speak yaninan not many lagoans did so lieutenant general junqueiro summoned fernao to interpret for him fernaos yaninan was also less than perfect but he thought he could make himself understood in the language the man of the ice people who spoke yaninan said tell your chief i am elishamma the son of ammihud who was the son of helori who was the son of shedeur who was the son of izhar who was the son of the genealogy went on for some time till elishamma finished who was the son of a god he necessarily used a word from his own language for that last instead of abstract powers the ice people believed in men writ large on the face of the universe fernao found the notion ludicrous to say nothing of barbarous he hadnt come to argue such notions with elishamma though but to translate for junqueiro having done so he added in lagoan give him all your forefathers too he started to say whether theyre real or not but refrained no telling if some of elishammas companions understood lagoan junqueiro did him proud naming a dozen generations of ancestry if any of them was fictitious fernao couldnt have proved it the lieutenant general said ask him what he wants from us fernao did elishamma told him complete with histrionics centuries out of fashion anywhere but the austral continent not even the algarvians indulged in so much boasting and bragging fernao couldnt try to hurry it along not without mortally insulting the chieftain at last elishamma ran down that let junqueiro ask once more and what do you want with us the mangy onesso ice people spoke of men less hairy than themselvesof yanina will pay us gold to fight you how much gold will you pay us to stay calm before i answer you will allow me to speak with my wise man here the lagoan commander said pointing to fernao junqueiro had chosen just the right lordly tone elishamma inclined his head in acquiescence you may remain here junqueiro told him my mage and i shall leave the tent to confer after junqueiro had turned that into yaninan he got up and went outside with the general junqueiro muttered powers above dont they ever wash from all ive seenand smelledno your excellency fernao said junqueiro rolled his eyes the mage went on in justice this is a cold country washing in a stream here even when the streams arent frozen fairly begs for chest fever feh junqueiro dismissed the subject with a wave of his hand which proved that lagoans though at war with algarve were of algarvic stock themselves it also proved he couldnt smell himself anymore his hazel eyes sharpened to business have the yaninans really made this offer if they have how much have they offered is it worth our while to pay the ice people more how much harm can they do us as for the first id say its likely fernao answered the yaninans havent had much luck fighting us by themselves so why shouldnt they pay somebody to do the job for them youd say its likely lieutenant general junqueiro clicked his tongue between his teeth cant you use your sorcery to know for sure fernao s sigh brought forth a large cloud of fog in this country sir the spells of mages not born here have a way of going awry they have a way of going dangerously awry in fact junqueiro gave him a dirty look then why did we bring you hither because colonel peixoto back in setubal has more enthusiasm than brains fernao answered sir by the expression on junqueiros face that was mutiny or as close to mutiny as made no difference the commanding general visibly contained himself very well he said though fernao knew it wasnt even close to very well by your best estimate sir mage however you arrive at them what do you think the answers to my other questions are however much the yaninans paid elishamma it will be less than he claims fernao answered he will try to cheat us no doubt he will try to cheat king tsavellas too aye i think its worth our while to pay him more than the yaninans do if we can and i pray your pardon sir for ive forgotten your last question if we dont pay them how bad can they hurt us junqueiro said on those cursed camels of theirs they move faster than we dofaster than we can fernao answered i wouldnt want them harrying our supply route by land not with the algarvians already harrying the sea route from lagoas to the austral continent junqueiro paced back and forth kicking up snow at every step he stopped so abruptly he caught fernao by surprise all right then he growled lets go on in and dicker with the stinkingand i do mean thatson of a whore elishammas face helped him it was almost impossible to read his beard grew up to just under his eyes his thick grizzled mustache covered his lips his hairline started low on his forehead so low that his eyebrows were only thicker tufts at the bottom of it that left next to no bare skin from which fernao and junqueiro could gauge his expression but he was not a great bargainer and he made a mistake he got greedy when he solemnly declared the yaninans had offered him a hundred thousand gold pieces to assail the lagoan army both that armys commander and its highestranking mage laughed in his face all of yanina put together isnt worth a hundred thousand gold pieces junqueiro said fernao enjoyed translating that it wasnt true not literally but it matched his feeling about the kingdom elishamma yielded ground without visible embarrassment even had he been barefaced fernao doubted he would have shown embarrassment he had as much effrontery as any yaninan ever born maybe i was wrong maybe it was but fifty thousand fernao responded to that without wasting time translating for junqueiro all of yanina put together isnt worth fifty thousand gold pieces either when elishamma lowered the proposed bribe again without loudly declaring hed been telling the truth all along fernao smiled to himself and brought his commander back into the discussion junqueiro knew how much the army could afford to pay out which fernao didnt he beat the chieftain from the ice people down to just over a tenth of what hed originally tried to get is it agreed then elishamma said at last junqueiro nodded and started to speak before he could fernao said aye with one exception what hostages will you give us these fellows you brought here with you may do he turned the words into lagoan so his superior could understand junqueiro looked startled and probably had to work hard not to look horrified for taking hostages had gone out of style in civilized countriesthough rumor said the algarvians were reviving it in the lands they occupied but elishamma only sat still and then slowly nodded i did not know if you would think of this he said you mangy ones are often absentminded when it comes to such things had you not spoken i would not have reminded you i believe that fernao said but i have come to this land before and i know somethingnot everything but somethingof its ways what is your fetish animal again elishamma paused finally he said i do not think i will tell you you are a shaman after all foreign magic is not strong here but i do not care to take a chance with you you flatter me fernao said in fact odds were elishamma did flatter him but his tone suggested he might be able to harm elishamma if he learned to which animal the chieftain was mystically bound what are you two saying junqueiro asked fernao explained junqueiro surprised him by finding exacdy the right thing to do he leaned over and patted fernao on the back as if to say he was certain the mage could indeed put paid to elishamma if he found out what his fetish animal was the chieftain noted that too he looked unhappy enough for fernao to recognize the expression now junqueiro asked is it agreed it is agreed elishamma said you have here machir and hepher and abinadab and eliphelet and gereb he proceeded to give all their genealogies too their heads shall answer for my good faith he spoke to his followers in their own guttural language they bowed to him in acquiescence do any of you speak the yaninans language fernao asked in that tongue none of the men of the ice people answered fernao shifted to lagoan do any of you speak this language again the hostages kept silent were they concealing what they knew how much would it cost to find out fernao knew no sorcerous way of learning he headed into the future as blind as any other man bembo paced through the streets of gromheort he was glad to be walking a regular constables beat today not going after kaunians to ship them westor even east though he still didnt understand why that one caravanload of blonds had headed off in the wrong direction when he remarked on that oraste grunted and gave him three words worth of what was undoubtedly good advice dont ask questions not asking was easierbembo had no trouble seeing that he had nothing against doing things the easy way hed always preferred it and so instead of asking another question the plump constable said dont hardly see any kaunians on the streets these days i dont miss em either oraste answered like a lot of what he said that not only didnt need a reply but practically precluded one here we go bembo strode into an eatery the forthwegian proprietor greeted oraste and him with a broad smile that was bound to be false but was welcome anyhow then he handed them lengths of spicy sausage and cups of wine they tossed back the wine and left the eatery tearing bites off the sausage not too bad oraste finished the last of the meat licked his fingers and wiped them on his kilt no bembo agreed they know they have to keep their constables happy or else the constables will keep them unhappy that was how things worked back in tricarico and the forthwegians were a conquered people if they didnt keep bembo and his comrades happy the algarvians could be a lot tougher on them than ever they could back in their own kingdom oraste jerked a thumb at a broadsheet as he and bembo marched past it what do you think of that he asked the broadsheet showed bearded forthwegians in long tunics marching side by side with uniformed algarvians sporting imperials or waxed mustaches or side whiskers or no facial hair at all bembo couldnt read forthwegian to save his life but he knew about plegmunds brigade with a shrug he answered if these buggers want to blaze unkerlanters thats fine by me and if the unkerlanters blaze them instead of hurting our boys thats fine by me too suppose the forthwegians decide to up and blaze us instead oraste said practically a speech from him then we smash em bembo answered he liked problems with simple answers after a moment he added not too much risk of that i dont think the forthwegians dont love us but they dont love swemmel either of course i cant think of anybody who does love swemmelcan you nobody in his right mind anyhow oraste said and laughed more likely at his own joke than at bembos they marched on for another couple of strides then oraste grunted besides were cleaning out the kaunians here aye thatll keep these whoresons happy a troop of unicorn cavalry trotted west past the two constables heading toward the distant front some though not all of the algarvians on the unicorns wore white smocks over their tan tunics back when the fight against unkerlant began no one in algarve had dreamt it would last into the winter let alone almost through it the unicorns white coatswhiter by far than the concealing smockswere splotched with gray and brown paint to make the animals stand out less against a background of melting snow one of the cavalry troopers jeered at bembo and oraste you boys have the soft jobs want to trade with me bembo shook his head not me he said i may be a horses arse but i know better than to be a unicorns by the powers above that won a snort from oraste and another from the algarvian cavalryman who went on riding his unicorns harness jingling at every stride oraste said i wouldnt mind getting rid of the unkerlanters bembo shrugged again the trouble with going off to fight in the west was that the unkerlanters were altogether too likely to get rid of him he didnt point that out if oraste couldnt see it for himself the burly constable was a lot dumber than bembo thought he was besides which be careful what you wish for because you may get it bembo said theyre sending a whole great whacking lot of men off to the west that most likely meant a whole great whacking lot of men off to the west were getting killed or maimed something on which bembo would have preferred not to dwell and he didnt have to dwell on it either for a plump middleaged forthwegian woman burst out the front door of a block of flats and ran toward him and oraste shouting constables constables the forthwegian word was similar to its algarvian equivalent the forthwegians had never heard of constables till the algarvians introduced them to the western part of forthweg which had been ruled from trapani for a century and a half before the six years war whats this oraste asked suspiciously bembo didnt know either and was just as suspicious his experience had been that forthwegians didnt look for constablesthey looked out for them the woman spewed forth a stream of gibberish the handful of forthwegian words bembo know were vile wait he said and threw up his hands as if stopping an oncoming wagon do you speak any algarvian the woman shook her head her massive bosom shook too bembo found the spectacle anything but entrancing he sighed then shifted languages and asked a question that obscurely embarrassed him you speaking kaunian yes i speak some kaunian the woman answeredshe had more of the tongue than he did which wasnt saying much live next to those nasty people long enough and some rubs off bembo tried to follow her and at the same time to dredge up vocabulary he hadnt had to worry about since the last time a schoolmaster beat it into his back with a switch you wanting to telling me what he asked he gave up on grammar and syntax if he could make himself understood he was ahead of the game and the woman did understand him pointing back toward her building she said a wicked wizard has cheated me out of a weeks pay i wait on tables i am not rich i will never be rich i cannot afford to have a miserable mage take away my money whats she yattering about asked oraste who either had never learned kaunian or didnt remember so much as a word bembo explained orastes long face got longer a wizard oh aye thats just what you love to do when youre a constable go after a wizard have to blaze the whoreson if he tries to give you trouble otherwise he doesnt just tryhe cursed well does it i know i know dont remind me bembo turned back to the forthwegian woman wizard doing was what what was he doing her bosom heaved once more sparks flashed in her dark eyes he was cheating me i told you that did you not listen constabulary work could be exasperating in tricarico too every kingdom had its share of fools bembo remained convinced he met more than his share he pointed at the woman you taking toward he we into the block of flats they went it was more battered and more crowded than any equivalent back in algarve the stairway stank of stale olive oil and staler piss bembo wrinkled his nose the forthwegian woman took the smell for granted which suggested it had been there before the algarvians overran gromheort on the third floor the woman pointed to the doorway farthest from the stairs there she said loudly the thief lives there kick it in oraste asked not yet bembo answered weve only got this gals side of it for all we know this fellow in there may be right for all we know he may not be a wizard at all powers above he may never have set eyes on her before the woman listened to him in impatient incomprehension with an unhappy mutter he started toward the door cover me he told oraste oh aye his comrade said and drew his stick just in case the dingleberry is a mage bembo was thinking the same thing the thought made him carefully calibrate his knock he was aiming for being firm without being overbearing he didnt draw his stick but had his hand on it when he heard someone moving inside the flat he didnt know whether to be relieved or alarmed after a click of the latch the door swung open the fellow who stood in the doorway staring at bembo through thick spectacles might have been a mage as easily he might have been an outofwork clerk comprehension filled his face when he saw the heavy woman behind the constables he muttered something in forthwegian that had to mean i might have known you speak algarvian bembo barked at him to his relief the fellow answered aye somewhat i should have guessed eanfled would summon the constables he looked past bembo and oraste and said something to the woman bembo didnt know what she answered but it sounded hotter than anything hed learned he pointed to the woman did you work magic for her aye i did the man answered what does he say the womaneanfleddemanded in kaunian bembo feeling harassed did his best to answer the man took over he spoke kaunian too ask him what sort of magic he did oraste suggestedin algarvian of course again bembo tried to translate she wanted to lose weight the man saidin kaunian i made a spell to take the edge off her appetite i had to be careful too much and she would starve herself to death no great loss he added but people would talk eanfled let out a furious screech that made doors open all along the hallway you cheated me you whoreson she shouted look at me there was certainly plenty of her at which to look you were fatter before the fellow with the spectacles answered calmly liar she yelled at him oraste nudged bembo all right smart boy what are they saying he asked after bembo told him he grunted thats about what i thought what are we going to do about it shake em both down bembo answered he turned to the lowranking or more likely amateur mage with whom he could converse more readily tell this walking pork chop here that were going to haul the both of you up in front of the military governor and well see if theres anything left of either one of you when hes through looking very unhappy the bespectacled man translated that into forthwegian the fat woman looked even more appalled bembo wondered if she was part kaunian and feared that would come out she didnt look it but you never could tell ahh do we really have to do that the forthwegian man asked bembo didnt say anything the fellow said couldnt we come to some sort of understanding what have you got in mind bembo countered by the time he and oraste left the block of flats their belt pouches were full and jingling if the wouldbe mage and his dissatisfied customer found themselves unhappy with algarvian notions of constabulary work bembo cared very little after all hed made money on the deal shouldering his axe garivald trudged across fields still covered in snow toward the woods out beyond the village of zossen pretty soon the snow would start to melt then the fields would go from frozen to soupy after which they would dry enough for plowing and sowing meanwhile he still needed firewood as he tramped along he glanced toward a spot in a vegetable plot not far from the house of waddo the firstman zossens crystal lay buried there garivald had helped bury it if zossens algarvian occupiers ever found out about that they would bury him he couldnt dig up the crystal now either because hed have to do it secretly and that was impossible he just had to keep on worrying about it as if i havent got enough other things to worry about he muttered it wasnt as if the crystal would work now it wouldnt not here in this magicstarved backwater of the duchy of grelz not without blood sacrifices to power it but it had connected zossen to cottbuswhich meant it would connect garivald to cottbus and to king swemmel he knew what the algarvians would make of such a connection they would make an end of it and of him once he got in among the trees he breathed easier he couldnt see the spot where the crystal lay buried anymore which took a weight off his mind and none of the redheads could see him anymore either even if they were looking for him that was also a relief for a while he didnt have to use the axe much a lot of big branches had simply fallen off their trees torn from them by the weight of ice theyd had to bear through the winter garivald just needed to trim them and stuff them into the leather sack he was carrying he found some fine lengths of oak and ash that would burn long and hot in the hearth he was trimming the smaller branches from one of those lengths when all at once he whirled around the axe ready to swing he couldnt have said what had warned him he wasnt alone any more but something had and whatever it was it was right bandits and brigands prowled the woods that was what the algarvians called them anyhow unkerlanter soldiers who hadnt surrendered after mezentios men overran them some of them were nothing but bandits others kept up the fight against the redheads at first garivald thought this fellow came from that latter group but the soldierhe was plainly a soldierwas too neat and clean for one of those men and garivald had never seen a hooded white smock like the one he wore it was too thin to give any warmth its only possible purpose was concealment realization smote youre a real soldier garivald blurted the fellow in the white smock chuckled well so i am he said and what are you friend for that matter what village are you from zossen garivald answered pointing back through the trees eagerly he went on are we going to be running the algarvians out of here soon to his disappointment the unkerlanter soldier shook his head no such luck pal i squeezed through the redheads lines for a look around thats all how big a garrison have they got in your village just a squad thats been there since they took the place garivald said but theyve had other men coming througha lot ofem moving west lately i wish you hadnt told me that the soldier said with a grimace the hope was that theyd run out of men and that wed be able to roll em up and clean em out before the good weather comes back powers above make it so garivald exclaimed powers above make our powers grow powers above make the redheads go more and more these days he thought in doggerel sometimes it came out of his mouth too well i have to tell you i dont think its going to happen the unkerlanter in the white smock said the cursed algarvians didnt quite shatter the way we hoped they would weve got a lot more fighting to do before were finally rid of em too bad garivald said though that sounded likely to him too and youre the fellow who makes songs arent you the soldier said ive heard about you have you garivald didnt know what to think of that his whole life in a peasant village had taught him that drawing notice was dangerous but if no one ever heard his songs if no one ever played them what good were they aye i have the soldier said thats one of the reasons i came this far eastbecause ive heard of you i mean keep writing them thats what the officers say theyre worth a regiment of men against the algarvians garivalds heart thudded in his chest he didnt think hed ever felt prouder a regiment of men he murmured my songs worth a regiment of men he wanted to make a song about that even if hed only be able to sing it to himself anyone else even annore would laugh well im on my way now the soldier said turning his face back toward the east have to see if i can make it past the redheads going the other way shouldnt be too hard they still dont know what to do in snow off he went as used to the snowshoes on his feet as if hed been born wearing them worth a regiment of men garivald repeated once more but then all of a sudden he wasnt so glad the unkerlanter in white had come looking for him if that fellow knew where to find the peasant who made songs how long would it be before the algarvians figured it out too he finished filling the leather sack with wood then bent almost double under its weight he staggered back toward zossen as he neared the village he saw the man he least wanted to see and worse luck waddo saw him too saw him and waved and limped toward him putting a lot of weight on his stick hello garivald the village firstman exclaimed as if he hadnt seen the other peasant for the past ten years hello garivald answered warily he and waddo were bound together because of the buried crystal he wished with all his heart they werent he didnt trust waddo the firstman had been king swemmels hand in zossen and had always sucked up to inspectors and impressers when they came to the village of course the algarvians despised and harassed waddo for that very reason here and there in the duchy of grelz theyd hanged firstmen who did things that didnt suit them garivald didnt suppose he wanted to see waddo dancing at the end of a rope on the otlier hand garivald had just thought about how waddo had maintained his tiny authority by aiding those who had more power if he decided to bend the knee to the redheads puppet king raniero rather than to king swemmel how could he best ingratiate himself with the algarvian garrison by throwing me to the wolves garivald thought as if he were a mage a wolf began to howl somewhere off in the distance every few winters zossen or some nearby village would lose somebody to a hungry pack that came prowling close it hadnt happened this year no garivald thought this year we have algarvians instead thats worse waddo heard the wolf too and grimaced i hope he finds a whole company of frozen redheads to eat aye garivald said he agreed with waddohe hoped the wolves found a whole regiment of frozen redheadsbut wished he didnt have to answer the firstman at all anything he said gave the other man a greater hold on him he needed a moment to realize he now had a greater hold on waddo too realizing it brought him little joy to use that hold he would have to betray waddo to the algarvians he couldnt imagine anything that would make him want to do that no matter how much he despised the firstman he loathed the invaders far more may next spring and summer be better waddo said aye garivald repeated he started to look back toward the woods in which hed met the unkerlanter soldier but checked himself before the motion was well begun he didnt want waddo wondering why his eyes went that way he revealed as little to the firstman as a fellow cheating on his wife told her waddo limped closer he spoke in a hoarse whisper when the ground gets soft well dig up that crystal and get it out of here aye garivald said for the third time now with real enthusiasm the farther the better as far as im concerned getting the crystal away from zossen would reduce the danger that hed wind up on the end of a rope maybe waddo said softly just maybe we can even activate it again and get word back to cottbus of whats going on in these parts now garivald stared at him as if hed gone crazy whose throat will you slit to power it he demanded not mine by the powers above no of course not yours the firstman said twisting his fingers into the gesture people used to turn aside words of evil omen whose then garivald persisted with peasant common sense itd have to be someones were not close to a ley line were not close to a power point either theyre few and far between in these parts i know i know waddo sighed maybe we could draw enough life energy from sacrificing animals they used to do that in the old days if you believe the stories the grannies tell we might i suppose but garivald remained unconvinced if cottbus thought we could power a crystal with animal sacrifices why did they send us captives to kill and guards to kill em to keep the thing going the firstman sighed i hadnt thought of that he admitted all right maybe we cant make it work but we can get it out of here and bury it in the woods somewhere so the algarvians dont stumble over it that would be good garivald said i already told you that would be good i dont want the cursed thing around here anymore than you do unlike waddo hed never wanted the crystal in zossen hed liked living in the middle of nowhere that let him pass his life with only minimal interference from the grasping hands of everyone who served his king but the algarvians had grasping hands too and they werent just trying to seize his crops they wanted his land and his village and everything he and everybody else had they wanted unkerlant all of it he could see that anyone who couldnt anyone who couldnt had to believe raniero was the rightful king of grelz once the crystal got out to the woods if it did he might be able to let some of the men the algarvians called brigands know it was there they could likely find a way to use it maybe they would cut a few redheads throats or maybe they would cut the throats of a few unkerlanter traitors instead he nodded one way or another he judged they could do the job aye he said to waddo when the ground turns soft well dig it up and get it into the woods then we wont have to worry about it anymore but the algarvians will he thought raunu swung the hoe lopped the stalk off a weed in merkelas herb garden and chuckled im getting good at this business the veteran sergeant said never thought i would i was a town boy my mother made sausages and my father hawked em through the streets so did i before i got sucked into the army in the middle of the six years war skarnu was also weeding and you stayed in thats right raunu nodded he was more than twenty years older than skarnu but probably stronger and certainly tougher once the fighting got done it was easier work for better pay than id had before easier than farm work skarnu asked beheading a weed himself in between wars sure raunu answered and i was good at it too by the powers above it took me awhile but i got as high up as a fellow like me was ever going to get in the army as a commoner was ever going to get he meant hed spent thirty years serving valmiera and had risen to sergeant and no higher skarnu had joined the army with no experience and immediately became a captain but then he was a marquis as he wouldnt have before the war he wondered if the rank and file of the valmieran army would have fought harder against algarve had a few very able menhis mind reached no further than thathad the chance to become officers merkela came out of the slateroofed farmhouse she surveyed the weeding efforts of the two soldiersturnedfarmers with something less than full approval taking the hoe from skarnu she slaughtered a couple of weeds he and raunu had both missed then she returned it with a flourish like a drill sergeant showing a couple of raw recruits how a stick ought to be handled raunu snickered skarnu felt faintly embarrassed ill never get the hang of farm work he muttered youre better than you were when you first came here merkela said an endorsement of sorts but not a ringing one then her whole manner changed leaning forward she asked are we going to do it tonight raunu snickered again in a different way skarnu knew merkela didnt mean taking her up to her bedchamber and making love to her he might do that too but only afterwards aye he said we are people have to know that collaborating with the algarvians has a price anyone who has anything to do with the algarvians ought to pay the price merkela declared skarnu wondered about that where did you draw the line between simply going on with your daily life and collaborating with the redheads was a tailor a collaborator if he made the occupiers tunics and kilts was the chap who steered a leyline caravan a collaborator if he took algarvians around priekule maybe not but what if he took them in the direction of fighting what then questions were easy answers less so merkela didnt care to look so hard she had her answers sometimes skarnu envied her certainty seeing the world in black and whiteor redhead and blondwas simple and required next to no thought he shrugged in broad outline they agreed he knew who the enemy was sure enough as if to echo that raunu said this negyus a bad egg no doubt about it he tells the algarvians everything he hears and everything his wife hears too and his daughters carrying a redheads bastard the little slut merkela added and she doesnt even have the decency to be ashamed i heard her bragging in the market square at pavilosta about all the presents her man gives her i bet she gave him one toothe clap no she didnt need to look hard to hate well take care ofem raunu said we ought to make it look as much like an accident as we can skarnu said blazing negyu didnt bother him blazing negyus wife and his pregnant daughter felt different even if they were as much hand in glove with the algarvians as negyu why merkela shook her head making her golden hair fly back and forth we ought to paint something like day and sunshine on their door to give the redheads something new to think about if we do theyll take hostages and theyll blaze them skarnu said that was why her husband gedominu was no longer among the living but she said the more hostages they blaze the more the people will hate them anything that made valmierans hate the occupiers was fine by her she looked to raunu for support since it didnt seem forthcoming from her lover but the veteran shook his head the more hostages they blaze the more people will fear them too the glare merkela gave him said hed betrayed her raunu stood up under it without flinching as a longtime sergeant hed stood up under more than his share of sour looks seeing that she couldnt sway him she flounced off raunu glanced at skarnu and muttered something under his breath skarnu could not quite make it out but thought it was better you than me sometimes farm work made the day pass swiftly sometimes the sun seemed nailed to one place in the sky this was one of those latter days skarnu felt hed been working for a week before he went into a supper of ale and cheese and a porridge of beans and sour cabbage and parsnips merkela was a good cook but not even her skill could make the bland supper very lively once it was done once shed washed the bowls and mugs and silverware she took gedominus hunting stick from its hiding place by the hearth lets go she said skarnu kept their sticksinfantry weapons that blazed heavier beams farther than the one merkela carriedhidden in the barn after reclaiming them they started south down the road toward negyus farm they were all ready to dive off the road and into the undergrowth to either side at the least hint of trouble the algarvians had declared a curfew after the murder of count simanu and did sometimes patrol the roads to enforce it about halfway to negyus farm the road passed through a wood of mixed elms and chestnuts they werent in leaf yet but they would be soon out of the darkness came a soft challenge king gainibu the column of victory skarnu repliednot the most original challenge and answer for valmieran patriots but easy for them to remember getting the right response four more men stepped out into the roadway after handclasps skarnu said single file down the road raunu youre the best of usyou walk point lets go do what needs doing they obeyed without argument to the farmers skarnu deserved to be obeyed because hed been an officer in jqng gainibus army they assumed he knew what he was doing raunu whod taught him everything he did know about fighting understood how ignorant he remained but hed given the right order this time and so the sergeant kept quiet the night was crisp but not so cold as it had been earlier in the winter it said spring would come even if not quite yet skarnu was warm enough and to spare in the sheepskin jacket that had been gedominus even if that jacket fit him worse than it might have as they drew near negyus farm raunu halted them all i can do is take us straight up the road he said one of you fellows whove lived here forever will know of some little deer track thatll lead us right to the whoresons back door without the algarvians ever being the wiser about how we got there that produced a lowvoiced argument between two of the locals each convinced he knew the best shortcut finally resentfully one of them yielded and let the other take raunus place at the head of the little column leave it to me the farmer said proudly curse me if i dont get you there all right maybe the powers above were listening harder than they were in the habit of doing in the middle of another dark stretch of wood a new challenge rang outthis one in algarvian skarnu and his men froze doing their best not even to breathe could he have done so in perfect silence he would have throttled their knowitall guide who going there this time the challenge came in bad willingly accented valmieran again skarnu and his comrades stayed perfectly still maybe the algarvians would decide theyd imagined whatever theyd heard and would go on their way no such luck after a muttered colloquy the men from the redheads patrol began moving toward the valmierans whod come to hurt their pet collaborator closer and closer came the footsteps though skarnu wasnt sure he could see the enemy soldiers who going there another redhead called no one skarnu thought loudly go away but the algarvians kept coming with a moan of fright one of the farmers whod joined raunu and merkela and himthe very fellow whod wanted and won the privilege of leading them to negyus farmbroke and ran naturally the algarvians started blazing at him as naturally the flash from their beams revealed to them that he wasnt the only valmieran out breaking the curfew those beams also revealed where some of the algarvians were merkela was the first to blaze at them a redhead fell with a groan take cover skarnu shouted to his followers and was proud that his yell came out a split second before raunus then raunu yelled something else reinforcements come in from the left for a moment that made no sense to skarnu who knew too well that he had no reinforcements then he realized the redheads didnt know he had none fighting by night was a terrifying deadly dangerous business every time anyone blazed he gave away his position that meant blazing and then rolling away at once before an enemy looking for your beam could send one of his own at you skarnu had done it at the front against algarve back in the dayshow distant they seemed nowwhen valmiera could hold a front against algarve he wished he knew about how many algarvians he was facing now not a company or anything of the sort or they would have rolled over his little band of raiders without a second thought his comrades and he had probably been unlucky enough to stumble across a patrol with about as many in it as they had but the algarvians curse them would be carrying a crystal theyd have more men here all too soon weve got to break away he shouted but he couldnt slide off into the woods by himself not without merkela and raunu keeping low keeping to what cover he could he scuttled toward where he thought they were softly calling king gainibu after a moment merkela answered column of victory then in no small anger she added you idioti almost blazed you well its not if youre the only one trying to he answered wed better find raunu and slide away we wont get to negyus tonight or any time soon no merkelas whisper held both ice and fire and how did they come upon us just when we were getting so close who let them know we were going to visit the traitor that hadnt occurred to skarnu on the battlefield hed worried about incompetence and cowardice not betrayal but merkela was right this wasor could bea different sort of war king gainibu from the darkness came raunus voice this time skarnu answered column of victory he went on we wont have a victory this time though wed better disappearif the redheads let us no arguments from me raunu said had he argued skarnu would have thought hard about staying and fighting but raunu only let out a glum sigh cursed bad luck we ran into that patrol bad luckor treason merkela asked as she had with skarnu raunu grunted almost as if hed been blazed like skarnu hed thought of war as a business where the sides were easy to tell apart skarnu realized hed have to do some new thinking after the dreadful weather and hard fighting hed gone through in unkerlant colonel sabrino found the mild air and bright sunshine above trapani a great relief an even greater relief was knowing that algarves enemies were all hundreds of miles away from the kingdoms borders pushed back by the might of king mezentios soldiersand by the might of his mages though sabrino did not like thinking about that so well he waved to the dragonfliers of his wing whod flown back to trapani with him then pointed down toward the dragon farm on the outskirts of the capital in good weather with no enemies close by he didnt bother using the crystal he carried hand signals were plenty good as they had been back in his greatgrandfathers days when men first began to master the art of flying dragons down spiraled the wing one after another the dragons settled to earth ground crewmen ran up to chain the fierce and stupid beasts to their mooring stakes that would keep them from fighting one another for food foolish for they all got plenty or for no reason at all even more foolish but then they were dragons sabrino undid his harness and dismounted his dragon was too busy screaming at the ground crewmen to pay him any attention ground felt good under his feet being home felt good too even if only for a little while the sunlight the color of the sky the green of the new grass that was beginning to sproutall seemed right to him at a level far below thought so did the smell of the air even if one part of the smell was the rank reek of dragonshit captain domiziano came up to sabrino saluting the squadron commander said good to get away from the front for a little while and id be the last to deny it still and all i wish we were going back soon powers above know the footsoldiers need the help of every dragon they can get in the sky above em we have different orders sabrino said and said no more about that he liked those orders no better than domiziano did instead he went on almost two and a half years since we flew our dragons out of here to fight the forthwegians i stood in the square below the palace balcony listening to the king declare war then hurried down here fast as i could go some way things have hardly changed since then others aye domizianos head bobbed up and down pride lit his handsome features then we were the oppressed the victims of the greed of the kaunian kingdoms now were the masters of derlavai that wasnt what sabrino had meant but it wasnt wrong either he didnt explain what he had meant he didnt feel like wasting time talking about it im going into the city he said i want to freshen upi smell like a stinking dragonand pay some calls we dont fly out of here till three days from now things shouldnt fall apart without me around till then oh no sir said domiziano who as senior surviving squadron leader would command the wing till sabrino returned good sabrino slapped him on the back then headed for the stables to commandeer a carriage to take him to a leyline caravan stop the dragon farm didnt lie on a ley line that could occasionally be a nuisance now though sabrino enjoyed the chance to relax as he headed toward town he was tempted to go to his mistress flat and freshen up there fronesia would be glad to see him since he paid for the flat and gave her lavish presents besides it was her duty to be glad to see him but he had duties of his own if he called on fronesia before he saw his wife gismonda would be furious when she found out and how could he blame her she would know hed go see fronesia later but that would be later he didnt want to hurt her pride and so with an inward sigh decided to keep up appearances after all trapani set as it was on a broad swampy plain in central algarve had never belonged to the kaunian empire no one could have guessed that by the public buildings though many of them were in the classical style most with the marble painted some left cool and white in the more modern mode in days gone by the algarvians had envied and imitated their kaunian neighbors no more the sharp verticals and extravagant ornamentation of native algarvian architecture seemed far more natural to sabrino than anything the blonds had ever built he hadnt sent a message ahead to let his household know he was coming he hadnt known he was coming till he got the order to bring his wing east and had had as few stops as he could manage since then he chuckled as he walked up to his own front door if the household couldnt stand a surprise every now and then too bad he grabbed the bellpull and yanked with all his might my lord count exclaimed the maidservant who let him in my lord count exclaimed one of the kitchen wenches who fortunately didnt drop the tray she was carrying toward the stairs my lord count exclaimed the butler who with gismonda ran the household when sabrino was away over and over sabrino kept agreeing that he was who he was my lord count gismonda said when he went upstairs with the kitchen wench this is an unexpected pleasure sabrino bowed and kissed her hand good of you to say so my dear he replied his wife was a handsome determinedlooking woman not far from his own age he respected her and liked her well enough as algarvian nobles went they had a tranquil marriage not least because neither pretended to be in love with the other with things as they are in the west i truly didnt expect to have you back in trapani any time soon gismonda said no she was anything but a fool i have new orders they take me out of unkerlant sabrino said his wife asked no more questions that was only partly because she understood that as a soldier he couldnt tell her everything more had to do with the polite pretenses and silences noble husbands and wives used to keep their lives tolerable gismonda turned to the kitchen wench fetch us a bottle of sparkling wine and two crystal flutes after the girl had gone sabrinos wife looked back at him and when did you come to trapani have you already gone to your mistress to shame me was what she meant she knew how he thought hed been wise to come here first indeed he had not an hour and a half ago he replied if you sniff you can smell the brimstone reek of dragon on me yet i want to make myself presentable before going to the palace gismonda did sniffand nodded satisfied will you take me to the palace with another bow sabrino shook his head would that i could but i may not i shall not wait on the king for pleasure but in connection with these orders i have got will he change them for you his wife asked i doubt it sabrino answered he trusts his generalsand hed better for if they arent to be trusted powers above preserve the kingdom but i hope he will let me see some of the sense behind them if any there be gismonda raised an eyebrow that let her know what he thought of things better for a hot soak sabrino changed into a fresh uniform one that didnt bear the effluvium of dragon then after a last nod to his wife he caught a leyline caravan for palace square the power pointin more ways than oneat the heart oftrapani walking into the palace he felt a curious sense of diminution anywhere else in the kingdom and he a count and a colonel was a presence of considerable consequence in the building that housed the king though the servitors gave him precisely measured bows less than they would have given were he a marquis much less than they would have given were he a duke his majesty is not receiving at present a gorgeously dressed fellow informed sabrino a reception is planned for later this evening however is your name on the list of invited guests your excellency not likely since i was in combat in unkerlant till day before yesterday but ill be there anyway sabrino answered had the palace official argued with him sabrino would have drawn the sword that was for the most part only a ceremonial weapon but the man nodded saying his majesty is always pleased to greet members of the nobility who have distinguished themselves in action if you will please give me your name sabrino did wondering how pleased king mezentio would be to greet him hed roused the kings ire by trying to talk him out of slaughtering kaunian captives to power sorcery against the unkerlanters mezentio had been sure that would win the war it hadnt no king was fond of meeting subjects who could say i told you so but there were other things sabrino wanted to tell mezentio and so he nodded his thanks to the splendid flunky and then left the palace to sup and drink a couple of glasses of wine before returning when he came back he wondered if the servitor had just been getting rid of him but no now his name was on the list of mezentios guests a serving woman whose kilt barely covered her buttocks led him to the chamber where the king was receiving he enjoyed following her more than he expected to enjoy talking with his sovereign flutes and viols and a tinkling clavichord wove an intricate net of sound as background to the gathering sabrino nodded approval as he headed over to get a glass of wine no strident thumpings here however civilized the kaunians claimed to be he couldnt stand their music goblet in hand he circulated through the building crowd bowing to and being bowed to by the other men bowing to and receiving curtsies from the women he wouldnt have minded receiving more than a curtsy from some of them but that would have to wait on events and besides he hadnt called on fronesia yet king mezentio seemed in good spirits his smile didnt falter as sabrino bowed low before him i greet you my lord count he said with nothing but courtesy in his voice but then he was sabrinos age or older hed had plenty of time to learn to hide what he thought behind a mask of policy i am very pleased to greet you your majesty though only briefly and in passing as it were sabrino replied bowing again briefly eh mezentio said he planned algarves grand strategy he didnt keep in mind where every colonel commanding a wing of dragons was going aye sabrino said my men and i are ordered across the narrow sea to help the yaninans in their fight with lagoas if your majesty will pardon my frankness i think we could do better fighting the unkerlanters i have pardoned your frankness before mezentio said now with an edge to his voiceno he hadnt forgotten their disagreement in unkerlant but i will also say that unless we keep the cinnabar that comes from the land of the ice people your dragons will have a harder time fighting anyone stubbornly sabrino said theres also cinnabar in the south of unkerlant across the narrow sea from the austral continent and i intend to go after it this summer too the king answered but i also intend to keep what i already have and to do that i have to prop up the yaninans on the other side of the sea he sighed since i see none in attendance here this very evening i can tell you the truth being allied to them is like being shackled to a corpse any joke a king made was funny by virtue of his rank this one actually amused sabrino bowing once more he said very well your majesty my men and i will do what we can to keep the corpse breathing a little longer that in turn made mezentio laughand when the king laughed everyone around him laughed too sixteen marshal rathar gnawed on chewy barley bread and knocked back a slug of raw spirits that made his hair try to stand on end under his fur cap the campfire by which he sat sent a plume of black smoke up into the air the unkerlanter soldiers with whom he ate had dug several holes close by in case that plume attracted a marauding algarvian dragon he swigged again from the tin canteen of spirits ah by the powers above that takes me back a few years he said to the men in rockgray sitting around the fire does me good to get back in the field it truly does i swilled this rotgut all through the twinkings war the breath it gives you you think youre a dragon yourself none of the youngsters said anything though a couple did risk smiles they saw the big stars on his collar tabs and couldnt imagine him as anything but a marshal they had no idea what getting older meant or how it could change a manthey hadnt done that yet hed been young and remembered what it was like he emptied the canteen then belched and thumped himself on the chest with a clenched fist that made a couple of more soldiers grin he could feel the spirits snarling inside his head getting back into the field felt so good getting away from cottbus getting away from the palace getting away from bang swemmel felt even better are we going to lick these algarvian whoresons right out of their boots he asked now the soldiers spoke aye it was as much a growl a fierce hungry growl as a word are we going to run em out of unkerlant out of the duchy of grelz here with their tails between their legs aye the soldiers repeated as fiercely as before theyd been pouring down spirits too asking unkerlanters not to drink was like asking roosters not to crow at daybreak officers did have some chance of not letting them drink too much are we going to show this socalled bang raniero that bang mezentio stuck on the throne that wasnt his to give away to begin with that wed sooner hang himor better yet boil him alivethan go down on our bellies before him rathar did his best to keep his tone light but worried even so some grelzers were perfectly content obeying a foreign oppressor no doubt because in the person of king swemmel they had been compelled to obey a domestic oppressor but the soldiersseveral of them grelzersshouted aye once more they were dirty and illshaven but theyd been moving forward ever since the weather got bad and there was nothing like advancing to put a soldiers pecker up rathar looked for the officer in charge of the unitlooked for him and didnt find him then he looked for a fellow wearing a sergeants three brass triangles on each collar tab sergeants had had to command companies during the six years war and sergeants had been worth their weight in gold in the desperate fight between swemmel and kyot some whod started as sergeants had risen high rathar highest ofall finding his man the marshal said tell me your name sergeant lord marshal im called wimar the fellow answered by his accent he was out of some village in the duchy of grelz well wimar step aside with me rathar said rising to his feet i want to know what you think about things and i hope youll give me straight answers ill do my best sir wimar said as he also got up he followed rathar away from the fire the eyes of the men he commanded followed them both rathar hid a smile no one would give the sergeant any back talk for a while not after the marshal of unkerlant asked for his opinions pointing east toward the front not too far away rathar asked what sort of shape are the algarvians in right now cold frostbitten miserable wimar answered at once they never once expected to have to do this kind of fighting youll know about that better than i do sir but they dont break to pieces powers below eat them you make the least little mistake against em and theyll cut off your dick and hand it to you with a ribbon tied around it uh sir by his expression he didnt think he should have been that frank by his breath hed had enough hed had enough spirits to talk before he did a whole lot of thinking im not angry rathar said theyve come too cursed close to cutting off the kingdoms dick sergeant and they may do it yet unless we figure out how to stop them once and for all any notions you have ill gladly listen to wimar needed a moment to believe what he was hearing at last he said i dont know how well fare when spring comes all the more reason to push hard now while we still hold the advantage dont you think rathar asked oh aye wimar answered we push them back now then see how far they push us back later king swemmel had demanded that the algarvians be pushed out of unkerlant altogether by the coming of spring that hadnt happened it wouldnt happen not a quarter of it would happen in the palace swemmel could demand whatever he pleased and it would be his at once here in the real world unfortunately the redheads also had a good deal to say about the business made bold by rathars forbearance wimar said ask you something sir forbearing still rathar nodded the sergeant licked his lips then continued sir can we really beat em aye we can the marshal spoke with great conviction we can but we have no promise from the powers above that we will the algarvians may have been too confident when the fighting started the dismal way some unkerlanter armies had performed would have gone a long way toward making them overconfident but he didnt mention that i think i can guarantee that the redheads wont be too confident this spring wed better not be either anybody who thinks anything against mezentios buggers will ever be easy is a cursed fool anybody wants to know the way it looks to me wimar said when he was expressing strong emotion his grelzer accent got thicker before rathar could answer the algarvians started tossing eggs into the area as if theyd decided to underscore the sergeants words rathar had huddled behind burning rocks when he went up to zuwayza to get that bungled campaign moving forward once more now he dove into a hole with a dusting of snow on the mud at the bottom he knew a certain amount of pride that he got in there before wimar could the sergeant cursed in disgust their tossers have been short of eggs lately they must have got a couple of caravans through an egg burst close enough to make the ground shudder under rathar be glad it was eggs and not kaunian captives he said as dirt rained down on the sergeant and him oh aye there is that wimar answered of course they might have brought eggs and kaunians both have we got any old folks and convicts ready to slaughter in case they did bring up some of those poor whoresonsor even if they didnt come to that every little bit helps is what folks say every little bit helps rathar repeated in a hollow voice wimar thought of his countrymen the same way swemmel did as weapons or perhaps tools in the struggle against algarve nothing more rathar wondered what the people the kings inspectors routed from their villages thought whatever it was it did them no good unkerlanter mages used their life energy as readily as the redheads stole that of the kaunians more eggs fell a heavier plastering than before wimar cursed again if i didnt know better id say the stinking redheads were getting their ducks in a row for a counterattack he said why do you know better rathar asked genuinely puzzled theyve done plenty of counterattacking this winter if they were going to counterattack i expect theyd already be killing kaunians the sergeant answered wed have to get out of this hole too itd be a death trap ah the marshal inclined his head i should have thought of that but you have more experience in the field against them than i do more than i want sirill tell you that wimar said before the marshal could reply cries rang out from the front the redheads the algarvians and another shout more alarmed and more alarming than the rest behemoths maybe mezentios men hadnt been able to bring any kaunians to this part of the line no matter what wimar had expected they were throwing themselves into the fight without much magic to back them up andrathar looked aroundthere were no unkerlanter behemoths anywhere close by all through the long hard winter in unkerlant the algarvians had lost a great many behemoths without snowshoes the beasts had trouble in deep snow some the redheads had killed when they couldnt keep up with the retreating footsoldiers to keep the unkerlanters from capturing them others had frozen still others had been lost in action mezentios men couldnt have very many more left down here in grelz because of all that rathar would have thought the algarvians would use the behemoths they had left with caution but doing things by halves was not the algarvian way when the redheads attacked they still came at their foes with as much panache as they had when the war was new peering out of the hole rathar saw half a dozen behemothsanimals that must have already broken through the unkerlanters first linebearing down on the company sergeant wimar commanded in the style theyd perfected algarvian footsoldiers followed the great beasts advancing through the hole theyd created mezentio the algarvians yelled as cheerful as if they were breaking into cottbus after all most of them wore white they were learning and algarvian dragons dove out of the sky dropping eggs ahead of the behemoths and spreading more chaos among the unkerlanters wimar turned to rathar sir if we dont fall back theyre going to trample us one of the things of which coming into the field reminded rathar was how fast everything could turn upside down you have my leave sergeant he said and if you think im ashamed to retreat with you youre daft he scrambled back from one hole in the snow to another several times spurts of steam rose from the snow not far away the algarvians were blazing at him he blazed back whenever he got the chance he thought he knocked down a redhead or two but he wasnt the only unkerlanter with a stick just when he was wondering whether the powers below were going to eat this whole stretch of line unkerlanter dragons came flying up in force they drove away the algarvian dragons and began to drop eggs on the enemys behemoths where nothing else had that made the big beasts slow down and let the unkerlanters bring up enough men to stop mezentios soldiers well we only lost a couple of miles here wimar said as twilight deepened could have been worse but it could have been better too if our dragons had got here sooner aye rathar agreed mournfully over and over hed seen how much more flexible and responsive than his own forces the algarvians were we need more crystals we need more of everything and we need it all yesterday too hed been saying that since the beginning of the war against algarve he wondered how long hed have to keep saying it and how much finding out would cost come on ealstan urged vanai if you wear a hooded tunic instead of your kaunian clothes no one at the performance will pay you any mind i dont want to wear forthwegian clothes she said and he could tell she was getting angry theyre fine for you but im not a forthwegian she stuck out her chin and looked stubborn im not a barbarian lingered under the surface of the words ealstan felt irritated too there were he was discovering all sorts of reasons why matches between forthwegians and kaunians had trouble but he was stubborn too and he had some notion why her thoughts traveled the ley line they did switching from his own language to kaunian he said i am certain your grandfather would agree with you thats not fair vanai snapped also speaking kaunian but then she paused as if trying to figure out how to put into words why it wasnt fair sensing his advantage ealstan pressed ahead besides you will enjoy yourself my brother would hold his breath till he turned blue to get into one of ethelhelms performances and this one will not even cost us anything vanais shrug told him he not only hadnt gained any ground hed lost some forthwegian music isnt really to my taste she answered he thought she was trying to sound polite but condescending came closer hes very good and hes sharp too ealstan said returning to forthwegian hed been casting his own accounts for a while till he hired me and he could have kept on doing it toohe has the skill he just couldnt find enough hours in the day id be about as interested in watching him do that as i would in listening to his band play music vanai said ealstan really did want her to come along he had one card left to play hed hoped he wouldnt have to play it but he did did you know ethelhelm is supposed to have a kaunian grandmother hed done some fishing in the mereflod the river that ran past gromheort and he could tell when he got a nibble he had one now no vanai answered does he really aye i think he does ealstan said with a solemn nod you cant tell it by his coloring but hes put together more the way a kaunian would be hes a little taller a little skinnier than most forthwegians he watched vanai she was intrigued all right do you think i could get out every once in a while if i wore forthwegian clothes every once in a while is probably about right ealstan answered but people will be paying more attention to the music at ethelhelms performance than to anything else i can get you a tunic if you like he didnt have to worry about precise size forthwegian womens tunics were always cut on the baggy side that was one reason forthwegian men leered at kaunian women in their closefitting trousers all right then vanai said abruptly ill go im so sick of staring at these walls andher eyes twinkledmy grandfather would fall over dead if he ever heard id got out of my trousersand no i dont mean like that having headed him offshe was learning how his mind worked tooshe added i still dont think ill like the music very much you may be surprised ealstan told her then he had to speak quickly before she could tell him it wasnt likely and youll be out and about in eoforwic she couldnt help but nod there on the way home the next evening he bought a plain green hooded tunic of medium weight vanai tried it on in the bedchamber when she came out into the front room she asked what do i look like we dont have a mirror big enough to let me get a good look at myself ealstan studied her even with her bright hair pulled back inside the hood and her face shadowed she didnt really look too much like a forthwegian woman but she wasnt so obviously a kaunian as she was in her own peoples clothing ealstan said i like your shape more when i can see it better of course you doyoure a man vanai said with a snort but will i do aye i think so he answered well be out at night after all and that will help just for a moment he let himself think about the dreadful things that could happen if someone recognized vanai for what she was were those things worth could they be worth risking all on an evening of music he wondered how foolish hed been in suggesting it to her even as he was worrying vanai said all right then ill go id do anything to get out of here for a while even wear this drafty tunic the second thoughts ealstan might have voiced flew out the window vanai went on and if going to a concert of forthwegian music doesnt count as anything i dont know what does they left for the performance later than ealstan would have done had ethelhelm not assured him of a couple of good seats the advantages of connections he thought back in gromheort his father had a lifetimes worth but he used them only sparingly so theyd be more reliable when he really needed them ealstan was glad to find the night cool lots of people wore their hoods up so vanai didnt stand out because of that she kept looking around she hadnt seen much of eoforwic before she started hiding in their flat there wasnt much to see no street lamps glowed no buildings had light streaming out through their windows unkerlanter dragons sometimes sneaked this far west the redheads didnt care to offer them nighttime targets at the hallonly an angular shape in the darknesshe and vanai had to pass through two black curtains before coming into the light when he finally did what seemed a sudden harsh glare made his eyes momentarily fill with tears he gave his name at the entrance vanai hanging back while he talked to the fellow there after checking a list the gatekeeper shouted for a flunky take these people down front he said theyre friends of the band ealstan preened he wished he could let the whole world see what a pretty girl he had with him unfortunately that would have let the whole world see vanai was a kaunian he took her hand and hurried after the impatient youth who led them to where they were supposed to sit here you go buddy the kid said to him and waited expectantly as soon as ealstan tipped him he hustled away the seats couldnt be better vanai said ealstan nodded two steps and they could have scrambled up onto the stage some of the halls where ethelhelm played allowed dancing this one with permanent seats fixed to the floor didnt ealstan waited for vanai to add something like now if only i wanted to see the show but she didnt a lot of people filling up the first row had more money than ealstan had dreamt of even when he was living back in gromheort where his family had been prosperous men wore furtrimmed cloaks jewels glittered on women some of those people gave him and vanai curious looks as if wondering how theyd managed to get the seats they had vanai kept tugging at her hood to show as little of her features as she could and then to ealstans relief the house lamps faded leaving only the stage awash in light the roar of the crowd packing the hall behind him washed forward when ethelhelm and his band stepped into the light the noise redoubled again one by one the men on trumpet and flute on viol and double viol began tuning up when the piper added his instruments whining drone vanai nodded bagpipes were part of the classical kaunian tradition too crouched behind his drums ethelhelm seemed shorter and more solid than he had striding out onto the stage but then he stood up again and used to good advantage the height his kaunian ancestry gave him stretching out his hands to the crowd he asked are you ready aye the shoutin which ealstan joinedwas deafening but ealstan noticed that vanai sat quiet beside him ethelhelm nodded to the rest of the band once twice three times he brought his drumsticks down hard as they went into their first song forthwegian music didnt have the thumping beat that characterized kaunian tunes neither was it one aimless tootling and tinkling noise after another which was how algarvian music struck ealstans ears strong and sinuous it had a power all its ownat least as far as he was concerned he couldnt see much of vanais face she still kept the hood pulled forward but the way she sat told him she was anything but entranced with the music he sighed he wanted her to enjoy what he enjoyed the first several songs the band played were old favorites one of them king plegmunds quickstep went back four hundred years back to the days when forthweg was mightier than either unkerlant or algarve hearing it made ealstan proud and worried at the same time this was the plegmund after whom the algarvians had named their puppet brigade now ealstan didnt want to know what vanai was thinking but after the quickstep was done ethelhelm grinned and called enough of the stuff they put your granddad to sleep with do you want to hear something new now aye this time the crowd roared even louder than it had when asking the band to begin again though vanai sat on her hands she stayed indifferent through the first couple of new tunes even though they were the ones that had put the band on the map but then as ethelhelm flailed away at his drums his voice went low and raspy as he broke into a brandnew song one so new ealstan had never heard it before doesnt matter the color of your hair doesnt matter the kind of clothes you wear doesnt matterbelieve me they dont care theyre gonna grab you and theyll send you over there the beat was strong and insistent about as close to a kaunian style as forthwegian music came people who wanted to could lose themselves in that beat and pay no attention to the words ethelhelm was singing ealstan almost did but only almost and vanai vanai leaned forward as if drawn by a lodestone she turned to ealstan he cant say that she exclaimed whats going to happen to him if he says things like that doesnt he think the algarvians are listening doesnt he think some of the people in here will tell them every word he sings hes mad but she was smiling for the first time in the performance she was smiling hes mad aye but oh hes brave i hadnt thought of it like that ealstan said but then he wasnt a kaunian or even part kaunian to vanai a song that said whether you were blond or dark didnt matter had to hit with the force of a bursting egg and such a song had to hit hard in eoforwic too forthwegians and kaunians had both rioted against the redheads here when the song ended vanai cheered louder than anyone though she stayed careful of her hood she turned and gave ealstan a quick kiss saying you were right after all im very glad i came setubal felt different from the way it had during cornelus last time of exile there then lagoas had been at war with algarve aye but hadnt seemed to take the fight seriously her navy and the strait of valmiera protected her from invasion and shed been looking east as well as toward sibiu and the mainland of derlavai fearful lest kuusamo spring on her back if she committed herself to the fight against mezentio it had been enough to drive cornelu and his fellow sibian refugees wild no more if lagoas didnt have an army fighting on the mainland she did have one fighting in the land of the ice people and she and kuusamo were assuredly on the same side nowand what had happened to yliharma made everyone in setubal shudder the algarvians could have attacked the capital of lagoas instead for that matter they could attack setubal yet maybe they were just pausing to gather more kaunians to kill it is good to see the lagoans worried cornelu said to vasiliu another exile as they sat together in the barracks assigned to sibian naval men whod managed to escape their kingdom it is always good to see lagoans worried his countryman answered they both chuckled neither with much humor lagoas had stayed neutral in the derlavaian war till the algarvians overran sibiu that rankled and though lagoas and sibiu had fought on the same side in the six years war they were old enemies and rivals being too much alike to make good friends lagoas however had for the past couple of hundred years been bigger and stronger to be just we should be worried here too cornelu said if these algarvians unleash their sorcery against setubal do you think it will spare us because we were born in sibiu nothing mezentio does is meant to spare sibians vasiliu snarled like cornelu like most from the five islands off the southern coast of algarve he had a long dour face a face on which anger and worry fit more readily than good cheer he was scowling now what i wonder is whether the happygolucky lagoans are doing anything to stop mezentio from serving them as he served yliharma i wonder if they can do anythingshort of slaughtering people i mean cornelu said and if they start slaughtering people how are they different from mezentios cursed mages how ill tell you how by the powers above theyre on our side vasiliu answered swemmel wont let the algarvians kick him without kicking back why should anyone else well all be monsters by the time this war ends if it ever does cornelu rose from his cot with training that had been enforced with switches during his cadet days he smoothed the blanket so no one could see the wrinkles his backside had made and the lagoans wont kill kaunians like mezentio and they wont kill their own like swemmel so what does that leave them a kingdom in trouble vasiliu said at once cornelu paced back and forth back and forth they ought to be able to do something he said though he knew that wasnt necessarily so sometimestoo oftenthere was no help for a situation the image of costache burned through his mind he wondered which of the algarvian officers quartered on her she was sleeping with he wondered if she was sleeping with all of them he wondered if he would have to greet a bastard or two when he came back to tirgoviste if he ever did vasiliu pulled him back to the hereandnow by bluntly asking what curse me if i know im no mage cornelu replied and if i were a mage with an answer id go to king vitor not to you he paused i knew a lagoan mage who might give me answers though if hes got any i brought him back from the land of the ice people on leviathanback if he doesnt give you anything you want after that visiting the austral continent has frozen his heart vasiliu exclaimed a ghastly place by everything ive ever heard and read what i saw of it doesnt make me want to argue with you cornelu agreed ill see if i can hunt up this fernao cornelu remained a puzzle piece that didnt fit after his longdelayed and unexpected return from tirgoviste till the lagoans figured out how they were going to try to get him killed next his time was his own he sighed as he left the barracks where the sibian exiles were quartered inside he had his own language his own countrymen outside was another world one where he didnt feel he belonged even the signs were strange aye lagoan was an algarvic language like sibian and algarvian but unlike its cousins it had borrowed heavily from both kaunian and kuusaman and swallowed most of the declensions and conjugations the other two languages used that meant cornelu could pick out words here and there but had trouble deciphering whole sentences he went up to a constable waited to be noticed and asked guild of mages he would have had no trouble putting the question in algarvian but that probably would have got him arrested as a spy whenever he tried speaking lagoan he had to hope he was making himself understood the kilted constable frowned then brightened oh the guild of mages he said to cornelu the lagoans words sounded the same as his own evidently they didnt to the constable the fellow launched into a long explanation of which cornelu got perhaps one word in five slowly he said in more than a little desperation for a wonder the lagoan did slow down in fact he began speaking as if to an idiot child no doubt that was patronizing cornelu didnt mind after two or three repetitions he learned which caravan line he needed to take to get to the guilds headquarters he bowed his thanks and went off to the cornerthree blocks up one block over as the constable had said and said and saidat which the leyline caravan would stop more ley lines came together in and around setubal than anywhere else in the world that was one reason why setubal was the commercial capital of the world but setubal had been the greatest trading city in the world even back in the days of sailing ships and horsedrawn wains it boasted a grand harbor the mondego river offered communication inland and the lagoans were not in the habit of disrupting their kingdom with internecine strife too bad cornelu thought sibiu would have been stronger if they were it was a relief when the caravan car came gliding up he didnt have to go on with such gloomy reflections he stepped up into the car threw a copper in the fare boxthe conductors watchful eye made sure he didand sat down on one of the hard not particularly comfortable seats ten minutes later he got off the caravan car and crossed the street to the grand hall of the lagoan guild of mages it was a splendid white marble building in uncompromising neoclassical style as were the statues in front of it had they and the hall been painted instead of remaining pristine they might have come straight from the heyday of the kaunian empire the splendor inside the grand hall proclaimed louder than words that the guild of mages had been very successful for a very long time when cornelu asked the first mage he saw in what he thought was lagoan how to find fernao the fellow stared at him in incomprehension then put a return question to him sir do you speak kaunian badly cornelu answered scholars kept it alive to use among themselves but he was a navy man and had forgotten most of what hed learned frowning in concentration he tried to ask the question in the classical tongue he was sure hed made a hash of the grammar but the mage didnt criticize him instead still speaking kaunian the lagoan said i think you had better come with me cornelu wasnt sure hed got that but then the fellow turned and gestured a language more universal even than kaunian instead of getting his question answered cornelu found himself conducted to a very impressive office with an even more impressive door at the moment closed sitting in front of it behind a desk wide as a ships desk was a cleverlooking man going through papers he looked up and exchanged words in lagoan with cornelus guide the lagoan mage turned back and spoke in kaunian sir this is brinco secretary to grandmaster pinhiero he will help you cornelu bowed my thanks hed spoken only a couple of words but brinco looked alert sibian he asked and cornelu nodded brinco switched languages saying you will speak algarvian then and cornelu nodded again this time so did the secretary good we can talk i read your tongue but cant claim to speak it and you have trouble with mine what is it that you want with fernao it does not have to be him your excellency cornelu began i am not an excellency brinco said grandmaster pinhiero is an excellency however you like cornelu answered but fernao and i have met each other so i thought i could ask him how you lagoans will keep algarve from doing to setubal what she did to yliharma it is a good question brinco agreed but fernao is not here to answer it he is with his majestys forces on the austral continent ah cornelu said he was there and came off and now is back i pity him all right sir since i have been brought before you i will ask you the question i would have asked him and hope to learn from your answer my answer is we are doing everything we can and we think it will help brinco said and my further answer is that i have no further answer i pray you will forgive me sir for pointing out that until my distinguished colleague brought you hither i had not had the honor of making your acquaintance even if fernao did mention you in the report he prepared on his return to lagoas you do not trust me you mean cornelu said slowly brinco inclined his head it grieves me to say that is exactly what i mean i intend no disrespect but i will not put my kingdoms secrets in the hands of those whose trustworthiness i know less well than i might like such is life in these troubled times i fear by his expression he half expected cornelu to take the matter further perhaps through seconds but the exiled sibian officer gave back the same sort of seated bow he had received you make good sense sir he said to brincos obvious relief lagoans have a name among us for loose talk lagoan women had a name for looseness toobut after costache cornelu preferred not to dwell on that he went on i am glad to see this name is not altogether deserved no not altogether brincos voice was dry we do the best we can may it be good enough cornelu said his best back home hadnt been good enough now he was back in the war for that at least hed been trained back in kajaani pekka wished shed never gone north to yliharma it wouldnt have made any difference of course the algarvians would have sorcerously assailed the capital of kuusamo even if she hadnt been there to try her experiment when she thought logically she understood that but logic went only so far she still had the pricklesonthebackoftheneck feeling that king mezentios mages had known what she was doing and timed their attack to foil her thats nonsense her husband said if theyd been after you then theyd still be after you they havent been so they werent leino was calm and logical excellent traits in a mageand an excellent mage he was too of a far more practical bent than pekka most of the time his solid good sense would have reassured pekka as it was meant to do now though it irritated her i know that she snapped up here i know it she tapped her forehead down here thoughshe rubbed her bellyits a different business wisely leino changed the subject when do you think youll be ready to run your experiment again i dont know she answered i just dont know ill need siuntio and ilmarinen to back me up and powers above only know when theyll both be able to get down here and even if they do her voice trailed away she looked unhappy things would be better if the fall of the palace up there hadnt caught prince joroinen wouldnt they leino asked gently pekka nodded that was part of what ate at her sure enough he was the one who really brought us all together she said he was the one who believed we could do it and who made other people believe it too without him our funds are liable to dry up she rolled her eyes without him im already starting to have trouble with the distinguished professor heikki again the mage who presided over thaumaturgical studies at kajaani city college was a specialist in veterinary sorcery the next new idea she had would be her first irked that she couldnt learn more about the work pekka was doing shed tried to cut off the theoretical sorcerers experimental budget prince joroinen had put a stop to that and made heikki remember for a moment that there was more to being a mage than attending departmental meetings with him gone the department head was already starting to reexert her petty authority before pekka could say anything more a crash from the other end of the house sent her and leino running to see what had made it they almost ran over their sonuto was coming their way as fast as they were going his he barely had the chance to assume his usual look of almost supernatural innocence before his father snapped what was that noise i dont know he answered sounding as selfrighteous as only a sixyearold could pekka took up the challenge well what were you doing in the kitchen nothing uto replied leino took him by the shoulder and turned him around saying thats what you always tell us and its never true lets go have a look everything looked fine till pekka opened the pantry door somehow or other a whole shelf had fallen down there with all the groceries on it and made quite a mess how did this happen she asked in tones of mingled horror and admiration i dont know uto repeated in tones like a silver bell youve been climbing again leino said you knew what would happen if you went climbing again of course uto knew of course hed never thought it would matter hed no doubt managed to convince himself hed never get caught no matter how often he did what he wasnt supposed to do amazing how much like grownups children are some ways pekka thought and now that he had been caught uto reacted just as an adult would have dont do it father he wailed recalling all too well the promised punishment ill be good i promise i will youve already promised leino told him you broke your promise after you made it thats not something kuusamans should ever do and so your stuffed leviathan will go up on the mantel for a week he started for his sons bedchamber no uto howled and burst into tears its not fair aye it is pekka said you didnt keep your word how can we trust you if you dont keep your word uto was paying no attention to her or to anything but his catastrophic loss i cant sleep without my tiny leviathan under my chin he cried how can i go to sleep without my leviathan he stamped his foot youll have to find out wont you pekka said evenly she dreaded putting him to bed without his special toy too but she didnt want him to see that maybe next time youll think a little more before you do something weve told you not to ill be good uto sounded as desperate as a bureaucrat caught with his hand in the till leinos footsteps coming up the hall announced the imminence of the tragedy ahead uto ran off to try to tackle him my leviathan following her son pekka wished her sisters husband had never bought uto the stuffed toy but if olavin hadnt given him that one he would have grown attached to some other stuffed animal he had a good many its over its done leino told him go back to your room till you can go around without snot and tears dribbling down your face i wont ever stop crying not ever uto shouted but off he went a silence as of a battlefield after the fighting has moved on filled the front room whew leino said and made as if to wipe sweat from his forehead im going to get myself a thimble of brandy ive earned it that could have been him crashing down as easily as the shelf you know i certainly do pekka said as long as youre heading back toward the kitchen pour me one too will you sooner or later ill think about putting the pantry to rights but not just yet noisy grief still came from utos room some of it was real some sent forth at the top of the little boys lungs to make his parents as unhappy as he was leino and pekka both ignored him her sister and brotherinlaw lived next door if they heard uto making a horrible racket they would figure he had it coming not that his parents were thrashing him to within an inch of his life leino came back with two shots of pear brandy he handed one to pekka then raised the other high heres to all of us living through another one ill gladly drink to that pekka said the pear brandy ran down her throat like sweet fire she glanced over toward the stuffed leviathan now lying dejected above the hearth and started to laugh but the laughter didnt want to come she was thinking not only of utos outburst but also of the disaster the algarvians had visited upon yliharma shed come through that and so had her sorcerous colleagues but far too many in the capital hadnt something of what was going through her mind must have shown on her face for leino said im glad you lived through that one and gave her a hug youre not the only one she said fervently she held leino for a moment just doing that not thinking about anything else but then even with his arms around her she shook her head so much work wasted if only theyd chosen to wait another day but they didnt and so she shrugged leino squeezed her again then let her go he still didnt know exactly what she was working on but had no trouble figuring out that it was something important he did his best to reassure her saying i still dont believe the algarvians know or care what youre about why she demanded how can you know any more than i can oh i dont know he admitted but i still dont believe it and ill tell you why look how many talented mages they must be using to forge the spells that use the life energy they release when they kill kaunians and their very best mages must be busy devising those spells how could they have anything much left to try to travel along other ley lines pekka pondered that slowly she nodded it makes sense she said but then checked herself it makes sense to me whether it makes sense in trapani i couldnt begin to say if the algarvians cared about what makes sense they never would have started slaughtering kaunians in the first place her husband said pekka nodded again but leino like a lot of kuusamans had the knack of seeing the other fellows point of view i suppose they thought theyd only have to do it a couple of times and then the war would be as good as won but it didnt work out that way no things too often dont work out the way you think they will pekka pointed down the hall thats what uto found out just now hes quieted down some leino said in no small relief he couldnt stay that loud for very long not even for his leviathan pekka said a good thing too or hed drive us all mad she cocked her head to one side listening hes very quiet i wonder if hes fallen asleep in there either that or hes getting ready to burn the house down and doesnt want us bothering him till after the fire starts leino sounded as if he were joking but also as if he wouldnt necessarily put it past his son pekka found herself sniffing when she realized what she was doing she made a face at her husband uto she called what are you doing in there nothing he answered as sweetly as he always did when he didnt feel like admitting what he was up to he wasnt asleep anyhow and he couldnt get into too much mischief in his own room or pekka hoped not she sniffed again no she didnt smell smoke someone knocked on the door as she wouldnt have done if she and leino hadnt been talking about the algarvians pekka looked out the window before she worked the latch no redheaded assassins stood out there on the snowy walk only her sister elimaki and olavin the giver of the stuffed leviathan they went back and forth with pekka and leino all the time elimaki took care of uto when the two mages worked too olavin had sharp eyes he spotted the leviathan on the mantel and said oh dear whats my nephew gone and done now tried to destroy the pantry leino answered he almost did it too cant have that olavin agreed youd need to borrow from me to put things right if he really did do the job he was one of kajaanis leading bankers maybe we could put uto up as collateral leino said pekka gave him a severe look that was going too farand pekka happened to know hed been a terror when he was a little boy too anyhow olavin said can you turn him loose long enough to let me say goodbye goodbye pekka and leino exclaimed in the same breath where are you going pekka added into the service of the seven princes her brotherinlaw answered theyre going to put a uniform on me fools that they are he shrugged id just get men killed if i tried to lead them in the field but i ought to make a decent paymaster i hope so anyhow dont listen to him when he goes on like that elimaki said hes so proud its a wonder his tunics still fit him she sounded proud too proud and worried at the same time a lot of people are serving the seven these days pekka said algarve might have done better to leave yliharma alone we would have got ready to fight slower than we are now leino set a hand on her shoulder the two of us have been in the service of the seven for a while now she nodded leino raised his voice uto come out and say goodbye to uncle olavin out uto came as sunny as if hed never been in trouble where are you going uncle he asked into the army olavin answered wow utos eyes glowed you have to kill lots of algarvians for me because im still too little ill do what i can olavin said solemnly elimaki squeezed his hand and didnt seem to want to let go pekka sighed she wished warshe wished everythingwere as simple as it looked through the eyes of a sixyearold child krasta was in a vile temper this morning krasta was in a vile temper a good many mornings had she tried to justify herselfunlikely since she was convinced she had a perfect right to her moodsthe valmieran noblewoman would have denied the peevish fury with which she faced the world was her fault other peoples failings inflamed her had those around her done betterwhich is to say done exactly what she wantedshe was convinced she would have been mild as milk shed always been good at fooling herself at the moment the failings exercising her were her maidservants the woman had had the presumption not to appear the instant krasta called bauska she shouted again louder and more sharply this time confound it where are you hiding get in here this instant or youll be sorry the door to her bedchamber opened in came the serving woman moving as fast as she could with a bulging belly that warned she would be having the baby inside before long here i am milady she said with an ungainly curtsy how may i serve you took you long enough krasta grumbled bauskas belly cut no ice with her not when a halfalgarvian bastard was growing in there said bastards father was captain mosco colonel lurcanios aide that left krasta half scornful half jealous bauskas algarvian lover was younger and handsomer than her own even if of lower rank i am sorry milady bauska dipped her head shed suffered through a great many of her mistress moods i was on the pot you see she put her hands on her swollen abdomen her smile had a wry edge to it seems like im on the pot all the time these days it certainly does krasta snapped she suspected bauska of camping on the pot so she wouldnt have to work she knew all about servants tricks well the wench was here now so krasta could get some use out of her im going to wear these dark green trousers today pick out a tunic that goes with them for me aye milady bauska said and waddled to the closet where krasta kept her tunics she had another one for trousers after pawing through them she held out two would you rather have the cinnamon or the gold left to her own devices krasta would have dithered for an hour maybe more fuming all the while faced with a simple clearcut choice though she was all decision the gold she said at once it plays up my hair she stepped out of the thin silk tunic and trousers in which shed sleptleaving them on the carpet for bauska to pick upand got into the more substantial daywear that done she let her maidservant brush out her shining blond locks after studying her reflection in a giltedged mirror she nodded she was ready to face the morning bauska hurried downstairs ahead of her to let the cook know she would want a cheeseandmushroom omelette with which to break her fast she wasnt wild about mushrooms she wanted them as much to annoy lurcanio as for any other reason like most algarvians he had no use for them at all she intended to dwell lovingly on them when she saw him almost as if she were a mushroommad forthwegian after the omelette and a slice of sweet roll stuffed with apples and a cup of tea she went into the west wing of the mansion she might as well have entered another world kilted algarvians dominatedmessengers bringing word of doings all over priekule clerks making sure those words went to the right official or file and soldiers and military police who turned words into action the redheads eyed her as she went byshe would have been disappointed or more likely insulted if they hadntbut kept their hands to themselves unlike those algarvian louts on the avenue of horsemen they knew without having to be told whose woman she was but when she got to the antechamber in front of colonel lurcanio s office the officer there was not captain mosco but a stranger you are the marchioness is it not so he said in slow careful classical kaunian and rose from his seat to bow i do not speak valmieran i am sorry to say do you understand me aye krasta answered though her own command of the classical tongue was considerably worse than this redheads where are uh is mosco the algarvian bowed again he is not here krasta could see that for herself her temper kindled before she could say anything though the officer added i am replacing him he is not returning what krasta exclaimedin valmieran for she was startled out of classical kaunian with yet another bow the algarvian said colonel lurcanio will be making it plain to you i am to tell you you are to go in to him he waved her through the antechamber bowing one last time as he did so even before lurcanio looked up from the memorandum he was drafting krasta demanded wheres captain mosco lurcanio set down his pen as the stranger in moscos place had before him he got to his feet and bowed come in my dear and sit down you are here and i am here and that is more than we can say for the unfortunate captain what do you mean krasta asked as she sat in the chair in front of his desk has something happened to him is he dead is that what that fellow out there meant ah goodyou made some sense of captain gradassos kaunian lurcanio said i wasnt sure how much you would be able to follow no mosco is not dead but aye something has happened to him he wont be here again i fear not unless he is luckier than seems likely did he have an accident did footpads set on him krasta scowled i hate it when you beat around the bush and if it suits you you hate it when i dont lurcanio replied still i will answer your questions no and no respectively although i suppose you might call what happened to him an accident a most unfortunate accident he has been ordered to the west you see to unkerlant what will he do about the baby when it comes krasta asked as always what affected her sprang most readily to her mind one of lurcanios eyebrows twitched sardonically i doubt that is the first thing on his mind right now the algarvian colonel said i only guess mind you but i would say he is most worried about not getting killed and next most worried about not freezing to death in all the time he has left over from that he may possibly give a thought to the little bastard yet to come on the other hand he may not too he promised to support that baby or we would let his wife know about the games he was playing krasta snapped if you think we wont do that lurcanios shrug was a masterpiece of its kind he will do as he will do and you and your wench will do as you will do he answered i dont know what else to sayexcept that should you find yourself with child do not seek to play these games with me krastas head came up are you saying you have no honor honest of you to admit it lurcanio got to his feet and set his hands on the desk leaning across it toward her he wasnt much taller than she but somehow made it seem as if she were looking up at him from out of a valley in spite of herself she shivered no one else she had ever met could put her in fear like that very quietly the algarvian said if you are foolish enough to speak such words again you will regret them to your dying day do you understand me he is a barbarian krasta thought that brought with it another shiver of fright with the fright not for the first time came a surge of desire the bedchamber was the only place where she had any control over lurcanio though even there she had less than she would have liked less than she would have had with most men luckily for the way she thought of herself the idea that she amused her algarvian lover never once entered her mind do you understand me lurcanio asked more softly still aye she said with an impatient nod and turned away lurcanio had a wife krasta knew that the woman probably amused herself back in algarve the same way as her husband was doing here in priekule algarvian slut krasta thought and did not dwell on what others might call her for lying with lurcanio well then is there anything else lurcanio said now in the tones he used when he wanted to get back to his work instead of answering krasta walked out of his office he didnt laugh to speed her going as hed been known to do instead he seemed to forget about her as soon as she started to leave an even more daunting dismissal she strode past captain gradasso he tried to put some compliments into classical kaunian she didnt stay to listen to them with a sigh of relief she returned to the part of the mansion that still belonged to her and her retainers when she saw bauska she frowned but the frown didnt last long here after all was another chance to pay back the maidservant for bedding the redhead she would have preferred to the one she had of course now she would have to maintain the brat after it was born but still come here she called i have news for you what is it milady bauska asked your precious captain is off getting chilblains in unkerlant krasta answered bauska had always been very fair since getting pregnant shed become paler yet she was not one of those women who glowed because of the new life within them now she went white as the wall behind her no she whispered oh aye krasta said dont you dare faint on me either theres too much of you to catch i have it straight from lurcanio and he has himself a new aide a fiddlefaced son of a whore who mumbles in the ancient language if you plan on taking this fellow to bed too youll need to bring along a lexicon that did make bauska turn red milady she cried reproachfully theyve sent mosco off to be killed and thats all you can say krasta disliked any histrionics but her own maybe hell come back after the algarvians finally beat unkerlant she said trying to calm the servant or at least make her shut up bauska astonished her by laughing in her face if the algarvians were going to beat unkerlant just like thatthe serving woman snapped her fingerswhy do they all dread being sent west so much why because they arent lucky to stay in priekule anymore of course krasta answered bauska rolled her eyes if she hadnt been carrying a baby krasta would have hauled off and belted her for her insolence as things were it was a nearrun thing get out of my sight the noblewoman snarled and bauska lumbered away staring after her krasta muttered a curse what a ridiculous notion that the algarvians might not win the derlavaian war if theyd beaten valmiera they would surely smash the unkerlanter savages wouldnt they to hold sudden confusion and worry away krasta shouted for her driver and headed off to the boulevard of horsemen to shop spring came early up in bishah the only real mark of it was that the rain that came occasionally during fall and winter stopped altogether the weather would have done for high summer in more southerly lands but the breezes that blew down off the hills and onto the capital of zuwayza promised far more heat ahead hajjaj knew the promise would be kept too he had at the moment other sorts of heat with which to contend he had eaten sweet cakes with king shazli drunk date wine and sipped delicately fragrant tea that meant that by zuwayzi custom old as time the king could at last begin talking business and shazli did demanding what are we to do now the zuwayzi foreign minister wished his sovereign would have chosen almost any other question but shazli was still a young manonly about half hajjajs ageand sought certainty where his minister had long since abandoned it with a sigh hajjaj answered your majesty our safest course still appears to be the one we are following king shazli reached up and tugged at the golden circlet he wore to mark his rank it was his only mark of rank it was but for some other jewelry and his sandals his only apparel shifting among the cushions on which he lolled he said this leaves us still shackled to algarve aye your majesty it does hajjajs mouth twisted he liked that no better than did the king but our only other choice is to be shackled to unkerlant and king mezentios chains are longer and looser than the ones king swemmel would have us wear curse it we are zuwayzinfree men shazli burst out our ancestors did not suffer themselves to be tied to other kingdoms why must we that was the heroic version of zuwayzi history hajjaj too had grown up hearing minstrels and bards sing of it but when he had grown up zuwayza was a provincea disaffected province aye but a province nonethelessof unkerlant later hed gone to an excellent university in trapani and had got a different view of how and why things had gone as they had for his people your majesty our clan chiefs love freedom so well even now they grudge bending the knee to you he said they would sooner fight among themselves than listen to anyone who tells them they must not that of course is how unkerlant was able to conquer us when one clans holdings fell the other chiefs did not join together against the foe but often laughed and cheered to see their neighbor and old enemy beaten i am not sure i see your point shazli said it is very simple your majesty the foreign minister said by trying to hold on to too much freedom our ancestors lost all they had they were so free they ended up enslaved we now have less freedom than we might like but less freedom than we might like is better than no freedom at all ah the king smiled you are at your most dangerous i think when you speak in paradoxes am i hajjaj shrugged we are still free enough to make choices about who our friends should be things could indeed be worse as you say we might have no choices left to call our own and we have taken back all the land the unkerlanters stole from us when they conveniently forgot about the treaty of bludenzand more besides to make the revenge sweeter still aye for the time being we are victorious shazli stretched out a long slim forefinger to point at his foreign minister but if you were so proud of our victories as all that would you have tried to pull us out of the war our victories depend on algarves victory hajjaj replied true algarve makes us a better ally than unkerlantwere farther from trapani than we are from cottbus after all if i had a choice though i would sooner not be bound to a pack of murderers that is why i tried to escape shazlis laugh was bitter as the beans zuwayzin sometimes chewed to stay awake weve picked the wrong war for principle havent we king mezentio slaughters his neighbors king swemmel slaughters his own hardly a pretty choice facing us is it no and i rejoice that you understand as much your majesty hajjaj said respectfully inclining his head toward his sovereign since principle is deadsince principle was murdered to power magecraftall we can do is look out for ourselves that we have done as well as we are able king shazli nodded the kingdom is in your debt your excellency without your diplomacy unkerlant would still be occupying much that is oursand would have taken more in the fighting you are gracious to me beyond my deserts hajjaj said modest as any sensible man would be at praise from his king and you hajjaj you are one of the largest pillows lying beneath the monarchy shazli said i know it as my father knew it before me other derlavaians would have spoken of pillars not pillows hajjaj far more cosmopolitan than most of his countrymen understood as much his years at the university in algarve and his travels since sometimes made him look on zuwayzas customs as an outsider he could see foibles other zuwayzin took for granted but so what he thought it wasnt as if foreigners had no foibles of their own shazli said we continue then and hope algarve triumphs so that our own advances are not written on sand an algarvian or a man from the kaunian kingdomslikely an unkerlanter toowould have said written on water but water in zuwayza was scarce and precious while the sunblasted desert kingdom had an enormous superabundance of sand hajjaj shook his head he was woolgathering again he did it more and more as he got older and hated it was it the first sign of drifting into senility he dreaded that more than the physical aches and pains of old age to be trapped inside a body that would not die while he forgot himself one piece at a time he shuddered and he was woolgathering again this time about woolgathering vexed he gave the answer that should have come sooner if the powers above were kind we would watch from the north until the last algarvian and the last unkerlanter beat in each others heads with clubs his shrug was mournful life is seldom so convenient as we would wish there your excellency you touch on a great and mysterious truth one that holds even for kings shazli said he got to his feet a sign he had given hajjaj all the time he intended to spare today grunting his knees clicking the foreign minister also rose and bowed to the king as kings went these days shazli was a good sort not a sharptempered martinet like mezentio much less a tyrant fearful of his own shadow like swemmel but then the clan chiefs of zuwayza ceded fewer powers to their kings than did the algarvian nobles while the old unkerlanter nobility these days was largely deceased replaced by upstarts swemmel had so much power because no one around him had any after formal farewells that used up another quarter of an hour hajjaj made his way through the corridors of the palace to the foreign ministry the building was as cool a place as any in bishah its thick walls of sundried brick could challenge even the zuwayzi climate nothing new to report to you your excellency hajjajs secretary qutuz said when the foreign minister poked his head into his office i thank you hajjaj replied he eyed qutuz a solid professional with a wariness he hoped he kept covert hed trusted the mans predecessor whod proved to be in the pay of unkerlant no matter how well his new secretary performed hajjaj knew he would be far slower in warming to him if he ever did he said so long as things are quiet i think i shall knock off early for the afternoon would you be so good as to summon my driver of course your excellency qutuz said before long hajjajs carriage was rolling up a narrow twisting road into the hills above bishah houses perched here were young fortresses dating back to the days when any clans hand was likely to be raised against its neighbor hajjajs home was no exception to the rule back in the days before mages learned to liberate great blasts of sorcerous energy it could have stood siege for months even now his large household included gate guards no telling when some local lord might try to settle a score that had simmered unavenged but unforgotten for half a dozen generations after the guards let the carriage roll through the entranceway hajjajs majordomo tewfik came waddling up to meet him hello there young fellow tewfik said bowing to hajjaj he was the only man alive entitled to greet the foreign minister thus he had been in the household longer than hajjaj had been alive hajjaj thought he was about eightyfive but he might have been older as surely as hajjaj ran zuwayzas foreign affairs tewfik ran hajjaj s domestic ones returning the majordomos bow hajjaj asked and how are things here well enough lord tewfik answered with another creaking bow of his own his back didnt bend very far these days peaceful one might even say now that that woman is no longer here that woman lalla had until recently been hajjajs juniormost wife a pretty amusement with whom to while away some time every now and then shed become an increasingly willful and expensive amusement finally to the relief of everyone else in the household shed become too expensive and willful for hajjaj to stand anymore and hed sent her back to her own clanfather formerly respected for her position shed become that woman in the blink of an eye tewfik said the lady kolthoum will be glad to see you your excellency and i of course am always glad to see my senior wife hajjaj answered why dont you run along ahead and let her know i will attend her shortly aye and off tewfik went not running but plenty spry for a man of his years hajjaj followed more slowly through the buildings and courtyards and gardens that filled the space within the households outer wall kolthoum would be irked if he didnt give her enough time to prepare herself and to ready refreshments for him when he did step into her chamber she was waiting with tea and wine and cakes as hed known she would be he embraced her and gave her a peck on the lips they rarely slept together these days the scrawny diplomat and his large comfortable wife but they were unfailingly fond of each other kolthoum understood him better than anyone else alive save possibly tewfik is it well she asked him as usual cutting straight to the heart of things it is as well as it can be he answered his senior wife raised an eyebrow and how well is that hajjaj considered i simply dont know right now ask me again in a few months and i may have a better notion you dont know kolthoum said hajjaj shook his head kolthoum raised both eyebrows powers above help us this time hajjaj nodded seventeen home vanai shook her head this isnt home ealstan its halfway between a trap and a cage she watched in dismay as ealstans face closed she was sick and tired of being cooped up and he was getting sick and tired of listening to her complain about it he said you didnt have to come with me you know oh but i did she answered my grandfathers house was a cage oyngestun was a trap i still do feel trappedshe was too proud to pretend not to have the feelings she hadbut at least the company is better when youre here with me that won a smile from her forthwegian lover only reason im not here more is because im working all the cursed time he answered my father would always say the best bookkeepers were mostly here in eoforwic because the capital is where the money is he usually knows what hes talking about but i think he was wrong this time if the bookkeepers here were so fine there wouldnt be so many people who wanted to hire me i dont know about that vanai said maybe youre better than you think he looked very young then and very confused as if he wanted to believe that but didnt quite dare my father is that good he said me he shrugged and shook his head i know how much i dont know vanai laughed at him but do you know how much the other bookkeepers in eoforwic dont know she watched him work his way through that it would be nice to believe that but i really dont he said then why does ethelhelm want you to keep his books for him vanai countered using the singers name because ealstan set such stock in him she set more stock in ethelhelm than shed expected not because of the kaunian blood he might have but for the forthwegian songs he wrote and sang but her question didnt have quite the impact for which shed hoped why ill tell you why ealstan answered because the fellow who used to cast accounts for him walked in front of a leyline caravan and got himself squashed thats why thats why ethelhelm was doing his own bookkeeping for a bit too but he just didnt have the time to keep on he got up from the table and stretched something crackled in his back ahh thats better he said i spend all my time on a stool bending over ledgers vanai was about to offer him the chance to spend some time in an altogether different position when she saw movement down on the street she went to the window for a better look algarvian constables she said over her shoulder to ealstan what are they doing he asked and then coming up behind her set a hand on her shoulder and drew her away from the grimy panes of glass let me lookit wont matter if they see me here she nodded and stepped back ealstan did his best to take care of her he stood there his wide back to her looking down well she asked at last theyre putting up broadsheets he said i cant make out what the sheets say not from up here once theyve gone on ill go downstairs and have a look all right vanai nodded all at once with the constables passing through the flat was a refuge once more maybe theyre just more recruiting sheets for plegmunds brigade those at least didnt have anything directly to do with her but ealstan shook his head they dont look like them he said the sheets for plegmunds brigade always have pictures on them so the people who are too stupid to read can figure out what theyre about these are nothing but words i can see that much he turned away from the window toward her dont worry about it sweetheart everything will be fine he didnt really believe that she could see as much by the lines deep past his years that were carved into the skin by the corners of his mouth she could also see he didnt really expect her to believe it either but he said it anyhow in the hope however forlorn it would make her feel better and his caring for her feelings did make her feel better even if she didnt think everything would be all right she stepped up and gave him a hug he hugged her too and kissed her one of his hands closed on her breast when major spinello had done that all vanai had wanted to do was tear herself away now though ealstan was doing the same thing her heart beat fast and she molded herself against him it was if you looked at it the right way pretty funny warmth flowed through her but when she started to go back toward the bedchamber ealstan didnt come along instead he returned to the window theyve gone down the street he said i can go down and look at the broadsheets without drawing any noticeplenty of people coming out to see what the latest nonsense is go on then vanai answered putting business ahead of pleasure was like ealstan right at the moment she wasnt sure she liked that so well ill be back in a minute he said and then something sparked in his eyes he hadnt forgotten her not at all good well better she waved toward the door but when he did come back his face was as grim as vanai had ever seen it any thoughts of making love right then flew out of her head what have the algarvians gone and done she asked dreading the answer theyre ordering all kaunians to report to the kaunian quarter here in eoforwic ealstan answered theyre all supposed to live there and nowhere else in town anybody who brings in word of one who hasnt reported to the kaunian quarter gets a rewardthe broadsheet doesnt say how much vanais voice went shrill with alarm you know why theyre doing that of course i do ealstan replied with all the kaunians in one place the redheads wont have to work so hard to round your people up and ship you west whenever they need some more some more to kill vanai said and ealstan nodded she turned away from him what am i going to do she wasnt asking ealstan she was asking the world at large and the world had long since shown that it didnt care whether shed asked him or not ealstan answered well youre not going into the kaunian quarter and thats flat out here youve got a chance in there forget it a price on my head vanai said wonderingly she giggled though it wasnt funnyperhaps because it wasnt funny what am i a famous highwayman youre an enemy of the kingdom of forthweg ealstan told her thats what the broadsheet says anyhow vanai laughed louder because that was even less funny than the other im an enemy of the kingdom she exclaimed i am who beat the forthwegian army last i looked it was the algarvians not us kaunians a lot of forthwegians will forget all about that though ealstan said bleakly cousin sidroc would i think maybe uncle hengist too kaunians have always been easy to blame of course we are vanai didnt try to hide her bitterness she might almost have been speaking to another kaunian as she went on there are ten times as many forthwegians as there are of us that makes us pretty easy to blame all by itself aye it does though not all of usealstan didnt forget he was a forthwegianfeel that way about kaunians slowly vanai nodded she knew how ealstan felt about her but from everything hed said his father and brother would never have done anything to harm kauniansand neither of them had fallen in love with one following that thought along its ley line brought fresh alarm to vanai what will the redheads do to anyone who helps hide kaunians outside the quarter ealstan looked unhappy maybe hed hoped that wouldnt occur to her the hope was foolish the algarvian edict would surely be plastered all over the news sheets too reluctantly he answered there is a penalty for harboring fugitivesthats what they call it the broadsheet doesnt say what it is whatever the algarvians want it to be thats what vanai predicted and ealstan had to nod she pointed at him as if the broadsheet were his fault and now youre going to be in danger on account of me that seemed even worse than her being in danger herself ealstan shrugged not many people know youre here im not sure the landlord does and thats a good thinglandlords are a pack of conniving doubledealing whoresons and theyd do anything to put another three coppers in their belt pouches in their pockets vanai would have said but the long tunics forthwegians wore didnt come with pockets she wondered how he spoke with such assurance about landlords having lived at home all his life till fleeing after the fight with his cousin she was about to twit him on that when she remembered he was a bookkeeper and the son of a bookkeeper for good measure he would know more about landlords and their habits than she might have guessed he went on i dont know if well be able to get you to any more of ethelhelms performances or anything like that when he said he didnt know if shed be able to go out he meant he knew perfectly well she wouldnt vanai could see that even so she was grateful for the way he phrased it it left her hope and she had little else she looked around at the imperfectly plastered walls of the dingy flat aye they might have been the bars of a cage in the zoological garden youll have to bring me more books she said a lot more books brivibas had given her one thing for which to remember him kindly at any rate as long as her eyes were going back and forth across a printed page she could forget where she was that was not the smallest of sorceries not when this was the place she had to try to forget i will ealstan said id already thought of that ill scour the secondhand stores i can get more for the same money in places like that she nodded and looked around again aye this would be a cage sure enough she wouldnt even dare look out on the street so much as she had been doing lest someone looking up spy her golden hair get me some cookbooks she said if im going to spend all my time cooped up in here cooking will help make the days go by she pointed at ealstan youll get fat you wait and see i dont mind trying he said fattening me up wont be easy though not on what passes for rations these days something unspoken hung in the air between them ifalgarve wins the war none of this matters mezentios men wouldnt need their savage sorceries anymore after that but by then they would have got into the habit of killing kaunians and that as the history of her people in forthweg attested was a habit easier to acquire than to break there was one other thing she could think of to make time go by here in this little flat she went over to ealstan and put her arms around him come on she said doing her best to recapture the excitement that had been growing in her before the redheads ran up their broadsheets lets go back to the bedchamber trasone tramped through the battered streets of aspang the burly algarvian soldier looked on the devastation around him with a certain amount of satisfaction the unkerlanters had done everything they could to throw his comrades and him out of the place but theyd failed algarves banner of red and green and white still flew from flagpoles all over aspang so did another flag the gold and green of the revived kingdom of grelz trasone rumbled laughter deep in his chest when he saw a grelzer flag he knew the kingdom was a joke every algarvian soldier in aspang knew the same thing and if the grelzers didnt they were even stupider than he thought he snorted as far as he was concerned grelzers were just another bunch of stinking unkerlanters if you turned your back on them theyd stab you every couple of paces he looked around no you couldnt trust these whoresons not even in a town full of algarvian soldiers he strode out into the market square along with the rest of aspang it had taken a beating still merchants from the town and peasants in from the countryside had set up tables on which to display their wares if they didnt sell theyd starve and no doubt some of them took word of what they saw back to the unkerlanter raiders who never stopped harassing the algarvians behind their lines sausage a woman called to trasone holding up several grayish brown links good sausage he would have bet every copper he owned that she hadnt known a word of algarvian before the war how much he asked algarvian soldiers were under orders not to plunder in the market square though the rest of aspang was fair game the links looked better than what he was likely to get back at the barracks one silver four links the sausage seller answered thief trasone growled to start the haggling off on the right note he got his four links of sausage and paid less than half what the grelzer peasant woman had first demanded he strolled away happy that the woman hadnt dared dicker hard against an occupying soldier with a stick slung on his back didnt cross his mind had it he wouldnt have cared the bargain was all that mattered he hadnt gone far before he saw major spinello heading his way as best he could with sausages in his free hand he came to attention and saluted as you were spinello said the battalion commander eyed his purchase youre supposed to give these unkerlanter wenches your sausage soldier youre not supposed to take theirs heh trasone said and nodded thats funny sir even if the officer did go on and on about the kaunian girl hed been screwing before he got sent west hed done a good job with the battalion now he took off his hat waved it around to emphasize what he was about to say and then set it back on his head at a jaunty angle you ask me though these broads are too ugly to deserve any algarvians sausage that just made trasone shrug even ugly broads are better than no broads at all he said hed lined up for a go at a soldiers brothel a few times that wasnt the best sport in the worldfar from itbut it was better than nothing spinello didnt have to worry about standing in line officers brothels were a cut above what the regular troopers got even so he rolled his eyes ugly he repeated every cursed one of em is ugly when i was doing garrison duty back in that forthwegian town now and he was off on another story about the blond girl back in oyngestun trasone grinned as he listened spinello did spin a pretty good yarn if half what he said was true hed trained that kaunian bitch the way a hunter trained his hound of course everybody lied about women except women and they lied about men instead a few eggs started landing on the outskirts of aspang none of them very close to the market square swemmels boys are right on time spinello remarked other than that he didnt react to the eggs at all he had nerve think the unkerlanters are going to have another try at running us out of here sir trasone asked theyre welcome to try as far as im concerned spinello answered the way weve fortified aspang since we got driven back here they could send every soldier they have against us and wed kill em all before they broke in maybe that was true aspang had held out against everything king swemmels men had thrown at it so far but an awful lot of algarvian soldiers had died holding the unkerlanters out besides spinello went on waving an arm the snow is starting to melt for the next few weeks nobodys going to move very far very fastexcept to sink into the mud i mean aye something to that trasone agreed if unkerlant doesnt hold the record for mud im buggered if i know what does saw that last fall powers above if it hadnt been for the mud wed have made it into cottbus without even breathing hard spinello waggled a finger under trasones nose trasone scowled what did the officer know that would make him contradict he hadnt been in unkerlant then hed been back in forthweg happily boffing that kaunian slut but spinello turned out to know more than trasone expected lecturing like a professor the major said consider my friend the fall mud comes from the fall rains alone the spring mud comes not only from the rain but also from the melting of all the snow on the ground which do you expect to be worse as ordered trasone considered his lips shaped a soundless whistle well be in mud up to our ballocks he exclaimed deeper major spinello said but so will the unkerlanters till that mud dries out nobody will do much when it does well see who moves first and where and wont that be interesting again he sounded more like a professor than a soldier all trasone said was im bloody well sick of going backwards i want to be heading west again he cared little for the big picture much more for his own small piece of it if he was retreating algarve was losing if he was advancing his kingdom was winning head west we shall spinello didnt lack for confidence and he had his reasons too if you dont think our mages are more clever than the unkerlanters you need to think again aye trasone nodded then chuckled by the time this fornicating war is done there wont be a kaunian left alive and if that included the wench with whom the major had been fornicating trasone wouldnt shed a tear or an unkerlanter either spinello said the ones we dont slay king swemmels mages will i for one wont miss them nasty people homely people too when you get right down to it he drew himself up very straight we deserve to win for we are better looking did he mean that or was it one of the absurd conceits he liked to come out with every now and then trasone couldnt tell he didnt much care either spinello had proved he knew what he was doing on the battlefield so long as that held true he could be as crazy as he liked away from it he thumped trasone on the back go on enjoy your sausages off he strutted across the market square a cocky little rooster of a man trasone stared after him with almost paternal affection then with a shrug the veteran headed back toward the theater where his company was quartered these days the name of the play it had been showing before the algarvians overran aspang was still up on the marquee that was what somebody had told trasone the words were anyhow he couldnt speak unkerlanter and he couldnt read it either the characters were different from the ones algarvians used sergeant panfilo had some onions even more to the point he had a frying pan the company had stolen a little iron stove from a house near the theater issued rations had often got erratic during the winter when the soldiers came on food they wanted to be able to cook it before long a savory aroma rose from the pan one of the other troopers in trasones squad a skinny fellow named clovisio came over and stood by the stove watching with spaniel eyes as the sausages sizzled trasones rumbling stomach made him less than polite you think youre going to scrounge scraps off us you can bloody well think again he growled clovisio looked affronted as readily as hed looked cuddly and endearing a moment before my dear fellow i can pay my way he said he took a flask from his belt and gently shook it its suggestive gurgle brought a smile to trasones faceand to sergeant panfilos now youre talking the sergeant said he turned the sausages with his knife eyed them and lifted the pan off the stove i think were in business here the three of them ate sausage and onions and shared nips of the fiery unkerlanter spirits in clovisios flask thats not so bad trasone said chasing a couple of strings of fried onion around the pan with his own knife he slapped his belly blazes the stuffing out of meat hacked off the carcass of a behemoth that froze to death or meat hacked off the carcass of a behemoth that didnt freeze right away but had time to start going bad first clovisio said trasone grimaced and nodded he knew the sickly sweet taste of spoiled meat as well as any other algarvian soldier in unkerlant not to be outdone by his companions sergeant panfilo added and it sure blazes the stuffing out of going empty aye trasone said all three soldiers solemnly nodded like so many algarvians in unkerlant theyd known emptiness too trasone turned to clovisio anything left in that flask clovisio shook it again it still gurgled he passed it to trasone trasone sipped but didnt empty it instead he handed it to panfilo the sergeant took a sergeants privilege and tilted it up to get the last few drops for a moment the three men squatted there looking at the now empty frying pan trasone nodded as if in agreement to something nobody had actually come out and said thats not so bad he repeated a full belly a little something to drink nobody trying to kill us right this minute clovisio put in aye it could be worse panfilo agreed weve all seen that trasone and clovisio nodded they had indeed seen that even when its been as bad as it can be we get to fight back trasone said id rather be us than a pack of stinking kaunians in what they call a special camp waiting to be turned into fuel for magecraft id rather be us than a pack of stinking kaunians any which way clovisio declared the more of em we get rid of the sooner we lick the unkerlanters and the sooner we can go home home trasone spoke the word with dreamy longing he shook himself like a man reluctantly awakening i dont even remember what its like anymore or only just barely ive been doing this too long i know its real everything else he shook his head after a moment so did panfilo and clovisio leofsig didnt like the way his father was looking at him hestan drew in a long breath and then slowly let it out a patient exhalation that wasnt quite a sigh but why son he asked our family and felgildes have been talking about this match for quite a while now as you know full well her father is a merchant whos done well even in these sorry times joining elfsigs house to ours would benefit both he raised an eyebrow and felgilde dotes on you you must know that too oh i do father leofsig answered that sat alone together in the dining room leofsig kept glancing at the doorways and the courtyard to make sure sidroc and uncle hengist werent snooping for that matter he didnt want his mother or sister listening either he didnt want to be having this conversation at all his father though had put his foot down hestan seldom did that when he did he usually got what he wanted he said and i thought you were fond of the girl too oh i was father i am leofsig said fond wast exactly the word he would have used but it served about as well as the cruder equivalents that sprang into his mind well then hestan asked in what was for him a considerable show of annoyance why wont you wed the girl then you could he broke off but leofsig had a good notion of what hed been about to say then you could do whatever you want with her no leofsig said though he knew just what he wanted to do with felgilde and knew she wanted to do it too why not his father raised his voice something he did even more rarely than putting his foot down because i dont think its a good idea for me to marry anybody i cant trust not to go to the algarvians with word of where ealstan is and who hes with leofsig answered thats why and i cant curse it hestan didnt show surprise very often either oh he said now and then a breath later oh again its like that is it aye it is leofsigs nod was somber shes got no use for kaunians and shes got no use for anybody who has a use for them shes a sweet girl a lot of ways powers above knowhe remembered the wonderful feel of her hand on him but we already have too many in our family we dont trust with our secrets not everyone would put his brother ahead of the girl who might become his wife hestan inclined his head you pay me a compliment by making me think i may possibly have done something right in raising you i dont know about that leofsig answered with a shrug i do know there are plenty of girls out there and ive only got one brother he wondered where the girls he talked about were forthwegian girls of good family in gromheort were mostly spoken for as felgilde had been for all practical purposes some kaunian girls of good family were selling themselves on the streets these days the algarvians having prevented them from feeding themselves any other way leofsig sometimes found himself horrified and tempted at the same time his father sighed now im going to have to tell elfsig we cant proclaim a formal engagement and im going to have to make up some kind of reason to explain why we cant im sorry father leofsig said believe me i didnt want things to turn out this way if he could have married felgilde he could have taken her to bed with no scandal attaching to either one of them he envied his younger brother who hadnt let scandaldouble scandal since his lover was a kaunianget in his way i do believe you i remember what i was like when i was your age hestan said with a reminiscent chuckle leofsig tried to imagine his father as a randy young man he had little luck hestan went on but you have nothing to be sorry fornothing that has anything to do with me anyhow i already told you im proud of you he stroked his beard his eyes far away as he thought leofsig noted with a small start how gray his fathers beard was getting even if hestans hair stayed mostly dark that graying had all come since the war one more evil to blame on it well what will we do hestan murmured ill come up with something leofsig said his father shook his head no dont you worry about a thing your mother and i will take care of it one way or another well keep elfsig sweet or not too sour one way or another too tell him i picked up a disease in a soldiers brothel leofsig suggested thats what the algarvians spend a lot of time complaining about hestan replied with a snort of course since theyre the only ones who use their brothels they never ask who gave the girls the diseases in the first place with another snort he added no i think well find something else to say to the man who wont end up being your fatherinlaw but what leofsig was less inclined to worry or brood than his father or his brother but saying goodbye to the girl hed thought himself likely to marry wasnt going to be easy your mother and i will come up with something that will serve his father said firmly so dont you trouble yourself about it if you see felgilde on the street dont let on that anything is wrong all right leofsig didnt know how good an actor he was either he hoped he wouldnt have to find out then he yawned he wouldnt worry about it not till he got up in the morning thank you father he said as he pushed back his chair and got up from the table dont thank me yet not when i havent done anything hestan answered but i do think well be able to take care of this without too much trouble when hestan stumbled out to the kitchen the next morning to eat porridge for breakfast and take along the bread and oil and onions and cheese his mother and sister had packed for his midday meal he found his mother kneading dough for the days baking making bread from scratch was cheaper than buying it readybaked elfryth and conberge had been doing more and more of it since the redheads occupied gromheort the dough wasnt quite the right colorit would have barley flour in it as well as wheat at least it didnt have peas or lentils ground up with it as it would have when things were hungriest the winter before i think your father and i have found something to keep felgildes family from being too disappointed when we break off our arrangement elfryth said it will probably cost a little cash but what is cash for except greasing the wheels every now and then youve already spent a lot on me leofsig said around a mouthful of barley porridge he gulped the rough wine his mother had poured for him how many palms did you have to grease after i broke out of the captives camp that doesnt matter his mother said besides almost all the people we paid off then are gone now as far as the algarvian constables here these days know youre right as rain he didnt argue he didnt have time to argue he grabbed the cloth sack that held his lunch and a tin flask with more cheap wine in it then hurried out the door in the early morning light gromheort seemed almost as sleepy as he felt only a handful of people were out and about to hear the great burst of song with which the birds greeted the sun in springtime hardly any of that handful were kaunians except for a few skulkers the blonds were all packed into a neighborhood about a quarter the size of that in which theyd formerly lived algarvian constables patrolled the edges of that neighborhood and let out only the few kaunians who had leave to labor elsewhere road workers fell into that group so did streetwalkers leofsig waved to peitavas who was arguing his way past the constables the blond laborer waved back after the constables finally let him go he walked with leofsig toward the west gate you shouldnt treat me as if i were a human being peitavas said in his own language it will give you a bad character among your own people and with the redheads as if i were a human being kaunian could be a remorselessly precise tongue it was certainly better than forthwegian for putting across fine shades of meaning i do not call that contrary to fact leofsig said also in kaunian i know you dont peitavas answered that proves my point he said very little after that no matter how hard leofsig tried to draw him out and he made a point of climbing into a wagon different from the one leofsig chose leofsig muttered to himself what was he supposed to do if peitavas didnt want to be treated like a human being that the kaunian might have been trying to protect him never entered his mind by the time he got out to the work and especially by the time hed put in a full day breaking rocks and making a roadbed he was too worn to care he didnt go back to gromheort in a wagon with peitavas or any other kaunian and he was too worn to care about that either he came as close to falling asleep on the way home as hed ever done not only because he wanted to be clean but also in the hope that a warm plunge followed by cold water would revive him he did pay a copper and stop at the public baths not far from the counts castle he knew how tired he truly was when he realized he was standing under a showerbath from a perforated bucket without imagining the naked women doing the same thing on the other side of the brick wall dividing the building in two but one of those women he discovered when he left the baths was felgilde she was coming out of the womens exit still running a comb through her damp hair at the same time as he was going out through the mens door he pretended he didnt notice her that gave him a couple of heartbeats worth of relief no more for she called out leofsig as soon as she saw him oh hello felgilde he said doing his best to sound surprised he hadnt been so frightened since the battle when the algarvians smashed the army of which hed been a part not long after it began its invasion of mezentios kingdom uh how are you he had the bad feeling he would find out in great detail and he did i never want to see you again felgilde said i never want to talk to you again i never want to have anything to do with you again after all we did had she had a knife she might have pulled it out and used it on him the nerve of your father since leofsig didnt know just what his father had done he kept quiet whatever it was it seemed to have broken the notquiteengagement he stood there doing his best to look innocent hoping felgilde would tell him why he ought to look that way and why she thought he wasnt she didnt disappoint him the nerve of your father she repeated the dowry he asked for a duchess father couldnt afford to pay and your family has more money than mine anyhow she sniffed i can certainly see why your father would dive into a dung heap to bring out a copper in his teeth that should have infuriated leofsig it did infuriate him in fact but he wanted to seem contrite im sorry felgilde he said and some small part of him was by most forthwegian standards her views were normal and his strange when it comes to money no one else in the family can argue with him felgilde tossed her head well you cant have tried very hard since you didnt goodbye nose in the air she stalked off leofsig felt a pang watching her go but he also felt hed just had a narrow escape trying to hold that feeling uppermost in his mind he headed for home himself leave the word sang within istvan hed spent far too long either at the front or on garrison duty with never the chance to go back to his home valley and spend a little time there now at last he had it he vowed to the stars to make the most of it too hed been walking for hours at the groundeating pace hed acquired in the gyongyosian army from the depot at which the leyline caravan had left him no ley line came any closer to his valley than that now looking down from the pass he could see spread out before him the place where hed spent his whole life till gyongyos wars pulled him away he stopped more in surprise than from weariness how small and cramped it looks he thought the valley had seemed plenty big enough while he was growing to manhood in it he shrugged broad shoulders and started walking again his village lay closest to the mouth of the pass hed be there well before nightfall the mountains that ringed the valley still wore snow halfway down from their peaks that snow would retreat up the slopes as summer advanced on spring but not too far not too far even now istvans breath smoked as he trudged along snow still lay on the ground here and there in the valley too in places shaded from the northern sky elsewhere mud replaced it mud streaked with last years dead yellow grass and just beginning to be speckled with the green of new growth an old man his tawny beard gone gray was setting stones in a wall that marked the boundary between two fields a boundary no doubt also marked in spilled blood a few generations before he looked up from his work and eyed istvan then called who are you lada natural enough question when istvans greenbrown uniform tunic and leggings hid his clan affiliation and made him look different too i am istvan son of alpri istvan answered kunhegyes is my village ah the old man said and nodded be welcome then clansmate may the stars always shine on you istvan bowed may you always know their light kinsman he walked on but even as he walked he realized he spoke differently from the old man the accent of the valleywhich had been his accent till he joined the armynow struck his ear as rustic and uncouth his own way of speaking these days was smoother and softer in the army he still sounded like someone from the back country here in his old home though he would seem almost like a city man whenever he opened his mouth like any village in gyongyos kunhegyes sheltered behind a stout palisade so far as istvan knew his hometown remained at peace with the other two villages in the valley nor was the valley as a whole at feud with any of its neighbors still such things could change in the blink of an eye the lookout up on the palisade was in grim earnest when he demanded istvans name he gave it again and added you let me in this instant csokonai or ill thrash you till you cant even see the lookout who was also istvans cousin laughed and said you and what army but he didnt try to keep istvan out instead he ran down off the palisade and opened the gate so his kinsman could enter as soon as istvan came inside the two young men embraced by the stars its good to see you csokonai exclaimed by the stars its good to be seen istvan answered which made csokonai laugh istvan laughed too but he hadnt been joking plenty of times hed thought he would never be seen again not in his home village inside the palisade kunhegyes houses were as he remembered them solid structures of stone and brick with steep slate roofs to shed rain and snow and to make sure no stick could set them afire the houses stood well apart from one another too to make each more defensible despite that the place seemed crowded to istvan in a way it hadnt before he saw the wider world first the valley felt crowded and now the village looks too small he thought whats wrong with me you must be glad to be back csokonai said oh aye so i must istvan agreed vaguely though that had been the furthest thing from his mind well dont just stand there then his cousin said ill take you along to your housenot likely anybody elseu come along till i get back up on the palisade we dont get one traveler most days let alone two his laugh said he was happy to dwell in such perfect isolation istvan had been too he kept looking into shops and taverns was everything here really on such a small scale had it always been this way if it had why hadnt he noticed before it had been air under the wings of a birdthat was why hed never imagined things could be any different now that he knew better kunhegyes shrank in his mind like a wool tunic washed in hot water up the street toward him came a fellow ten years older than he a bruiser named korosi every so often hed made istvans life in kunhegyes miserable he still walked with a swagger but like everything else in the village he seemed to have shrunk istvan walked straight toward him not looking for trouble but not about to give way either in days gone by he would have yielded now korosi was the one who stepped aside he didnt even growl about it instead he said welcome home istvan may the stars shine on you and on you istvan answered half a heartbeat slower than he should have he glanced over toward csokonai his cousin seemed as surprised that hed got a friendly greeting from korosi as he was it must be the uniform istvan thought not realizing that he looked like what he was a combat veteran whod seen a lot of fights and wouldnt shy from one more csokonai pointed theres the house in case youve forgotten where you live now i am going to get back up on the palisade before somebody notices im not where im supposed to be and pitches a fit not know my own house not likely istvan said if you think im that stupid maybe i ought to knock some sense into your head csokonai beat a hasty retreat istvans own house strangely seemed as it should have to him after a moment he realized it had been shrinking for him as long as he could remember what had seemed immense to a toddler was just the right size once he had some size of his own being away hadnt pushed that process any further it had already gone as far as it could as with most houses in kunhegyes his had only little slits for windows but out of them floated the delicious smell of his mothers pepper stew spit poured into his mouth where so much seemed less than it once had the stew smelled even better than hed expected he hadnt had anything like it in a long time he hurried forward to knock on the door he heard shouts within a moment later he found himself staring at an older shorter version of himself father he exclaimed his father had been holding a boot and a length of leather lacing with which hed been repairing it now he dropped them both istvan he said joyfully istvans name produced more shouts farther back inside the house his father embraced him ah by the stars theyve gone and made a man of you have they istvan shrugged as he came inside im just me alpri his father had the same backwoods accent as everyone else in the valley istvan didnt know why that surprised him so much but it did people boiled forward to hug him and pound him on the back and tell him what a wonderful fellow he was his mother uncles and aunts his sisters cousins of both sexes a greatuncle leaning on a stick somebodyhe didnt know who pressed a beaker of mead into his hand he poured it down as soon as he did somebody else took it away and gave him another one he drank that one straightaway too mead wasnt the raw spirit for which hed acquired a taste in the army but it wasnt milk either after two beakers sweat broke out on his face he stopped worrying about peoples accents everything anyone said seemed funny but not even a couple of beakers of mead could keep him from noticing how dark the inside of the house was after his father shut the door against the chilly drafts outside and with so many men just in from long days on the farms around kunhegyes the air got thick fast but that didnt bother istvan so much barracks werent much better and the field was commonly worse as if conjured up yet another horn of mead appeared in his hand come on his mother took him by the arm i was about to put supper on the table let him stand awhile and talk gizella his father said hes just got back after all and he hasnt even said how long he can stay of course hell want to hear everything thats happened since hes been gone as a matter of fact i am pretty hungryand i havent had proper pepper stew in a long time istvan said gizella beamed alpri looked surprised and disappointed but put the best face on it he could istvan hurried to the table to his large and noisy family things that had happened in this end of their little valley were more important than the derlavaian war that raged across the continent the war wasnt real to them and the valley hardly seemed real to istvan any more the pepper stew tasted as good as it smelled as good as he remembered istvan said so over and over which made his mother flush with pleasure but sitting down to supper didnt keepnever had kepthis close kin from going on and on about weather and livestock and the local scandals and the iniquities of the folk who lived in szombathely the nearer village down the valley and the even greater iniquities of the barely human wretches who lived in the next valley over he wanted to make them quiet down and he couldnt after what seemed a very long time istvans greatuncle whose name was batthyany asked whats it like out there lad do the stars still remember you by your right name when youre so far from home it was at last the right question an expectant hush fell over the table as istvans clanfolk waited to hear what he would say he looked around a few of the men he knew had been out of the valley but none had gone too far they hadnt seen what hed seen they hadnt done what hed done answer your grandfathers brother boy alpri said as peremptory as if istvan were a child often or so aye father istvan said and turned to betthyany theres more world out there than i ever imagined and its a harder world too but the stars the stars look down on all of it greatuncle im sure of that well said his father boomed and everybody else nodded and before long well win this war and everything will be fine another expectant hush of course we will istvan said then he went and got very drunk indeed everyone said what a hero he surely had to be springtime in jelgava carried with it the promise of summernot the threat of summer as was so in desert zuwayza but a definite assurance that where the weather was warm now it would be warmer later talsu reveled in the clear skies and the lengthening days so did some of the algarvian occupiers in skrunda northern algarves climate wasnt much different from this but more of the redheads in his hometown sweated and fumed and fussed as winter ebbed away the algarvian heartland lay in the forests of the distant south where it was always cool and damp talsu didnt understand why anyone would want to live in such weather but a lot of king mezentios men pined for it he listened to them grumbling whenever they came into die family shop to have traku sew their tunics and kilts if they dont care for the way things are here they can go back where they darkness descending came from traku said one evening at supper spitting an olive pit down into his plate talsu paused with a spoonful of barley mush dusted with powdered cheese halfway to his mouth they may not like it here father but they like it a lot less in unkerlant his chuckle was deliberately nasty i wouldnt want to go to unkerlant either his younger sister ausra said and shivered its probably still snowing there and it hasnt snowed in skrunda at all for years and years theres a difference though talsu said if you did go to unkerlant king swemmels men wouldnt want to blaze you on sight lets not talk about any of us going to unkerlant his mother said in a firmer tone than she usually used when folk of kaunian blood go to unkerlant these days its not of their own free will and they dont come back now laitsina lets not borrow trouble either traku said nobody knows for sure whether those rumors are true or not his words fell flat he didnt sound as if he believed them himself the news sheets say theyre all a pack of lies talsu observed but everything in the news sheets is a lie because the redheads wont let them tell the truth if a liar says something is a lie doesnt that mean it really isnt well the news sheets say we all love king mainardo and thats not true ausra said after you read that you know you cant trust anything else you read she got up from the table may i be excused aye laitsina said but arent you going to finish she pointed to ausras bowl which was still almost half full no ive had enough ausra answered you can put it in the rest crate maybe ill eat it for dinner tomorrow at noontime ill put it away talsu said rising too his bowl of mush was empty the only things on his plate were the rind from a slab of white cheese and a dozen olive pits he could easily have finished ausras portion too but while he might have wanted it he knew he didnt need it thank you laitsina said and in an aside to traku he really has grown up its the time he spent in the army talsus father answered also in a low voice traku had more faith in the jelgavan army than talsu did no doubt because hed never served in it talsu was convinced he would have become reasonably neat without sergeants screaming at him whenever they felt like it he plucked ausras bowl off the table and carried it into the kitchen where the rest crate lay beside the door to the pantry the sorcery that made the crate work was based on a charm from the days of the kaunian empire a paralysis spell the imperial armies had used against their foes with great success till those foes found counterspells that rendered it useless then for more than a thousand years it had been only a curiosity till with the advent of systematic magecraft wizards discovered it worked by drastically slowing the rate at which life went on that made variations on it handy not only in keeping food fresh but also in medicine as soon as talsu undid the latch and took the lid off the rest crate he put the spell out of action the food his mother had stored inside began to age at its normal rate once more he set the half full bowl of barley mush on top of a coil of sausage links then returned the lid to its proper place reactivating the crate he was just snapping the latch again when laitsina called make sure you put the cover on good and tight aye mother talsu said patiently she might make noises about his having grown up but she didnt believe it not down deep inside she probably never would afterwards he played robbers with his father till they were both yawning he won three games traku two as the tailor put away the board the men and the dice he said youre better at the game than you were before you went into king donalitus service i dont know why talsu answered i dont think i played it more than a couple of times mostly we just rolled dice when we felt like swapping money around the next morning after talsu finished cutting the pieces for an algarvians summerweight linen tunic his mother came downstairs and pressed some coins into his hand go over to the grocers and bring me back half a dozen apples she said i want to make tarts tonight all right mother talsu said and set down the shears with alacrity laitsina smiled and dont take too long passing the time of day with gailisa either who me talsu said his mother laughed at him in some ways she was ready to believe him grown up after all whistling he hurried over to the grocers shop sure enough gailisa was taking care of the place she was artistically arranging onions in a crate when he walked inside hello talsu she said what do you want today you dont sell that he said with a grin and she made a face at him but my mother sent me over here for some apples well weve got some gailisa answered pointing to a basket on the counter if theyre for eating though ive got to tell you theyre on the mushy side the winter was just too mild for them to get as firm as they might no she wants them for tarts talsu said theyll be fine for that gailisa went over to the basket talsu watched her hips work inside her trousers how many does she want about half a dozen she said all right gailisa bent over the basket and started picking them up one by one ill give you the best ones weve got she was still going through them when a couple of algarvian troopers in kilts strode into the shop one of them pointed at her and said something in his own language laughing the other one nodded and rocked his hips forward and back talsu didnt understand a word of what they said but that didnt stop him from getting angry he turned toward them not saying anything himself but not trying to hide what he thought of them either he wasnt afraid of algarvians because they were algarvians not when hed faced them over the sights of a stick true his army had lost to theirs but that didnt mean they couldnt hurt and bleed just like jelgavans they noticed his expression too noticed it and didnt like it one of them jerked a thumb back toward the door through which theyd come and spoke in bad jelgavan yougoing out getting lost no talsu answered evenly im waiting for the lady to choose some apples for me futtering apples the algarvian said going out now going out now anduh orbeing sorry no talsu repeated talsu maybe youd better gailisa began but it was already too late the redheads understood what no meant they were as young and headstrong as he was and they were the conquerors and there were two of them smiling most unpleasantly they advanced on him gailisa darted around the counter and into the back of the shop loudly calling for her father talsu noticed only out of the corner of his eye almost all of his attention stayed on the algarvians the fight such as it was didnt last long one of the redheads swung at him a looping haymaker that would have knocked him sprawling had it landed it didnt he blocked it with his left forearm and delivered a sharp straight right the algarvians nose flattened under his fist with a howl the soldier staggered back into shelves piled high with produce he knocked them over vegetables spilled across the floor talsu spun toward the other algarvian this fellow didnt waste time on fisticuffs he yanked a knife from his belt stabbed talsu in the side and then helped his friend get up they both ran out of the grocers shop when talsu started to run after them he got only a couple of paces before crumpling to his knees and then to his belly he stared in dull surprise at the blood that darkened his tunic and spread over the floor he heard gailisas shriek as if from very far away the inside of the shop went gray and then black he woke puzzled wondering why he wasnt seeing the grocers shop instead his eyes took in the iron rails of a bed and a whitewashed wall beyond it a man in a pale gray tunic peered down at him how do you feel the fellow asked before talsu could answer he became aware of a snarling pain in his flank he bit back a scream as he might have done were he wounded in battle hurts he got out through clenched teeth i believe it said the man in the gray tunica healing mage talsu realized we had to do a lot of work on you while your body was slowed down even with the sorcery it was touch and go for a while there you lost a lot of blood but i think youll come through pretty well if fever doesnt take you hurts talsu repeated he was going to start screaming in a minute whether he wanted to or not the pain felt as big as the world here the mage said drink this talsu didnt ask what it was he seized the cup and gulped it down it tasted overpoweringly of poppies he panted like a dog waiting for the pain to go away it didnt not really he did he seemed to be floating to one side of his body so that while he still felt everything it didnt seem to matter anymore it might almost have been happening to someone else the mage lifted his tunic and examined the stitchedup wound in his side talsu looked at it too with curiosity far more abstract than he could have managed undrugged he put quite a hole in me he remarked and the mage nodded did they catch him talsu asked and this time the healer shook his head talsu shrugged the drug didnt let him get excited about anything i might have known youre lucky to be alive the healer said youve got more stitches holding you together inside if wed come a little later he shook his head again but your lady friend made sure we didnt my lady friend talsu said vaguely and then oh gailisa he knew he ought to be feeling something more than he was but the drug blocked and blurred it too bad he thought still vague having been nearly idle through the winter garivald was making up for it now that the ground had finally got firm enough to hold a furrow along with the rest of the peasants of zossen he plowed and sowed as fast as he could to give the crops as long to grow as possible he rose before sunset and went to bed after nightfall only harvest time was more wearing than the planting season along with everything else he had to do he still had to go into the forest to cut wood for zossens algarvian occupiers how hed hoped the unkerlanter advance would sweep them out of his village but it hadnt happened and it didnt look as if it would either he hacked at a tree trunk wishing it were a redheads body when the unkerlanters in grimy rockgray tunics let him see them he kept right on chopping wood one of his countrymen said youre the singer arent you what if i am garivald asked pausing at last what difference does it make if you arent we might decide not to let you live the ragged soldier answered and made as if to turn his stick in garivalds direction youve already spent awhile killing my hopes garivald said i thought the algarvians would be gone from here by now thought probably took it too far hoped came closer but the men who skulked through the woods had taken his songs had promised great victories and then hadnt delivered if they were unhappy with him he was unhappy with them too soon said the soldier who hadnt surrendered to the redheads very soon the fight still goes on it does not always go just as we would have it but the king will strike another blow against the invaders soon and when he does we need you now he pointed at garivald with his finger not his stick need me for what garivald asked in some alarm if they wanted him to raise the village against the algarvian occupiers he was going to tell them they were out of their minds as far as he could see that would only get his friends and relativesand maybe him tookilled without accomplishing much zossen wasnt on a ley line a rising here wouldnt keep the redheads from moving reinforcements wherever they pleased zossen in fact wasnt even near a power point which was why bang swemmels men had had to keep sacrificing condemned criminals to gain sorcerous energy to make their crystal function the crystal garivalds hand tightened on the handle of his axe even before the ragged soldier spoke garivald guessed what he would say and say it he did you have something we want something buried in the ground garivald had thought about digging up the crystal and passing it on to the unkerlanters who kept resisting behind algarvian lines hed thought about it but he hadnt done it yet in spite of waddos urgings even trying to do it was risky but having so many people know about it was also risky he hadnt said a word to anyone somebody else in the village must have and what got to the irregulars ears also got to the algarvians ill get it for you he said quickly the irregulars could probably arrange to whisper into the redheads ears if he proved recalcitrant good all the ragged soldiers nodded the fellow who was doing the talking for them went on when will you get it for us when i find it garivald snarled powers above dogs cant find the bones they bury half the time i didnt leave any special marks to point the way to the cursed thing if i would have the algarviansd have it by now im going to have to find it dont waste too much time one of the other unkerlanters warned him we need it and no mistake if you think you can get it faster than i can go ahead and dig for yourselves garivald said good luck go with you dont play games with us the irregulars leader said dont be an idiot garivald retorted he wondered if hed pushed his countrymen too far he tensed ready to rush them with his axe if they tried to blaze him he might be able to take one of them with him before he fell but after glancing back and forth among themselves they slipped away deeper into the protecting woods without another word garivald lugged his load of firewood back to the algarvians the only thanks he got were a grunt and a tick against his name so he wouldnt have to do it again for a while had the redheads worked to make people like them they would have had no small following in the duchy of grelz garivald knew as much the peasants hadnt had an easy time of it during swemmels reign some folk clove to the algarvians because of that regardless of how they were treated most like garivald saw they were getting no better bargain and stayed aloof took you long enough annore said when he came into their hut dont you start on me garivald growled he looked around syrivald was outside doing something or other while leuba was occupied with a cloth doll stuffed with buckwheat husks lowering his voice garivald went on they want it his wifes eyes widened can you get it im going to have to try can you get it without getting caught annore persisted do you even know exactly where it is im going to have to try garivald repeated i think i can and maybe ill be able to find out where it is how annore asked youre no mage and i dont need to be one either garivald said everybody knows a lodestone will draw iron and rubbed amber will draw feathers or straw havent you ever heard that limestone will draw glass the same way his wife snapped her fingers in annoyance at herself i have by the powers above but it slipped my mind lodestone and amber are toys to make children laugh but how often does anyone need to draw glass to him not very garivald replied and theres not much glass in zossen to draw the stuffs too expensive for the likes of us but if that crystal isnt glass i dont know what it is if that crystal wasnt glass the limestone wouldnt work in that case hed have to start probing the plot where the crystal lay buried hed have to be lucky to find it so and it would surely take a long time somebody was bound to find him first to find him and to ask a great many questions he couldnt answer all right annore said limestone wont be hard to find not when we spread it crushed on the fields to mellow the soil garivald nodded ill just need a chunk a little bigger than most and a string to tie around it so it swings freeoh and aye a dark night youll have those the next few nights annore said after that the moon will be getting bigger and setting later i need one other thing garivald said after a moments thought his wife raised a questioning eyebrow he explained i cant find the cursed crystal if it isnt there if waddos already gone and dug it up im wasting my time waddo had talked about the two of them digging it up together but who could tell what all went through the firstmans mind garivald wondered what hed tell the unkerlanter irregulars if waddo had decided to take it on his own whatever he told them they wouldnt want to listen he didnt think waddo had told the algarvians about the crystal had the firstman blabbed to the redheads they would have come down on garivald and his family like a falling tree but waddo might well have taken the crystal out of the ground himself and hidden it somewhere else to keep garivald or one of the villagers whod seen garivald and him burying it from betraying him have to hope garivald muttered and tramped back out to the fields finding a chunk of limestone the size of a finger joint didnt take long he unraveled some of the hem of his tunic using the thread for a string annore wouldnt be happy with him for that but he had bigger things to worry about with the stone and the string in his belt pouch he took care of endless chores till sundown supper was blood sausage and pickled cabbage washed down with a mug of ale after supper annore let the fire die to embers that shed only a faint red glow over the inside of the hut she spread out blankets and quilts on the benches that lined the walls syrivald and leuba curled up in them and went to sleep before long annore was snoring too garivald had to stay awake though exhaustion tugged at him he watched a stripe of moonlight crawl across the floor and up the wall after the moonlight disappeared after the inside of the house got darker than ever he sat up swallowing yet another yawn and put back on the boots that were all hed taken off did annores breathing change as he went out the door had she only been pretending to be asleep hed find out later he couldnt worry about it now most of the village lay quiet farm work bludgeoned people into slumber when night came that made the raucous singing from the house the algarvians had taken as their own all the more irksome but if they were in there carousing they werent out patrolling beyond wishing them ugly hangovers in the morning garivald had no fault to find with their way of whiling away the hours not tonight he stepped as quietly as he could if anyone did spy him hed say he was out to ease himself that wouldnt work in the middle of the garden though once he got there he couldnt afford to waste a moment the twostory bulk of waddos house looming dark against the sky helped guide him to the plot he needed waddos was the only twostory house in zossen as far as garivald was concerned it was also a monument to wretched excess but that like the redheads racket was beside the point right now garivald took out the little chunk of limestone and swung it gently at the end of the length of thread tied to it show me where the crystal went he whispered as it swung back and forth show me as was truly meant he didnt know if it was truly meant or not but figured the assumption would do no harm and the limestone began gliding back and forth as if he were swinging it but he wasnt not now his hand and wrist were still he went in the direction it led him and it swung faster and faster higher and higher then after hed gone on for a while it began to slow he stopped and reversed his field the swings grew stronger and higher once more he stopped where the limestone swung most vigorously stopped and squatted that was where he began to dig with his belt knife he didnt know how deep hed have to dig or how big a hole hed have to make the only way to find out was to do it the tip of the knife grated off something hard and smooth powers above garivald whispered and reached down into the hole after guddling about for a moment his hands closed on the cool sphere of the crystal with a soft exclamation of triumph he drew it out then as best he could he filled in the hole trying to make it seem as if no one had ever been there he hurried away back toward his own house clouds slid across the stars swallowing them one after another the air smelled damp maybe it would rain before morning that would help hide what hed been doing and hide his tracks too it would also be good for the newly planted crops rain he murmured clutching the crystal tight eighteen not even snowshoes helped behemoths make their way through the bottomless mud of the spring thaw leudast wished the thaw would have come later than it didexactly the opposite of what he would have wished back in his village an early thaw meant an early planting and a long growing season but a late thaw meant the unkerlanter army could have kept pushing the algarvians eastward across solid ground solid ground for the next few weeks would be hard to come by his company was still moving eastward one laborious step at a time paved roads in unkerlant being few and far between the highways down which they advanced were as muddy as the fields to either side sometimes because so many men and horses and unicorns and behemoths and wagons moved along them and tore up the dirt they were muddier than the fields during the thaw ordinary wagons were useless no matter how many horses pulled them they bogged down but every village had a wagon or two useful in the mud or in deep snow one with tall wheels and a curving bottom almost like that of a boat mud wagons could bring supplies to soldiers at the front line where everything else got stuck the unkerlanter army had its own fleet of mud wagons and confiscated any it found in reconquered villages such confiscations were few and far between though because the algarvians stole the wagons too looking back over his shoulder leudast saw a couple of mud wagons making their way back toward the company he led he waved to the driver of the lead wagon the fellow waved back calling you part of captain hawarts outfit thats right leudast answered he would have said the same thing had the driver asked him if he were part of some regiment hed never heard of supplies didnt come forward so often that he could afford to let them slip through his fingers lying to get his hands on them seemed no sin at all these which were actually meant for his unit didnt come forward in a hurry mud wagons didnt move quickly what set them apart from every other vehicle was that they could move at all during the thaw leudast had plenty of time to shout for soldiers to help unload them before they actually arrived what have you got for us he asked as his men swarmed over the wagons oh some of this some of that the lead driver answered bandages potted meat charges for your sticks so you wont have to cut a captives throat to keep blazing all sorts of good things i should say so leudast exclaimed such bounty hadnt come his way in quite a while powers above weve been living handtomouth for so long i dont know what well do with all this stuff well pal if you dont want it i figure theres plenty who do the driver said he laughed to show he didnt intend to be taken seriously a good thing for him too several of leudasts soldiers were about to turn their sticks in his direction they werent going to let him and his fellow drivers get away before theyd gone through the wagons either captain hawart himself squelched up before the plundering was quite complete you cant keep all the goodies for your own company you know he told leudast he wasnt laughing as he said it sir i wouldnt do that leudast assured him of course you wouldnt hawart answered ive got my eye on you amazing how well people behave when somebodys watching isnt it i dont know what youre talking about leudast did laugh so did hawart now they understood each other pretty well hawart said you are going to share this stuff leudast because were ordered forward against the redheads in lautertal up ahead past the woods there he pointed are we leudast said tonelessly theyll have had a deal of time to get ready for us wont they and we wont be able to come at em quick and flank em out like we did so often in the snow thats all true every word of it his superior agreed but were ordered in anyhow and so well go they arent supposed to have that many men holed up in the place thats the word coming back to us anyhow he didnt sound as if he believed it he didnt look as if he believed it either casting about for ways to ask how big a fiasco the ordered assault was likely to be leudast found one how hard are you going to push the attack sir were going forward till we cant go forward anymore hawart answered spoken one way that meant one thing spoken another way it meant something altogether different leudast had no great trouble figuring out captain hawarts tone aye sir he said you dont need to worry about my company we always do our best i know you do hawart said if they havent killed us yet they probably cant kill us at all dont you think aye leudast said knowing he was lying knowing hawart knew he was lying but if he lied to the captain maybe he could lie to himself too he went on what help can we count on when we go at this lautertal place eggtossers behemoths magecraft magecraft was a euphemism for slaughtered unkerlanters but he might be able to lie to himself about that too in any case hawart shook his head tossers are mostly stuck in the mud ten miles behind us same with the behemoths and this isnt a big enough attack to deserve magecraft cant say im too sorry about that he was probably lying to himself too now we hope the algarvians feel the same way about holding the place leudast said and hawart nodded leudast went on ill let my men know what theyll be doing no wonder the powers aboveby which he meant the unkerlanter quartermasters not the abstract powers beyond the skydecided to let us have enough supplies for a change after hawart left leudast broke the news to the company he commanded his veterans nodded in resignation the new recruits exclaimed and grinned excitedly they knew no better they would those who didnt pay an irredeemable price for the instruction the algarvians were about to give them as soon as leudast advanced out of the trees and on toward lautertal he knew the attack was in trouble the town had a couple of buildings with tall spires that hadnt been knocked down that meant the algarvians would have lookouts in those spires men who could see a long way they also proved to have eggtossers in the town eggs began bursting among the unkerlanters slogging across the liquid fields toward the town the mud absorbed some of the sorcerous energy those eggs releasedsome but far from all men shrieked as they were burned or as bits of the egg casings scythed into them keep going leudast shouted we can do it he didnt know whether the unkerlanters could do it or not but he did know they couldnt if they didnt think they could urra he yelled swemmel urra urra the unkerlanters shouted they were game theyd stayed game all through the dreadful summer and fall when the algarvians pushed them back almost at will leudast still marveled at that throwing down his stick and throwing up his hands would have been so easy but hed kept fighting and so had his countrymen ever since fall gave way to winter theyd been the ones advancing that was enough to keep a man going all by itself but it wasnt enough to let the unkerlanters take lautertal the algarvians had indeed had some time in which to get ready and theyd used it well theyd dug and then cleverly concealed blazing pits all around the town they must have reinforced them too or the pits would have turned to muck during the thaw the pits hadnt king mezentios men took a steady toll on the unkerlanters from them and the eggtossers kept dropping death on leudast and his comrades he saw an egg spinning through the air toward him saw it and flung himself face down in the muck before it burst fragments of the casing hissed malignantly over his head the soggy ground under him shuddered as if in torment but hed known worse than that when the algarvians started slaughtering kaunian captives then the ground didnt merely shudder trenches and holes closed on the soldiers unlucky enough to shelter in them and flames burst up to catch men scrambling free algarvian magecraft was nothing to despise since they had so many other defenses cunningly prepared leudast feared king mezentios men would also be ready to use kaunians life energy against the unkerlanter attack if they were ready they didnt bother killing the captives they had no need for anything so drastic leudast and the other unkerlanters had no chance to break into lautertal let alone to run the algarvians out of it wiping mud from his eyes leudast looked around during the winter king swemmels soldiers had taken to using the algarvian tactic of flanking die enemy out of his position rather than smashing straight into it with behemoths on snowshoes adding punch and speed to unkerlanter attacks the ploy had worked well now leudast shook his head soldiers half drowned in muck were not going to produce a powerful flanking maneuver not around lautertal not even if the algarvians had no further unpleasant surprises waiting for them the unkerlanters couldnt go around they couldnt go forward and they were having an even harder time staying where they were what do we do sir one of leudasts men cried as if certain he would have the answer what can we do nothing was the first thought that sprang into leudasts mind stay where we are and keep getting pounded was the second he liked it no better though doing it would have meant obeying orders to the letter he looked around again trying to find any way in which the attack on lautertal might succeed had he seen one he would have ordered his men to keep trying no war ever got won without casualties but no war ever got won by throwing men into a meat grinder to no purpose either as far as he could see that was all the unkerlanters were doing here fall back he shouted back to our own lines well take another blaze at these buggers later on he didnt know whether the unkerlanters would or not he did know this attack had failed getting away from lautertal proved almost as expensive as assailing the place had been the algarvians fortunately could no more pursue than the unkerlanters had been able to attack but their eggtossers punished the retreating soldiers all over again back at the soggy trenches from which theyd begun the assault on lautertal king swemmels men reckoned up their losses leudast had seen worse which was the most he could say who ordered the withdrawal captain hawart demanded i did sir leudast answered and wondered if an avalanche of official wrath would fall on his head but hawart only nodded and said good you waited long enough leudast let out a long weary sigh of relief in all his years as a dragonflier count sabrino had never faced such determined enemies in the air as the ones he met here in the land of the ice people try as he would he could not escape them and all the wing he led suffered from their ferocious onslaughts he turned to colonel broumidis who commanded the handful of yaninan dragons on the austral continent can we do nothing against them he cried out in torment are we powerless broumidis shrug had none of the panache an algarvian would have given it the yaninan officer a short skinny man with an enormous black mustache that didnt suit his narrow face seemed rather to be suggesting that fate had more to do with it than he did all all he said was what can we do but endure go mad sabrino suggested no more than a quarter in jest he slapped then cried out in triumph theres one mosquito dead that leaves only fortyeight billion as near as i can reckon the cursed things are eating me alive colonel broumidis shrugged again it is spring on the austral continent he said sounding even more doleful in his accented algarvian than he would have in his own language all the bugs hatch out at once and they are all hungry what can we do but slap and light stinking candles and suffer id like to drop enough eggs on all the swamps to kill the wrigglers before they grow up thats what sabrino said savagely broumidis raised a bushy black eyebrow and said nothing sabrino felt himself flush he knew hed been absurd when the ice down here finally melted half the countryside turned into a bog and as the yaninan colonel had said the bugs swarmed forth intent on packing a years worth of life into the few weeks of mild weather the austral continent gave them sabrino looked back over his shoulder at heshbon the yaninan outpost he and his dragonfliers had to help protect miserable little place he thought ive flown over plenty of unkerlanter peasant villages where id rather settle down and i wouldnt be caught dead in an unkerlanter peasant village cinnabar he muttered under his breath making it into a curse aye cinnabar broumidis agreed mournful still it draw warriors as amber draws feathers us the lagoansmay the powers below swallow those widearsed whoresonsand now you i would have been just as well pleased to stay on the other side of the narrow sea i assure you sabrino said colonel broumidis sent him a hurt look the yaninans large dark liquid eyes were made for such expressions sabrino sighed he could have said a good deal more but he didnt want to offend his ally shouting if you buggers had done any fighting on your own i could have stayed on the other side of the narrow sea struck him as impolitic well we shall have to carry on the war as best we can broumidis sighed too the yaninans were hardly happier witjh the algarvians than the other way round they were a proud and touchy folk and all the more touchy because of their failures in the field broumidis pointed here comes the food for our dragons several camels bore panniers full of chunks of meat the meat came from other camels cutting them up struck sabrino as the best thing that could happen to them they were almost as disagreeable as dragons sabrino know no higher dispraise mosquitoes didnt care about cutup meat they wanted theirs live flies and gnats and midges werent so fussy they swarmed round the panniers in buzzing swirling clouds they were perfectly willing to torment the camels carrying the panniers too and because the camels had started shedding their heavy winter coats they suffered badly not so the ice people who led them the natives of the austral continent remained swaddled in furs and robes and offered the bugs few targets sabrino rather wished he were wearing something that covered more than a kilt his legs looked hardly better than the meat the dragons were getting and before i came here i thought the ice people were hairy because that helped keep them warm now i wonder whether their being so hairy helps keep the mosquitoes away too it does broumidis said with assurance i have seen as much in my service here he inhaled choked on a gnat and spent the next minute or so coughing when he could speak again he went on even so i would not care to be among their number no indeed my dear fellow sabrino exclaimed his own groundcrew men took the camel meat from the ice people they dusted it with brimstone and lavishly with cinnabar before feeding it to the dragons sabrino said we need not stint here at any rate thats all to the good aye dragons down here burn hot and flame far his yaninan counterpart agreed not for nothing do we need what the ice people trade us before sabrino could answer an insect bit him on the back of the neck it wasnt a mere mosquito it felt as if it had driven a redhot nail an inch into his flesh he yelled and leaped in the air and slapped at himself all at the same time something squashed under the palm of his hand when he looked he saw blood and bug guts he scrubbed his palm on the new green grass shooting up now that the snow had melted like the bugs like everything on the austral continent the grass was speeding through its life as if it knew it had not a moment to waste another camel approached from out of the east this one was a riding beast with a man of the ice people perched atop the curious padded bench that served it for a saddle seeing broumidis the fellow steered the camel toward him as soon as he came into earshot he began shouting in his own throaty language pointing back over his shoulder as he did so you understand what hes saying sabrino asked his neck still throbbed aye broumidis replied or i do when i dont have to try to understand you too sabrino shut up the yaninan spoke in the language of the ice people listened and spoke again after he got another set of answers he turned back to sabrino the lagoans are coming pathrusim here spied them fording the jabbok river about forty miles east of here theyll be across it now of course but not so far across ittheyre mostly footsoldiers and couriers camels ride like the wind we can strike them we can smite them he sounded quiveringly eager had all the yaninans been so eager to go into action against king vitors men sabrino could have stayed in unkerlant in a fight he was convinced mattered more to his kingdom than this sideshow the best way to escape the sideshow though was to smash the lagoans if they were beaten off the austral continent he could go back to derlavai he shouted for his bugler the fellow came running up horn in hand blow the call to combat sabrino told him we fly against the lagoans familiar martial music rang out his dragonfliers burst from their tents and ran for their beasts which screamed in fury at having their meals interrupted they were going off to a fight which they liked as well as eating but they hadnt the brains to figure that out a couple of minutes later a yaninan trumpeter also started blaring away broumidis men moved more slowly than the algarvians despite their commandant s shouts and curses poor bugger sabrino thoughta good officer trapped in a bad service sabrinos whole wing was in the air and speeding east before the first yaninan dragons left the ground sabrino sighed this was why king mezentio s men had had to come give them a hand with yaninans for allies algarve hardly needed enemies peering down from his perch at the base of his dragons neck sabrino spied a couple of lagoan behemoths lumbering ahead of the enemys army the lagoans spotted his wing too and started blazing at the dragons with the heavy stick mounted on one behemoth the wing fortunately was flying high and even that powerful beam couldnt knock any dragons out of the sky it did keep sabrino from ordering his dragons to swoop down on the lagoan behemoths though they would pay a high price if they tried that a few of the algarvian dragonfliers did drop eggs on the behemoths down here on the austral continent the wing had to carry eggs as well as fighting with flame and the fliers sticks sabrino didnt see whether they knocked the lagoan beasts down he was looking ahead trying to spot the lagoans main force he was also worrying hed flown against lagoan dragons over the strait of valmiera their fliers knew what they were doing and the lagoans unlike the unkerlanters used crystals as freely as did his own kingdom those behemoths would let the rest of the lagoan army know the dragons were coming and they did the lagoans might not have brought along many dragons but they had lots of behemoths some of those beasts carried eggtossers but the ones with heavy sticks all started blazing at the wing of algarvian dragons captain domizianos face appeared in sabrinos crystal sir shall we dive on them the squadron commander asked by his tone he would have liked nothing better but sabrino shook his head noit would hurt us too much we cant afford to throw ourselves awayno telling if any more dragons will be able to come here if we do and dragons cant stop a whole army on the march by themselves anyhow the yaninans wont be able to stop them either domiziano predicted are we going to have to send soldiers here too i dont know do i look like king mezentio youd better not say aye by the powers above sabrino added the warning before domiziano could say anything at all what i do know is were not going to give the lagoans anything easy eggs rained down on king vitors men at a height beyond that at which the foes heavy sticks could harm the dragons the only trouble was it was also a height beyond that at which the dragonfliers could aim accurately here and there a bursting egg flung lagoans in all directions more often than not though the eggs only cratered the ground after a while there were no more eggs left to drop back to the dragon farm boys sabrino ordered well load up again and then hit these miserable whoresons another good lick the rest of the dragonfliers obeyed his command as he spiraled down to a landing outside of heshbon the mosquitoes and flies and gnats hed escaped in the upper air began to plague him once more he cursed and slapped neither of which did much good colonel broumidis few dragons were landing alongside their algarvian allies theyd done well enough or so sabrino supposed he cursed them anyhow for not stopping the lagoans by themselves if theyd managed that he wouldnt have had to come to the austral continent and get nibbled to death by gnats now that the land of the ice people was no longer frozen hard as stone fernao could dig a hole for himself when eggs began dropping all around him he got filthy when he dove into the muddy hole but he vastly preferred getting filthy to getting killed overhead the algarvian dragons wheeled unchallenged they stayed high above the lagoan army not daring to swoop down and flame soldiers or behemoths fernao supposed that represented a moral victory of sorts moral victories though went only so far when measured against the real article the algarvians could hurt his comradesand him though he tried not to think about that while the men on the ground could do little to the dragons as long as they stayed high as if to underscore that a lagoan soldier not far away started shrieking with a cursehe wasnt thrilled about exposing himself to dangerfernao scrambled out of the hold where he sheltered and hurried to the wounded mans side the soldier writhed clutching at his belly blood rivered out from between his fingers either a fragment of egg shell or a sharp stone propelled by a nearby blast of sorcerous energy had laid him open as neatly as a butcher might have done even as fernao readied the spell that would slow the man down and give the physicians a chance to work on him the fellow groaned one last time he shuddered and went limp his eyes rolled up in his head when fernao felt for his pulse he found none that might have been a mercy the soldier would have known nothing but torment after coming out from under the shadow of the magic and fever against which even mages had little power might well have carried him off anyhow fernao jumped back into his hole again the algarvian dragons seemed to stay in the air over the army forever part of that feeling came from being under attack fernao knew as much and part sprang from the nature of daylight on the austral continent when hed first come in winter the sun had hardly peeked above the horizon not so very much farther south it would never have risen at all now that spring had come though days grew longer with astonishing speed before long the sun would spend almost all day in the sky on the far side of the barrier mountains it would never set at last no doubt because they were out of eggs the algarvian dragons flew off toward heshbon fernao shook his head to get rid of the echoing roar of bursting eggs mosquitoes buzzed malignantly he could still hear those when he inhaled a tickling in his nose warned him hed breathed in a couple of midges he exhaled sharply and got ride of them before he started to choke all over the field lagoans were emerging from the holes theyd dug for themselves like fernao his countrymen were worn and muddy a lot of them had a look in their eyes that he didnt like the look of men whod had to take a beating without being able to hit back a few officers were calling for them to push on toward the west but fernao could see at a glance that the soldiers were in no shape to advance someone waved to him affonso youre still alive the other mage called aye i think so fernao said and you as wellcongratulations affonso bowed thanks i wish i could take credit for it but it had more to do with luck or the powers aboveyour choicethan with me he slapped at the back of his leg just above the top of his wool stocking stinking bugs when i was here before theyd already passed their peak fernao said now its a miracle they dont suck the blood out of everything if they dont the algarvians are liable to affonso said gloomily to that fernao could only nod algarve had a much easier time sending men and supplies across the narrow sea to the austral continent than did lagoas the same held true for yanina but king mezentios men unlike kingtsavellas took war seriously fernao said if they ship over footsoldiers and behemoths were liable to be in a bad way aye affonso agreed more gloomily still the dragons are bad enough even when they arent dropping eggs on our heads theyre looking down to see just where were going even yaninan footsoldiers can put up a fight when they have an edge like that algarvians i dont want to think about the bloody algarvians we have to have dragons of our ownthats all there is to it fernao said he turned away where are you going affonso asked to tell lieutenant general junqueiro what i just told you fernao answered maybe he hasnt figured it out for himself yet the more i see of soldiers the worse i think they are at trying to deal with things theyve never met before he found junqueiro in the middle of a heated argument with the hostages the chieftain of the ice people named elishamma had left with the lagoan army since the general and the hostages had no language in common the exchange of ideas was necessarily limited but both sides seemed most sincere one of the hostages a fuzzy fellow named abinadab spoke some yaninan even if he hadnt admitted it when elishamma handed him over to the lagoans seeing fernao he rounded on him you tell your big man to let us go he cried our chief not know mangy yaninans have strong mangy friends when he give us too bad fernao said we are not without power ourselves we have marched a long way now we are almost in sight of heshbon soon we will take it then the algarvians will have a harder time fighting us you dream abinadab said and scornfully turned his back what is he havering about junqueiro demanded what are they all havering about powers above theyre uglyand smelly too fernao translated for him the lagoan general clapped a hand to his forehead tell them that if they dont like being hostages they can be victims i doubt their worthless lives have much energy but they might keep a few sticks charged no matter what fernao thought of junqueiro that was exactly the right line to take with the ice people if the mage enjoyed putting it into yaninan so abinadab could translate it for the rest of the nomads no one but he had to know that the men of the ice people cried out in furious indignation but when fernao and junqueiro both ignored them they went off shaking their heads and muttering teach them the fear of the powers above junqueiro muttered glaring at their backs they dont believe in the powers aboveonly their foolish gods fernao said the last word necessarily being in the language of the ice people but they do know strength and they know weakness too if we dont get some dragons here strength will not lie on our side he waited for junqueiro to burst like an egg no dragon could fly all the way from lagoas even to the eastern edge of the land of the ice people let alone all the way to the neighborhood of heshbon but to his surprise the commanding general only nodded and said its being taken care of it is fernao blinked how junqueiro chuckled ah so you mages dont know everything there is to know eh fernao gave him a dirty look while talking with affonso hed accused the general of being none too bright and didnt enjoy having the charge flung back in his face junqueiro went on while you werent looking sorcerous sir the kuusaman navy built leyline transports to haul dragons out to where they needed them they used them against the gongs out in the bothnian ocean now we have some too and a couple of them are on their way to the narrow sea to give us a hand against mezentios dragons we have they are not for the first time fernao found he really didnt know everything the discovery never failed to annoy him when will they get here have they made it past sibiu safe aye they have or so my crystallomancer tells me junqueiro answered now that a good deal of the ice has melted they could follow ley lines farther south than any we dared use in dead of winter no algarvian dragons or leviathans out of sibiu spied them theyll be here in a couple of days and then well have dragons of our own powers above be praised powers above be praised indeed fernao agreed nothing like giving mezentios men a nasty surprise the next time they come calling aye looking pleased with himself the lagoan general whuffled out air through his whitestreaked mustachios they may have made us stop for a little while but were not down for good he puffed out his chest and looked strong and brave fernao had always thought he was strong and brave what the mage had wondered was whether junqueiro had any brains now fernao began to hope he did but the lagoan dragons didnt get there to give the algarvians a nasty surprise the next time the algarvians flew overhead for mezentios dragonfliers returned later that evening not long before sunset would usher in the brief spring night this time they had more eggs than on their first visit huddled in a hole in the ground fernao hurled curses at them that he knew would not bite he also cursed the mosquitoes that kept harassing him the mosquitoes bit again the curses didnt this time a couple of dragons did swoop low to flame the lagoan soldiers a heavy stick on a behemoths back blazed one of them out of the sky fernao cheered himself hoarse even though the dragons thrashing death throes did as much damage to the lagoans on the ground as had its fiery breath after the algarvians flew off again a runner came shouting fernaos name on following the man he discovered that three of the hostages had taken advantage of the chaos to flee the ones who hadnt got away looked as if they expected to be blazed for their comrades transgressions fernao wondered whether they were grateful to be spared or despised the lagoans for their mercy when morning returned so did the algarvian dragonfliers going forward while eggs fell was impossible for the lagoans scattering to minimize the damage from the enemys eggs was a better ploy it wouldnt have been had junqueiro feared an attack from yaninas footsoldiers but the yaninans had shown they had no stomach for such assaults the algarvians came back twice more that day keeping the lagoans from advancing against heshbon the scouts junqueiro did send forward showed that the yaninans despite their unwillingness to attack were strengthening positions that covered the approaches to their coastal base the commanding general cursed when he got the news though he could hardly have expected anything different and then that evening lagoan dragons did come flying into the armys unhappy campeleven of them no more and all in the last stages of exhaustion the men who flew them were hardly in better shape leviathan one of them said gulping at the flask of spirits a soldier pressed into his hand cursed leviathan or more likely a pod of them we never knew we were in any trouble either dragon transport till the eggs they planted against our sides burst by then they were long gone underwater and not long after that both our ships went under the water too most of the dragons most of the fliers never made it out he swigged again tilting the flask so he could drain it dry what will we do without enough dragons to fight the algarvians someone asked the question hadnt been aimed at fernao but he saw only one thing the lagoans could do they would have to retreat we are not satisfied king swemmel told marshal rathar by the powers above how can we be satisfied with the cursed redheads still infesting so much of the richest part of our kingdom rathar bowed his head had he been in swemmels audience chamber he would have gone down on his belly but the king had come to his office and so that indignity was spared him he said your majesty we may not have done so much as youd hoped but we have done a great deal even after the mud fully dries the algarvians will be hard pressed to mount another assault on cottbus the last one cost them dear and we have new fortifications protecting the way west toward thie capital hed hoped his words would please the king but swemmels eyes blazed angrily we care little for what the algarvians may seek to do to us he growled we care far more for what we can do to the algarvians within limits that was a good attitude for a soldier to have king swemmel had never recognized limits not for himself not for those he commanded rathar said we will hit back at mezentios men in the south but we must also make sure the capital is safe when the ground lets the redheads move they wont stand idle waiting to be attacked the marshal of unkerlant wondered how big an understatement that was the previous summer and falls campaign had proved the algarvians had taken too big a bite to swallow at once it hadnt proved they couldnt swallow it in several gulps rather than one and rathar remained uneasily aware that man for man mezentios soldiers were better than swemmels he thanked the powers above that unkerlant had more men swemmel said we had better not rest idle either as soon as the ground dries we want us to move first before the algarvians can he walked over to the map on the wall by rathars desk you are always talking about flanking attacks if we can flank them out of aspang here their whole position in grelz crumbles rathar nodded the king had been furious for some time because the unkerlanters hadnt driven king mezentios men out of aspang having the redheads there didnt thrill rathar either hed managed to talk swemmel out of a headlong assault on the city unkerlant had already tried that and bloodily failed the marshal had no compunction about spending lives but wanted to buy something with what he spent and if hed managed to get the king thinking about flanking maneuvers hed accomplished something as important as winning a major battle i believe youre right your majesty i would like to go south and prepare that attack myself but king swemmel shook his head from your own mouth came the words the algarvians will not stand idle when the ground dries what will they do marshal what would you do did you wear mezentios kilt swemmel was having a good day he couldnt have found a more pertinent question to ask rathar did his best to think his way into king mezentio s mind one answer emerged i would strike again for cottbus here in the center its still as important as it ever was no matter how well weve fortified the ground in front of it the algarvians will still want it we agree swemmel said and because we agree we are going to keep you here in front of the capital to defend it against the redheads i obey your majesty rathar said glumly he wished he could fault swemmels logic but if he was the best general unkerlant had and cottbus the vital place likeliest to be endangered where better to station him than here of course you obey us swemmel said did you not we should have got ourselves a new marshal some time ago nowready this assault against the algarvians around aspang pick a general who will run it well and set it in motion as soon as may be the king swept out of the office major merovec looked inside when rathar nodded his adjutant came in what now merovec asked cautiously rathar told him what now the marshal did not try to hide his frustration even if merovec reported him to the king swemmel would have a hard time blaming him for wanting to go out and fight that wasnt to say swemmel couldnt blame him but the king would have to work at it whom will you choose to command in the south since you may not go yourself merovec asked general vatran has fought as well as anyone could reasonably expect down there rathar answered which was true not even king swemmel had complained of vatran ill leave him there till he proves he cant do the jobor till a more important one comes along and i promote him into it merovec thought that over then nodded he seems capable enough not like the early days of the fight with the redheads when generals got the sack about once a week they got what they deserved rathar said one thing war does in a hurry that peace cant do at all it sorts out the officers who know how to fight from the ones who dont and now since i cant go south to lead the attack there i am going to go to the lines in front of cottbus to see what we can do to help vatran when the attack goes in the lines were a good deal in front of cottbus these days a fingers breadth between two pinholes on the map translated into three hours travel in a leyline caravan car through some of the most ravaged countryside rathar had ever seen neither the unkerlanters nor their algarvian foes had asked for or given quarter every town and village had been fought over twice first when the algarvians darkness descending advanced towards cottbus and then when they fell back from it a wall that hadnt been knocked down was unusual a building unburnt and intact a prodigy about twothirds of the way to the front the caravan halted im afraid youll have to get out now marshal an apologetic mage said we havent cleared all the algarvian sabotage from the ley line east of here we cant afford to lose you youd better have a horse waiting for me then rathar growled oh aye sir we do the mage said sure enough a groom held a peppylooking stallion not far from where the caravan car had halted rather no splendid equestrian would have preferred a gelding but expected he could manage a more headstrong beast he was a pretty headstrong beast himself the stallion must have been at the front for a while it shied neither at the sharp stink of wood smoke as it trotted past one more burnedout village nor at the reek of dead meat which seemed to be everywhere sometimes faint sometimes sickeningly strong one reason the horse was able to trot as opposed to sinking hockdeep in mud was that it stuck to a roughly corduroyed path leading east rather rode past a gang of algarvian captives laying boards in the roadway under the sticks of a squad of unkerlanter guards he wished every one of the soldiers who served king swemmel could have looked at these filthy scrawny thoroughly cowed algarvians the redheads sometimes seemed to go forward for no better reason than that both they and the unkerlanters they fought were convinced they could this gang of algarvians would never raise that particular awe in their enemies again at last as the sun set behind him and evening twilight began to gather the marshal heard the rumble of bursting eggs ahead when he entered the next village a couple of unkerlanter sentries popped out of the ruins and barked halt who goes there i am marshal rathar rathar said mildly before you blaze me for not knowing the password take me to your commander he will vouch for me he wondered just which colonel or brigadier was in charge in these parts if it was a man whose career hed blighted the fellow might deny any knowledge of him and have him blazed for a spy it wasnt likely but stranger things had happened in unkerlanter history in the event rathar wasted some perfectly good worries the officer to whom the wideeyed sentries led him colonel euric saluted so crisply rathar thought his arm would fall off he gave rathar his own battered chair fed him a big bowl of boiled buckwheat groats onions and what was probably horsemeat and poured him a heroic nip of spirits i may live rather said when hed got outside of the meal and the drink all of me but my backside hopes i will anyhow they dont pay you to be a cavalryman lord marshal euric answered with a grin they pay you to tell cavalrymen what to do i cant very well do that if i dont know whats going on myself rathar said thats why i like to come up to the front when i get the chance he pointed at euric much as king swemmel was in the habit of pointing at him what is going on up here colonel not a whole lot to tell you the truth not right this minute euric answered were waiting for things to dry out and so are the stinking redheads meanwhile we toss some eggs at them they toss some at us a few soldiers on both sides get killed and it wont change the way the war turns out one lousy bit he stuck out his chin as if defying rathar to come down on him for his frankness rathar instead got up walked over to him and folded him into a bear hug i always praise the powers above when i run into a man who speaks his mind he said it doesnt happen all that often believe you me euric laughed he was young to be a colonelnot far past thirty rathar wondered how many men above him had been killed or disgraced to let him get where he was outspoken captains were common enough most of them never advanced past captain euric was likely to be good at what he did and had surely been in the right place at the right time the colonel said i tell you this too well lick the buggers unless we do something stupid and were liable to he raised an eyebrow and grinned at rathar nothing personal of course of course rathar grinned back he slapped eurics shoulder youll go far no telling wholl chase you while youre going but youll go far both men laughed they shared a bond the same bond that joined so many unkerlanter officers so far theyd survived the worst both king swemmel and the algarvians could do to their kingdom rather felt he was ready for anything now by eurics jaunty expression they had that in common too algarvian dragons started dropping eggs on the village both euric and rather jumped down into a hole in the ground behind the battered hut where euric made his headquarters what will they diink of you in cottbus when you come back all covered with mud euric asked theyll think im earning my keep rathar replied either that or theyll think im a cursed fool for taking chances i dont have to as opposed to the rest of us poor sods who do have to take chances euric said rathar shrugged that had no answer nor had it since the beginning of time but euric laughed and added you took your share beforei know that for a fact an egg burst close by showering rathar with mud that stank of corpses even so he felt forgiven was the word he finally found you do good work ethelhelm said to ealstan as they sat in the band leaders flat sipping wine if id had you casting accounts for me since the days before the war idve had a lot more money for the algarvians to take away from me heh ealstan said ethelhelms wit always had a bite to it rubbing his chin ealstan went on in musing tones before the war it was only two and a half years ago but it seems like forever oh longer than that ethelhelm cocked his head to one side waiting to see darkness descending how ealstan took his reply ealstan laughed a lot of people he supposedhis cousin sidroc assuredly among themwould have stared in blank incomprehension ethelhelm nodded as if hed passed an obscure test youre hardly old enough to piss without wetting yourself but youve got an old head on your shoulders dont you people say so ealstan answered im cursed if i know i take after my father is what i think it is i took after my father too once upon a time ethelhelm said took after him with a carving knife as a matter of fact didnt catch him though ealstan couldnt imagine going after his father with a knife uncle hengist that was a different story ealstan wondered how sidroc was doing if he was hale whether hed gone off to fight for the algarvians yet he rather hoped sidroc had that would be the easiest on everyoneexcept perhaps sidroc id better get back ealstan said rising to his feet he couldnt suppress a pang of disappointment at leaving ethelhelms large airy elegantly decorated flat and having to go back to his own which was none of those things ethelhelm was a wealthy young man ealstan knew to the copper just how wealthy the musician was hed made a fortune before the war broke out and had managed to hold onto most of it despite eoforwics occupation first by the unkerlanters and then by the algarvians what with the business ealstan had not only from ethelhelm but also from his other clients he could have afforded better than the nasty little flat in which he and vanai were living he could have afforded better but he didnt dare move if he went to a better neighborhood vanai would draw more notice that was the last thing he wanted especially now that the redheads had herded all the kaunians into one cramped bit of eoforwic ethelhelm came with him to the door and set a hand on his arm youre a good fellow ealstan i wouldnt mind seeing more of youor meeting your lady either thank you ealstan said and meant it not all his fathers clientsprobably not even half his fathers clientsdealt with hestan socially as opposed to on business matters and for ethelhelm to say that about vanai ealstan bowed wed like that too but with things the way they are i dont know how wed manage it ethelhelm had never seen vanai in person and ealstan made a point of not referring to her by name but the musician had shown as much by what he didnt say and didnt ask as by what he did that he had a good notion she was a kaunian with things the way they are he echoed well heres hoping they dont stay that way forever my friend you be careful do you hear me ealstan laughed it might have been his fathers laugh coming out of his mouth youre talking to a bookkeeper remember if i werent careful what would i be who knows what youd be ethelhelm answered he hesitated maybe he was wondering how much he ought to say or whether to say anything at last he decided to you arent careful all the time or youd be somebody with a different lady or with no lady at all i suppose so ealstan said but im careful now by the powers above i have to be he didnt wait for ealstan to reply but stepped out into the hallway and closed the door behind him then he hurried downstairs these stairs were carpeted not bare battered boards they didnt smell of cabbage and beans and occasionally of urine ealstan sighed he liked comfort hed grown up in comfort hed thrown it aside for loveand if that wasnt the hoariest cliché in bad romances he didnt know what was vanai made him happymade him joyfulin ways hed never imagined before but that didnt mean he was immune to missing his comforts out on the streets eoforwic had the pallid threadbare look of every other forthwegian town in the third year of a war long lost but eoforwics was a more genteel more splendid shabbiness than say gromheorts the whitebearded man who strode past ealstan wore a herringbone wool tunic shiny with age at the elbows and seat and with a frayed collar but a garment that would have cost a lot new all the capital was like that buildings ruined in one round of fighting or another still showed fine bones buildings that hadnt been ruined also hadnt been kept up brickwork was filthy weeds pushed their way into the sunlight between paving slabs but the memory of what had been persisted if ealstan let his eyes drift a little out of focus he could imagine eoforwic with king penda ruling it not an algarvian governor general when he got back to his own neighborhood he didnt need to let his eyes go unfocused this part of town had been grimy and unkempt during king pendas reign of that he had no doubt whatever even the stray dogs on the narrow winding streets moved warily as if afraid of having their belt pouches slit sure enough the stairwell in his block of flats stank of piss he wondered which neighbor had got drunk and been unable to hold it in it was curiosity of the most abstract sort he didnt really want to find out he knocked on the door to the flat he shared with vanai in the rhythm of a forthwegian childrens verse she unbarred the door which she wouldnt have done had he knocked in an ordinary way an ordinary knock meant a stranger and strangers these days were deadly dangerous to kaunians hello sweetheart ealstan said and quickly slipped inside he barred the door again before vanai could the bar was reinforced with iron the brackets on which it rested and the screws that secured those brackets to the wall were the strongest ealstan could find far stronger than the ones the landlord had used in the flat anyone who wanted to come in after vanai wouldnt have an easy time of it tell me everything you did vanai said after theyd kissed everything from the moment you went out the door cooped up in here she relied on him to be her eyes and ears on the outside world as a blind man might rely on a cleverly trained dog to take him through streets he could not see his arms still around her ealstan obliged not only did he have a good memory for detail he also had a most appreciative audience and as he talked his hands wandered now to the small of vanais back now farther down now straying upward to cup her breast touching her got him as drunk as wine did with never a hangover afterwards she snuggled against him too hed discovered she didnt like being surprised by touch her face would go hard and tight and she would stand as stiff as if carved from wood something bad must have happened to her back in oyngestun but shed never said what it was and he didnt have the nerve to ask but when she wasnt taken aback he pleased her as much as she pleased him and what he had to say pleased her this evening ethelhelm said that about me she demanded and made ealstan repeat it he said that really he is a good fellow isnt he she paused and lost a little of her glow of course hes also supposed to be part kaunian himself ayebut i think he would have said the same thing even if he werent ealstan answered you dont have to be part kaunian to like kauniansi ought to know he stroked her hair she tilted her face up they kissed for a long time at last vanai broke away let me go take the pot off the fire so supper doesnt scorch she said she was gone only a moment then they went into the bedchamber together when theyd finished they lay side by side for a while one of her legs hooked over his he leaned over taking his weight on an elbow so he could caress her with his free hand he knew he would rise again pretty soon at seventeen he could make love about as often as he wanted to but his stomach had other things on its mind and growled loud enough for vanai to hear she giggled ealstans ears heated she said shall we eat now we can always come back with so little else to do and with both of them so young they spent a lot of time in the bedchamber as if to leave no possible doubt about its opinion ealstans stomach rumbled again he laughed which was the easiest way to hide his embarrassment all right he said id better or my belly will shake the building down he spooned up barley and onions and chopped almonds and a few tiny bits of smoked pork thoughtfully smacking his lips you did something different this time vanai nodded you got me that fennel i asked for so i used it is that what it is ealstan said for forthwegians fennel was medicine especially useful in hemorrhoid preparations kaunians did more cooking with it a tradition that went back to the days of the empire ealstan smacked his lips again tastes better than i thought it would listening to himself he admired his own calm he hoped vanai did too by the way the corners of her mouth twitched she was trying not to smile or maybe not to laugh out loud you shouldnt have bought it if you didnt expect me to put it in the food you know i suppose not valiantly ealstan kept eating people did cook with fennel and they didnt perish as a result he had bought this particular batch and it hadnt gone into a hemorrhoid cream and when you got down to it it wasnt so bad interesting flavor he admitted this time vanai did laugh theyd just finished supper when shouts down on the street made them both hurry to the window to find out what was going on night had already fallen and the street was poorly lit but ealstan didnt need long to make sense out of what was happening a couple of men in kilts were forcing a fellow in trousers along the sidewalk one of them took a bludgeon off his belt and walloped the luckless kaunian who cried out again no one came to his rescue gently ealstan pushed vanai away from the window we have to be careful sweetheart he said we dont want them looking up here and seeing you two tears slid down her cheeks by her expression they were tears of rage no of course we dont she said her voice quivering as long as i stay inside my trap here im perfectly safe ealstan didnt know how to answer her he didnt think there was any way to answer all the meanings shed put into that he did the best he could i love you i know you do vanai said that just leaves the rest of the world out of the bargain once again ealstan found himself without a good reply skarnu felt a certain amount of pride at going into pavilosta by himself hed been staying on the farm once gedominus for going on two years now long enough for the locals to conclude hed be around for a while even if theyd call him things like the new fellow the rest of his days silver jingled in the pockets of the homespun trousers merkela had made for him he needed a couple of drill bits he knew more about them than merkela did and at least as much as raunu so he was the logical one to come and buy them even so he felt smallboy enthusiasm for an outing of a sort he hadnt enjoyed before down in priekule he would have gone into an ironmongers bought what he needed and left with as much dispatch as he could in a village like pavilosta hed discovered that was bad manners a customer was supposed to pass the time of day rather than brusquely laying down his money skarnu found that peculiar since the country folk were usually much more sparing of words than his old set back in the capital but it was so after gossip about the weather the way the crops were shaping and a couple of juicy local scandals skarnu managed to make his escape his time in and around pavilosta had changed him more than he would have guessed though for instead of heading straight back to the farm he ambled into the market square to see what he could see and hear what he could hear maybe ill learn something to help in the fight against the redheads he thought but he was too honest with himself to let that stand for long maybe ill pick up something to make merkela laugh or cluck that came closer to the truth and he knew it somehow or other he found himself gravitating toward the enterprising taverner who was in the habit of setting out a table at the edge of the square if he stood around and soaked up a mug of ale or even a couple of mugs of ale he wouldnt look the least bit out of place so he told himself at any rate as a lure to the men who were both thirsty and curious the taverner had set out a couple of copies of a news sheet that had come in from some larger town from ignalina in the east skarnu saw by the masthead full of nonsense and drivel the taverner said as the noble picked up the sheet well why do you have it then skarnu asked to give people something to complain about more than anything else the taverner answered skarnu laughed the other fellow held out his hands what dyou think im joking see for yourselfyoull find out i dont need to read it to know itll be full of all the things the algarvians want us to hear and empty of the ones they dont skarnu said right the first time the taverner said some people believe the manure the news sheets print if you can believe that pal skarnu nodded but said nothing he would have bet that while talking to people who got on well with the redheads the taverner praised the news sheet to the skies with him the fellow went on take a look at this here for instance go on just take a look at it ball in the capital celebrates algarvianvalmieran amity the headline read the subscription fees for the ball had gone to pay for relief for wounded algarvian soldiers skarnu hoped die redheads needed to collect lots and lots of money for such a worthy cause the list of those who attended the ball showed what the algarvians meant by amity too pointing to it skarnu said its all their officers and our women oh ayedid you expect anything different the taverner said with a scornful sneer these noblewomen theyre all whores every cursed one ofem skarnu started to bristle at that slur against his class he had to remind himself that he wasnt at the moment a member of his class his eyes kept sliding down the list it was always brigadier and viscount soandso a redhead coupled with countess whatshername a valmieran he had no doubt that most of the pairs named were coupled literally as well as metaphorically colonel and count lurcanio and marchioness krasta skarnu almost missed that one pairing among so many he stared and stared wishing his eyes had gone on past without catching his sisters name what was she doing what could she be doing but that had an all too obvious answer he stared so hard the taverner noticed whats the matter pal he asked see somebody you know he threw back his head and laughed uproariously at his own wit what would he do if skarnu said aye call me a liar i hope skarnu thought every other possibility struck him as worse likely tell was all he answered which made the taverner chuckle but not chortle again worst was that skarnu couldnt just up and leave he had to hang around and finish his ale and keep on chatting while he was doing it anything else would have been out of character and drawn notice concealing his anguish was as hard as hiding a physical wound would have been hed always known krasta was headstrong and willful but what could have possessed her to take up with an algarvian officer he wondered if she knew shed never been long on selfexamination after he could finally start back to the farm with propriety he heaved a long sigh his sister had made or more likely unmade her bed now she would have to lie in it with this colonel lurcanio skarnu sighed again whatever krasta had done he couldnt do anything about it he walked on for a while before realizing that wasnt true if he and his comrades did somehow manage to expel the algarvians from valmiera lurcanio would go and krasta presumably would stay what would happen then he couldnt imagine nothing pleasanthe was sure of that my own sister he muttered as he tramped along the road it was safe enough he could see a good long blaze in every direction my own sister hed never dreamt of being on opposite sides of a civil war with krasta when he got back to the farm he told raunu and merkela the news straightaway he knew he didnt have to no one else was likely to associate his name and that of a noblewoman in priekule but he preferred not to take the chance better they should hear it from him than from anybody else raunu had been repairing the steps that led up to the farmhouse porch he paused to pound in a couple of nails using what struck skarnu as needless force then he said thats hard sir aye thats about as hard to choke down as anything i can think of merkela took skarnu by the hand come upstairs with me she said raunus ears went red he drove one more nail in a tearing hurry then almost ran out of earshot of the farmhouse skarnu listened to the veterans footfalls fade as he himself followed merkela up the stairs to her bedchamber if this was how she wanted to make him feel better he had no doubt shed succeed in the bedchamber she turned his way he held out his arms to her she stepped toward himand slapped him in the face almost hard enough to knock him off his feet he staggered back one hand coming up to his cheek the other grabbing for the door frame to help him stay upright powers above he exclaimed tasting blood in his mouth what was that for merkelas eyes blazed ill tell you what thats for she snarled its for caring about your sister now that shes an algarvians whore shes still my sister skarnu mumbled his cheek felt as if it were on fire he probed the inside of his mouth with his tongue trying to find out whether merkela had loosened any of his teeth for him you havent got a sister not anymore merkela spoke with great certaintyin that at least she was a lot like krasta if she knew what you were doing dont you think shed blab to this redheaded colonel and count whatever his name was powers below eat him and eat his name too skarnu started to say of course she wouldnt but the words clogged in his throat he had no idea what krasta would do if she found out he was one of the small stubborn band of menand womenkeeping the war against algarve darkness descending sputteringly alive in the countryside maybe she would keep silent but maybe she wouldnt too merkela saw the doubt on his face she nodded you arent trying to lie to me anyhow thats something lurcanio skarnu said his names lurcanio i told you i dont care what his name is merkela answered hes an algarvian thats enough to know your sister gave herself to him and now you have no sister aye skarnu said dully merkela viewed the world in very simple terms hed known that all along this time though try as he would he couldnt find any way to believe she was wrong she eyed him she nodded once more in what looked like grudging approval and then in a swift sudden motion she pulled her tunic up over her head and threw it on the floor she kicked off her sandals yanked down her trousers and drawers and took the couple of steps that brought her over to the bed she lay down on it now she held out her arms to him you have no sister she repeated but you have me getting out of his own clothes was a matter of a moment he lay down beside her clutching at her flesh as fiercely as she grabbed for him very often their lovemaking reminded him more of combat than of anything hed ever known with other women this was one of those times she sank her teeth into his shoulder as if she meant to draw blood her nails scored his back and flanks he squeezed and pinched and prodded her she pressed his hands to her urging him to be rougher yet and when not much later he drove into her he hardly cared whether he hurt her as well as pleasing her by the way she moaned and bucked beneath him she hardly cared either or knew the difference his lips and teeth jammed against hers muffled her final cry a couple of fierce thrusts later he spent himself deep inside her sweat made their bodies stick and slide against each other merkela pushed at him to remind him to take a little weight on his elbows he didnt want to pull away he hoped hed get hard again inside her so they could start again now that he was past thirty though such things didnt happen very often sure enough in a minute or two he flopped out merkela reached for him she wasnt trying to make him rise it seemed almost a gesture of respect for an admired foe later she said theres always later aye skarnu said though he thought she was talking more to part of him than to all of him and indeed merkela started slightly as if his voice reminded her all of him lay in this bed with her maybe she needed reminding even more than a year after theyd started lying down together she often called out her dead husbands name at the moment of climax her expression sharpened she reached out and tapped skarnus chest with a fingernail you have no sister she said once more and he nodded again admitting as much she turned her head south in the direction of priekule her voice sank to a throaty whisper but oh the vengeance you can take on her who was once your kin after the kingdom is free once again skarnu thought about it what would he do if he ever saw krasta face to face again colonel and count lurcanio and marchioness krasta the words in the news sheet seared like vitriol he nodded aye nineteen hajjajs secretaryhis new secretary his loyal secretary his secretary who was not an unkerlanter spystuck his head into the zuwayzi foreign ministers office and said your excellency marquis balastro has arrived very well qutuz i am ready to receive him hajjaj rose to display the algarvianstyle tunic and kilt he had donned for the occasion they were making him sweat unreasonably but that was one of the prices he had to pay for conforming to the diplomatic usages of the rest of derlavai you may bring him in aye your excellency qutuz said and went off to get the algarvian minister a moment later hajjaj and balastro were clasping hands good day good day balastro said he was stocky middleaged vigorous and much smarter than he looked reaching out to pat hajjajs tunic he said if you were a pretty young wench id be disappointed you were wearing this as ishe shrugged a grandiloquent algarvian shrugi can live with it your reassurances do so ease my mind hajjaj said dryly and the redheaded algarvian noble threw back his head and laughed out loud balastro would have laughed out of the other side of his mouth had hajjaj told him ansovald of unkerlant had said something similar not so long before foreigners always thought of zuwayzi nudity in terms of pretty young wenches in one sense hajjaj understood that in another the ways it missed the point never failed to amuse him balastro made himself comfortable with the cushions that did duty for chairs in hajjajs office so did the zuwayzi foreign minister unlike most of his countrymen he had a desk but a low wide one one he could use while sitting on the carpet another compromise between zuwayzi usages and those of the rest of derlavai the secretary came in with a silver tray that held the ritual tea and cakes and wine unlike ansovald balastro appreciated the ritual as long as he and hajjaj nibbled and sipped he stuck to small talk he had an abundant store of it hajjaj enjoyed listening to him and fencing with him he said as muchtea and cakes and wine were also a time for frank praise darkness descending balastro gave back a seated bow i rejoice at pleasing you your excellency he replied i do my best to treat my friend as if he might become an enemy and i hope that precludes inflicting boredom when he quoted the proverb he did so in the original classical kaunian hajjaj sipped at his cup of wine to keep from showing what he thought of that balastro was and was proud to be a man of culture but he was also a man of algarve a man whose kingdom was tormenting the kaunians who had shaped so much of the culture he displayed somehow balastro and his countrymen saw no contradiction there algarvians always wanted everything at once while partaking of tea and cakes and wine hajjaj could not say anything so serious without by his own lights becoming a boor that he would not do presently qutuz took the tray away balastro smiled and said well shall we get on with it i am at your service my lord marquis hajjaj replied as you must know i am always pleased to see you and i am always curious to learn what is in your mind even when you dont like it balastro said without much malice hajjaj gravely inclined his head just so your excellency even when i dont care for what you say how you say it never fails to fascinate me the kaunian proverb crossed his mind again he won a chuckle from balastro but the algarvian minister quickly sobered i can only speak simply here for my message is of the plainestalgarve needs your help my help the zuwayzi foreign minister raised an eyebrow truly your kingdom is in desperate straits if you expect a skinny old man to shoulder a stick for you heh balastro said i thought we were coming to grips with things i mean zuwayzas help of course very well though my reply changes little hajjaj said your realm is also in difficulties if you expect a skinny young kingdom to shoulder many sticks for you of course we are in difficulties balastro saidhe could sometimes be refreshingly frank if we werent we would have taken cottbus before winter froze us in our tracks he could sometimes also be disingenuous winter did rather more than freeze you in your tracks hajjaj pointed out well so it did balastro said we had misfortunes i can hardly deny it but we have the unkerlanters checked now all along the line and this year this year by the powers above well beat them once for all he sat up very straight as if making his bearing serve as proof for his claims from what the zuwayzi generals said to hajjaj and from what he could gather for himself balastro was telling the truth about what had happened the unkerlanters were no longer advancing against mezentios men how much the spring thaw had to do with that hajjaj wasnt sure he suspected no one else was either as for the future you said last summer that you would beat unkerlant then since you were wrong once why should i not think youre wrong twice because of everything we did to unkerlant last year balastro answeredhe had answers for everything as most algarvians did if you hit a man once he may not fall right away but if you hit him again and keep hitting him one blow after another he will go down unkerlant had hit algarve one blow after another too who would fall as far as hajjaj could see remained anyones guess but balastro would doubtless have some compelling explanations as to why it wouldnt be algarve mentally stipulating as much hajjaj asked what he judged the more important question what sort of help do you need from us our main effort this year will fall in the south balastro replied we aim to finish taking away unkerlants breadbasket to lay our hands on the herds of horses and unicorns and behemoths she raises there and to seize the cinnabar mines in the far southwest with all that gone king swemmel can hardly hope to keep standing he was hajjaj judged likely to be right if algarve could seize so much unkerlant would fall whether king mezentios men could do what they had in mind to do though was another question hajjaj said i will not ask my sovereign to send zuwayzi warriors to the far south he would say no and i would agree with him if you need more men than algarve can provide you have yaninan allies there so we do and well use them balastros expression said exactly what he thought of algarves yaninan allies but hajjaj already knew that the algarvian minister went on nor would i ask king shazli to send brave zuwayzin to a land in which bare skin is hardly a fitting uniform however well it may fit he laughed what then hajjaj asked though by now he thought he knew balastro had glided down this ley line before sure enough the algarvian marquis said king mezentio would have you strike hard at the unkerlanters here in the north to tie down as many of their men as you can and to keep them from sending reinforcements to put in the line against us i understand why you say this hajjaj answered slowly but i would remind you your excellency that zuwayza has already done everything in this war that she set out to do we have taken back the line set up in the treaty of bludenz and more land beyond it that suffices the clanfathers would not rejoice to hear that they needed to send their men into new battles would they rejoice to hear that everything theyve won might be lost again through dithering balastro returned hajjaj had to work to hold his face impassive balastro had unerringly found the best argument he could use but hajjaj said i think we understand the notion of enough better than you algarvians some of the things youve done in your fight against unkerlant he broke off hed long since made his feelings about massacring kaunians plain to balastro the algarvian minister quoted another proverb in the original kaunian for a good cause wrongdoing is virtuous hajjaj didnt know whether to admire balastros gall or to be horrified by it after a moments struggle horror won your excellency considering what your kingdom is doing how can you in good conscience let that language flow from your lips they would have done it to us if only theyd thought of it balastro said hajjaj shook his head the kaunian kingdoms had had a good many algarvians under their rule when the derlavaian war began they hadnt slaughtered them maybe as balastro said they hadnt thought of it hajjaj s guess was that they never would have thought of such an appalling thing he poured himself another cup of wine and tossed it down that showed more of what he thought than he was in the habit of doing but he couldnt help it we are your cobelligerents your excellency not your servants he said at last balastro said this will serve your own interest as well as algarves if we are beaten will you be better for it that would depend on how badly you hurt unkerlant before swemmels men took you down hajjaj thought saying as much aloud struck him as undiplomatic what he did say was this is a proposition i can take to his majesty the final choice lies in his hands oh aye likely tell balastro said anyone whos neither blind nor deaf knows where zuwayza comes by her dealings with other kingdoms he pointed straight at hajjaj you are mistaken said the foreign minister who knew perfectly well balastro wasnt king shazli is his own man mine is but the privilege of advising him balastros laugh was loud and long and merry i havent heard anything so funny since the story about the girl who trapped the eel and i was only twelve years old then so i doubt that one would hold up yours will you do me too much credit hajjaj said in a pigs arse balastro said cheerfully but all right well play it your way since you know king shazli so well what do you suppose hes likely to say about what youll ask of him i think he would be likely to ask the generals and the clanfathers for their views hajjaj replied balastro sighed i was hoping youah that is of course king shazli might make up his mind more quickly but i suppose it cant be helped all right your excellency i dont suppose i can complain but tell your generals and clanfathers not to take too long deciding because this dragon is going to fly with you or without you and algarve will remember which i understand hajjaj said unkerlant would not let zuwayza out of the war algarve insisted zuwayza go in deeper trapped hajjaj thought not for the first time like all the rest of the world were trapped bembo and oraste walked warily along the paths that meandered through the biggest park in gromheort the moon had set an hour before they had nothing but starlight by which to see no braver than he had to be bembo carried his stick in his hand not on his belt anything could be lurking in here the algarvian constable complained anything at all im not worried about anything oraste answered anybody nowthats a different business his head kept turning now this way now that so did bembos the bushes by the edges of the paths were shaggy and untrimmed dead grass from the winter before remained tall enough for people to hide in it youd think theyd do a better job of keeping this place up bembo said oraste laughed if they havent got the silver to repair most of their miserable buildings what are the odds theyre going to cut the grass that made an unpleasant amount of sense to bembo even so he said how are we supposed to catch anybody in this miserable place if they dont with a shrug oraste answered as if anybody cares whether we catch these worthless buggers unless they bother algarvians but if the bad actors know we walk through the park they wont be so likely to roost in it huzzah bembo said petulantly and then as he heard a rustle from the dead grass whats that startlement made his voice go high and shrill i dont know oraste by contrast sounded quiet and determined he didnt have a lot of brains he had no imagination at all but he was a terrific fellow to have at your back in a brawl he stepped off the path and moved purposefully toward the sound but wed better find out eh aye bembo agreed in hollow tones as much to keep up his own courage as for any other reason he went on any whoreson out to ambush us wouldnt make so much noise would he heres hoping oraste answered which did little to reassure bembo the other constable added now shut up however rude that was it was good advice like oraste bembo tried to step as lightly as he could though he could hardly help making some noise while walking through thick dry grass the rustling ahead grew louder as the constables drew nearer the breeze picked up it made the grass rustle too with luck it helped mask the sounds bembo and oraste were making bembo sniffed he was no bloodhound but any constable would have recognized that smell fear ebbed just some cursed drunkard whos gone and puked himself he said aye almost invisible in the darkness oraste nodded ought to beat the son of a whore to within an inch of his life for the turn he gave us stinking old forthwegian bum after another couple of steps bembo smelled spilled wine as well as puke he darkness descending thought about putting away his stick and taking his bludgeon off his belt instead sergeant pesaro wouldnt mind if he and oraste did work out their alarm on a noisy drunk pesaro would just regret not being here to share the fun bembo pointed there he is i see him oraste said miserable whitehaired buggerwhy didnt he die twenty years ago along with oraste bembo stood over the drunk he sniffed again then let out a theatrical sigh of relief powers above be praised at least he hasnt gone and shit his trousers he had to listen to his own words to realize what he was seeing hes not a whitehaired old forthwegian hes a blond well curse me if you arent right oraste exclaimed he laughed out loud the most joyous sound bembo had ever heard from him now nobodyll care at all if we kick him to death lets do it i dont know bembo had no great appetite for mayhem all he wanted to do was get out of the park finish his beat and go back to the barracks so he could climb onto his cot again lets just leave him here hes so far gone he wont even know were stomping him and the head hell have in the morningll hurt worse than a boot in the ribs no oraste growled hes not where hes supposed to be is he you bet your arse hes notall these kaunians are supposed to be in their own district and if we catch em outside when they arent working theyre fair game right he looks like hes working hard dont he he laughed but the kaunian however unsanitary he was wasnt so far gone as bembo had thought as oraste drew back his foot for the first kick the blond opened his eyes and sat up he spoke in kaunian a line of poetry bembo recognized and understood because hed had to memorize it the barbarians are at the gates shut up fool oraste said and did kick him an instant laterbembo didnt see howhis partner was lying in the grass with a curse oraste scrambled to his feet he hauled off and kicked the kaunian again again he went sprawling too this time with a howl of pain the kaunian who was having trouble staying in a seated position spoke again this time in understandable if slurred algarvian leave me alone and i will extend you the same privilege leave you alone oraste got up once more powers below eat me if i will you louseridden wait bembo grabbed oraste before his partner could try to kick the drunk again a light had gone on in his mind however dark his surroundings remained i think hes a mage a mage a stage an age an outrage the drunken kaunian said still in algarvian if i were sober i could do great things if i were sober i could could he brought his hands up to his face and began to weep through his sobs he went on but it is not enough it could not be enough nothing could be enough he looked up at the constables for you nothing is enough do you wonder that i am not sober lets get out of here bembo whispered urgently i dont want to tangle with a mage even a drunk one even a lousy one tangling with mages uses up a lot of constables oraste let bembo lead him a few paces away but then shrugged off his comrade that kaunian sorcerously assaulted me he declared as if before a panel of judges he has to pay the price he whirled around and pointed his stick at the drunken blond sorcerer but the kaunian wasnt there bembo stared it wasnt as if the fellow were hiding in the dead grass it was as if hed never been there only the lingering stink of vomit and bembos memory said anything different oraste said nothings enough for us algarvians eh ill show that blond what nothings all about and he blazed at the place where the kaunian had beenthe place where bembo realized the kaunian still had to be a shriek said his beam had found the mark an instant later the kaunian reappearedwounded he couldnt keep holding the masking spell oraste blazed him again the blond jerked as if struck by lightning when the beam bit him with what was plainly dying effort the mage pointed toward the two constables and began intoning a spell in kaunian bembo understood only a couple of words of it but knew it had to be a curse now he blazed at the drunken mage too and his beam caught the kaunian in the face with a last groan the mage sank back and lay very still thats the way oraste said and thumped him on the back see you are good for something after all oh shut up bembo answered you think i want to go around with a wizards last curse on me youre daft but it never would have happened if youd let him alone in the first place he deserved what he got oraste said powers above he deserved more than he got well have to tell pesaro about it when we get back to the barracks bembo said his stomach was lurching unpleasantly hed never killed a man before oraste let out a couple of grunts probably meant for laughter pesaroll give us each a shot of brandy tell us we did good and put us to bedand you know it as well as i do too he was probably right but bembos stomach did another few lurches now that he thought about itsomething he tried not to dohed sent plenty of kaunians off to certain death blazing the drunken mage still felt different he couldnt pretend here as he did there that he really hadnt had anything to do with their deaths blazing a man in the face left no room for doubt about what happened on the other hand the kaunian mage mightwouldhave harmed bembo and oraste if bembo hadnt blazed him the kaunians he hauled out of villages or off the streets of gromheort hadnt done anything to him or to anybody else bembo shook his head thinking about it was much too complicatedand too unpleasant too lets go he said well get out of here well finish our beat and then well go back to the barracks the carrion there wont be going anywhere till somebody comes and picks it up after we report in now youre talking sense oraste said come on shake a leg the rest of the park was quiet even so bembo was glad to escape it he didnt know whether hed been been talking sense or not like any constable with an ounce of brains or more than two weeks experience he craved quiet shifts hed hoped for one tonight hoped and been disappointed other constables patrolled the perimeter of the quarter where gromheorts kaunians had to live but bembo and oraste came near that perimeter as they neared the end of their beat wont be long oraste said i aim to do some serious sleeping once we get in yawning bembo nodded morning twilight was beginning to paint the eastern sky gray and pink he yawned again he didnt like the latenight shift and then he grew alert once more powers above he said softly here comes another kauniana woman looks like even in twilight thiat pale gold hair was hard to miss aye oraste said and then raising his voice what are you doing out of your district sister as the woman got closer bembo saw that her trousers were very tight indeed her tunic of transparent silk she was on the skinny side but worth looking at in slow clear algarvian she answered i am going home my name is doldasai i have leave to be out i was sent for to screw one of your officers you may check this it is true oraste and bembo looked at each other unlike almost any other kaunian an officers whore might be able to make trouble for them if they bothered her bembo said well go on then doldasai strode past him as if he didnt exist he turned to watch her backside but she wasnt working now and put nothing extra into her walk he shrugged and sighed you couldnt have everything as soon as the leyline caravan stopped moving sergeant leudast stood up in the straw of the car in which part of his company had traveled the car was better suited to hauling livestock than soldiers by the lingering stench that filled it it had carried a lot of livestock but unkerlant these days used anything it could leudast undogged the door and slid it open the fresh air that poured into the car made him notice the livestock smell more than he had for a while hed got used to it as the caravan came down into the duchy of grelz come on boys out we go he said now were here and well have work to do his men held in their enthusiasm if theyd ever known any after the botched attack on lautertal they had to be wondering again about the orders they were getting but wondering or not they had to obey so did leudast he knew that too he jumped down out of the car and waved to captain hawart who waved back and came up to him with a grin well what did you think of cottbus when we went through it hawart asked if you hadnt told me we were going that way sir i never would have known it leudast answered and in a closed car like that one i didnt get a chance to see it at all as far as im concerned cottbus smells like cows as far as youre concerned everything smells like cows right now the regimental commander said and leudast could hardly disagree hawart went on but you should have known wed be going through cottbus even if i hadnt told you its the biggest leyline center in the kingdom thats one of the reasons we had to hold onto it no matter what hawart was a man not just of wit but also of education he paid leudast a compliment by assuming the sergeant shared his background leudast knew only too well that he didnt trying to hold his own he said you mean hanging onto cottbus makes us more efficient king swemmel was wild for efficiency which meant his subjects had to be too to leudasts relief and pride captain hawart nodded thats right if wed lost cottbus wed be going around three sides of a rectangle to get soldiers from the north down here to grelz if theyd lost cottbus they would have lost the war hawart didnt dwell on that neither did leudast he said well were here now and we got here the short way as long as we are here wed better make the redheads sorry about it aye thatd be efficient sure enough hawart agreed he didnt dare sound anything but serious about king swemmels favorite word either he slapped leudast on the shoulder get em moving head em east he might have been talking about cattle himself as soon as the whole armys in place well show the algarvians what we can do with shouts and waves and occasional curses leudast did get his men moving the encampment into which hawarts regiment went was one of the biggest ones hed ever seen rockgray tents that stretched and clumped for a couple of miles here and there heavy sticks thrust their noses up into the air pointing to one of them leudast said almost makes me hope the cursed algarvians do send some dragons over those little toys will blaze them right out of the sky so they willif the weather stays clear so their crews can see where to aim and so clouds dont make the beams spread too much to do any good captain hawart told him dont go wishing for any more trouble than youve got leudast youll generally have plenty leudast knew good advice when he heard it he saluted aye sir after he made sure the soldiers in his charge were settled he paced here and there through the encampment trying to figure out what sort of orders the regiment would get when it went into action he returned to his companys tents certain of but one thing whatever was coming would be big the encampment held not only footsoldiers beyond counting but also units of horse and unicorn cavalryleudast liked the bugling cries unicorns let outand a good many behemoths though he would have liked to see even more of the great beasts there was also a large dragon farm oh aye sergeant were as ready as can be for the stinking algarvians one of his troopers said what we get to find out next is how ready the redheads are for us leudast wished he hadnt put it like that the algarvians were rarely anything but ready they could be beatenleudast knew that now where he hadnt been so sure the summer beforebut they always put up every ounce of fight they had anybody who thought that would be different this time had to be drunk either on spirits or perhaps more dangerous on hope two days later hawarts regiment along with a great many others was ordered to the front leudast had got used to marching through land over which the algarvians and unkerlanters had already fought this was another such battered landscape one that looked as if a couple of petulant giants had vented their wrath on it not so far wrong if you looked at things the right way all the eggtossers said one of leudasts troopers a bignosed kid named alboin were going to be dropping plenty on the redheads we are aye leudast agreed well hit em a good first lick thats for sure what would happen after the first lick was anything but sure as he knew too well eggtossers had trouble keeping up with the rest of the army when that army was moving fast hed seen as much hed also seen that unkerlanter eggtossers had more trouble keeping up than their algarvian counterparts alboin had seen no such thing he was one of the reinforcements whod joined the company during the winter by now hed had enough action to be well on the way toward making a veteran but it had all been since the unkerlanter counterattack began well lick em he said sounding absurdly confident aye i think we will leudast said more from policy than from conviction from conviction he went on remember how they handled us at lautertal they can do worse than that im not saying they will but they can sure sergeant but alboin sounded as if he was talking from policy too he hadnt seen the algarvians at their best when the footing was good and they had the chance to maneuver leudast said listen to me if the redheads werent tough nasty buggers would we be fighting them in the middle of the duchy of grelz maybe that got through maybe it didnt either which way alboin shut up and kept marching that suited leudast well enough here and there up at the front the algarvians lobbed eggs at the unkerlanters positions leudast was glad when soldiers waved his company into the shallow trenches from which they would soon attack the earthworks shielded his men and him from bursting eggs then once in the trenches he wasnt so glad any more if the redheads started slaughtering kaunians and making magic the holes grubbed in the ground could turn into death traps he wondered if king swemmels mages would start slaughtering unkerlanter peasants or old women or whomever it was they killed on the one hand he wanted magecraft to help the army move forwardand more urgently to help him stay alive on the other he couldnt help but think about the price his kingdom was paying to try to beat back the algarvians captain hawart came along the line the attack goes in tomorrow morning before sunrise he said and walked on to keep spreading the word leudast spread it too his troopers talked among themselves in low voices they were ready they were more than readythey were eager leudast wondered how many of them would be eager after the attack even if it succeeded not many if his own experience was any guide well before sunrise the unkerlanter eggtossers started pounding at the algarvian positions farther east leudast hoped they did lots of damage because they were surely alerting king mezentios men to the coming assault and the algarvians responded flinging eggs of their own at the unkerlanters but as best leudast could judge his side had the better of the exchange he huddled in his blanket and tried to sleep as black night gave way to gray twilight the ground shook beneath him he leaped up ready to scramble out of the trench for his life if the shaking got worse it didnt peering over the lip of the trench he saw purplish flames spurting up from the ground he and his comrades would have to cross these were unkerlanter mages plying their trade not algarvians leudast muttered under his breath hoping the sacrifice from his countrymen would help the army win victory whistles shrilled all along the line still not officially an officer leudast couldnt add another strident note instead he shouted come on you buggers they wanted to quarrel with us and now theyre going to pay the price urra his troopers roared as they burst from the sheltering trenches urra king swemmel swemmel urra yelling himself leudast ran forward too one tiny drop in a rockgray wave however many of their own theyd killed to make the magic against mezentios men the unkerlanter mages hadnt got rid of all algarvian resistance eggs fell among the advancing unkerlanter troopers making holes in their lines that reserves had to fill redheaded soldiers blazed down unkerlanters too but try as they would they couldnt stop or even seriously slow king swemmels men here and there along the shattered line an algarvian trooper would throw up his hands and try to surrender sometimes the redheads managed to do it rather more often they got blazed down forward leudast shouted to his men echoing captain hawart who was doing his best to be everywhere at once for his regiment unkerlanter magic had done dreadful things to the algarvian trenches so dreadful that leudast and his countrymen had trouble pushing across the shattered ground flames still sullenly flickered every few feet resistance from the redheads stayed light this is almost too easy leudast called to hawart the next time he saw him i like it said alboin who chanced to be close by but hawart looked worried aye it is he said i havent seen enough dead algarvians to satisfy me nor anything close where are they curse them buried when their trenches all caved in leudast suggested i hope so the officer answered if they arent were going to run into them pretty soon and they wont be glad to see us powers below eat them we werent glad to see them either leudast said he ran and scrambled on wondering how deeply the algarvians had fortified their positions there seemed to be no end to trenches and foxholes and barricades and then as hawart had worried about the algarvians started popping up out of holes beyond the reach of the unkerlanters magecraft after that nothing was easy anymore along with the rest of his company trasone stood at stiff attention in front of the barracks in aspang major spinello strode down the line with a box of medals he paused in front of each man to pin one onto him kiss him on the cheek and murmur a few words before moving on when he got to trasone he said for making it through this cursed winter and presented the decoration after the ritual kiss that accompanied it he pinned an identical decoration on clovisio at last everybody had his medal spinello strutted away trasone looked down at the decoration it was stamped with a map of eastern unkerlant and two words winter war he tapped sergeant panfilo on the shoulder isnt that grand weve all got frozenmeat medals to call our own panfilo laughed but not for long therere a lot of dead men only thawing out now he said if you want to trade places with one ofem i doubt hed complain i like being alive just fine thanks sergeant trasone said but twenty years from now im going to look at this cursed chunk of polished brass and my feetll start to freeze and ill taste behemoth thats starting to go bad once i get home thats the stuff i want to forget not remember now you do aye panfilo agreed but how many times have you listened to veterans of the six years war going on and on about everything they went through trasone grunted that had the unpleasant feel of probability to it good he said my old man always bored me now ill have an excuse to bore my kids if i ever have any he glanced west in the direction of the unkerlanters who still tossed eggs at aspang they wanted to make sure he wouldnt so far theyd had no luck when he woke up before dawn the next morning he thought theyd smuggled more eggtossers up close enough to strike at aspang but the rumbling roar he discovered came from the south not from the west and while there were a great many bursts none seemed close to the city whats going on he asked around a yawn as he got up from his cot are the unkerlanters kicking up their heels or have we got something laid on down south nobody told me anything about an attack down south sergeant panfilo said not yet anyhow i know were shifting men down there but we arent set to move this soon its the unkerlanters then trasone said if they cant get us out of aspang from the front theyre going to try and do it from the back fits the buggers doesnt it panfilo laughed so it does now we have to find out if they get anywhere if they dont we can sit tight here but if they do were liable to have to go out and work for a living again oh aye this is a rest cure this is trasone snorted come to beautiful aspang for your health the garden spot of southern unkerlant only eight months of winter a year dont fancy the weather wait a bit itll get worse if you got any worse theyd fling you in the bloody guardhouse panfilo said too cursed early to be carrying on like that all the rest of the day trasone kept an ear on the racket from the south it didnt fade if anything it got louder he drew his own conclusions quietly and without any fuss he made sure his kit was ready to sling onto his back at a moments notice he wasnt the only veteran doing the same thing either major spinello burst into the barracks the next morning lets go lets go lets go he shouted full of energy as usual swemmels boys are getting rowdy and its up to us to show em thats our job he screamed at the men who werent ready to move on the instant and cursed the ones who were because they hadnt made sure their comrades were too that meant all the other officers and sergeants started screaming too if theyd wanted the battalion ready to move at a moments notice they could have started screaming earlier for one thing they werent screaming at him because he was ready for another hed heard a lot of screaming in his time it didnt faze him under the lash of spinellos tongue the soldiers in the battalion tramped to the leyline caravan depot and filed aboard cars that looked to have had better lifetimes were going down to hit the unkerlanters in the flank spinello said as they boarded swemmels boys are as nervous about their flanks as so many virgins and were going to screw em as they glided south out of aspang they passed the wreckage of several caravans lying by the side of the ley line cursed unkerlanters are a pack of nervous virgins trasone remarked and got a laugh if the unkerlanters had managed to plant one more egg along the ley line he and his comrades wouldnt have the chance to do much in the way of seduction but the leyline caravan stopped where its operator wanted it to not at the whim of some unkerlanter irregulars trasone and his fellow troopers tumbled out again major spinello was shouting lets go what are you waiting for we have to move curse it maybe the major had been talking by crystal while on the caravan because he seemed to know just where he was going after spinello led the battalion out of a stretch of woods trasone exclaimed in delight behemoths our behemoths clovisio said where did they come from i dont know and i dont care trasone said theyre here and the ground is nice and solid so they can move and when weve got behemoths than can do what theyre supposed to do the unkerlanters had better watch out as if to underscore that the behemoths trotted forward spinello shouted come on you lazy buggers give em a hand you know what to do not that many months off garrison duty he didnt have any experience of what to do himself but he was right not only in his tactics but in being sure the veterans he commanded knew what to do they hurried along with and behind the behemoths ready both to protect them and to swarm through any holes they punched in the enemys lines unkerlanter eggtossers kept pounding away at the algarvian positions to the south and now to the southeast by the sound of the fighting king swemmels men had pushed the algarvians back that worried trasone but sergeant panfilo heard the same thing and grinned from ear to ear those whoresonsll be so busy looking straight ahead ofem they wont even think about peering sideways till its too late trasone thought about that heres hoping youre right sergeant by the affronted pose he struck panfilo might have been standing on the street of some algarvian town rather than trotting across a wheatfield that was coming up rank with weeds of course im right have you ever heard me wrong only when you talk trasone assured him panfilos glare deserved to go up on the stage after a moment though the sergeant chuckled and got going again and panfilo did turn out to be right half an hour later the crews on the backs of the behemoths started lobbing eggs at swarthy soldiers in rockgray mezentio major spinello shouted and all the troops echoed him mezentio the unkerlanters had been moving forward against the algarvians to the east of them when doing what they were ordered to do whether that was making an attack or defending a position they were among the stubbornest warriors in the world along with so many other algarvian soldiers trasone had found that out the hard way when taken by surprise taken by surprise the unkerlanters broke and fled in wild disorder some of them threw away their sticks so they could run faster to complete their demoralization a squadron of algarvian dragons swooped out of the sky to drop eggs on some of them flame down others and start fires even in the green damp fields after that some of the unkerlanters stopped running and threw up their hands in surrender the algarvians blazed down a few of them in the heat of the moment but only a few most got relieved of whatever they had worth stealing and sent up in the direction of aspang keep moving major spinello shouted not just to his own troopers but also to the behemoths crews and to anyone else who would listen if we just keep moving by the powers above maybe we can get em all in a sack cut em off from their pals and pound em to pieces how does that sound sounds good to me trasone said more to himself than to anyone else he wondered how many other algarvian officers were shouting the same thing on every stretch of this counterattack ruthless speed and drive had taken algarve deep into unkerlant now the algarvians could use them againand the unkerlanters trasone vowed were going to be sorry he also wondered what the unkerlanter officers were shouting right now the ones whose orders mattered the ones with the higher ranks wouldnt even know things had gone wrong yet the unkerlanters were too cheap or too lazy or too ignorant to give their soldiers as many crystals as they needed that had cost them before he hoped it would cost them again because swemmels men didnt have a lot of crystals they made elaborate plans ahead of time junior officers who changed plans without orders got into trouble here that meant the unkerlanters kept trying to go east even after the algarvian counterattack against their northern flank it also meant the counterattack got a lot farther than it would have otherwise not until midaftemoon did swemmels soldiers realize the algarvians had thrown a lot of men into the fight and really needed to be stopped by then it was too late behemoths crushed the first few unkerlanter regiments that turned from east to north the unkerlanters strokes came in one after another instead of all at once which made them easier to break up the enemy even flung unicorn cavalry into the fight trasone enjoyed blazing down cavalrymen he enjoyed it even more when they rode unicorns than when they were on horseback for centuries unicorns with ironshod horns had been the dreadful queens of the battlefield terrorizing footsoldiers with their unstoppable charges memories of them lingered in soldiers minds to this day even if sticks had made cavalry charges more dangerous to riders than to the men they attacked these days behemoths ruled the field they were ugly but strong enough to carry not just soldiers but also eggtossers and armor the eggs they flung at the charging unicorns knocked down the splendid beautiful beasts sometimes three and four at a time wounded unicorns screamed like women in torment wounded riders screamed too trasone blazed them once they were off their unicorns with as much relish as while they still rode the unkerlanters were brave trasone had seen that ever since the fighting started here and now it did them little good a scratch force of cavalry couldnt hope to stop superior numbers of footsoldiers supported by behemoths king swemmels men fell back in confusion trasone slogged after them he and his fellow algarvians were going forward again all was right with the world pekka went down on one knee first to siuntio then to ilmarinen as if they were two of the seven princes of kuusamo ilmarinens chuckle and the leer that went with it said he knew the ancient significance of that particular gesture of obeisance from a woman to a man siuntio surely knew it too but was too much a gentleman to show he knew and pekka by this time was used to ignoring ilmarinen at need thank you both from the bottom of my heart she said without you i dont think i could have persuaded the illustrious professor heikkishe laced the words with as much sardonic venom as she could heikki was a nobody even in veterinary sorceryto release the funds to go on with the experiment always a pleasure to make a fool look foolish ilmarinen said rolling his eyes oh and she is too siuntio said my dear i only wish our intervention had been unnecessary were prince joroinen among the living you would have had everything you needed in this laboratory here at the crook of a finger aye ilmarinen said you ask me its amazing you could get any work done at all in this miserable little hole of a laboratory before shed seen the elegant facilities at the university up in yliharma pekka would have bristled at that till then she hadnt thought kajaani city college was a bad place to do research she knew better now even if the algarvian attack that had killed joroinen had also kept her from performing her longplanned experiment we do most of our work inside our heads and can do it anywhere siuntio said with a chuckle the advantage of theory over practice we only need the laboratory to see that weve done our sums correctly or more often that weve done em wrong ilmarinen put in siuntio chuckled again this time on a note of wry agreement pekka was too nervous to chuckle like any theoretical sorcerer she knew her limits in the laboratory and knew she was going to have to transcend them lets see what happens when we use the divergent series she said her voice harsh bowing to her senior colleagues she went on you both know what im going to doand you both know what youll have to do if things go wrong we do siuntio said firmly oh aye indeed we do ilmarinen nodded the only thing we dont know is whether well be able to do it before things get too far out of control for anybody to do anything his smile showed stained snaggly teeth of course like i said we do the experiment to find out what else weve done wrong that isnt the only reason siuntio said with a touch of reproof before the two distinguished old men could start snapping and barking again pekka repeated lets see what happens take your places if you please and no more talking unless its life or death if you distract me thats just what its liable to be she wished leino were down here with her instead of working on his own projects somewhere else in this rambling sprawling building her husband was all business when he went into the laboratory but being all business he cared little for theory and theory was what counted here one more thing to worry about if the theory was wrong and the experiment went disastrously awry she might take him with her in her own failure if she did though shed never know it looking from siuntio to ilmarinen she asked are you ready it was an oddly formal question she knew they were but until they acknowledged as much she would do nothing siuntios response was also formal he dipped his head a gesture halfway between a nod and a bow ilmarinen simply nodded but his expression held no mockery now he was as alive with curiosity as either of his colleagues pekka went to the cage of one of the rats shed selected she carried the cage over to one of the white tables in the laboratory after she stepped away siuntio came up and peering through his spectacles read the rats name and identification number pekka solemnly repeated them and wrote them down then pulled another cage off the shelf she carried this one to an identical table and set it there now ilmarinen stepped forward to read the beasts name and number again pekka repeated them and set them in her journal she said for the record be it noted that the specimens are grandfather and grandson she wrote that down too siuntio said be it also noted that this experiment unlike others we have attempted before uses a spell with divergent elements to explore the inverse relationship between the laws of similarity and contagion pekka also set that down in the journal ilmarinen said be it further noted that we dont know what in blazes were doing that were liable to find out the hard way and that if we do they wont find enough pieces of us to put on the pyre let alone the precious experimental diary mistress pekka is keeping there and be it noted that im not writing a word of that pekka said ilmarinen blazed her an impudent grin she felt like blazing him too with the heaviest stick she could find enough siuntio said sometimesnot alwayshe was able to abash ilmarinen not the least of his sorcerous abilities the other senior theoretical sorcerer quieted down now even if pekka doubted he was abashed i begin pekka said then she spoke the ritual words any kuusaman mage used before commencing a spell they helped calm her kuusamo would go on even if she didnt just as it had gone on for the millennia before she was born reminding herself helped take the edge off her nerves she started to incant her voice rising and falling speeding and slowing in the intricate rhythms of the spell she and her fellow theoreticians had crafted it wasnt the same version of the spell as she had begun to use in yliharma when the algarvians struck since then she and ilmarinen and siuntio had gone over it line by line pruning here strengthening there doing their best to see that no error remained in either the words of the spell or the passes she made while chanting spring in kajaani was none too warm but sweat sprang out on pekkas face she could feel the energies she was trying to summon and control they were strong strong every calculation had said they would be but the distance between knowing and understanding had never felt greater powers above aid us siuntios voice was soft but very clear he sensed it too then ilmarinen muttered something pekka didnt think it was anything like a prayer even the rats started scurrying around in their cages they worked at the doors with clever paws clever but not clever enough the older one squeaked in fright the younger one burrowed down into the straw at the bottom of his cage and tried to hide pekka didnt blame him she wanted to hide too the conjuration shed made before the one that had started her down this ley line had been nothing like this she wondered if some mage in the kaunian empire or during the long confused time after its fall had tried a conjuration like this if so he hadnt lived through itwhich the ancients would no doubt have termed summoning up a demon too strong to control that oldfashioned terminology had always made pekka smile till now what went through her mind now was imust be mad even for attempting this but she shook her head the world around her had gone mad she hadnt she hoped she hadnt anyhow she kept on with the spell she had by now gone much too far into it to back out without consequences almost as bad as the ones she was trying to createand with none of the safeguards her two colleagues could she hoped provide if everything went according to plan dont do anything foolish she always told herself that when she went to work magic instead of just working on it she knew her limits as a practical mage because she knew them and because she knew she was so close to them she was doubly careful she could afford a mistake no more than she could afford to try to abandon the conjuration ahh ilmarinen murmured for a moment pekka intent on spell and passes didnt understand what had pulled that lowvoiced exclamation from him then she too saw the thin pale line of light running between the cages that held the two rats she didnt smileshe was too busy to smilebut inside she exulted theory had predicted that discharge of energies and theory so far was proved right as theory had also predicted the line of light grew brighter with startling speed pekka had to squint through narrowed eyes to tolerate the glare one of the ratsshe never knew which onesqueaked in alarm if the conjuration didnt end soon that light itself might prove enough to wreck the laboratory now pekka worked with her eyes squeezed shut as tight as she could force them but the brilliance swelled and swelled she couldnt turn away not unless she wanted to turn straight toward ruin she smelled thunderstorms as she might have if the beam from a stick passed close to her head she wished the forces she was challenging were as trivial as that for a terrifying instant she felt heat heat that made the inside of a furnace seem like the land of the ice people the thunderclap that followed almost knocked her off her feet all the windows in the laboratory broke spraying shards of glass out onto the lawns silence stillness im alive pekka thought ihope the glass didnt hurt anyone and then professor heikki will be angry at me for putting all those windows on the departments budget the absurdity of that last thought made her snicker but didnt make it any less likely to be true the odors of growing grass and of flowers bursting into bloom wafted into the laboratory chamber through the newly unglazed windows along with them pekkas nose caught a harsh reek of corruption one way or another the experiment had come to completion lets see what weve got ilmarinen said echoing her thoughts pekka went to the cage that had housed the older rat he was still thereafter a fashion she nodded at seeing his moldering remains then she walked over to the other cage the one that heldor rather had heldhis grandson but for straw and a few seeds it was empty now congratulations my dear siuntio said this confirms your experiment with the two acorns confirms and amplifies it and thanks to the refined conjuration and the life energy of the rats it also confirms we can use this means to release sorcerous energy and more will come ilmarinen grunted divergent series they diverged all right aye pekka said still looking from one cage to another the one went on past the end of his span the other back before the beginning of his time she pointed to the empty cage where is he now was he ever truly here did he ever truly exist what would it be like to be pushed out of the continuum so do you want to find out ilmarinen asked experimentally i mean pekka shuddered powers above no one more long day like so many long days climbing down from the wagon that had brought him back to gromheort from labor on the roads leofsig wondered if he shouldnt have picked a different line of work after all he thought about going to the baths to revive himself but lacked the energy to walk the couple of blocks out of his way he would have needed to get there home he muttered food sleep as far as he was concerned nothing else mattered tonight sleep loomed largest of all if he hadnt known the algarvian constables were liable to take him for a drunk and beat him up he could easily have lain down on the sidewalk and fallen asleep there he put one foot in front of the other till he made it to his own front door but even as he knocked he heard a commotion inside he came to alertness commotion was liable to mean danger for him or his whole family if for instance sidroc had got his memory back someone in there heard his knock and lifted the bar off its brackets leofsig worked the latch and opened the door and there stood sidroc a large uncharacteristic grin spread over his heavy features ive finally gone and done it he declared well good for you leofsig answered done what now if its what it sounds like i hope she was pretty his cousin guffawed but then shook his head no not that though i wont have any trouble getting that too whenever i want it ive gone and signed up for plegmunds brigade thats what ive done oh leofsig said no wonder everybody in there is screaming his head off then you can hear the racket out here powers above you can probably hear the racket over in the counts castle wouldnt surprise me one bit sidroc said i dont care i made up my mind and im going to do it powers below eat the unkerlanters and the cursed kaunians too but fighting for algarve leofsig shook his head he was too tired to argue as hard as he would have at another time let me by would you i want to get some wine and i want to get some supper now sidroc said oh and stood aside as leofsig went past him he continued not so much fighting for algarve as fighting for me i want to go do this i want to go see what the war is all about thats only because you havent done it leofsig said remembering the smell of entrails laid openand remembering the smell of fear too you sound like my father sidroc said scornfully he hasnt done it either so he doesnt know what hes talking about leofsig answered relishing the chance to say that about uncle hengist but i have and i do and im telling you youre crazy too you can tell me whatever you want it doesnt matter worth a sack of beans because i signed the papers this afternoon sidroc said anybody who doesnt like it can cursed well lump it leofsig wanted to lump sidroc but he also still wanted supper and sleep and a house without sidroc in it was liable to be a more peaceable place so all he said was have it your way and walked down the entry hall and turned left into the kitchen his mother and sister were in there i heard you talking with him elfryth said in a stage whisper fighting for mezentio after what the redheads have done to our kingdom the very idea did you persuade him not to no mother leofsig answered and poured himself some wine and do you know what else i didnt try very hard good conberge didnt bother holding her voice down i wont be sorry to see him out of this house and nobody can make me say i will having him here has been nothing but trouble if the algarvians want him theyre welcome to him as far as im concerned sidroc must have gone back into the dining room after letting leofsig in for more shouts erupted from there he and uncle hengist were going at each other hammer and tongs leofsig cocked his head to one side wanting to catch some of the choicer names they were throwing back and forth he almost missed his mother saying herei had a kettle of hot water over the fire waiting for you you can wash now reluctantly he came back to the real world oh thank you he said and hoped he didnt sound too vague conberge set a basin on the floor for him she and elfryth headed out of the kitchen to give him privacy in which to wash over her shoulder conberge said take the pork stew off the fire if it starts to smell like its burning all right leofsig worked the pump handle in the sink to get cold water to mix with what his mother had heated for him then he scrubbed away at the dirt and sweat that clung to him a washrag and a basin didnt let him do the job he could have at the baths but he hadnt had to go out of his way to get here his father came into the kitchen while he was drying off leofsig didnt know whether hestan had been home for a while or just stepped in his father quickly made that plain youll have heard the news i expect oh aye leofsig answered with a nod the whole neighborhood will have heard it by now except for that old deaf man three doors down hestan chuckled then sighed that would be funny if only it were funny if you know what i mean sidroc doesnt want to listen to anybody though i wish he would you and uncle hengist are the only ones who do leofsig said as another blast of shouts came out of the dining room and i thought youd be glad to see sidroc gone from most of the things youve said his father sighed again i would have been powers above i was till he said he was really going after that its hard to watch your own kin walk into what cant be anything but a big mistake if he goes ealstans safer leofsig pointed out thats so hestan said but sidroc hasnt shown any sign of recalling just what happened there i never felt safe enough about it to tell ealstan he could come home and he probably wouldnt want to now not when hed have to try to bring that girl with him vanai leofsig said remembering how startled hed been when ealstan told him her name aye now that the redheads are shutting so many of the kaunians away how could he bring her back to gromheort before hestan could answer sidroc shouted curse you you old shitter powers below eat you im going where i am wanted a moment later the door opened and then slammed shut the whole house shook that seems to settle that leofsig said and his father nodded he continued im sorry but im not sorry if that makes any sense i wont miss him very much and im safer with him gone too even if he hasnt made little sly cracks about turning me in to the algarvians for a while i dont think he ever meant them hestan said i hope he never did ill tell you that leofsig was convinced his cousin had thought hard about betraying him to the algarvian authorities but held his tongue sidroc hadnt actually done it and pretty soon hed get shipped off to unkerlant hed have plenty of more urgent things to worry about there uncle hengist came into the kitchen he was hestans younger brother and the more dapper of the two now he looked older than leofsigs father and worn to a nub hes gone he said as if he couldnt believe it he walked out of here hes gone aye hestan said leofsig busied himself with putting away the basin that way uncle hengist wouldnt be able to see the look on his face as hed said to his father the whole block knew sidroc was gone who would have thought hed want to go fight for the algarvians hengist said though sidroc had been talking about doing that for months and hengist had had some things to say about the redheads that didnt sit well with leofsig either dont you think theyre the coming thing anymore uncle he asked his father gave him a look that told him to keep his mouth shut uncle hengist scowled but answered even if they are thats no reason to take up arms for them theyve got plenty of soldiers of their own you cant have it both ways was what leofsig wanted to say one thing that stopped him was his fathers warning glance which had got more urgent than ever the other was remembering that hengist like sidroc knew hed escaped from an algarvian captives camp he didnt dare push his uncle too far not when he couldnt fully trust him hestan said powers above keep the boy safe hengist boy is right hengist burst out but hes so cursed sure hes a man and how can anyone tell him anything different hell learn hestan said you did i did leofsig has we just hope he doesnt pay too high a price for his lessons easy for you to say uncle hengist said no its not leofsigs father answered i had a son in the army the forthwegian armyhe couldnt resist the dig and hengists mouth tightenedand my other boys gone and who can say what happened to him no one in gromheort knows where ealstan is he might have fallen off the face of the earth i never have understood what happened the day he disappeared hestan the day sidroc got hurt hengist said if i did understand it i think i might have something more to say to you he turned on his heel and walked away hes liable to be more dangerous than sidroc leofsig said in dismay after his uncle had gone i dont think so hestan answered and then with one more sigh i hope not he has other things than us on his mind right now anyhow now that he wont have sidroc staying with him he ought to move out of here and find a place of his own leofsig said do you think so his father sounded genuinely curious my notion has always been that its better to have him where we can keep an eye on him than to let him go off on his own and brood am i wrong leofsig considered no i dont suppose you are i wish you were but i dont think you are from the hallway conberge called are you decent in there if you are mother and i would like to finish cooking come ahead leofsig said i have a better appetite for pork stew than i do for quarreling right now his father raised an eyebrow then solemnly nodded twenty for the first time since an egg from an algarvian dragon killed eforiel cornelu was back in his element riding a leviathan in search of the most harm he could do to king mezentios followers the leviathan a lagoan beast wasnt trained up to the standards of the sibian navy but she was still young and she could learn hed already seen as much true these days cornelu patrolled the strait of valmiera not the narrower channel that separated sibiu from the mainland of derlavai his own kingdom remained under algarvian occupation powers above his own wife remained under algarvian occupation but he was fighting back again he tapped the leviathan in a pattern the same in the lagoan service as it had been in that of sibiu obediently the great beast raised the front part of her body out of the water lifting cornelu with it so he could see farther if an algarvian ship glided down a ley line without his seeing it he could hardly try to sink it even with the added range to his vision he saw nothing but sea and sky he tapped the leviathan again and it sank back down into the water by the way the beast quivered under him he knew it thought rearing was part of an enjoyable game that was all right with him he would enjoy the game if it led him to algarvians king mezentios men wouldnt but sending them to the bottom would only make cornelu happier now he muttered i think weve been traveling along a ley line but id better make sure like the skintight suit he wore his belt was made of rubber he took from one of the pouches on the belt an instrument of bronze and glass inside the hollow glass sphere that made up the bulk of it were two vanes of thinnest gold leaf they stood well apart from each other cornelu let out a satisfied grunt that the vanes repelled each other showed they were in the presence of sorcerous energyand the only sources of sorcerous energy out on the ocean were the ley lines that formed a grid on sea and land alike if cornelu waited here long enough a ship was sure to pass close by but he had no idea how long long enough might be and loathing the algarvians as he did he was not in the mood to wait he wanted to hunt he was a coursing wolf not a spider sitting in a web waiting for a butterfly to blunder along and give him a meal he turned his instrument this way and that in his hands watching the goldleaf vanes flutter as he did he knew they spread wider when parallel to a ley line than when perpendicular to it as hed thought the line on which hed positioned himself and his leviathan ran from northeast to southwest without hesitation he urged the leviathan in the latter direction toward the coast of algarvianoccupied valmiera and of algarve itself if you dont go where the bees are you wont get any honey he told the leviathan talking to this new beast wasnt like talking with eforiel hed told his old leviathan everything with this one he still felt a certain reserve he wasnt sure how much it understood eitherafter all it spoke lagoan not sibian cornelu knew that was an absurd conceit but he couldnt get it out of his mind the leviathan swam along happily enough it was doing what it would have done had it never made the acquaintance of mankind foraging when it got into a school of mackerel its long toothy jaws opened and closed snapping up fish after fish the only notice it took of cornelu on its back and of the eggs strapped beneath its belly was that they made it swim a little slower and more awkwardly than it would have otherwise that let a couple of mackerel it should have caught get away but it still caught plenty and didnt seem aggrieved come on my beauty cornelu urged it come on bring me to a ship it doesnt have to be a great big ship just bring me to a ship he was lying he knew the kind of ship to which he wanted the leviathan to bring him to a great algarvian floating fortress all bristling with heavy sticks and with eggtossers sending a vessel like that to the bottom would be the beginning of revenge for everything algarve had done to his kingdom and to his life but sending a vessel like that to the bottom wouldnt be easy he knew as much he would have to be sly he would have to be sneaky he would have to be lucky the sailors aboard a floating fortress would always be alert against attack by leviathans so would the mages aboard such a ship though he didnt worry so much about them as he would have on land he had his instrument for detecting sorcerous energy but wasnt using any to speak of that made his own sorcerous footprint very small and hard to note sea sky sea sky still nothing but sea and sky as far as he could see he muttered in frustration and then he spied something neither sky nor sea but not something to delight him as a hunter instead he cursed and ordered his leviathan to dive he hoped the dragon gliding through the air far above had not spied him his rubber suit and sorcery kept the cold of the southern seas from slaying him by stealth another sorcery let him get air from the water around him so that he could stay down as long as the leviathan could no mage had ever successfully applied that latter spell to a leviathan to let it stay submerged without ever needing to come up and breathe nor had any mage ever made a spell to let a man dive as deep as a leviathan could without the weight of the water above him crushing out his life he had the leviathan stay submerged as long as it could when it finally had to rise to spout he anxiously scanned the heavens if that dragonflier had spotted him before he took cover below the surface of the sea an egg might fall out of the sky at any moment or the dragon might come skimming low over the waves to flame him off his leviathan he hated dragons and dragonfliers not least because they could hurt him and he couldnt hit back but once more he saw nothing but sea and sky he breathed a sigh of relief at what had annoyed him only minutes before he hated leyline warships too but he hated them because they belonged to algarve aye they could hurt him he could hurt them too though if only he got the chance patting the leviathan cornelu asked now which way did you swim when you went under the leviathan couldnt answerand by his own silly logic wouldnt even have understood the question being a lagoan beast he pulled out the instrument he used to detect sorcerous energy both goldleaf vanes hung limp which meant the leviathan had swum away from the ley line cornelu turned the instrument in his hands the vanes stayed limp cornelu cursed loudly and foully why not no one was around to hear him with a couple of taps he ordered the beast to swim south after what he judged to be about half a mile he stopped the leviathan and examined the instrument again if anything the vanes hung closer together than they had before cornelu grunted he hadnt found the ley line but hed found where it wasnt that gave him a better idea of where it was he turned the leviathan back toward the north and swam pasthe hoped he swam pastthe point where hed begun trying to reacquire it then he checked the instrument once more and nodded to himself the vanes were separating before long hed found the ley line again he sent the leviathan southwest down it these were algarviancontrolled waters where were the warships with which the algarvians controlled them most patrols by the nature of thingsthe ocean was vast the targets upon it few and small and far betweenended in futility cornelus whole war up till now had been futile he didnt know how much more futility he could stand that thought had hardly crossed his mind before he spotted a speck on the horizon hope flooded into him if he could bring his leviatjhan back to setubal after sinking an algarvian ship even the haughty lagoans would have to give him his due haughty wasnt quite fair the lagoans thought they were better than anybody else but they didnt flaunt it the way say valmierans did for his part cornelu remained convinced one sibian was worth three lagoans any day nobody who talked through his nose the way king vitors subjects did was altogether to be trusted well now cornelu had the chance to prove that of which he was convinced he urged the leviathan toward the shipand the ship was coming toward him too he couldnt have caught it from behind not unless it was just lazing along he pulled a brass spyglass off his belt a minor magic kept its lenses dry so he could peer through it right away the ship seemed to leap toward him he gasped for a moment he thought it was a floating fortress then he realized it was the next class down a leyline cruiser his lips skinned back from his teeth in a savage smile it will have to do he said through the spyglass he saw sailors on the deck of the cruiser a jack of green white and red snapped in the breeze cornelu nodded he wouldnt be attacking a lagoan ship by mistake that would be biting the hand that fed him those sailors would be on the lookout for leviathans if they spied him he would never get close enough to plant his egg against the cruisers flank he fought the algarvians ironically by keeping his mount at the surface mezentios men would be watching for the big plumes of vapor that rose when a leviathan came up from the depths so long as his beast kept breathing steadily it wouldnt give itself away too soon cornelu had to gauge when to dive for his attack if he waited too long mezentios men would spot him if he dove too soon his leviathan wouldnt be able to come alongside the cruiser he would have to surface before it got there and then he would really be in trouble when he judged the moment ripe he tapped the leviathan which slipped beneath the waves and sped toward the leyline cruiser it knew it had to swim alongside or under the ship long enough to let him attach the egg hed sometimes wondered if leviathans had any true notion why men did such things the beasts fought among themselves over mates and sometimes over food did they know their masters fought too and then cornelu had no more time to wonder for the leviathan brought him up right below the cruiser his lost eforiel could not have done a finer job all he had to do was pick the moment to signal the leviathan to swim bellyup beneath the algarvian warship so he could slide along the harness and release an egg the egg clung to the hull of the leyline cruiser as soon as its shell touched the ship a spell began to bring it to life cornelu regained his position near the leviathans blowhole urgently now he ordered his mount away from the ship the egg would burst whether he was close or far he didnt want to have to endure a burst close by this egg was far heavier and more potent than any a dragon could haul into the air he also wanted to get far enough from the leyline cruiser to let the leviathan surface safely he didnt quite manage that the leviathan had to spout a little sooner than hed expected the algarvians flashed mirrors in his direction they werent sure to which side he belonged he took a mirror from his belt pouch and flashed back his signal would be wrong but as long as they kept playing with mirrors they wouldnt be lobbing eggs at him and his leviathan swam farther from the cruiser with every heartbeat before long the algarvians realized he wasnt one of their own eggs began flying through the air toward the leviathan the first couple fell short but the enemys aim was liable to improve in a hurry then the egg hed planted burst the leyline cruiser staggered in the water as if it had collided with an invisible wall the algarvians forgot all about him as they tried to save their ship they couldnt its back broken it plunged beneath the sea cornelus bellow of triumph might have burst from the throat of a warrior from five hundred years before for king burebistu for sibiu this time hed struck the enemies of his kingdom a heavy blow about every other algarvian officer who came into the tailors shop traku ran took one look at talsu working beside his father and told him you are lucky to be alive each time he had to nod politely and say something like aye i know it however polite he acted he wasnt always sure it was a good thing that he was alive the wound in his left side still pained him when he walked he wanted to bend his body to favor it as much as he could when he sat he kept twisting to find the position where it hurt least he couldnt find a position where it didnt hurt at all by what the healer said that would be awhile yet if it ever came what made it hard to stay polite though was that the algarvians didnt mean he was lucky to be alive after the redheaded soldier stabbed him they meant he was lucky the occupying authorities hadnt seized him tied him to a post put a blindfold on him and blazed him one of mezentios officers wagged a forefinger under talsus nose you are a fortunate fellow in that the military governor for this district is an easygoing old man who would sooner swive his pretty young mistress than do his job with most of his kind and the fellow drew that finger across his own throat oh aye im about the luckiest man in the world talsu agreed by then hed said it so often he managed to sound as if he believed it the algarvian captain shut up and left him alone but what right did the redheads have to take any woman who struck their fancy what right did they have to pick a fight with someone who happened to be a jelgavan womans friend what right did they have to stab someone who didnt care for their lewdness the right of the conqueror that was what they would answer that algarvian had proved his answer with the point of his knife and had got off scot free talsu didnt have so sharp a counterargument well father it will be awhile yet before i can run around and get in trouble like i could before he told his father that evening as traku was closing up the shop traku started to slap him on the shoulder as he would have done before talsu made the acquaintance of a blade he stopped awkwardly the motion half completed any jar hurt talsu these days embarrassed at himself traku said i wouldnt mind if you did i wouldnt mind if i did either talsu said but i cant not for a while i havent got the strength to haul rocks or break them either but you taught me the needle and scissors so i can still bring in money once upon a time the way fathers will i hoped youd make something better than a tailor of yourself his father answered barring the door but you couldnt hope to rise too far out of your class and im glad youre content to stay where you are that wasnt exactly what talsu had said before he could tell his father so traku went on and if you want to right about now i bet we could fix up a marriage for you thats in our class and the arrangements would go like that he snapped his fingers talsu flushed dyou really think so he mumbled aye i do traku said gailisas never hated you you know and now that you took on the redheads to keep them from doing whatever they would have done to her she really thinks the sun rises and sets on your head a slow smile stretched across talsus face aye i had noticed that shes come visiting a lot since i got stuck hasnt she just a bit his father said solemnly pretty girl good girl too and that counts for more in the long run though you cant always see as much when youre young shes grateful to you sure enough he nodded agreeing with himself she shows it too in ways that count we havent eaten this well since before the war if you end up deciding needle and scissors and tape measure and tailoring magic dont suit you you might have yourself a grocers shop instead im not going to worry about that right now talsu said a delicious smell floated down the stairs he grinned id sooner worry about supperstuffed cabbage or my nose has gone daft the rest of you maybe your nose no his father held out a hand do you want some help getting up the steps i can manage talsu said it doesnt hurt as much as it used to going up or down stairs especially up them made him raise his legs higher than usual which meant the healing muscles in his flanks had to work harder up he went slowly saying it hurt less than it had was true but didnt mean it didnt hurt at all he made it though and made it without gritting his teeth more than a couple of times that was a sizable improvement on the bentover hobbling hed done when he first came home and once a few days before hed stumbled going up the stairs hed thought he was going to come to pieces hed rather hoped he would in fact he hadnt hurt so much since just after he got stabbed he also had to sit carefully once he was at the table and had taken a couple of deep breaths the pain eased it didnt go away but it eased his sister ausra set a heaping plate in front of him he dug in the sauce sharp with vinegar and sweet with honey livened up the cabbage and the mix of meat and barley with which it was stuffed good he said enthusiasticallyand blurrily because he didnt bother swallowing first thank you dont thank methank your lady friend his sister answered shes the one who got us the ground mutton and the honey my lady friend talsu echoed i guess maybe she is his father coughed his mother smiled his sister laughed out loud of course she is you dunderhead ausra said shes as much your friend as you want her to be traku had said the same thing hearing it from another woman though made it somehow seem more real more immediate not that thinking of ausra as a woman rather than as a brat and a nuisance of a little sister didnt feel strange well maybe talsu muttered no maybes about itits true that wasnt his sister but his motherand laitsina spoke with great certainty traku coughed again what i told him was he could stay a tailor if he chose or he could go into the grocers line if he didnt pass me that pitcher of wine will you ausra talsus ears burned dont you think its rude to run somebodys life for him right in front of his face he asked the rest of his family ausra stuck out her tongue at him would you rather have us run your life behind your back she asked id rather you didnt try to run it at all talsu said i had enough of that and to spare in the army even if the food is better here the food wasnt much better here till a little while ago ausra said not about to give in and why is it now gailisa thats why if theyd teased him about gailisa anymore he thought he might start hating the grocers pretty daughter such irks always lasted till gailisa came into the tailors shop at which point they blew away like fog in the bratanu mountains so it was again the next morning when she walked in while he was cutting the pieces for an algarvian officers cloak hello she said and then how are you feeling today waggling the palm of his hand back and forth he answered not bad i am getting better if he said that often enough maybe hed believe it was true thats good she said nodding hanging on his every word im glad to hear it those algarvians have never been back since since the day you had trouble im glad to hear that talsu said heres hoping they get sent to unkerlant or maybe to the land of the ice people his father made a sour face theyre winning both places if you believe the news sheets even if you only believe a quarter of whats in the news sheets theyre still winning traku opened a drawer rattled through it and slammed it shut then did the same with another shaking his head he muttered must have left the fool thing upstairs ill be back when i find it off he went leaving his son alone with gailisa talsu was convinced his father had done that on purpose by the way she smiled so was gailisa your father is a nice man she said which to talsu only proved she didnt know traku all that well he laughed gailisa raised an eyebrow and waited to hear what he had to say after a moments thought he said it i dont know but what we had more fun when you were snippy all the time you keep treating me like im one of the powers above and im liable to start believing it and then where would we be here in skrunda probably gailisa answered its hard to be snippy with you after you did what you did you know what i mean i liked you before and then she stopped and turned red before talsu could say anything to that his side twinged he grabbed it and grunted sound and movement were altogether involuntary after it eased a little he said im glad it made you like me better but im not so glad as all that if you hear what im telling you of course i do gailisa said i thought you were going to die right there on the floor so did i talsu said thanks for getting help so fast youre welcome she answered then she walked over to him put her arms around him and kissed him i like this better than being snippy what do you think of that i think i like it too talsu told her kiss me again so i can find out for sure she did when traku came downstairs neither one of them noticed him he went back up again chuckling under his breath after the narrow valley in which kunhegyes lay the vast expanse of western unkerlant seemed all the more enormous to istvan and the forest of pine and spruce and fir ahead looked big enough to cover half the world staring istvan said we spent more than half a year fighting our way through the mountains and down onto the flatlands and now we have to go through thisi we could be another year on the way if anything that was liable to be a low guess the forest might swallow anything up to and including a gyongyosian army its not so bad as that sergeant captain tivadar took a map out of a leather map case and pointed at the red lines snaking through the green on the paper here do you see plenty of roads going through aye sir istvan said he could hardly disagree not when he was a sergeant a cobblers son talking to an officer with a fancy pedigree he did add what do you want to bet though that king swemmels men fight at every crossroads if it were going to be easy we would already have done it tivadar answered he pointed ahead then to the map again and nodded in satisfaction see theres the highway weve been following aye sir istvan repeated the alleged highway wouldnt have been much of a road even in the gyongyosian valley where hed just spent his leave it was narrow twisting altogether unpaved and at the moment muddy it disappeared among the trees as if it had no intention of ever coming out the other sideif the forest had another side onward then tivadar said this is splendid timber some of the finest in the world if we can find ley lines to take it away itll make gyongyos rich if there were any ley lines in this starsforsaken country the unkerlanters would have cut down the forest and hauled it away themselves so istvan thought at any rate since they hadnt ley lines were likely to be few and far betweenor perhaps they really were just undiscovered out here on the edge of nowhere but tivadar had his orders and had given istvan his istvan turned to his squad forward he called into the woods were going to take them away from the accursed unkerlanters aye the troopers chorused they were warriors of a proud warrior race they would obey even bespectacled corporal kun lean and knowing and gratingly sophisticated said aye with the rest as they advanced on the forest szonyi said i wonder if theyve got eggtossers in there waiting for us to get right up to the edge of the trees before they let us have it he sighed only way to find out is the hard way and isnt that the sad and sorry truth istvan said more in resignation than anything else well they havent killed us yet so were still ahead of the game as other sergeants and officers were doing he raised his voice come on you miserable lugs get moving somewhere in there weve got unkerlanters to flush out he and his men tramped across the meadow that led to the forest the grass was a brilliant green far brighter than the nearly black needles on the trees ahead yellow oxeye gentian and red clover brightened the meadow more butterflies flitted from flower to flower some sort of ground squirrel not long out of its burrow after a long winters nap stood up on its hind legs and chattered indignantly at the soldiers marching past and then off to istvans left the ground erupted in a roar a trooper shrieked but not for long istvan stared up at the sky no dragons wheeled there only a rustyred jay like the ones he might have seen at home and no more eggs were flying through the air to land on the advancing gyongyosians someone else shouted out what flashed through his mind have a care all the stinking sons of goats have buried eggs under the meadow tromp on one and youll never tromp on anything else all at once istvan wanted to walk above the grass his bowels knotted with every step he took kun spat and said i wonder how much fun well have going down the highway thats supposed to run through the forest istvan didnt like thinking about that either have we got any mages who can sniff out buried eggs for us he asked the question in a loud hopeful voice nobody responded to it istvan rounded on kun what about you you were a mages apprentice after all kun bared his teeth in what was anything but a smile if i could do you think id be stomping along like everybody else no law against hoping is there istvan said no and theres no law against stupidity either though there cursed well ought to be kun retorted that was insubordinate but istvan let it slide he knew why kun was unhappy he was unhappy for the same reason himself another egg burst this one half a mile over to the right istvan couldnt hear whether the luckless gyongyosian whod trodden on it shrieked or not he ground his teeth and kept going half a minute later yet another burst shattered the morning calm a magpie screeched annoyance at having its hunt for worms and crickets and maybe mice disturbed higher and higher the trees loomed ahead but for the roadway that led into the forest no one had ever taken an axe to it gyongyos had few woods like this and none so vast people were scattered thinly over this part of the world it looked istvan judged much as it had when the stars first shone down on it kun walk point he called as his squad went into the forest a little to the north of the road szonyi on the right fenyes on the left ill take rear guard for a while keep your eyes open everyone somewhere in there the filthy goatbuggers are waiting for us the world changed when he went in among the trees the sun disappeared except for occasional dapplings sneaking through the thick branches overhead the air got cooler and damper spicy resinous scents filled it istvans boots scuffed on redbrown fallen needles here and there especially at the bases of tree trunks lacy green ferns sprang up on the meadow istvan had been able to see for miles here the trees cramped his vision and not just from side to side when he looked up those dark boughs hid the sky he shook his head he didnt like that no stars tonight he muttered more to himself than to anyone else but one of his troopers heard and answered theyll see us sergeant even if we cant see them aye istvan answered but he remained unreassured he kept looking up every once in a while he managed to spy a sliver of blue when he did he felt hed won a victory a red squirrel holding a fir cone in its front paws peered down at him with beady black eyes and chittered in annoyance as its cousin had out on the meadow he raised a hand the squirrel ducked back putting the bulk of the branchwhich was as thick as a mans legbetween itself and what looked like danger seeing it put a new thought in his mind keep watching overhead he called to his men if the unkerlanters havent put some snipers in the trees im an even bigger fool than you think i am up ahead kun said something istvan thought he heard the word impossible but he wasnt sure he decided not to find out heading east and not getting turned around in this dim shadowless world kept the whole squadand probably the whole armybusy kuns sorcerous training though scanty did come in hand there from somewhere or other hed got a chunk of lodestone he tied it on the end of a string and chanted over it it swung in a particular direction thats south he said confidently and made half a turn to his left so this is east he pointed how does the lodestone know where south lies istvan asked curse me if i can tell you the former sorcerers apprentice said but i know that it does which is what we need what we need is to bump up against the unkerlanters so we can knock em out of the way istvan said all this waiting is making my belly gripe itll loosen up when the fighting starts thats certain szonyi said if youre anything like me youll thank the stars that you dont foul yourself that was no way for a member of a warrior race to talk but istvan just chuckled and nodded maybe some heroes didnt think about what might happen to them when they went into action but he did he couldnt help it twilight under the trees was darkening toward real twilight when he and his countrymen ran into the first positions the unkerlanters had built to block their path down kun shouted and everyone in the squad threw himself flat a beam zipped past above istvans head whether it would have caught him had he not gone down he didnt know it struck a tree trunk behind him and blazed through the bark deep into the wood aromatic steam gushed from the wounded pine istvan scuttled over behind another tree ever so warily he glanced around it he saw nothing but more trees ahead where are they he called softly up ahead somewhere kun answered which was doubtless true but imperfectly helpful sounding exasperated the point man went on theyre unkerlanters curse it theyre good at hiding to begin with and theyve had plenty of time to get ready for us shouts and curses and screams rang out all through the forest as the gyongyosian army ran into the concealed unkerlanter defenders the unkerlanters had eggtossers hidden among the trees along with their soldiers and started using them as soon as their foes collided with them and king swemmels men had left forces in the woods whod waited and stayed hidden while the gyongyosians went past then attacked from the rear after istvan and his comrades bumped into the main defensive line istvan found out about that when one of them blazed at him from behind hed thought he had good cover but suddenly a charred hole appeared in the tree in back of which he was hiding and only bare inches from his head he whirled and threw himself down on his belly where had the beam come from shouts of swemmel echoed through the darkening woods for a moment panic filled him was the whole gyongyosian force surrounded and about to be cut to pieces if it was the unkerlanters would have to go through a lot of stubborn men like him maybe there was something to springing from a warrior race after all was that a rockgray tunic istvan blazed an unkerlanter groaned and tumbled out from behind the trunk of a spruce istvan yanked a folding shovel off his own belt and began digging a hole in the soft dirt hed named himself rear guard for the squad that meant he was the one who had to be first defender against threats from behind he smelled smoke no matter how moist the forest was all the blazes and bursting eggs had set it afire he dug harder than ever but wondered even as dirt flew whether he was doing anything more than digging his own grave he also wondered whether anyone unkerlanter or gyongyosian would come out of the forest alive as krasta came downstairs from her bedchamber colonel lurcanio was pacing back and forth in the hall at the bottom of the stairway his green eyes sparked as he glared up at her what took you so long milady he growled but then however unwillingly he bowed over her hand and kissed it you do look very lovely tonight i must say which almost makes the delay worthwhile had he left off the almost krasta would have known shed created just the effect she wanted lurcanio was difficultsometimes impossibleto manage but she didnt wish shed got captain mosco instead not anymore off in the trackless wilds of unkerlant she didnt want to think about that im sure your driver will be able to get us to the reception in good time she said he doesnt dawdle over everything the way mine does he is an algarvian and he is a soldier lurcanio said the angry rumble had left his voice krasta decided hed put it there to see if he could make her afraid this time it hadnt worked and he didnt push it either as he sometimes did he slipped his arm around her waist let us be off then his driver was indeed an algarvian and a soldier the fellow proved that by leering at krasta as lurcanio handed her up into the carriage he was tall and young and handsome but surely had no breeding at all krasta did not believe in rutting with her social inferiors lurcanio spoke to the driver in their own language the driver nodded flicked the reins and got the horses going despite what krasta had said about him he didnt drive very fast not when all the streets of priekule were lit only by a sinking crescent moon lagoan dragons didnt fly up to the capital of occupied valmiera very often but the algarvians made things as hard as they could for tliem on principle taking advantage of the darkness lurcanio set a hand on krastas leg just above the knee and slowly slid it higher and higher along her thigh youre in a bold mood tonight she said amused i am in a happy mood tonight colonel lurcanio declared and moved his hand higher still and do you know why im in a happy mood tonight i can think of a reason krasta said archly setting her hand on his he chuckled oh that too my dear he said but i can get that anytime i want her back stiffened not from me you cant not if you talk that way if not from you then from someone else finding it isnt hard not in a conquered kingdom lurcanio sounded annoyingly smug the trouble was krasta knew he was rightand if she threw him out of her bed in a fit of pique she would be left without an algarvian protector when she didnt rise to his bait lurcanio went on no the chief reason i am happy tonight is that we have smashed the attack the unkerlanters made on our positions south of aspang good krasta said though she couldnt have found the city on a map to save herself from the headsmans axe oh aye it is lurcanio replied swemmels men spent most of the winter smashing us which is the main reason captain moscos bastard will likely never see hisor even herfather had they kept on smashing us now that spring has come it would have been a great deal less than amusing theyre only unkerlanters after all krasta said lurcanio nodded even so and they are once more proving they are only unkerlanters if you take my meaning krasta didnt not altogether she didnt trouble herself to go looking for it either instead she craned her neck for a better look at the skyline it still seems wrong not to have the column of victory standing tall and white and pretty there it wouldnt be lit up now not in wartime lurcanio could be annoyingly precise maybe one day king mezentio will build a new and grander column in its place an algarvian column of victory to last for all time not just a paltry double handful of centuries in priekule that would be for once krasta remembered in the nick of time who and what her companion was and swallowed a remark that would have got her in trouble with lurcanio a few minutes later the carriage pulled up in front of the mansion that belonged to sefanu the duke of klaipedas nephew the duke had commanded valmieras beaten army in the war against algarve hed since retired to his country estates his nephew was quite happy playing host to the occupiers as usual at these affairs algarvian and valmieran men were present in about equal numbers all the women though were blondes and all young and pretty krasta wasted no time before looking over the potential competition some of the valmieran women were nobles like her some commoners shed seen at other functions and some new faces her lip curled the algarvians could pick and choose and discard as they pleased and they did some of the new faces topped painfully thin bodies several of that type congregated at the buffet exclaiming over meats and cheeses the likes of which they hadnt seen for a long time no noblewoman would have stuffed herself as they did but their algarvian escorts stood around watching with amused smiles probably brought them here just to fatten them up krasta thought spitefully rather more valmieran noblewomen than commoners wore algarvianstyle kilts krasta scowled when she noticed that some of the valmieran men had taken to wearing the algarvian style too krasta liked that no better sure enough here came viscount valnu in a kilt so short he would have had trouble staying modest if he bent over his bonily handsome face wore a dazzling smile hello darling he said fluttering his fingers at krasta he hugged her and kissed her on the cheek then hugged lurcanio and kissed him on the cheek too hello my lord count and how are you well enough thanks lurcanio said and kept his distance from valnu from then on algarvian men were more apt to kiss than valmierans but they didnt usually do it quite like thatthough krasta recalled seeing valnu at one party with an algarvian officer who was definitely like that valnu to her certain knowledge wasnt or wasnt altogether what have you been doing lately she asked him more than a hint of malice in her voice why whatever i can of course he answered come with me and ill tell you all about it he turned to lurcanio i wouldnt steal your lady without your leave my lord count that were rude indeed its all right lurcanio said indulgently by his tone he thought he was safe enough entrusting krasta to this creature of no obvious gender krasta knew better and the thought of being unfaithful to her redheaded lover suddenly looked delightful not so much for valnus sake as to put one over on lurcanio she took hold of valnus arm aye she gushed tell me everything valnus smile grew brighter yet oh i will he said and led her off through the crowd behind her lurcanio laughed krasta was laughing too but inside where it didnt show you dont know as much as you think you do she steered valnu over to the bar so she could collect a mug of ale then let him steer her out of the mansion and onto the street you do need to know that i came here with lurcanios driver not my own she murmured oh i do do i valnu said and why is that because you cant have this fellow drive along some quiet road while we do whatever we want in the carriage krasta answered hed blab to lurcanio sure as sure while we do whatever we want valnu laughed softly the last time we tried that you shoved me out of the carriage and left me to walk home alone in the dark i dont know about you my dear marchioness but that isnt what i had in mind when we started on the ride krasta shrugged impatiently you deserved it for picking just the wrong time to start chattering about shopgirls i wont say a word about them now i promise you valnu slid his arm around her stroll with me we can look up at the stars together or do anything else we happen to think of there were more stars to look at than there had been when priekule was at peace with the city dark they shone in great glittering profusion multicolored jewels scattered across black velvet after one brief glance krasta forgot about them she hadnt come out with valnu to stargaze shed come out to enjoy revenge on an algarvian keeper who took her for granted but valnu really did feel like strolling or so it seemed fuming a little krasta went along for a block or so then she got mulish planting her feet firmly on the slates of the pavement she took hold of valnu and said if you brought me out here to trifle what are you waiting for to get a little farther away valnu answered which made no sense to her but this will do well enough he gathered her in she kissed him more fiercely than shed ever kissed lurcanio the algarvian was a skilled and pleasing lover but he also held the whip hand and krasta knew it not here not now valnu was nuzzling her neck and nibbling her ear when a thunderous roar behind her knocked both of them off their feet the first thing krasta noticed was that shed torn a knee out of her velvet trousers only after cursing at that did she proclaim powers above what happened if i had to guess i would say an egg burst in sefanus mansion valnu answered he rose and with startling strength hauled her to her feet come on because he sounded sure of himself and acted as if he knew what he was doing krasta followed him back toward the mansion his guess had been right on target and so she saw had the egg the mansions second and third stories had fallen in on themselves and fire was beginning to spread in the ruins shrieks from injured and trapped people inside made the night hideous a few men and women disheveled and bleeding pulled themselves free of the rubble and came staggering away krasta yanked at an arm sticking out from under a pile of bricks it came away with no body attached to it she dropped it with a horrified cry her stomach lurched as if aboard a diving dragon lurcanio she muttered it hadnt been his armit had belonged to a woman but what chance had he had to get away and then from behind her he said i am here hed lost his hat he had a cut over one eye and another on his forearm he also had most of his aplomb bowing he said good to see you intact milady your pretty popinjay picked just the right time to entertain you there aye krasta said and realized for the first time that she might easily have been inside the mansion when the egg burst her stomach lurched again curse the lagoan dragons she exclaimed dragons lurcanio shook his head no dragons tonight that egg didnt drop miladyit was smuggled in and left to burst plenty of ways to arrange such a thing and when we find out who did it well arrange his guts as pretty as you please oh hell take a long time to die he sounded as if he looked forward to seeing that in some ways algarvians remained barbaric after all no matter how fine and mild the night was krasta shivered vanai laid her hand on ealstans forehead he was burning hot as he had been an hour before as he had been a day before as he had been ever since he came down sick three days before he thrashed and muttered and stared up at her from the bed conberge he muttered biting her lip vanai soaked a washrag in a bowl of cold water wrung it out till it was nearly dry and put it on his forehead if he thought she was his sister he was in a bad way indeed no one in his right mind could have mistaken her for a swarthy solidly made forthwegian woman what am i going to do she exclaimed shed managed to get occasional sips of water and broth down ealstan but that wasnt nearly enough and she knew it and he needed something more than a cold compress to fight the fever too she turned the compress over already the heat that came off him had gone a long way toward drying the side that had touched his skin he needs a physician she thought or at least real medicine shed been thinking that for most of the past day ever since it had become clear that the fever wasnt going to leave anytime soon he would have gone out for her she knew that but he didnt face capture and worse if he stuck his nose outside the door to the flat chilly he said in conversational tones and started to shake he wasnt chilly he was as far in the world as he could be from chilly but he thought he was freezing his teeth started to chatter vanai piled blankets on him but he kept shivering underneath them hed done that before too it never failed to appall vanai with a grimace she made up her mind ealstan had to have more help than she could give here with what little they had in the flat to fight fever taking care to speak forthwegian so he wouldnt fret vanai said im going out now ill be back as soon as i can she did her best to sound as if everything were perfectly normal as if she could go out anytime she chose as if nothing could possibly happen to her when she went out into eoforwic maybe she even succeeded for ealstan said all right mother be careful out in the blizzard because he thought he was cold he thought the rest of the world had to be cold too i will vanai promised she took all the money she could find in the flata good deal more than shed thought she and ealstan had algarvians were famous for being bribable shed bribed major spinello with her body next to that she didnt worry about silver stepping out into the hall seeing walls that werent the walls of her flat felt very strange she wished shed changed into the long tunic ealstan had got for her but it wouldnt disguise what she was not on a fine bright spring day she hurried downstairs and out of the block of flats street noise hit her like a blow eoforwic dwarfed oyngestun shed forgotten how big and brawling the capital was shed seen it briefly when she and ealstan first came here from the east since then shed stayed high up looking out through window glass at the world but taking no part in it seeing strange faces up close felt wrong unnatural and people stared at her too a forthwegian with a face like a bignosed ferret grabbed her by the arm even as she twisted away he demanded lady are you out of your skull you want the redheads to nab you she needed a moment to notice that the question had come in kaunian a slangy dialect far removed from what shed heard and used back in oyngestun the kind of kaunian pickpockets and thieves would speak this fellow had probably learned it from blond pickpockets and thieves i need an apothecary she said in forthwegianno use drawing attention to herself by ear as well as eye my brothers sick uhhuh the ferretfaced forthwegian didnt believe that after a moment she understood why a brother would have been as conspicuous as she was that meant this fellow knew she had a forthwegian lover but he was saying two blocks over a block and a half up and he wont ask no questions just stay invisible between here and there my thanks vanai said but the forthwegian had gone on his way as if she really were invisible few of the other dark blocky men and women on the streets seemed to notice she was there either in eoforwic she remembered forthwegians and kaunians had rioted together against the algarvian occupiers when they learned what happened to the kaunians the redheads sent west it hadnt been like that in oyngestun it hadnt been like that most places in forthweg had it been the algarvians would have had a harder time doing what they did what do you need a graybearded forthwegian asked her he was grinding some powder or another with a brass mortar and pestle as the fellow whod recommended his place had said he didnt seem to care that she was a kaunian a feverfighter she answered and described ealstans symptoms without saying who or what he might be in relation to her ah the apothecary nodded theres a deal of that going around so there is ill mix you up some willow bark and poppy juice aye and a bit of hairy marshwort too its got an ugly name but its full of virtue he reached for bottles full of bark and a dark liquid and dried leaves then mixed them together after grinding all the solids to powder after that he poured in something clear and sparkling just a bit of grain spiritsfor flavor you might say whatever you think best vanai trusted him at sight he knew what he knew and was good at what he did had an algarvian or a naked black zuwayzi told him of the same symptoms he would have made the identical medicine she was sure of that here you are he said when he was done thatll be three in silver vanai nodded and paid she thought tamulis back in oyngestun where things were cheaper would have charged her more as she turned to go the apothecary showed the first sign of knowing what she was he called after her get home safe girl get home and stay there she looked back over her shoulder thats what i intend to do thank you he didnt answer he just went back to the medicine hed been compounding when she came into the shop she clung close to the walls of shops as she scurried back toward her block of flats as if she were a mouse scurrying along a baseboard to its hole again most forthwegians she saw pretended not to see her she did hear one shout of dirty kaunian but even the woman who yelled made no move to do anything about it powers above be praised she thought as she reached the last corner she had to turn before reaching her building igot away with it she turned the corner and almost walked into a pair of algarvian constables who were about to turn onto the street she was leaving had vanai seen them half a block away she could easily have escaped they were both pudgy and middleaged but one of them reached out and grabbed her even as she was letting out a startled squeak well well what are we having here he said in fairly fluent forthwegian let me go vanai exclaimed she kicked at him but he was nimble enough despite his bulk her shoe didnt strike his stockinged shin then she thought to use guile instead of force ill pay you if you let me go she reached down and made the silver in her pocket jingle the constable who didnt have hold of her leered how you paying us eh his forthwegian was worse than his partners but vanai had no trouble understanding what he wanted from her most of the horror that gripped her was horror at not feeling more horror if that was what it took to get rid of the algarvians why not major spinello had inflicted himself on her for months after that what were a few minutes with a couple of strangers she should have been appalled at thinking that way part of her was but only a small part spinello had burned away the rest of her sense of shame in quick almost musical trills the algarvians talked back and forth one of them pointed to the dark mouth of an alleyway across the street from where they stood if they took her back there they could do what they wanted with her and no one would be the wiser unless she screamed lets be going said the one who had hold of her and he gave her a shove in that direction she would have seized a chance to escape but they offered her none now i have to hope theyll let me go after this she thought grinding her teeth relying on the honor of men all too liable not to have any made her legs light and shaky with fear and then a forthwegian loomed in front of the constables turn her loose he rumbled she aint done nothing aye thats right a woman said from behind her she is being a kaunian the constable answered as if that explained everything most places in forthweg it would have not here aye shes a kaunian and youre a son of a whore said the burly man blocking the constables path a crowd started to gather the forthwegian repeated turn her loose curse you had he shouted for vanais blood he might well have got that as things were everybody in the growing crowd shouted for the constables to let her go the two algarvians looked at each other they were timeservers not heroes the bold the young the brave were off doing real fighting these fellows couldnt hope to blaze everybody who was yelling at them they would get mobbed and a riot would start the one who had hold of vanais arm held out his other hand ten silvers fine for being on street without permitting he declared vanai gave him the coins without hesitation the other constable stuck out his hand whereupon the first one split the money with him they both beamed why not theyd made a profit even if she hadnt gone into the alley and done lewd things for them with a pat on the head as if shed been a dog the first constable let her go run along home he told her she didnt wait to let him change his mindor for the crowd to disperse which might have tempted him to do just that and the crowd helped in another way for it kept the algarvians from seeing which building she entered safe she breathed as she got inside she hurried up the stairs to give ealstan the medicine she clutched the jar tightly it had ended up being expensive but ohhow much more it might have cost waddo came limping up to garivald as the peasant tramped in from the fields with a hoe on his shoulder as if it were a stick the firstman grabbed garivald by the elbow and pulled him aside its gone he said hoarsely his eyes wide with fear whats gone garivald asked though he thought he knew the answer why the crystal of course waddo answered proving him right its gone and powers above only know whos got it or what hes going to do with it he stared at garivald you havent got it have you we were going to take it out of the ground together the two of us no i havent got it garivald said waddo hadnt asked him if hed dug it up had the firstman asked him that he would have denied it too not caring at all whether he lied the less waddo knew the less anyoneparticularly anyone algarviancould wring out of him at the moment waddo seemed not far from panic someone has it he said aye someone has it someone wholl use it against me hell tell the redheads and theyll hang me theyre bound to hang me he wasnt a brave man garivald had known that since before hed started to shave the firstman had enjoyed his petty authority in zossen while he had it now that he had it no more he lived in constant fear lest the algarvians make him pay for everything hed done while the village was under king swemmels rule try not to worry garivald said though he might as well have told the sun not to rise tomorrow he thought about letting waddo know the unkerlanter irregulars who roamed the woods had the crystalthought about it and put it out of his mind the less waddo knew the better sure enough dont tell me that how can you tell me that the firstman said garivald only shrugged no answer he gave the firstman would satisfy him wideeyed waddo stumped away digging the end of his stick into the ground at every stride whats chewing on him garivalds friend dagulf asked powers above only know garivald answered you know how waddo gets sometimes it never means anything i havent seen him that heated up since the algarvians came into zossen dagulf said rubbing the scar on his cheek and he thought they were going to boil him for soup then theyd have to skim a lot of fat off before they could eat it if they did garivald said which made dagulf laugh it also made the other peasant stop asking questions which was what garivald had had in mind as the peasants and their wives were going out to work the next morning the algarvian sergeant in charge of the little occupying force started beating on the lid of a pot with a hammer to summon them to the village square he read a proclamation from a sheet of paper which meant his unkerlanter was grammatically accurate even if badly pronounced his majesty king raniero of grelz announces that with the help of his brave allies from algarve the wicked invasion of his domain by the forces of swemmel the usurper has been beaten back crushed and utterly quashed now let us all give three hearty cheers to thank the powers above for this grand and glorious victory the harbinger of many more along with the rest of the villagers garivald dutifully cheered hed learned from experience that if the cheers werent hearty enough to suit the redheads theyd keep the peasants there till the shouts suited them he had work to do cheering loudly from the start let him go do it he didnt have time to waste standing around he wondered how much truth the proclamation held the algarvians had been in the habit of announcing victories even in the middle of winter when the irregulars made it clear mezentios men were getting pounded but algarvian soldiers had come forward through zossen in the past few days which likely meant things werent going so well for unkerlant another squad of algarvians these men mounted on unicorns rode into the village while he was out weeding garivald paid them no particular attention even when they didnt go west right away hed grown too used to the redheads to worry about any one lot of them very much a year before hed never so much as seen an algarvian he heartily wished hed never see any more of them either but that wasnt the sort of wish likely to be granted right away when sunset came he shouldered his hoe and trudged back toward zossen as he did every evening again he noticed the algarvians standing at the edge of the village without paying them any special heed it was dagulf who remarked looks like that cursed longwinded bugger of a sergeant is pointing at you huh garivald looked up in surprise sure enough the redhead whod delivered the proclamation did have his index finger aimed his way when he saw garivald had noticed him he beckoned whats he want with you dagulf asked curse me if i know garivald shrugged and sighed guess id better go find out though he turned away from the shortest path toward his home and walked over to the sergeant who stood with some of the newcomers to the village you being garivald is not being so the sergeant said his unkerlanter was much worse when he had to try to speak it without a script aye im garivald garivald answered the question plainly was for the record the sergeant knew who he was all the algarvians whod come into zossen that day aimed their sticks at him by order of king raniero and king mezentio you are under arrest one of them said his unkerlanter was much better than the sergeants even so garivald had trouble following what the fellow said through the roaring in his ears you are to be taken to herborn for trial the charge being treason through subversive songs after the trial you are to be executed in accordance to the law any resistance and you shall be blazed without trial now come along numbly garivald came later he thought he should have laid about him with the hoe and with luck have slain a couple of the redheads before they did blaze him down at the moment stunned by the catastrophe that had overfallen him he let them take away the hoe let them tie his hands behind his back and let them lead him to their unicorns with his hands tied he couldnt mount one of the beasts by himself a couple of algarvians helped him get aboard hed never ridden a unicorn before he would just as soon not have started riding one in this particular way but he had no choice hed lost any possibility of choice once the hoe was gone the algarvians tied his feet together under the unicorns barrel what happens if i fall out of the saddle he asked you get dragged to death or trampled to death answered the algarvian whod announced his arrest we dont care we can deliver your body if you want to keep breathing a little longer dont fall they wasted no time unkerlanters at king swemmels urging talked about efficiency the redheads personified it theyand garivaldrode out of zossen before annore could burst shrieking from the house shed shared so long with her husband even after darkness fell they kept on heading east back toward the capital of grelz garivald had heard the irregulars boasting of what they did to small bands of algarvians they caught away from help hed believed those boasts tonight he discovered that like so many they were nothing but wind the algarvians treated him like a domestic animal without either kindness or cruelty beyond what they needed to make sure he didnt escape when he asked them to stop so he could ease himself they did toward midnight they rode into another village they fed him then from their own rationsspicier than what he was used to eating but no worseand gave him wine to drink they let him sleep in a hut but posted guards around it he was too worn even to think about escape for more than a moment not long after sunset theyand perforce hestarted off again had he been less weary and saddlesore and frightened he might have marveled at the endurance of the unicorn he rode that though wasnt what struck him by midafternoon he was farther from his home than hed ever been in his life will you sing us one of your songs to pass the time asked the algarvian who spoke unkerlanter i dont know what youre talking about garivald said stolidly i dont know anything about making songs to his surprise the algarvian nodded aye id say the same in your boots he agreed but it wont do you any good not once we get you to herborn theyll blaze you or hang you or boil you no matter what you tell them boil me garivald didnt want to say that aloud but couldnt help it everybody knew what had happened to kyot at the end of the twinkings war to think of that happening to him on they rode past meadows and woods and fields under cultivation and fields going to weeds past villages that looked achingly like zossen and past villages that were nothing but charred ruins garivald had heard about what the war had done but hed never really seen it not till now words started to shape themselves inside his mind he didnt know whether to laugh or to cry whatever songs he made now hed never have the chance to sing them no village was near when evening came confident as if in the middle of their own kingdom the algarvians encamped at the top of a low hill they had three men up and watching all through the night watching garivald watching their unicorns watching for any trouble that might come their way garivald had kept hoping irregulars might use the cover of darkness to attack them but none did herborn in a couple of days the redhead who spoke unkerlanter said to him the next morning then your trial then the end he wasnt gloating he was as matteroffact as if talking about the weather that made him more frightening to the peasant not less on went the unicorns taking garivald on toward the big city hed never seen and would not see for long late that afternoon the road went through a wood of mixed beeches and birches and pines the algarvians chattered back and forth in their own language and kept looking this way and thatthey didnt like riding along so close to the trees that they could reach out and touch them and they had reason to mislike it when the ambush hit it hit hard and fast a barricade of logs and brush blocked the road mezentios men had barely reined in before unkerlanters started blazing at them from behind trees and bushes algarvians tumbled out of the saddle one after another one of the redheads lifted his stick to blaze garivald but crumpled clutching at himself before he could loose his beam some of the unicorns fell too shrieking shrilly from the pain they couldnt understand garivald could only stay where he was if anyone blazed his unicorn it would crush him when it went down before long the irregulars came out of the woods to finish offthe two or three algarvians still groaning one of them strode up to garivald who are you he demanded why did the whoresons grab you to kill me thats why garivald answered im garivald the songmaker he wondered if the fellow had heard of him when the irregulars eyes widened garivald knew he had garivald the songmaker in my band he exclaimed i will gain fame for that he thumped his chest then drew a knife i munderic set you free you are one of my men now far from home suddenly saved from certain death garivald nodded eagerly he was a peasant no more nor a captive either as munderics knife bit through his bonds he gladly became an irregular
