geoff ryman pol pots beautiful daughter in cambodia people are used to ghosts ghosts buy newspapers they own property a few years ago spirits owned a house in phnom penh at the tra bek end of monivong boulevard khmer rouge had murdered the whole family and there was no one left alive to inherit it people cycled past the building leaving it boarded up sounds of weeping came from inside then a professional inheritor arrived from america shed done her research and could claim to be the last surviving relative of no fewer than three families she immediately sold the house to a chinese businessman who turned the ground floor into a photocopying shop the copiers began to print pictures of the original owners at first single black and white photos turned up in the copied dossiers of aid workers or government officials the father of the murdered family had been a lawyer he stared fiercely out of the photos as if demanding something in other photocopies his beautiful daughters forlornly hugged each other the background was hazy like fog one night the owner heard a noise and trundled downstairs to find all five photocopiers printing one picture after another of faces young college men old women parents with a string of babies or government soldiers in uniform he pushed the big green offbuttons nothing happened he pulled out all the plugs but the machines kept grinding out face after face women in beehive hairdos or clever children with glasses looked wistfully out of the photocopies they seemed to be dreaming of home in the s when phnom penh was the most beautiful city in southeast asia news spread people began to visit the shop to identify lost relatives women would cry thats my mother i didnt have a photograph they would weep and press the flimsy a sheets to their breasts the paper went limp from tears and humidity as if it too were crying soon a throng began to gather outside the shop every morning to view the latest batch of faces in desperation the owner announced that each mornings harvest would be delivered direct to the truth a magazine of remembrance then one morning he tried to open the housedoor to the shop and found it blocked he went round to the front of the building and rolled open the metal shutters the shop was packed from floor to ceiling with photocopies the ground floor had no windowsthe room had been filled from the inside the owner pulled out a sheet of paper and saw himself on the ground his head beaten in by a hoe the same image was on every single page he buried the photocopiers and sold the house at once the new owner liked its haunted reputation it kept people away the for sale sign was left hanging from the second floor in a sense the house had been bought by another ghost this is a completely untrue story about someone who must exist pol pots only child a daughter was born in her name was sith and in she was eighteen years old sith liked air conditioning and luxury automobiles her hair was dressed in cornrows and she had a spiky piercing above one eye her jeans were elaborately slashed and embroidered her pink tshirts bore slogans in english care kooky pink moll sith lived like a woman on thai

generals created by the regime their sons can behave with impunity avoid all men with potbellies they eat too well and therefore must be corrupt avoid anyone who drives a toyota viva or honda dream motorcycle dont answer letters or phone calls never make any friends there was also a tenth rule but that went without saying rotten fruit rinds and black mud never stained siths designer sports shoes disabled beggars never asked her for alms her life began yesterday which was effectively the same as today every day her driver took her to the new soriya market it was almost the only place that sith went the color of silver soriya rose up in many floors to a round glass dome sith preferred the nd street entrance its green awning made everyone look as if they were made of jade the doorway went directly into the icecold jewelry rotunda with its floor of polished black and white stone the individual stalls were hung with glittering necklaces and earrings sith liked tiny shiny things that had no memory she hated politics she refused to listen to the news pol pots beautiful daughter wished the current leadership would behave decently like her dad always did to her she remembered the sound of her fathers gentle voice she remembered sitting on his lap in a forest enclosure being bitten by mosquitoes memories of malaria had sunk into her very bones she now associated forests with nausea fevers and pain a flicker of treeshade on her skin made her want to throw up and the odor of soil or fallen leaves made her gag she had never been to angkor wat she read nothing sith shopped her driver was paid by the government and always carried an ak but his wife the housekeeper had no idea who sith was the house was full of swept marble polished teak furniture ipods xboxes and plasma screens please remember that every word of this story is a lie pol pot was no doubt a dedicated communist who made no money from ruling cambodia nevertheless a hefty allowance arrived for sith every month from an account in switzerland nothing touched sith until she fell in love with the salesman at hello phones cambodian readers may know that in there was no mobile phone shop in soriya market however there was a branch of hello phone cards that had a round blue sales counter with orange trim this shop looked like that every day sith bought or exchanged a mobile phone there she would sit and flick her hair at the salesman his name was dara which means star dara knew about deals on call prices sim cards and the new phones that showed videos he could get her any call tone she liked talking to dara broke none of siths rules he wasnt fat nor was he well dressed and far from being a teenager he was a comfortably mature twentyfour years old one day dara chuckled and said as a friend i advise you you dont need another mobile phone sith wrinkled her nose i dont like this one anymore its blue i want something more feminine but not frilly and it should have better sound quality okay but you could save your money and buy some more nice clothes pol pots beautiful daughter lowered her chin which she knew made her neck look long and graceful do you like my clothes why ask me she shrugged i dont know its good to check out your look dara nodded you look cool what does your sister say sith let him know she had no family ah he said and quickly changed the subject that was terrific secrecy and sympathy in one easy movement sith came back the next day and said that shed decided that the rosecolored phone was too feminine dara laughed aloud and his eyes sparkled sith had come late in the morning just so that he could ask this question are you hungry do you want to meet for lunch would he think she was cheap if she said yes would he say she was snobby if she said no just so long as we eat in soriya market she said she was torn between bbworld burgers and lucky bbworld was big round and just two floors down from the dome lucky burgers was part of the lucky supermarket such a good store that a tiny jar of maxwell house cost us they decided on bbworld it was full of light and they could see the town spread out through the wide clean windows sith sat in silence pol pots daughter had nothing to say unless she was buying something or rather she had only one thing to say but she must never say it dara did all the talking he talked about how the guys on the third floor could get him a deal on original copies of grand theft auto he hinted that he could get sith discounts from bsfashion the spotlit modern shop one floor down suddenly he stopped you dont need to be afraid of me you know he said it in a kindly grownup voice i can see youre a properly brought up girl i like that its nice sith still couldnt find anything to say she could only nod she wanted to run away would you like to go to kfour kfour the big electronics shop stocked all the reliable brand names hitachi sony panasonic philips or denon it was so expensive that almost nobody shopped there which is why sith liked it a crowd of people stood outside and stared through the window at a huge home entertainment center showing a dvd of ice age on the screen a little animal was being chased by a glacier it was so beautiful sith finally found something to say if i had one of those i would never need to leave the house dara looked at her sideways and decided to laugh the next day sith told him that all the phones she had were too big did he have one that she could wear around her neck like jewelry this time they went to lucky burgers and sat across from the revlon counter they watched boys having their hair layered by revlons natural beauty specialists dara told her more about himself his father had died in the wars his family now lived in the country siths cocacola suddenly tasted of antimalarial drugs but you dont want to live in the country she said no i have to live in phnom penh to make money but my folks are good country people modest he smiled embarrassed theyll have hens and a cousin who shimmies up coconut trees there will be trees all around but no shops anywhere the earth will smell sith couldnt finish her drink she sighed and smiled and said abruptly im sorry its been cool but i have to go she slunk sideways out of her seat as slowly as molasses walking back into the jewelry rotunda with nothing to do she realized that dara would think she didnt like him and that made the lower part of her eyes sting she went back the next day and didnt even pretend to buy a mobile phone she told dara that shed left so suddenly the day before because shed remembered a hair appointment he said that he could see she took a lot of trouble with her hair then he asked her out for a movie that night sith spent all day shopping in kfour they met at six dara was so considerate that he didnt even suggest the horror movie he said he wanted to see buffalo girl hiding a movie about a country girl who lives on a farm sith said with great feeling that she would prefer the horror movie the cinema on the top floor opened out directly onto the roof of soriya graffiti had been scratched into the green railings why would people want to ruin something new and beautiful sith put her arm through daras and knew that they were now boyfriend and girlfriend finally he said finally what youve done something they leaned on the railings and looked out over other peoples apartments west toward the river was a building with one huge roof terrace women met there to gossip children were playing tossthesandal from this distance sith was enchanted i just love watching the children the movie from thailand was about a woman whose face turns blue and spotty and who eats men the blue woman was yucky but not as scary as all the badly dubbed voices the characters sounded possessed it was though thai people had been taken over by the spirits of dead cambodians whenever sith got scared she chuckled so she sat chuckling with terror dara thought she was laughing at a dumb movie and found such intelligence charming he started to chuckle too sith thought he was as frightened as she was together in the dark they took each others hands outside afterward the air hung hot even in the dark and nd street smelled of drains sith stood on tiptoe to avoid the oily deposits and castoff fishbones dara said i will drive you home my driver can take us said sith flipping open her kermitthefrog mobile her black mercedes benz edged to a halt crunching old plastic bottles in the gutter the seats were upholstered with tan leather and the driver was armed daras jaw dropped who who is your father hes dead dara shook his head who was he normally sith used her mothers family name but that would not answer this question flustered she tried to think of someone who could be her father she knew of nobody the right age she remembered something about a politician who had died his name came to her and she said it in panic my father was kol vireakboth had she got the name right please dont tell anyone dara covered his eyes wemy family my fatherwe fought for the kpla sith had to stop herself asking what the kpla was kol vireakboth had led a faction in the civil wars it fought against the khmer rouge the vietnamese the king and corruption it wanted a new way for cambodia kol vireakboth was a cambodian leader who had never told a lie and or accepted a bribe remember that this is an untrue story dara started to back away from the car i dont think we should be doing this im just a villager really that doesnt matter his eyes closed i would expect nothing less from the daughter of kol vireakboth oh for gosh sake she just picked the mans name out of the air she didnt need more problems please she said dara sighed okay i said i would see you home safely i will inside the mercedes he stroked the tan leather when they arrived he craned his neck to look up at the building which floor are you on all of them color drained from his face my driver will take you back she said to dara as the car pulled away she stood outside the closed garage shutters waving forlornly then sith panicked who was kol vireakboth she went online and googled she had to read about the wars her skin started to creep all those different factions swam in her head ans nadk kprand kpnlf the very names seemed to come at her spoken by forgotten voices soon she had all she could stand she printed out vireakboths picture and decided to have it framed in case dara visited kol vireakboth had a round face and a fatherly smile his eyes seemed to slant upward toward his nose looking full of kindly insight hed been killed by a car bomb all that night sith heard whispering in the morning there was another picture of someone else in the tray of her printer a longfaced bucktoothed woman stared out at her in black and white sith noted the victims fashion lapses the womans hair was a mess all frizzy she should have had it straightened and put in some nice highlights the womans eyes drilled into her cant touch me said sith she left the photo in the tray she went to see dara right away no breakfast his eyes were circled with dark flesh and his blue hello trousers and shirt were not properly ironed buy the whole shop dara said looking deranged the guys in kfour just told me some girl in blue jeans walked in yesterday and bought two home theatres one for the salon she said and one for the roof terrace she paid for both of them in full and had them delivered to the far end of monivong sith sighed im sending one back she hoped that sounded abstemious it looked too metallic against my curtains pause she also bought an aido robot dog for fifteen hundred dollars sith would have preferred that dara did not know about the dog it was just a silly toy it hadnt occured to her that it might cost that much until she saw the bill they should not tell everyone about their customers business or soon they will have no customers dara was looking at her as if thinking this is not just a nice sweet girl i had fun last night sith said in a voice as thin as high clouds so did i we dont have to tell anyone about my family do we sith was seriously scared of losing him no but sith its stupid your family my family we are not equals it doesnt make any difference you lied to me your family is not dead you have famous uncles she did indeeduncle ieng sary uncle khieu samphan uncle ta mok all the pol pot clique had been called her uncles i didnt know them that well she said that was true too what would she do if she couldnt shop in soriya market anymore what would she do without dara she begged i am not a strong person sometimes i think i am not a person at all im just a space dara looked suddenly mean youre just a credit card then his face fell im sorry that was an unkind thing to say you are very young for your age and im older than you and i should have treated you with more care sith was desperate all my money would be very nice im not for sale he worked in a shop and would be sending money home to a fatherless family of course he was for sale sith had a small heart but a big head for thinking she knew that she had to do this delicately like picking a flower or she would spoil the bloom lets lets just go see a movie after all she was beautiful and well brought up and she knew her eyes were big and round her tiny heart was aching this time they saw tum teav a remake of an old movie from the s if movies were not nightmares about ghosts then they tried to preserve the past when thought sith will they make a movie about cambodia s future tum teav was based on a classic tale of a young monk who falls in love with a properly brought up girl but her mother opposes the match they commit suicide at the end bringing a curse on their village sith sat through it stonyfaced i am not going to be a dead heroine in a romance dara offered to drive her home again and thats when sith found out that he drove a honda dream he proudly presented to her the gleaming motorcycle of fast young men sith felt backed into a corner shed already offered to buy him showing off her car again might humiliate him so she broke rule number seven dara hid her bag in the back and they went soaring down monivong boulevard at night past homeless people prostitutes and chefs staggering home after work it was late in the year but it started to rain sith loved it the cool air brushing against her face the cooler rain clinging to her eyelashes she remembered being five years old in the forest and dancing in the monsoon she encircled daras waist to stay on the bike and suddenly found her cheek was pressed up against his back she giggled in fear not of the rain but of what she felt he dropped her off at home inside everything was dark except for the flickering green light on her printer in the tray were two new photographs one was of a child a little boy holding up a school prize certificate the other was a tough wiselooking old man with a string of muscle down either side of his ironic bitter smile they looked directly at her they know who i am as she climbed the stairs to her bedroom she heard someone sobbing far away as if the sound came from next door she touched the walls of the staircase they shivered slightly constricting in time to the cries in her bedroom she extracted one of her many ipods from the tangle of wires and listened to system of a down as loud as she could it helped her sleep the sound of numetal guitars seemed to come roaring out of her own heart she was woken up in the sundrenched morning by the sound of her doorbell many floors down she heard the housekeeper jorani call and the door open sith hesitated over choice of jeans and top by the time she got downstairs she found the driver and the housemaid joking with dara giving him tea like the sunshine dara seemed to disperse ghosts hi he said its my day off i thought we could go on a motorcycle ride to the country but not to the country couldnt they just spend the day in soriya no said dara theres lots of other places to see in phnom penh he drove her twisting through back streets how did the city get so poor how did it get so dirty they went to a new and modern shop for cds that was run by a record label dara knew all the cool new music most of it influenced by khmeramericans returning from long beach and compton sdey phnom penh bad boys khmer kid sith bought twenty cds they went to the national museum and saw the beautiful buddhalike head of king jayavarman vii dara without thinking ducked and held up his hands in prayer they had dinner in a french restaurant with candles and wine and it was just like in a karaoke video a boy a girl and her money all going out together they saw the show at sovanna phum and there was a wonderful dance piece with sampled s music from an old french movie with traditional khmer choreography sith went home her heart singing dara dara dara in the bedroom a mobile phone began to ring over and over call said the screen but gave no name or number so the person was not on siths list of contacts she turned off the phone it kept ringing thats when she knew for certain she hid the phone in a pillow in the spare bedroom and put another pillow on top of it and then closed the door all fortytwo of her mobile phones started to ring they rang from inside closets or from the bathroom where she had forgotten them they rang from the roof terrace and even from inside a shoe under her bed i am a very stubborn girl she shouted at the spirits you do not scare me she turned up her ipod and finally slept as soon as the sun was up she roused her driver slumped deep in his hammock come on were going to soriya market she said the driver looked up at her dazed then remembered to smile and lower his head in respect his face fell when she showed up in the garage with all fortytwo of her mobile phones in one black bag it was too early for soriya market to open they drove in circles with sunrise blazing directly into their eyes on the streets men pushed carts like beasts of burden or carried cascades of belts into the old central market the old market was domed art deco the color of vomit french sith never shopped there maybe you should go visit your mom said the driver you know she loves you families are there for when you are in trouble siths mother lived in thailand and they never spoke her mothers family kept asking for favors money introductions or help with getting a job sith didnt speak to them any longer my family is only trouble the driver shut up and drove finally soriya opened sith went straight to daras shop and dumped all the phones on the blue countertop can you take these back we only do exchanges i can give a new phone for an old one dara looked thoughtful dont worry leave them here with me ill go sell them to a guy in the old market and give you your money tomorrow he smiled in approval this is very sensible he passed one phone back the one with video and email this is the best one keep this dara was so competent sith wanted to sink down onto him like a pillow and stay there she sat in the shop all day watching him work one of the guys from the games shop upstairs asked who is this beautiful girl dara answered proudly my girlfriend dara drove her back on the dream and at the door to her house he chuckled i dont want to go she pressed a finger against his naughty lips and smiled and spun back inside from happiness she was in the groundfloor garage she heard something like a rat scuttle in her bag the telephone rang who were these people to importune her even if they were dead she wrenched the mobile phone out of her bag and pushed the green button and put the phone to her ear she waited there was a sound like wind a child spoke to her his voice clogged as if he was crying they tied my thumbs together sith demanded how did you get my number im all alone then ring somebody else someone in your family all my family are dead i dont know where i am my name is sith clicked the phone off she opened the trunk of the car and tossed the phone inside it being telephoned by ghosts was so unmodern how could cambodia become a number one country if its cell phone network was haunted she stormed up into the salon on top of a table the nomess dog stared at her from out of his packaging sith clumped up the stairs onto the roof terrace to sleep as far away as she could from everything in the house she woke up in the dark to hear thumping from downstairs the sound was metallic and hollow as if someone were locked in the car sith turned on her ipod something was making the sound of the music skip she fought the tangle of wires and wrenched out another player a xen but it too skipped burping the sound of speaking voices into the middle of the music had she heard a ripping sound she pulled out the earphones and heard something climbing the stairs a sound of light uneven lolloping she thought of crippled children frost settled over her like a heavy blanket and she could not move the robot dog came whirring up onto the terrace it paused at the top of the stairs its camera nose pointing at her to see its useless eyes glowing cherry red the robot dog said in a warm friendly voice my name is phalla i tried to buy my sister medicine and they killed me for it sith tried to say go away but her throat wouldnt open the dog tilted its head no one even knows im dead what will you do for all the people who are not mourned laughter blurted out of her and sith saw it rise up as cold vapor into the air we have no one to invite us to the feast said the dog sith giggled in terror nothing i can do nothing she said shaking her head you laugh the dog gathered itself and jumped up into the hammock with her it turned and lifted up its clear plastic tail and laid a genuine turd alongside sith short brown hair was wound up in it a scalp actually and a single flat white human tooth smiled out of it sith squawked and overturned both herself and the dog out of the hammock and onto the floor the dog pushed its nose up against hers and began to sing an oldfashioned childrens song about birds something heavy huffed its way up the stairwell toward her sith shivered with cold on the floor and could not move the dog went on singing in a high sweet voice a large shadow loomed out over the top of the staircase and sith gargled swallowing laughter trying to speak there was thumping in the car and no one in it said the driver sith sagged toward the floor with relief the ghosts she said theyre back she thrust herself to her feet were getting out now ring the hilton find out if they have rooms she kicked the toy dog down the stairs ahead of her were moving now together they all loaded the car shaking once again the house was left to ghosts as they drove the mobile phone rang over and over inside the trunk the new hilton which does not exist rose up by the river across from the department for cults and religious affairs tall and marbled and pristine it had crystal chandeliers and fountains and wood and brass handles in the elevators in the middle of the night only the bridal suite was still available but it had an extra parental chamber where the driver and his wife could sleep high on the twentyfirst floor the night sparkled with lights and everything was hushed as far away from cambodia as it was possible to get things were quiet after that for a while every day she and dara went to movies or went to a restaurant they went shopping she slipped him money and he bought himself a beautiful suit he said over a hamburger at lucky ive told my mother that ive met a girl sith smiled and thought and i bet you told her that im rich ive decided to live in the hilton she told him maybe we could live in the hilton a pretty smile could hint at that the rainy season ended the last of the monsoons rose up dark gray with a froth of white cloud on top looking exactly like a giant wave about to break dry cooler air arrived after work was over dara convinced her to go for a walk along the river in front of the royal palace he went to the mens room to change into a new luxury suit and sith thought hes beginning to imagine life with all that money as they walked along the river exposed to all those people sith shook inside there were teenage boys everywhere some of them were in rags which was reassuring but some of them were very well dressed indeed the sons of impunity who could do anything sith swerved suddenly to avoid even seeing them but dara in his new beige suit looked like one of them and the generals sons nodded to him with quizzical eyebrows perhaps wondering who he was in front of the palace a pavilion reached out over the water next to it a traditional orchestra bashed and wailed out something old fashioned hundreds of people crowded around a tiny wat dara shook siths wrist and they stood up to see people held up bundles of lotus flowers and incense in prayer they threw the bundles into the wat monks immediately shoveled the joss sticks and flowers out of the back behind the wat children wearing tshirts and shorts black with filth rootled through the dead flowers the smoldering incense and old coconut shells sith asked why do they do that you are so innocent chuckled dara and shook his head the evening was blue and gold sith had time to think that she did not want to go back to a hotel and that the only place she really felt happy was next to dara all around that thought was something dark and tangled dara suggested with affection that they should get married it was as if sith had her answer ready no absolutely not she said at once how can you ask that there is not even anyone for you to ask have you spoken to your family about me has your family made any checks about my background which was what she really wanted to know dara shook his head i have explained that you are an orphan but they are not concerned with that we are modest people they will be happy if i am happy of course they wont be of course they will need to do checks sith scowled she saw her way to sudden advantage at least they must consult fortunetellers they are not fools i can help them ask them the names of the fortunetellers they trust dara smiled shyly we have no money i will give them money and you can tell them that you pay daras eyes searched her face i dont want that how will we know if it is a good marriage and your poor mother how can you ask her to make a decision like this without information so you ask your family for the names of good professionals they trust and i will pay them and i will go to prime minister hun sens own personal fortuneteller and we can compare results thus she established again both her propriety and her status in an old romance the parents would not approve of the match and the fortuneteller would say that the marriage was illomened sith left nothing to romance she offered the familys fortunetellers whatever they wanteda car a farmand in return demanded a written copy of their judgment all of them agreed that the portents for the marriage were especially auspicious then she secured an appointment with the prime ministers fortuneteller hun sens kru taey was a lady in a black business suit she had long fingernails like talons but they were perfectly manicured and frosted white she was the kind of fortuneteller who is possessed by someone elses spirit she sat at a desk and looked at sith as unblinking as a fish both her hands steepled together after the most basic of hellos she said dollars only twentyfive thousand i need to buy my son an apartment thats a very high fee said sith its not a fee it is a consideration for giving you the answer you want my fee is another twentyfive thousand dollars they negotiated sith liked the kru taeys manner it confirmed everything sith believed about life the fee was reduced somewhat but not the consideration payment upfront now the kru taey said she wouldnt take a check like only the very best restaurants she accepted foreign credit cards siths swiss card worked immediately it had unlimited credit in case she had to leave the country in a hurry the kru taey said i will tell the boys family that the marriage will be particularly fortunate sith realized that she had not yet said anything about a boy his family or a marriage the kru taey smiled i know you are not interested in your real fortune but to be kind i will tell you unpaid that this marriage really is particularly well favored all the other fortunetellers would have said the same thing without being bribed the kru taeys eyes glinted in the most unpleasant way so you neednt have bought them farms or paid me an extra twentyfive thousand dollars she looked down at her perfect fingernails you will be very happy indeed but not before your entire life is overturned the back of siths arms prickled as if from cold she should have been angry but she could feel herself smiling why and why waste politeness on the old witch sith turned to go without saying goodbye oh and about your other problem said the woman sith turned back and waited enemies said the kru taey can turn out to be friends sith sighed what are you talking about the kru taeys smile was a wide as a tigertrap the million people your father killed sith went hard not a million she said somewhere between two hundred and fifty and five hundred thousand enough smiled the kru taey my father was one of them she smiled for a moment longer i will be sure to tell the prime minister that you visited me sith snorted as if in scorn i will tell him myself but she ran back to her car that night sith looked down on all the lights like diamonds she settled onto the giant mattress and turned on her ipod someone started to yell at her she pulled out the earpieces and jumped to the window it wouldnt open she shook it and wrenched its frame until it reluctantly slid an inch and she threw the ipod out of the twentyfirstfloor window she woke up late the next morning to hear the sound of the tv she opened up the double doors into the salon and saw jorani pressed against the wall the tv jorani said her eyes wide with terror the driver waited by his packed bags he stood up looking as mournful as a bloodhound on the widescreen tv there was what looked like a pop music karaoke video except that the music was very old fashioned why would a pop video show a starving man eating raw maize in a field he glanced over his shoulder in terror as he ate the glowing singalong words were the song that the dog had sung at the top of the stairs the starving man looked up at sith and corn mash rolled out of his mouth its all like that said the driver i unplugged the set but it kept playing on every channel he sompiahed but looked miserable my wife wants to leave sith felt shame it was miserable and dirty being infested with ghosts of course they would want to go its okay i can take taxis she said the driver nodded and went into the next room and whispered to his wife with little scurrying sounds they gathered up their things they sompiahed and apologized the door clicked almost silently behind them it will always be like this thought sith wherever i go it would be like this with dara the hotel telephone started to ring sith left it ringing she covered the tv with a blanket but the terrible tinny old music kept wheedling and rattling its way out at her and she sat on the edge of her bed staring into space ill have to leave cambodia at the market dara looked even more cheerful than usual the fortunetellers had pronounced the marriage as very favorable his mother had invited sith home for the pchum ben festival we can take the bus tomorrow he said does it smell all those people in one place it smells of air freshener then we take a taxi and then you will have to walk up the track dara suddenly doubled up in laughter oh it will be good for you will there be dirt everywhere oh your dirty nikes will earn you much merit but at least thought sith there will be no tv or phones two days later sith was walking down a dirt track ducking tree branches dust billowed all over her shoes dara walked behind her chuckling which meant she thought he was scared too she heard a strange rattling sound whats that noise its a goat he said my mother bought it for me in april as a present a goat how could they be any more rural sith had never seen a goat she never even imagined that she would dara explained i sell them to the muslims it is agricultural diversification there were trees everywhere shadows crawling across the ground like snakes sith felt sick one mosquito she promised herself just one and i will squeal and run away the house was tiny on thin twisting stilts she had pictured a big fine country house standing high over the ground on concrete pillars with a sunburst carving in the gable the kitchen was a hut that sat directly on the ground no stilts and it was made of palmleaf panels and there was no electricity the strip light in the ceiling was attached to a car battery and they kept a live fire on top of the concrete table to cook everything smelled of burnt fish sith loved it inside the hut the smoke from the fires kept the mosquitoes away daras mother mrs non kunthea greeted her with a smile that triggered a respectful sompiah from sith the prayerlike gesture leaping out of her unbidden on the platform table was a plastic sack full of dried prawns without thinking sith sat on the table and began to pull the salty prawns out of their shells why am i doing this because its what i did at home sith suddenly remembered the enclosure in the forest a circular fenced area daddy had slept in one house and the women in another sith would talk to the cooks for something to do she would chop vegetables or shell prawns then daddy would come to eat and hed sit on the platform table and she little sith would sit between his knees daras older brother yuth came back for lunch he was potbellied and drove a taxi for a living and he moved in hard jabs like an angry old man he reached too far for the rice and sith could smell his armpits you see how we live yuth said to sith this is what we get for having the wrong patron sihanouk thought we were antimonarchist to hun sen we were the enemy remember the work for money program no they didnt give any of those jobs to us we might as well have been the khmer rouge the past thought sith why dont they just let it go why do they keep boasting about their old wars mrs non kunthea chuckled with affection my eldest son was born angry she said his slogan is ten years is not too late for revenge yuth started up again they treat that old monster pol pot better than they treat us but then he was an important person if you go to his stupa in anlong veng you will see that people leave offerings they ask him for lottery numbers he crumpled his green soft oldfashioned hat back onto his head and said nice to meet you sith dara shes too high class for the likes of you but he grinned as he said it he left swirling disruption in his wake the dishes were gathered again without thinking sith swept up the plastic tub and carried it to the blackened branches they rested over puddles where the washingup water drained you shouldnt work said daras mother you are a guest i grew up in a refugee camp said sith after all it was true dara looked at her with a mix of love pride and gratitude for the good fortune of a rich wife who works and that was the best sith could hope for this family would be fine for her in the late afternoon all four brothers came with their wives for the end of pchum ben when the ghosts of the dead can wander the earth people scatter rice on the temple floors to feed their families some ghosts have small mouths so special rice is used sith never took part in pchum ben how could she go the temple and scatter rice for pol pot the family settled in the kitchen chatting and joking and it all passed in a blur for sith everyone else had family they could honor to siths surprise one of the uncles suggested that people should write names of the deceased and burn them to transfer merit it was nothing to do with pchum ben but a lovely idea so all the family wrote down names sith sat with her hands jammed under her arms daras mother asked isnt there a name you want to write sith no said sith in a tiny voice how could she write the name pol pot he was surely roaming the world let loose from hell there is no one dara rubbed her hand yes there is sith a very special name no theres not dara thought she didnt want them to know her father was kol vireakboth he leant forward and whispered i promise no one will see it siths breath shook she took the paper and started to cry oh said daras mother stricken with sympathy everyone in this country has a tragedy sith wrote the name kol vireakboth dara kept the paper folded and caught siths eyes you see he seemed to say i have kept your secret safe the paper burned thunder slapped a clear sky about the face it had been sunny but now as suddenly as a curtain dropped down over a doorway rain fell a wind came from nowhere tearing away a flap of palmleaf wall as if forcing entrance in a fury the family whooped and laughed and let the rain drench their shoulders as they stood up to push the wall back down to keep out the rain but sith knew her fathers enemy was in the kitchen the rain passed the sun came out the family chuckled and sat back down around or on the table they lowered dishes of food and ate making parcels of rice and fish with their fingers sith sat rigidly erect waiting for misfortune what would the spirit of kol vireakboth do to pol pots daughter would he overturn the table soiling her with food would he send mosquitoes to bite and make her sick would he suck away all her good fortune leaving the marriage blighted her new family estranged or would a kindly spirit simply wish that the children of all cambodians could escape escape the past suddenly sith felt at peace the sunlight and shadows looked new to her and her senses started to work in magic ways she smelled a perfume of emotion sweet and bracing at the same time the music from a neighbors cassette player touched her arm gently words took the form of sunlight on her skin no one is evil the sunlight said but they can be false false how sith asked without speaking genuinely baffled the sunlight smiled with an old mans stained teeth you know very well how all the air swelled with the scent of the food savoring it the trees sighed with satisfaction life is true sith saw steam from the rice curl up into the branches death is false the sunlight stood up to go it whispered tell him the world faded back to its old self that night in a hammock in a room with the other women sith suddenly sat bolt upright clarity would not let her sleep she saw that there was no way ahead she couldnt marry dara how could she ask him to marry someone who was harassed by one million dead how could she explain i am haunted because i am pol pots daughter and i have lied about everything the dead would not let her marry the dead would not let her have joy so who could pol pots daughter pray to where could she go for wisdom loak kru kol vireakboth she said under her breath please show me a way ahead the darkness was sterner than the sunlight to be as false as you are it said you first have to lie to yourself what lies had sith told she knew the facts her father had been the head of a government that tortured and killed hundreds of thousands of people and starved the nation through mismanagement i know the truth i just never think about it ive never faced it well the truth is as dark as i am and you live in me the darkness she had read bookswell the first chapter of booksand then dropped them as if her fingers were scalded there was no truth for her in books the truth ahead of her would be loneliness dreary adulthood and penance grow up the palmleaf panels stirred like waiting ghosts all through the long bus ride back she said nothing dara went silent too and hung his head in the huge and empty hotel suite darkness awaited her shed had the phone and the tv removed her footsteps sounded hollow jorani and the driver had been her only friends the next day she did not go to soriya market she went instead to the torture museum of tuol sleng a cadre of young motoboys waited outside the hotel in baseball caps and bling instead sith hailed a sweetfaced older motoboy with a battered rusty bike as they drove she asked him about his family he lived alone and had no one except for his mother in kompong thom outside the gates of tuol sleng he said this was my old school in one wing there were rows of rooms with one iron bed in each with handcuffs and stains on the floor photos on the wall showed twisted bodies chained to those same beds as they were found on the day of liberation in one photograph a chair was overturned as if in a hurry sith stepped outside and looked instead at a beautiful house over the wall across the street it was a high white house like her own with pillars and a roof terrace and bougainvillaea a modern daughters house what do they think when they look out from that roof terrace how can they live here the grass was tended and full of hopping birds people were painting the shutters of the prison a fresh bluegray in the middle wing the rooms were galleries of photographed faces they stared out at her like the faces from her printer were some of them the same who are they she found herself asking a cambodian visitor their own the woman replied this is where they sent khmer rouge cadres who had fallen out of favor they would not waste such torture on ordinary cambodians some of the faces were young and beautiful men some were children or dignified old women the cambodian lady kept pace with her company did she guess who sith was they couldnt simply beat party cadres to death they sent them and their entire families here the children too the grandmothers they had different days of the week for killing children and wives an innocent looking man smiled out at the camera as sweetly as her aged motoboy directly into the camera of his torturers he seemed to expect kindness from them and decency comrades he seemed to say the face in the photograph moved it smiled more broadly and was about to speak sith eyes darted away the next face sucked all her breath away it was not a stranger it was dara her dara in black shirt and black cap she gasped and looked back at the lady her pinched and solemn face nodded up and down was she a ghost too sith reeled outside and hid her face and didnt know if she could go on standing tears slid down her face and she wanted to be sick and she turned her back so no one could see then she walked to the motoboy sitting in a shelter in complete silence she got on his bike feeling angry at the place angry at the government for preserving it angry at the foreigners who visited it like a tourist attraction angry at everything that is not who we are that is not what i am the motoboy slipped onto his bike and sith asked him what happened to your family it was a cruel question he had to smile and look cheerful his father had run a small shop they went out into the country and never came back he lived with his brother in a jeumroom a refugee camp in thailand they came back to fight the vietnamese and his brother was killed she was going to tell the motoboy drive me back to the hilton but she felt ashamed of what just how far was she going to run she asked him to take her to the old house on monivong boulevard as the motorcycle wove through back streets dodging redearth ruts and pedestrians she felt rage at her father how dare he involve her in something like that sith had lived a small life and had no measure of things so she thought its as if someone tinted my hair and it all fell out its as if someone pierced my ears and they got infected and my whole ear rotted away she remembered that she had never felt any compassion for her father she had been twelve years old when he stood trial old and sick and making such a show of leaning on his stick everything he did was a show she remembered rolling her eyes in constant embarrassment oh he was fine in front of rooms full of adoring students he could play the bong thom with them they thought he was enlightened he sounded good using his false soft and kindly little voice as if he was dubbed he had made sith recite verlaine rimbaud and rilke he killed thousands for having foreign influences i dont know what i did in a previous life to deserve you for a father but you were not my father in a previous life and you wont be my father in the next i reject you utterly i will never burn your name you can wander hungry out of hell every year for all eternity i will pray to keep you in hell i am not your daughter if you were false i have to be true her old house looked abandoned in the stark afternoon light closed and innocent at the doorstep she turned and thrust a fistful of dollars into the motoboys hand she couldnt think straight she couldnt even see straight her vision blurred back inside she calmly put down her teddybear rucksack and walked upstairs to her office aido the robot dog whirred his way toward her she had broken his back leg kicking him downstairs he limped whimpering like a dog and lowered his head to have it stroked to her relief there was only one picture waiting for her in the tray of the printer kol vireakboth looked out at her middleaged handsome worn wise pity and kindness glowed in his eyes the land line began to ring youl prom she told the ghosts agreed she picked up the receiver and waited a man spoke my name was yin bora his voice bubbled up brokenly as if from underwater a light blinked in the printer a photograph slid out quickly a young student stared out at her looking happy at a family feast he had a beatle haircut and a striped shirt thats me said the voice on the phone i played football sith coughed what do you want me to do write my name said the ghost please hold the line said sith in a hypnotized voice she fumbled for a pen and then wrote on the photograph yin bora footballer he looked so sweet and happy you have no one to mourn you she realized none of us have anyone left alive to mourn us said the ghost then there was a terrible sound down the telephone as if a thousand voices moaned at once sith involuntarily dropped the receiver into place she listened to her heart thump and thought about what was needed she fed the printer with the last of her paper immediately it began to roll out more photos and the land line rang again she went outside and found the motoboy waiting patiently for her she asked him to go and buy two reams of copying paper at the last moment she added pens and writing paper and matches he bowed and smiled and bowed again pleased to have found a patron she went back inside and with just a tremor in her hand picked up the phone for the next half hour she talked to the dead and found photographs and wrote down names a woman mourned her children sith found photos of them all and united them father mother three children uncles aunts cousins and grandparents taping their pictures to her wall the idea of uniting families appealed she began to stick the other photos onto her wall someone called from outside and there on her doorstep was the motoboy balancing paper and pens i bought you some soup the broth came in neatly tied bags and was full of rice and prawns she thanked him and paid him well and he beamed at her and bowed again and again all afternoon the pictures kept coming darkness fell the phone rang the names were written until siths hand which was unused to writing anything ached the doorbell rang and on the doorstep the motoboy sompiahed excuse me lady it is very late i am worried for you can i get you dinner sith had to smile he sounded motherly in his concern they are so good at building a relationship with you until you cannot do without them in the old days she would have sent him away with a few rude words now she sent him away with an order and wrote and when he came back the aged motoboy looked so happy i bought you fruit as well lady he said and added shyly you do not need to pay me for that something seemed to bump under sith as if she was on a motorcycle and she heard herself say come inside have some food too the motoboy sompiahed in gratitude and as soon as he entered the phone stopped ringing they sat on the floor he arched his neck and looked around at the walls are all these people your family he asked she whispered no theyre ghosts who no one mourns why do they come to you his mouth fell open in wonder because my father was pol pot said sith without thinking the motoboy sompiahed ah he chewed and swallowed and arched his head back again that must be a terrible thing everybody hates you sith had noticed that wherever she sat in the room the eyes in the photographs were directly on her i havent done anything said sith youre doing something now said the motoboy he nodded and stood up sighing with satisfaction life was good with a full stomach and a patron if you need me lady i will be outside photo after photo name after name youk achariya touring dancer proeung chhay school superintendent sar kothida child aged died of swelling disease sar makara her mother nurse nath mittapheap civil servant from family of farmers chor monirath wife of awardwinning engineer yin sokunthea khmer rouge commune leader she looked at the faces and realized dara im doing this for dara the city around her went quiet and she became aware that it was now very late indeed perhaps she should just make sure the motoboy had gone home he was still waiting outside its okay you can go home where do you live he waved cheerfully north oh on monivong like you he grinned at the absurdity of the comparison a new idea took sudden form sith said tomorrow can you come early with a big feast fish and rice and greens and pork curries and stirfries and kebabs she paid him handsomely and finally asked him his name his name meant golden good night sovann for the rest of the night she worked quickly like an answering service this is like a cleaning of the house before a festival she thought the voices of the dead became ordinary familiar why are people afraid of the dead the dead cant hurt you the dead want what you want justice the wall of faces became a staircase and a garage and a kitchen of faces all named she had found joranis colored yarn and linked family members into trees she wrote until the electric lights looked discolored like a headache she asked the ghosts please can i sleep now the phones fell silent and sith slumped with relief onto the polished marble floor she woke up dazed still on the marble floor sunlight flooded the room the faces in the photographs no longer looked swollen and bruised their faces were not accusing or mournful they smiled down on her she was among friends with a whine the printer started to print the phone started to ring her doorbell chimed and there was sovann white cardboard boxes piled up on the back of his motorcycle he wore the same shirt as yesterday a cheap blue copy of a lacoste a seam had parted under the arm he only has one shirt sith realized she imagined him washing it in a basin every night sith and sovann moved the big tables to the front windows sith took out her expensive tablecloths for the first time and the bronze platters the feast was laid out as if at new year sovann had bought more paper and pens he knew what they were for i can help lady he was old enough to have lived in a country with schools and he could write in a beautiful oldfashioned hand together he and sith spelled out the names of the dead and burned them i want to write the names of my family too he said he burnt them weeping the delicious vapors rose the air was full of the sound of breathing in loose papers stirred with the breeze the ash filled the basins but even after working all day sith and the motoboy had only honored half the names good night sovann she told him you have transferred a lot of merit said sovann but only to be polite if i have any merit to transfer thought sith he left and the printers started and the phone she worked all night and only stopped because the second ream of paper ran out the last picture printed was of kol vireakboth dara she promised herself dara next in the morning she called him can we meet at lunchtime for another walk by the river sith waited on top of the marble wall and watched an old man fish in the tonl sap river and found that she loved her country she loved its tough smiling uncomplaining people who had never offered her harm after all the harm her family had done them do you know you have the daughter of the monster sitting here among you suddenly all sith wanted was to be one of them the monks in the pavilion the whiteshirted functionaries scurrying somewhere the lazy bones dangling their legs the young men who dress like american rappers and sold something dubious drugs or sex she saw dara sauntering toward her he wore his new shirt and smiled at her but he didnt look relaxed it had been two days since theyd met he knew something was wrong that she had something to tell him he had bought them lunch in a little cardboard box maybe for the last time thought sith they exchanged greetings almost like cousins he sat next to her and smiled and sith giggled in terror at what she was about to do dara asked whats funny she couldnt stop giggling nothing is funny nothing she sighed in order to stop and terror tickled her and she spurted out laughter again i lied to you kol vireakboth is not my father another politician was my father someone youve heard of the whole thing was so terrifying and absurd that the laughter squeezed her like a fist and she couldnt talk she laughed and wept at the same time dara stared my father was saloth sar that was his real name she couldnt make herself say it she could tell a motoboy but not dara she forced herself onward my father was pol pot nothing happened sitting next to her dara went completely still people strolled past boats bobbed on their moorings after a time dara said i know what you are doing that didnt make sense doing what do you mean dara looked sour and angry yeah yeah yeah yeah he sat looking away from her siths laughter had finally shuddered to a halt she sat peering at him waiting i told you my family were modest he said quietly your family are lovely sith exclaimed his jaw thrust out they had questions about you too you know i dont understand he rolled his eyes he looked back round at her there are easier ways to break up with someone he jerked himself to his feet and strode away with swift determination leaving her sitting on the wall here on the riverfront everyone was equal the teenage boys lounged on the wall poor mothers herded children the foreigners walked briskly trying to look as if they didnt carry moneybelts three fat teenage girls nearly swerved into a cripple in a pedal chair and collapsed against each other with raucous laughter sith did not know what to do she could not move despair humbled her made her hang her head ive lost him the sunlight seemed to settle next to her washing up from its reflection on the wake of some passing boat no you havent the river water smelled of kindly concern the sounds of traffic throbbed with forbearance not yet there is no forgiveness in cambodia but there are continual miracles of compassion and acceptance sith appreciated for just a moment the miracles the motoboy buying her soup she decided to trust herself to the miracles sith talked to the sunlight without making a sound grandfather vireakboth thank you you have told me all i need to know sith stood up and from nowhere the motoboy was there he drove her to the hello phone shop dara would not look at her he bustled back and forth behind the counter though there was nothing for him to do sith talked to him like a customer i want to buy a mobile phone she said but he would not answer there is someone i need to talk to another customer came in she was a beautiful daughter too and he served her making a great show of being polite he complimented her on her appearance really you look cool the girl looked pleased daras eyes darted in siths direction sith waited in the chair this was home for her now dara ignored her she picked up her phone and dialed his number he put it to his ear and said go home you are my home she said his thumb jabbed the c button she waited shadows lengthened were closing he said standing by the door without looking at her shamefaced sith ducked away from him through the door outside soriya the motoboy played dice with his fellows he stood up they say i am very lucky to have pol pots daughter as a client there was no discretion in cambodia either everyone will know now sith realized at home the piles of printed paper still waited for her sith ate the old cold food it tasted flat all its savor sucked away the phones began to ring she fell asleep with the receiver propped against her ear the next day sith went back to soriya with a box of the printed papers she dropped the box onto the blue plastic counter of hello phones because i am pol pots daughter she told dara holding out a sheaf of pictures toward him all the unmourned victims of my father are printing their pictures on my printer here look these are the pictures of people who lost so many loved ones there is no one to remember them she found her cheeks were shaking and that she could not hold the sheaf of paper it tumbled from her hands but she stood back arms folded dara quiet and solemn knelt and picked up the papers he looked at some of the faces sith pushed a softly crumpled green card at him her family id card he read it carefully with the greatest respect he put the photographs on the countertop along with the id card go home sith he said but not unkindly i said she had begun to speak with vehemence but could not continue i told you my home is where you are i believe you he said looking at his feet then sith had no words it can never be sith he said he gathered up the sheaf of photocopying paper what will you do with these something made her say what will you do with them his face was crossed with puzzlement its your country too what will you do with them oh i know youre such a poor boy from a poor family who could expect anything from you well you have your whole family and many people have no one and you can buy new shirts and some people only have one dara held out both hands and laughed sith you sith are accusing me of being selfish you own them too sith pointed to the papers to the faces you think the dead dont try to talk to you too their eyes latched she told him what he could do i think you should make an exhibition i think hello phones should sponsor it you tell them that you tell them pol pots daughter wishes to make amends and has chosen them tell them the dead speak to me on their mobile phones she spun on her heel and walked out she left the photographs with him that night she and the motoboy had another feast and burned the last of the unmourned names there were many thousands the next day she went back to hello phones i lied about something else she told dara she took out all the reports from the fortunetellers she told him what hun sens fortuneteller had told her the marriage is particularly well favored is that true he looked wistful you should not believe anything i say not until i have earned your trust go consult the fortunetellers for yourself this time you pay his face went still and his eyes focused somewhere far beneath the floor then he looked up directly into her eyes i will do that for the first time in her life sith wanted to laugh for something other than fear she wanted to laugh for joy can we go to lunch at lucky she asked sure he said all the telephones in the shop all of them hundreds all at once began to sing a waterfall of trills and warbles and buzzes snatches of old songs or latest chart hits dara stood dumbfounded finally he picked one up and held it to his ear its for you he said and held out the phone for her there was no name or number on the screen congratulations dear daughter said a warm kind voice who is this sith asked the options were severely limited your new father said kol vireakboth the sound of wind i adopt you a thousand thousand voices said at once we adopt you in cambodia you share your house with ghosts in the way you share it with dust you hear the dead shuffling alongside your own footsteps you can sweep but the sound does not go away on the tra bek end of monivong there is a house whose owner has given it over to ghosts you can try to close the front door but the next day you will find it hanging open indeed you can try as the neighbors did to nail the door shut it opens again by day there is always a queue of five or six people wanting to go in or hanging back out of fear outside are offerings of lotus or coconuts with embedded josh sticks the walls and floors and ceilings are covered with photographs the salon the kitchen the stairs the office the empty bedrooms are covered with photographs of chinesekhmers at weddings khmer civil servants on picnics chams outside their mosques vietnamese holding up prize catches of fish little boys going to school in shorts cyclopousse drivers in front of their odd oldfashioned pedaled vehicles wives in stalls stirring soup all of them are happy and joyful and the background is phnom penh when it was the most beautiful city in southeast asia all the photographs have names written on them in oldfashioned handwriting on the table is a printout of thousands of names on slips of paper next to the table are matches and basins of ash and water the implication is plain burn the names and transfer merit to the unmourned dead next to that is a small printed sign that says in english hello every pchum ben those names are delivered to temples throughout the city gold foil is pressed onto each slip of paper and attached to it is a parcel of sticky rice at am food is delivered for the monks steaming rice and fish along with bolts of new cloth at am more food is delivered for the disabled and the poor and most mornings a beautiful daughter of cambodia is seen walking beside the confluence of the tonl sap and mekong rivers like cambodia she plainly loves all things modern she dresses in the latest fashion cambodian r ampb whispers in her ear she pauses in front of each new waterfront construction whether built by improvised scaffolding or erected with cranes she buys noodles from the grumpy vendors with their tiny stoves she carries a book or sits on the low marble wall to write letters and look at the boats the monsoon clouds and the dopdops she talks to the reflected sunlight on the river and calls it father
