laurell k hamilton obsidian butterfly v book of the anita blake vampire hunter series authors note for those of you who have never read an anita blake novel before let me tell you a bit about her world its just like the world we all live in except that the creatures of the night vampires werewolves zombies and such are not the stuff of fiction they are hereandnow we coexist with them not always happily not always peacefully and sometimes we get to know them all too well i was covered in blood but it wasnt mine so it was okay not only was it not my blood but it was all animal blood if the worst casualties of the night were six chickens and a goat i could live with it and so could everyone else id raised seven corpses in one night it was a record even for me i pulled into my driveway at a quarter til dawn with the sky still dark and starfilled i left the jeep in the driveway too tired to mess with the garage it was may but it felt like april spring in st louis was usually a twoday event between the end of winter and the beginning of summer one day you were freezing your ass off and the next day itd be eighty plus but this year it had been spring a wet gentle spring except for the high number of zombies id raised it had been a typical night everything from raising a civil war soldier for a local historical society to question a will that needed a final signature to a sons last confrontation with his abusive mother id been neck deep in lawyers and therapists most of the night if i heard how does that make you feel jonathan or cathy or whoever one more time tonight id scream i did not want to watch one more person go with his or her feelings ever at least with most of the lawyers the bereaved didnt come to the graveside the courtappointed lawyer would ascertain that the zombies raised had enough cognitive ability to know what they were signing then he would sign off on the contract as a witness if the zombie couldnt answer the questions then no legal signature the corpse had to be of sound mind to sign a legally binding signature id never raised a zombie that couldnt pass the legal definition of soundness but it happened sometimes jamison a fellow animator at animators inc had a pair of lawyers come to blows on top of the grave what fun the air was cool enough to make me shiver as i walked down the sidewalk to my door i could hear the phone ringing as i fumbled the key into the lock i hit the door with my shoulder because no one ever calls just before dawn unless its important for me that usually meant the police which meant a murder scene i kicked the door closed and ran for the phone in the kitchen my answering machine had clicked on my voice died on the machine and edwards voice came on anita its edward if youre there pick up silence i was running full out and skidded on my high heels grabbing the receiver as i slid into the wall and nearly dropped the phone i yelled into the receiver as i juggled the phone edward edward its me im here edward was laughing softly when i could finally hear him glad i could be amusing whats up i asked im calling in my favor he said quietly it was my turn for silence once upon a time edward had come to my aid been my backup hed brought a friend harley with him as more backup id ended up killing harley now harley had tried to kill me first and id just been quicker but edward had taken the killing personally picky picky edward had given me a choice either he and i could draw down on each other and find out once and for all which of us was better or i could owe him a favor some day he would call me up and ask for me to be his backup like harley id agreed to the favor i never wanted to come up against edward for real because if i did i was pretty sure id end up dead edward was a hit man he specialized in monsters vampires shapeshifters anything and everything there were people like me that did it legal but edward didnt sweat the legalities or hell the ethics he even occasionally did a human but only if they had some sort of dangerous reputation other assassins criminals bad men or women edward was an equal opportunity killer he never discriminated not for sex religion race or even species if it was dangerous edward would hunt it and kill it its what he lived for what he was a predators predator hed been offered a contract on my life once hed turned it down and had come to town as my bodyguard bringing harley with him id asked him why he hadnt taken the contract his answer had been simple if he took the contract he only got to kill me if he protected me he thought hed get to kill more people perfect edward reasoning hes either a sociopath or so close it makes little difference i may be one of the few friends that edward has but its like being friends with a tame leopard it may curl on the foot of your bed and let you pet its head but it can still eat your throat out it just wont do it tonight anita you still there im here edward you dont sound happy to hear from me lets just say im cautious i said he laughed again cautious no youre not cautious youre suspicious yeah i said so whats the favor i need back up he said what could be so terrible that death needs backup ted forrester needs backup from anita blake vampire executioner ted forrester was edwards alter ego his only legal identity that i was aware of ted was a bounty hunter that specialized in preternatural creatures that werent vampires as a general rule vamps were a specialty item which was one of the reasons that there were licensed vamp executioners but not licensed anything else executioners maybe vampires just have a better political lobby but whatever they get the most press bounty hunters like ted filled in the blanks between the police and the licensed executioners they worked mostly in rancherrun states where it was still legal to hunt down varmints and kill them for money varmints still included lycanthropes you could shoot them on sight in about six states as long as later a blood test proves they were lycanthropes some of the killings had been taken to court and were being contested but nothing had changed yet on a local level so what does ted need me for though truthfully i was relieved that it was ted asking and not edward edward on his own probably meant illegal maybe even murder i wasnt quite into coldblooded murder not yet come to santa fe and find out he said new mexico santa fe new mexico yes when i asked now since im coming as anita blake vamp executioner i can flash my executioners license and bring my arsenal bring what you want edward said ill share my toys with you when you arrive i havent been to bed yet do i have time to get some sleep before i get on a plane get a few hours sleep but be here by afternoon weve moved the bodies but were saving the rest of the crime scene for you what sort of crime scene id say murder but thats not quite the right word slaughter butcher torture yes he said as if trying the word over in his mind a torture scene are you trying to scare me i asked no he said then stop the theatrics and just tell me what the hell happened he sighed and for the first time i heard a dragging tiredness in his voice weve got ten missing twelve confirmed dead shit i said why havent i heard anything on the news the disappearances made the tabloids i think the headline was bermuda triangle in the desert the twelve dead were three families neighbors just found them today how long had they been dead i asked days nearly two weeks for one family jesus why didnt someone miss them sooner in the last ten years almost the entire population of santa fe has changed weve got a huge influx of new people plus a lot of people have what amounts to vacation homes up here the locals call the newcomers californicators cute i said but is ted forrester a local ted lives near the city yeah a thrill went through me from the soles of my feet to the top of my head edward was the ultimate mystery man i knew almost nothing about him really does this mean i get to see where you live youll be staying with ted forrester he said but youre ted forrester edward ill be staying at your house right he was quiet for a heartbeat then yes suddenly the whole trip seemed much more attractive i was going to see edwards house i was going to be able to pry into his personal life if he had one what could be better though one thing was bothering me when you said families were the victims does that include kids strangely no he said well thank goodness for small blessings i said you always were a soft touch for the kiddies he said does it really not bother you to see dead children no he said i just listened to him breathe for a second or two i knew that nothing bothered edward nothing moved him but children every cop i knew hated to go to a scene where the vic was a child there was something personal about it even those of us without children took it hard that edward didnt bothered me funny but it did it bothers me i said i know he said one of your more serious faults there was an edge of humor to his voice the fact that youre a sociopath and that im not is one of the things i take great pride in you dont have to be a sociopath to back me up just a shooter and you are that anita you kill as easily as i do if the circumstances are right i didnt try and argue because i couldnt i decided to concentrate on the crime instead of my moral decay so santa fe has a large transient population not transient edward said but mobile very mobile we have a lot of tourism and a lot of people moving in and out on a semipermanent basis so no one knows their neighbors i said or what their schedules should be exactly his voice was bland empty with that thread of tiredness underneath and under that was something else a tone something you think theres more bodies that you havent found yet i said i made it a statement he was quiet for a second then said you heard it in my voice didnt you yeah i said im not sure i like that you being able to read me that well sorry ill try to be less intuitive dont bother your intuition is one of the things thats kept you alive this long are you making a joke about womens intuition i asked no im saying that youre someone who works from your gut your emotions not your head its a strength for you and a weakness too tenderhearted am i sometimes and sometimes youre just as dead inside as i am hearing him state it like that was almost scary not that he was including me in the same breath as himself but that edward knew something had died inside of him you ever miss the parts that are gone i asked it was the closest thing to a personal question id ever asked him no he said do you i thought about that for a moment i started to say yes automatically then stopped myself truth always truth between us no i guess i dont he made a small sound almost a laugh thats my girl i was both flattered and vaguely irritated that i was his girl when in doubt concentrate on the job what kind of monster is it edward i asked ive no idea that stopped me edward had been hunting preternatural bad guys years longer than i had he knew monsters almost as well as i did and hed traveled the world killing monsters so he had first hand knowledge of things id only read about what do you mean you have no idea ive never seen anything kill like this anita i heard an undercurrent in his voice that id almost never heard fear edward whose nickname among the vamps and shapeshifters was death was afraid it was a very bad sign youre shook edward thats not like you wait until you see the victims ive saved you photos of the other scenes but the last one i kept intact just for you how did the local law enforcement like putting a ribbon around a crime scene and wrapping it up just for little ol me the local cops all like ted hes a good ol boy if ted tells them you can help they believe him but youre ted forrester i said and youre not a good ol boy but ted is he said voice empty your secret identity i said yeah he said fine ill fly into santa fe this afternoon or early evening fly into albuquerque instead ill meet you at the airport just call me and give me the time i can rent a car i said ill be in albuquerque on other business its not a problem what arent you telling me i asked me keeping secrets there was a thread of amusement in his voice again youre the original mystery man edward you love keeping secrets it gives you a sense of power does it he made it a question yeah it does he laughed softly maybe it does make the ticket reservations and call me with the flight times ive got to go his voice went low as if someone else had come into the room i hadnt asked what the urgency was ten missing twelve confirmed dead it was urgent i hadnt asked if hed be waiting for my call edward who never spooked was scared hed be waiting for my call it turned out that the only flight i could get that wasnt full was a noon flight which meant i got about five hours of sleep before i had to get up and run for the airport i also missed kenpo class a type of karate that id just started a few weeks ago id have much rather been in class than on a plane i hate to fly id driven to as many of the out of town appointments as possible but id been doing a lot of flying lately it had lessened the actual terror but i was still phobic i hated to be in a plane being flown by someone i didnt know who i had not personally drug tested i just wasnt the trusting sort neither are the airlines carrying a concealed weapon on a plane was a pain in the ass id had to take the twohour faa course on carrying concealed on a plane i had a certificate to prove id taken the course i could not get on the plane without the certificate i also had a letter stating that i was on official business that required me to carry a gun sergeant rudolf dolf storr head of the regional preternatural investigation team had faxed me the letter on taskforce letterhead always impressive someone who was a real policeperson had to give me something to legitimize my status if it were real police business even if dolf werent directly involved hed usually give me what i needed if edward had called me in to help in an unofficial case ie illegal i would have avoided dolf mr law and order wasnt real fond of edward aka ted forrester ted was around a lot when there were bodies on the ground it made dolf not trust him i did not look out the window i read and tried to pretend i was on a very cramped bus id finally figured out that one of the reasons i didnt like to fly was that i also have claustrophobia a full of people was close enough to make it hard to breathe i turned the little fan above my seat on high and read i was reading sharon shinn she was an author that i trusted to hold my attention even hundreds of feet above the ground with a thin metal sheet between me and eternity so i cant tell you what albuquerque looks like from the air and the little walkway that led into the airport was like every other one id ever walked through even in the tunnel you could feel the heat pressing like a giant hand hovering over the thin plastic it may have been spring in st louis but it was summer in albuquerque i scanned the crowd for edward and actually looked past him once before realizing it was him part of it was the fact that he was wearing a hat a cowboy hat there was a fan of feathers tucked into the front of the hat band but it had the look of a hat that had been worn well the brim was curved back on both sides as if hed worked at the stiff material until the brim had formed a new shape under the constant run of his hands his shirt was white and shortsleeved like something youd get at any department store it was matched with dark blue jeans that looked new and a pair of hiking boots that werent hiking boots edward hed never impressed me as a country boy no definitely a city fellow but there he stood looking sort of downhomey and comfortable it didnt look like edward at all until i met his eyes wrap him up in whatever disguise you want you could dress him like prince charming on a disney float but as long as you could glimpse his eyes you would still run screaming his eyes are blue and cold as winter skies he is the epitome of wasp breeding with his blond hair and slender paleness he can look harmless if he wants to he is the consummate actor but unless he works at it his eyes give him away if the eyes are the mirror to the soul then edwards in trouble because no one is home he smiled at me and it thawed his eyes to something close to warmth he was glad to see me genuinely glad or as glad as he ever was to see anyone it wasnt comforting in a way it was unnerving because one of the main reasons edward liked me was that together we always got to kill more than we did apart or at least i did for all i knew edward might have been mowing down entire armies when he wasnt with me anita he said edward i said the smile turned into a grin you dont seem happy to see me you being this happy to see me makes me nervous edward youre relieved im here and that scares me the grin faded and i watched all the humor all the welcome drain out of his face like water leaving a glass through a crack empty im not relieved he said but his voice was too bland liar i said i would have liked to say it softly but the noise of the airport was like the crash of the ocean a continuous roar he looked at me with those pitiless eyes and gave one small nod an acknowledgment that he was relieved i was here maybe he would have verbalized it but suddenly a woman appeared at his side she was smiling her arms sliding around him until she cuddled against him she looked thirtyish older than edward appeared though i wasnt sure of his actual age her hair was short brown a nononsense style but flattering she wore almost no makeup but was still lovely i here were lines at her eyes and mouth that had made me jump her from thirty to forty something she was smaller than edward taller than me but still petite though she didnt look soft she was tanned darker than was healthy which probably explained the lines on her face but there was a quiet strength to her as she stood there smiling at me holding edwards arm she wore jeans that looked so neat they must have been pressed a white shortsleeved shirt that was sheer enough that shed put a spaghetti strap tank top under it and a brown leather purse almost as large as my carryon bag i wondered for a second if edward had picked her up from a plane too but there was something too fresh and unhurried about her she hadnt come off a plane im donna you have to be anita she held out her hand and we shook she had a firm handshake and her hand wasnt soft shed worked this one had she also knew how to shake hands most women never really got the knack of it i liked her instantly instinctively and mistrusted the feeling just as quickly teds told me so much about you donna said i glanced up at edward he was smiling and even his eyes were full of humor the entire set of his face and body had changed he slouched slightly and the smile was lazy he vibrated with good ol boy charm it was an oscarwinning performance as if hed traded skins with someone else i looked at edwardted and said hes told you a lot about me has he oh yes donna said touching my arm while still holding onto edward of course she would be a casual toucher my shapeshifter friends were getting me accustomed to touchiefeelie stuff but it still wasnt my best thing what the hell was edward ted doing with this woman edward spoke but there was a slight texaslike drawl to his voice like an old accent almost forgotten edward had no accent whatsoever his voice was the cleanest and hardest to place id ever heard as if even his voice was never touched by the places and people he saw anita blake id like you to meet donna parnell my fiancйe my jaw dropped to the carpet and i just gaped at him i usually try and be a little more sophisticated than that or hell more polite i knew that astonishment nay shock showed but i couldnt help it donna laughed and it was a good laugh warm and chuckly a good mom laugh she squeezed edwards arm oh you were right ted her reaction was worth the trip told ya honeypot edward said hugging her and planting a kiss on the top of her head i closed my mouth and tried to recover i managed to mumble thats great i mean really i i finally extended my hand and said congratulations but i couldnt manage a smile donna used the handshake to draw me into a hug ted said youd never believe hed finally agreed to tie the knot she hugged me again laughing but my god girl ive never seen such pure shock she retreated back to edwards arms and his smiling ted face i am not nearly as good an actor as edward its taken me years to perfect a blank face let alone outright lying by facial expression and body language so i kept my face blank and tried to tell edward with my eyes that he had some explaining to do with his face slightly turned from donna he gave me his close secretive smile which pissed me off edward was enjoying his surprise damn him ted where are your manners take her bag donna said edward and i both stared at the small carryon bag i had in my left hand he gave me teds smile but he said edwards line anita likes to carry her own weight donna looked at me for confirmation as if this couldnt possibly be true maybe she wasnt as strong and independent as she appeared or maybe she was a decade older than she appeared a different generation you know teds right i said putting a little too much emphasis on his name i like to carry my own bags donna looked like shed have liked to correct my obviously wrong thinking but was too polite to say it out loud the expression not the silence reminded me of my stepmother judith which made me push donnas age over fifty she was either a mightily well preserved fiftysomething fortysomething or a sunaged thirtysomething i just couldnt tell they walked ahead of me through the airport arm in arm i followed behind them not because my suitcase was too heavy but because i needed a few minutes to recover i watched donna bump her head against edwards shoulder her face turning to him smiling glowing edwardted bent over her face tender whispering something that made her laugh i was going to be sick what the hell was edward doing with this woman was she another assassin as good an actor as he was somehow i didnt think so and if she was exactly what she appeared a woman in love with ted forrester who didnt exist i was going to kick edwards metaphorical ass how dare he involve some innocent woman in his cover story or and this was a very strange thought was edwardted really in love if youd asked me ten minutes ago id have said he wasnt capable of such depth of emotion but now now i was just plain confused the albuquerque airport broke my rule that all airports look nearly identical and you cant really tell what part of the country or even the world that youre in just from the airport if there are decorations theyre usually from a different culture entirely like inland bars having seaside motifs but not here here there were hints of a southwestern flavor everywhere multicolored tile or paint leaning to turquoise and cobalt blue lined most of the shops and store fronts a small covered stand sold silver jewelry in the middle of the large hallway leading from the gates to the rest of the airport wed left the crowd behind and with it the noise we moved in a world of neatly ringing silence heightened by the white walls and the large windows on either side albuquerque stretched outside those windows like some great flat plain with a ring of black mountains at the edge like the backdrop to a play somehow unreal the heat pressed down even through the air conditioning not really hot but letting you know it was going to be the landscape was totally alien adding to my sense of having been cut adrift one of the things i liked about edward is that he never changed he was what he was and now edward dependable in his own psychotic way had thrown me a curve ball so wild i didnt even know how to swing at it donna stopped and turned drawing edward with her anita that bag is just too heavy for you please let ted carry it she gave him a little goodnatured push in my direction edward walked towards me even his walk was a rolling sort of gait like someone who spent a lot of time on horseback or on a boat he kept teds smile on his face only his eyes slipped and showed through the mask dead those eyes empty no love shone in them damn him he actually leaned over his hand started to close over mine and the handle i hissed dont i let that one word hold all the anger i was feeling his eyes widened just a bit and he knew i wasnt talking about just the carryon bag he straightened up and called back to donna she doesnt want my help he put emphasis on the my she tsked under her breath and walked back to us youre just being stubborn anita let ted help you i looked up at her and knew my face wasnt neutral but i couldnt drain all the anger out of my face donnas eyes widened just a bit have i offended you in some way she asked i shook my head im not upset with you she looked at edward ted dear i think shes angry with you i think youre right edward said his eyes had gone back to sparkling with love and good humor i tried to salvage the situation its just that ted should have told me about the engagement i dont like surprises donna put her head to one side giving me a long considering look she started to say something then seemed to think better of it well ill try and make sure you dont get any more surprises from me she settled herself a little more securely on edwards arm and the look in her brown eyes was just a tad less friendly than it had been before i realized with a sigh that donna now thought i was jealous my reaction wasnt normal for a mere friend and business acquaintance since i couldnt tell her the real reason i was upset i let it go better she think ted and i had been an item once than the truth though heaven knew shed probably prefer wed been lovers to the real truth about her ted she was in love with a man who did not exist no matter how real the arm she was holding happened to be i tightened my grip on my bag and moved up so i was walking on the other side of donna as we moved up through the airport she wasnt comfortable with me trailing behind so id keep up im not good at small talk at the best of times but now i couldnt think of a damn thing to say so we moved in a silence that grew progressively uncomfortable for me and for donna her because she was a woman and naturally friendly me because i knew silence would make her uncomfortable i didnt want to make her more uncomfortable she broke first ted tells me youre an animator and vampire hunter i prefer vampire executioner but yeah in a desperate attempt to be polite i asked what do you do she flashed me a brilliant smile that showed the smile lines on either side of her mouth like a frame for her thin ohsoslightly lipsticked mouth i was i glad id worn no makeup maybe that would help her realize i wasnt after edwardted i own a shop in santa fe edward added she sells psychic paraphernalia he gave me a smile over her head my face hardened and i fought to keep it blank what sort of paraphernalia crystals tarot decks books everything and anything that catches my fancy i wanted to say but youre not psychic but i didnt id met people before that were convinced they had psychic gifts when they didnt if donna was one of the successfully deluded who was i to burst her bubble instead i said is there much of a market for that sort of thing in santa fe oh there used to be a lot of shops like mine the new age was really big in santa fe but the property taxes have skyrocketed and most of the new psychics have moved further into the mountains to taos santa fes energy has changed in the last five years or so its still a very positive place but taos has better energy now im not sure why she talked about energy like it was an accepted fact and didnt try to explain it as if i would understand her she was assuming like so many people did that if you raised the dead for a living you were psychic in other areas too which was often true but not always what she called energy i called the feel of a place some places did have a feel to them good or bad energizing or draining the old idea of genius loci was alive and well in the new age movement under a different name do you read cards i asked it was a polite way of finding out if she believed she had powers oh no donna said my gifts are very small id love to be able to read cards or crystals but im only a proprietor my talent in this life is helping others discover their strengths it sounded like something a therapist who believed in past lives would have said id been meeting enough of them at graveside to know the lingo so youre not a psychic i said i just wanted to be sure she knew it oh heavens no she shook her head for emphasis and i noticed her small gold earrings were ankhs most people that go into the business usually are i said she sighed the psychic im going to now says that im blocked in this life because of misuse of my gifts last time around she says ill be able to work magic next time again she assumed i believed in reincarnation and past life therapy probably because of what i did for a living either that or edwardted had been lying to her about me just to amuse himself but i didnt point out that i was a christian and didnt believe in reincarnation there are after all more religions on the planet that believe in reincarnation than ones that dont who am i to quibble i just couldnt help the next question and have you met ted before in a past life no actually hes brand new to me though brenda says he is a very old soul brenda your psychic i asked she nodded ill agree with the old soul part i said edward gave me a look over her head where she couldnt see him it was a suspicious look youve felt it too then the way he resonates thats what brenda calls it like a great heavy bell in her head whenever hes around alarm bells more likely i thought aloud i said sometimes you can make your soul heavy in one lifetime she gave me a puzzled look she wasnt stupid there was intelligence in those brown eyes but she was naive donna wanted to believe it made her an easy mark for a certain kind of liar like wouldbe psychics and men like edward men who lied about who and what they were id like to meet brenda before i go home i said edwards eyes widened where she couldnt see them donna smiled delightedly id love to introduce the two of you shes never met an animator before i know shed get a kick out of meeting you ill bet i said i did want to meet brenda because i wanted to see if she was truly a psychic or just a charlatan if she was professing to abilities she didnt possess it was a crime and id turn her in i hated seeing supposed psychics take advantage of people it was always amazing to me with the number of genuine talents around how many fakes still managed to prosper we were passing a restaurant decorated in more blue and fuchsia tiles with small daisylike flowers painted in the edges there was a mural on one wall showing spanish conquistadors and breechclothclad native americans as we came down the escalators i was still managing to balance my carryon without any trouble all that weightlifting i guess there was a bank of pay phones set to one side let me try to get hold of the kids one more time donna said she kissed edwards cheek and moved off towards the phones before i could react kids i said yes he said voice careful how many i asked two ages boy fourteen girl six he said wheres their father donna is a widow i looked at him and the look was enough no i didnt do it he died years before i met donna i stepped close to him turning my back so that donna wouldnt see my face from the phones what are you playing at edward she has children and is so in love with you it makes me gag what on gods green earth could you be thinking donna and ted have been dating for about two years theyre lovers she expected him to propose so he did his face was still smiling ted but the voice was matter of fact and totally unemotional youre talking like teds a third person edward youre going to have to start calling me ted anita i know you if you dont make it a habit youll forget i stepped into him in the relative silence lowering my voice to a furious whisper fuck that he is you and youre fucking engaged are you going to marry her he gave a small shrug shit i said you cant you cannot marry this woman his smile widened and he stepped around me holding his hands out to donna he kissed her and asked how are the munchkins he turned her in his arms so he was halfhugging her and had her turned away from me his face was ted relaxed but his eyes were warning me dont screw this up it was important to him for some reason donna turned so she could see my face and i fought to give blank face what were you two whispering about so urgently the case edward said oh pooh she said i raised eyebrows at edward oh pooh the most dangerous man id ever met was engaged to a mother of two that said things like oh pooh it was just too weird donnas eyes widened where is your purse did you leave it on the plane i didnt bring one i said i knew id have the bag and pockets she looked at me as if id spoken in tongues my god i wouldnt know what to do without my monstrosity in tow she pulled the huge purse around in front of her im such a pack rat where are your kids i asked with my neighbors theyre a retired couple and are just great with my little girl becca she frowned of course nothing seems to make peter happy right now she glanced at me peters my son hes fourteen going on forty and seems to have hit his teenage years with a vengeance everyone told me a teenager was hard but i never dreamed how hard has he been getting into trouble i asked not really i mean hes not into anything criminal she added the last a little too quickly but hes just stopped listening to me he was supposed to come home two weeks ago from school and watch becca instead he went to a friends house when i came home after the shop closed the house was empty and i didnt know where either of them were the hendersons had been out so becca wasnt there god i was frantic another neighbor had taken her in but if they hadnt been home shed have just had to wander the neighborhood for hours peter came home and just wasnt sorry by the time he came home id convinced myself hed been abducted by someone and was lying dead in a ditch somewhere then he just comes strolling in as if nothings wrong is he still grounded i asked she nodded face very firm you bet he is grounded for a month and ive taken every privilege i can think of away from him what does he think of you and ted getting married it was a sadistic question and i knew it but i just couldnt help myself donna looked stricken truly stricken hes not too keen on the idea keen well hes fourteen and a boy i said hes bound to resent another male coming into his turf donna nodded yes im afraid so ted hugged her itll be all right honeypot pete and i will come to an understanding dont you worry i didnt like edwards phrasing on that i watched his face but couldnt see behind his ted mask it was as if for minutes at a time he just vanished into his alter ego i hadnt been on the ground an hour and his jekyllhyde act was already beginning to get on my nerves do you have any other bags edward asked of course she does donna said shes a woman edward gave a small laugh that was more his own than teds it was a small sound that made donna glance at him and made me feel better anita isnt like any other woman ive ever met donna gave him another look edward had phrased it that way on purpose hed caught her jealous reasoning just as i had and now he was playing to it it was one way to explain my strange reaction to the engagement news without risk of blowing his cover i guess i couldnt blame him but in a way i knew it was payback for my lack of social skills his cover was important enough to him to let donna think wed been a couple which meant it was pretty important to him edward and i had never had a single romantic thought about each other in our lives ive got luggage i said see donna said tugging on his arm the carryon bag wouldnt hold all the guns donna stopped in the middle of saying something to edward then turned slowly to stare at me edward and i stopped walking because she had stopped her eyes were a little wide she seemed to have caught her breath she was staring at me but not at my face if it had been a guy i might have accused him of staring at my chest but that wasnt exactly what she was looking at i followed her gaze and found that my jacket had slipped back over my left side exposing my gun it must have happened when i readjusted the bag coming off the escalator careless of me im usually pretty careful about exposing my arsenal in public it tends to make people nervous just like now i shifted the bag so that my jacket slid back over the shoulder holster like a curtain dropping back in place donna drew a quick breath blinked and looked at my face you really do carry a gun her voice held a sort of wonderment i told you she did edward said in his ted voice i know i know donna said she shook her head ive just never been around a woman that do you kill as easily as ted does it was a very intelligent question and meant that shed been paying more attention to the real edward than id given her credit for so i answered the question truthfully no edward hugged her to him eyes warning me over her head anita doesnt believe shifters are animals she still thinks the monsters can be saved it makes her squeamish sometimes donna stared at me my husband was killed by a werewolf he was killed in front of me and peter peter was only eight i didnt know what reaction she expected so i didnt give her one my face was neutral interested far from shocked what saved you she nodded slowly understanding the question a werewolf tore her husband apart in front of her and her son yet they were still alive and the husband wasnt something had interceded something had saved them john my husband had loaded a rifle with silver shot hed dropped the gun in the attack hed wounded it but not enough her eyes had gone distant with remembering we stood in the bright airport three people huddled in a small circle of silence and hushed voices and donnas wide eyes i didnt have to look at edward to know that his face was as neutral as mine shed fallen silent the horror still too fresh in her eyes the look was enough there was worse to come or worse to her something she felt guilty about at the very least john had just showed peter how to shoot the week before he was so little but i let him take that gun i let him shoot that monster i let him stand his ground in the face of that thing while i just huddled on the floor frozen that was it that was the true horror for donna shed allowed her child to protect her allowed her child to take the adult role of protector in the face of a nightmare shed failed the big test and little peter had passed into adulthood at a very tender age no wonder he hated edward peter had earned his right to be man of the house hed earned it in blood and now his mother was going to remarry yeah right donna turned those haunted eyes to me she blinked and seemed to be drawing herself hack from the past as if it were a physical effort she hadnt made peace with the scene or it wouldnt have remained so vivid if you can begin to make peace you can tell the most horrible stories as if they happened to someone else unemotional or maybe you havent made peace but you still tell it like it was an interesting story that happened a long time ago nothing important ive seen cops that had to get drunk before the pain spilled out into their stories donna was hurting peter was hurting edward wasnt hurting i looked up at him past donnas softly horrified face his eyes were empty as he looked at me as waiting and patient as any predator how dare he step into their lives like this how dare he cause them more pain because whatever happened whether he married her or didnt it was going to be painful painful for everyone but edward though maybe i could fix that if he fucked up donnas life maybe i could fuck up his yeah i liked that id spread the rain around all over his parade it must have shone in my eyes for a second or two because edwards eyes narrowed and for a moment i felt that shiver he could send down my spine with just a glance he was a very dangerous man but to protect this family id test his limits and mine edward had finally found something that pissed me off enough to maybe press a button that id never wanted to touch he had to leave donna and her family alone he had to get out of their lives id see him out of their lives or else and there is only one or else when youre dealing with edward death we stared at each other over donnas head while he hugged her to his chest stroking her hair mouthing soothing words to her but his eyes were all for me and i knew as we stared at each other that he knew exactly what i was thinking he knew the conclusion id come to though he might never understand why his involvement with donna and her kids was the straw that broke the camels back but the look in his eyes was enough he might not understand why but he knew the camel was broken in fucking two and there was no way to fix it except to do what i wanted him to do or die just like that i knew id do it i knew i could look down the barrel of a gun and shoot edward and i wouldnt aim to wound it was like a cold weight inside my body a surety that made me feel stronger and a little lonelier edward had saved my life more than once id saved his more than once yet yet id miss edward but id kill him if i had to edward wonders why im so sympathetic to the monsters the answer is simple because i am one we walked out into the heat and it blasted against our skin on the edge of a hot wind it had the feel of a serious heat and considering that it was only may it probably would be a real barnburner when true summer finally hit but it is true that eighty plus without humidity isnt nearly as miserable us eighty plus with humidity so it wasnt horrible in fact once you blinked into the sunlight and just got adjusted to the heat you sort of forgot about it it was only attentiongetting for the first oh fifteen minutes or so st louis would probably be ninety plus by the time i got home and with eighty to a hundred percent humidity of course that meant id be going home if i really drew down on edward that was a debatable option there was a very real possibility that hed kill me i hoped seriously hoped that i could talk him out of donna and her family without resorting to violence maybe the heat didnt seem bad because of the landscape albuquerque was a flat empty plain running out and out to a circle of black mountains as if everything of worth had been stripmined away and the waste had been lumped into those forbidden black mountains like giant mounds of coal yeah it looked like the worlds largest stripmining operation and it had that feel to it of waste and desolation of things spoiled and an alien hostility as if you werent quite welcome i guess donna would say bad energy id never felt anyplace that had such an instant alienness to it edward was carrying both my suitcases that had come off the carousel normally id have carried one but not now now i wanted edwards hands full of something besides guns i wanted him at a disadvantage i wasnt going to start shooting on the way in the car but edward is more practical than i am if he decided i was more danger than help he might he able to arrange an accident on the way to the car itd be tough with donna in tow but not impossible not for edward it was also why i was letting him lead the way and putting me at his back instead of him at mine it wasnt paranoia not with edward with edward it was simply good survival thinking edward got donna to go ahead of us and unlock the car he dropped back to walk beside me and i put some distance between us so that we were standing in the middle of the sidewalk staring at each other like two oldfashioned movie gunfighters he kept the suitcases in his hands i think he knew that i was too keyed up i think he knew if he dropped the suitcases i was going to have a gun in my hand you want to know why i wasnt bothered with you following behind me you knew i wouldnt shoot you in the back i said he smiled and you knew i might i cocked my head to one side almost squinting into the sun edward was wearing sunglasses of course but since his eyes rarely gave anything away it didnt matter his eyes werent what i had to worry about you like the personal danger edward thats why you only hunt monsters you have to be taking the big risk every time you come up to bat or its no fun a couple came walking by with a cart full of suitcases we waited in silence until they passed us the woman glanced at us as they hurried past picking up on the tension the man jerked her back to face front and they pushed past us you have a point edward asked you want to know which of us is better edward youve wanted to know for a long time if you take me from ambush the question will never be answered and that would bug you his smile both widened and faded as if it wasnt a humorous smile anymore so i wont shoot you in the back thats right i said so why go to so much trouble to fill my hands and make me walk in front this would be a hell of a time to be wrong he laughed then soft and vaguely sinister that one sound said it all he was excited about the idea of going up against me i would love to hunt you anita ive dreamed about it he sighed and it was almost sad but i need you i need you to help solve this case and as much as id like the big question answered id miss you you may be one of the only people in the world that i would miss what about donna i asked what about her he asked dont be cute edward i looked past him to find donna waving to us from the parking lot were being paged he glanced back towards her lifting one of the suitcases to make a vague wave it would have been easier to do if hed dropped one of the cases but in his own way edward was being cautious too he turned back to me you wont he able to do your job if youre looking over your shoulder for me so a truce until the case is solved your word i asked he nodded my word good enough i said he smiled and it was genuine the only reason you can take my word at face value is that if you give your word youll keep it i shook my head and started closing the distance between us i keep my word but i dont take most peoples oaths very seriously i was even with him and could feel the weight of his gaze even through the black lens of the sunglasses he was intense was edward but you take mine youve never lied to me edward not once youve given your word you do what you say youll do even if its a bad thing you dont hide what you are at least not from me we both glanced back at donna and started walking side by side toward her as if wed discussed it how the hell did you let it get so far how could you have let ted propose he was quiet for so long i didnt think hed answer we walked in silence in the sunwarmed heat but finally he did answer i dont know i think one night i just got too caught up in my role the mood was right and ted proposed and i think for just a second i forgot that id be the one getting married i glanced at him youve told me more personal shit in the last half hour than in the entire five years ive known you are you always such a jabberbox when youre on teds home turf he shook his head i knew you wouldnt like donna being involved i didnt know how strongly youd react but i knew you wouldnt like it which meant to keep the peace i had to be willing to talk about it i knew that when i called you we stepped off the curb both of us smiling and me waving to donna i said through the smile like a ventriloquist how can we know each other this well and would miss each other if we died yet still be willing to pull the trigger i know its the truth but i dont understand it isnt it enough to know its true do you have to explain it he asked as we wove through the cars toward donna yes i need to explain it why he asked because im a girl i said that made him laugh a surprise burst of sound and it made my heart ache because i could count on one hand the number of times id heard edward surprised into laughter i valued the sound of that particular laugh because it was like an old sound from a younger more innocent edward i wondered if i was the only one that could force that laugh from him how could we be talking calmly about killing each other no it wasnt enough to know we could do it there had to be a why to it and saying we were both monsters or sociopaths wasnt enough explanation at least not for me donna looked at me rather narrowly as we walked up she made a big show of kissing him and when he sat the suitcases down and had his hands free she put on an even better show they kissed hugged and body pressed like a couple of teenagers if edward was in any way reluctant it didnt show in fact he slipped off his hat and melded into her like he was happy to be there i stood leaning against the side of the car close enough to touch them if they wanted privacy they could get a room it went on long enough that i wondered if checking my watch would be hint enough but resisted the urge i decided that leaning against the car arms crossed over my stomach looking bored might be hint enough edward drew back with a sigh after last night i wouldnt think youd be missing me this much i always miss you she said in a voice halfway between sultry and a giggle donna gazed at me hands still encircling him very possessive she looked right at me and said sorry didnt mean to embarrass you i pushed away from the car i dont embarrass that easy the happy light in her eyes turned to something fierce and protective the look and her next words were not friendly and just what would it take to embarrass you i shook my head is this my cue to say a lot more than youve got she stiffened dont worry donna i am not now nor have i ever been interested in ted in a romantic way i never thought she started to say save it i said lets try something really unique lets be honest you were worried about me with edward i changed it very quickly to ted which was why you did the teenybopper makeout session you dont need to mark your territory for my sake donna the last was said in something of a rush because i hoped she hadnt noticed my slip on the names but of course she had and i knew edward had teds too much like me to ever consider dating itd be like incest she blushed even through the tan my you are direct shes direct even for a man edward said for a woman shes like a battering ram it saves time i said that it does edward said he drew donna into a quick but thorough kiss ill see you tomorrow honeypot i raised eyebrows at that edward looked at me with teds warm eyes donna drove her own car in so we could spend part of the day together now shes going to drive home to the kiddies so we can do business donna turned from him giving me a long searching look im taking you at your word anita i believe you but im also picking up some strange vibes from you like youre hiding something i was hiding something i thought if she only knew donna continued face very serious im trusting you with the third most important person in my life ted is right behind my kids for me dont screw up the best thing ive had since my husband died see edward said donna knows how to be blunt too that she does i said donna gave me one last searching look then turned to edward she drew him away towards a car three down from us they talked quietly together while i waited in the still dry heat since donna had tried for privacy i gave it to them turning away and gazing off at the distant mountains they looked very close but its always been my experience that mountains are seldom as close as they appear theyre like dreams distant things to set your sights on but not truly to be trusted to be there when you need them i heard edwards boots crunch on the pavement before he spoke i was facing him arms crossed lightly over my stomach which put my right hand nicely close to the gun under my arm i believed edward when he said we had a truce on but better cautious than sorry he stopped by the car one slot over leaning his butt against it arms crossing to mirror me but he didnt have a gun under his arm i wasnt sure that a bounty hunters license was enough to get him through an airport metal detector so he shouldnt have been able to have a gun or large blade on him unless of course hed picked it up from one of the cars where hed hidden it it would be something that edward would do better to assume the worst and he wrong than assume the best and be wrong pessimism will keep you alive optimism wont not in our line of business anyway our line of business strange phrase edward was an assassin i wasnt but somehow we were in the same business i couldnt quite explain it but it was title edward gave me a pure edward smile a smile meant to make me uneasy and suspicious it also usually meant that he meant me no harm and was just yanking my chain of course he knew i knew what the smile usually meant so he might use it to lull me into a false sense of security or it could mean just what it seemed to i was overthinking things and that was bad all on its own edward was right i was at my best when i let my gut work and kept my higher functions in the background not a recipe for going through life but a good one for a gunfight we have a truce i said he nodded i said we did you make me nervous i said the smile widened glad to hear youre still scared of me i was beginning to wonder the day you stop being afraid of the monsters is the day they kill you and im a monster he made it a question you know exactly what you are edward his eyes narrowed you called me edward in front of donna she didnt say anything but you are going to have to be more careful i nodded im sorry i caught it too i will try but im not half as good a liar as you are besides ted is a nickname for edward not if the full name on my drivers license is theodore now if i can call you teddy maybe id remember teddy is fine he said voice totally unchanged you are a very hard man to tease ed ted names dont mean anything anita theyre too easy to change is edward really your first name it is now i shook my head id really like to know why he gazed at me from the black sunglasses and the weight of his interest burned through the glass the question wasnt idle of course edward seldom asked any question he didnt want an answer to because ive known you for five years and i dont even know if your first name is real its real enough he said it bugs me not to know i said why he asked again i shrugged and eased my hand away from my gun because it wasnt necessary not right this minute not today but even as i did it i knew there would be other days and for the first time i really wasnt sure that both of us would see the end of my little visit it made me sad and grumpy maybe i just want to know what name to put on the tombstone i said he laughed confidence is a fine trait overconfidence isnt the laughter faded and left his face around the glasses cool and unreadable i didnt have to see his eyes to know they were cold and distant as winter skies i pushed away from the car hands empty at my sides look edward ted whatever the hell you call yourself i dont like being invited here to play monster bait and find you dating the new age mom of the year its thrown me and i dont like that either we have a truce until the case is solved then what then well see he said you couldnt just agree to stop being engaged to donna no his voice was small careful why not i asked id need to give her a good enough reason to break her heart and the kids remember ive been spending a lot of time with the kids how would it look to just vanish on them i think her son wouldnt mind peter wasnt it i think hed love it if ted would vanish edward turned his head to one side yeah peter would love it but what about becca ive been in her life for over two years and shes only six donna trusts me to pick her up after school i drive her once a week to dance lessons so donna doesnt have to close the shop early his voice and face never changed as he spoke as if it was just facts and meant nothing anger tightened my shoulders and traveled down my arms i put my hands in fists just to have something to do with my body you bastard maybe he said but be careful what you ask me to do anita just walking out could do more damage than the truth i stared at him trying to see behind that blank face have you thought about telling donna the truth no damn you do you really think she could handle the truth the entire truth about me he asked i thought about that for nearly a full minute while we stood in the heatsoaked parking lot finally i said no i didnt like saying it but truth was truth youre sure she couldnt play wife to an assassin i mean youve only met her for half an hour how can you be so sure now youre teasing me i said his lips twitched almost a smile i think you are exactly right i dont think donna could handle the truth the car belonged to ted even though edward was driving it it was a square and big something between a jeep a truck and an ugly car it was covered in red clay mud as if hed been driving through ditches the windshield was so dirty only two fans of clear space remained where the windshield wipers had washed away the mud everything else had dried to a reddishbrown patina of dirt gee edward i said as he opened the back hatch what have you been doing to this poor whatever it is ive never seen a car so dirty this is a hummer and cost more than most peoples houses he raised the hatch and started putting my bags inside i offered him my carryon and when i was close could smell that new car smell which explained why the carpeting in back was still nearly pristine if it costs that much then why doesnt it rate better care i asked he took the carryon and put it on the new carpet i bought it because it could go over almost any terrain in almost any weather if i didnt want it to get dirty id have bought something else he slammed the hatch shut how can ted afford something like this actually ted makes a fine living off varmint hunting not this good i said not off of bounty hunting how do you know what a bounty hunter makes he asked peering around the filthy car at me he had a point i guess i dont most people dont know what a bounty hunter makes so i can get away with some purchases that might be out of teds price range he walked around the car toward the drivers side only the top of his white hat showing above the mudcaked roof i tried the passenger side door and it opened it took a little bit of work to climb into the seat and i was glad i wasnt wearing a skirt one nice thing about working with edward was that he wouldnt expect me to wear business attire it was jeans and nikes for this trip the only business thing i was wearing was the black jacket slung over my cotton shirt and jeans the jacket was to hide the gun nothing more what are the gun laws like in new mexico edward started the car and glanced at me why i put on my seatbelt evidently we were in a hurry i want to know if i can ditch the jacket and wear my gun naked or whether im going to have to hide the gun for the entire trip his lips twitched new mexico lets you carry as long as its not concealed concealed carry without a permit is illegal let me test my understanding i can wear the gun in full view of everyone with or without a carry permit but if i put a jacket over it concealing it and dont have a carry permit its illegal the twitch turned into a smile thats right western state gun laws are always so interesting i said but i started sliding out of the jacket you can wiggle out of almost anything while remaining seatbelted in a car since i always wear a seatbelt id had a lot of practice but the police may still stop you if they see you walking around armed just make sure youre not here to kill anybody he half smiled when he said the last so i can carry as long as its not concealed but not really not without getting questioned by the police and you cant carry a gun of any kind even unloaded into a bar i dont drink i think i can avoid the bars a wire fence edged the road he pulled onto but did nothing to take away the flat flat distances and the strange black mountains what are the mountains called sangre del cristo the blood of christ he said i looked at him to see if he was kidding of course he wasnt why why what why call them the blood of christ i dont know how long has ted lived out here almost four years he said and you dont know why the mountains are named sangre del christo do you have no curiosity not about things that dont affect the job he didnt say a job but the job i thought it was odd phrasing what if this monster that were hunting is some kind of local bugaboo knowing why the mountains are named what theyre named may mean nothing or it may have to do with a legend a story a hint about some great blood bath in the past there are very localised monsters edward things that only come above ground every century or so like really longlived cicadas cicadas he asked yeah cicadas the immature form stays in the ground until every thirteen or seven or whatever their cycle is years they climb out molt and become adults theyre the insects that make all that noise in the summer time whatever did those people wasnt a giant cicada anita thats not the point edward my point is that there are types of living creatures that stay hidden almost totally hidden for years then resurface are still a part of the natural world preternatural biology is still so maybe old myths and legends would give us a clue i didnt bring you down here to play nancy drew he said yes you did i said looked at me long enough to make me want to tell him to watch the road what are you talking about if you just wanted someone to point and shoot youd have brought in someone else you want my expertise not just my gun right hed turned back to the road much to my relief there were small houses on either side most of them made of adobe or fauxadobe i didnt know enough about it to judge the yards were small but welltended running high to cacti and huge lilac bushes with surprisingly small bundles of pale lavender flowers on them it looked like a different variety from the lilacs in the midwest maybe it took less water silence had filled the car and i let it watching the scenery id never been to albuquerque and id play tourist while i could edward finally answered then he turned onto lomos street youre right i didnt ask you down here just to shoot things i already have backup for that who i asked you dont know them but youll meet them in santa fe were driving straight to santa fe now i havent eaten yet today i was sort of hoping to catch some lunch the latest crime scene is in albuquerque well catch it then lunch will i feel like eating afterwards maybe i dont suppose i could talk you into lunch first then weve got a stop before we hit the house he said what other stop i asked he just gave that small smile which meant it was going to be a surprise edward loved to try my patience maybe hed answer a different question whos your other backup i told you you dont know them you keep saying them are you saying that you already have two people for backup and you still needed to call me in too he didnt say anything to that three people backing you on this geez edward you must be desperate id meant for it to be a joke sort of he didnt take it that way i want this case solved anita whatever it takes he looked grim when he said it so much for my sense of humor do these two backups owe you a favor one does are they assassins sometimes bounty hunters like ted bernardo is at least i had a name bernardo is a sometimes assassin and a bounty hunter like ted you mean he uses his bounty hunting identity like you use yours as a legal identity sometimes hes a bodyguard too a man of many talents i said not really he said which was a strange thing to say what about the other guy olaf olaf okay hes sometimes an assassin not a bounty hunter not a bodyguard and what else edward shook his head his noncommittal answers were beginning to get on my nerves do either of them have any other special abilities besides being willing to kill yes hed reached my limit on yes no answers i didnt come down here to play twenty questions edward just tell me about the other backups youll meet them soon enough fine then tell me where the other stop is he gave a small shake of his head look edward youre getting on my nerves and youve already pissed me off so cut the mysterious crap and talk to me he glanced sideways at me a glimpse of eyes from the edges of the dark glasses my my arent we touchy today this isnt even close to touchy for me edward and you know it but keep up the noncommittal crap and you are going to truly piss me off i thought you were already pissed off about donna i am i said but im willing to get interested in the case and forget to be continuously pissed but i cant get interested in the case if you dont answer questions about it as far as im concerned your backup is part of the case so either start sharing info or drive me back to the damn airport i didnt tell olaf and bernardo youre shacking up with a vampire and a werewolf actually im not dating either of them anymore but thats not the point i dont want to know about their sex life edward i just want to know why you called them in what are their areas of expertise you broke up with jeanclaude and richard both for one of the few times since id met him i heard real curiosity in his voice i wasnt sure if it was nice to know or disturbing that my personal life interested edward i dont know if we broke up its more like we arent seeing each other i need some time away from them before i decide what to do what are you thinking about doing to them and there was a note of eagerness now edward was only eager about one thing i am not planning to kill either of them if thats what youre hinting at i cant say im not disappointed edward said i think you should have killed jeanclaude yourself before it all got too deep youre talking about killing someone who has been my lover off and on for over a year edward maybe you could strangle donna in her bed but id lose sleep over something like that do you love him the question stopped me not because of the question but because of who was asking it it seemed a truly odd question coming from edward yeah i think i do do you love richard again it seemed odd talking about my emotional life with edward i have a few male friends and most of them would rather have a root canal than to talk about feelings of all my male friends i was talking to the one i thought would never discuss love with me it just wasnt my year for understanding men yes i love richard you say you think you love the vampire but you simply answer yes about richard kill the vampire anita ill help you do it not to put too fine a point on it edward but im jeanclaudes human servant richard is his animal to call the three of us are bound by vampire marks into a nice little menage a trois if one of us dies we may all die maybe or maybe thats what the vampire tells you it wouldnt be the first time hes lied to you it was impossible to argue without looking like a fool so i didnt try when i want your advice on my personal life ill ask for it until people start ice skating in hell save your breath now tell me about the case you get to tell me who to date and who not to but i cant return the favor he asked i looked at him are you angry with me about my stand on donna not exactly but if you get to give me advice on dating why cant i return the favor its not the same thing edward richard doesnt have kids children make that big a difference to you he asked i nodded yeah they do i never figured you as the maternal type im not but kids are people edward little people trapped by the choices the adults around them make donnas old enough to make her own mistakes but when you screw her youre screwing her kids too i know that doesnt bother you but it bothers me i knew it would i even knew how youd react but i dont know why well youre one ahead of me i never dreamed you were boffing new age widows with munchkins i figured you more for the pay as you go plan ted doesnt pay for it he said how about edward he shrugged its like eating just another need the cold bluntness of it was actually reassuring see thats the edward ive grown to know and be afraid of youre afraid of me but yet youd come against me for a woman you just met and two kids you dont even know im not even planning to kill any of them and yet youd push the ultimate question between us he shook his head i dont understand that dont understand it edward just know its true i believe you anita youre the only person i know except for me that never bluffs bernardo and olaf bluff i gave it that extra little lilt making it a question he shook his head and laughed the tension that had been building eased with that laugh no im not giving you anything on them why i asked because he said and he almost smiled i looked at his careful profile youre enjoying this youre enjoying olaf and bernardo meeting me i didnt try and keep the surprise out of my voice just like i enjoyed you meeting donna even though you knew id be pissed i said he nodded the look on your face was almost worth a death threat i shook my head youre beginning to worry me edward just beginning to worry you i must be losing my touch fine dont tell me about them tell me about the case he pulled into a parking lot i looked up to find a hospital looming over us is this the crime scene no he pulled into a parking spot and shut the engine off what gives edward why are we at a hospital the survivors are here my eyes widened what survivors he looked at me the survivors from the attacks he opened his door and i grabbed his arm holding him in the car edward turned slowly and looked at my hand on the bare skin of his arm he looked at my hand a long time with his disapproval at the touch radiating from him but it was a trick id pulled myself more than once if the person makes it known that they dont want to be touched most people that dont mean you violence will back off i didnt back off i dug my fingers into his skin not to hurt just to let him know he wasnt getting rid of me that easily talk to me edward what survivors he shifted his gaze from my hand to my face i had an urge to snatch the sunglasses from his face but fought it his eyes wouldnt show me anything anyway i told you there were injured people his voice was mild no you didnt you made it sound like there were no survivors my oversight he said my ass i said i know you enjoy being mysterious edward but its getting tedious let go of my arm he said it the way youd say hello or nice day no inflection at all will you answer my questions if i do no he said still with that same pleasant empty voice but if you make this a pissing contest anita ill feel compelled to make you let go you wouldnt like that the voice never changed there was even a slight smile to his mouth but i let go slowly drawing back into my seat if edward said i wouldnt like it i believed him talk to me edward he gave me a big ol smile call me ted then the son of a bitch got out of the car i sat in the car watching him walk across the parking lot he stopped at the edge with the hospital just across a small road from him he took off the sunglasses slipped one of the ear pieces into his shirt front and stared back at the car waiting it would serve him right if i didnt get out it would serve him right if i went back to st louis and let him clean up his own mess but i opened the door and got out why you might ask one hed asked me for a favor and being edward hed reveal all in his own sadistic time two i wanted to know i wanted to know what had finally cut through all that coldness and scared him i wanted to know curiosity is both a strength and a weakness which one this particular curiosity was wouldnt be answered for a while i was betting on weakness saint lucia hospital was big and one of the few buildings of any size in albuquerque that id seen that didnt have a southwest theme to it it was just big and blocky generic hospital maybe they didnt expect the tourists to see the hospital lucky tourists as hospitals go it was nice but it was still a hospital a place i only go when things have gone wrong the only up side this time was that it wasnt me or anyone i knew in the rooms we were in a long pale corridor with lots of closed doors but there was a uniformed police officer in front of one of them call it a hunch but i figured that was our room edward walked up to the policeman and introduced himself he was at his good ol boy best harmless and jovial in a subdued hospital sort of way they knew each other on sight which should have sped things up considerably the uniform looked past edward to me he looked young but his eyes were cool and gray cop eyes you have to be on the job a while before your eyes go empty but he looked at me too long and too intently you could almost feel the testosterone rising to the surface the challenging look said that either he was insecure in his own masculinity his own copness or that he hadnt been on the job all that long not a rookie but not much beyond it either if he expected me to squirm under the scrutiny he was going to be disappointed i faced him smiling calm eyes blank and close to bored passing inspection had never been my favorite thing he blinked first the lieutenant is inside he wants to see her before she goes inside why edward asked voice still likable the officer shrugged im just following orders mr forrester i dont question my lieutenant wait here he opened the door and slipped inside without giving much of a glimpse inside he shut the door behind him not waiting for the weight and hinges to do it for him edward was frowning i dont know whats going on i do i said he looked at me raising an eyebrow as if to say go ahead im a girl and technically a civilian a lot of cops dont trust me to do the job i vouched for you gee ed ted i guess your opinion doesnt carry as much weight as you thought it did he was still frowning at me with edwards eyes when the door swung open i was watching his face as he transformed into ted the eyes sparkled the lips curved the entire set of his face remade itself as if it were a mask his own personality vanished like magic watching the show this up close and personal made me shiver just a bit the ease with which he switched back and forth was just plain creepy the man in the doorway was short not many inches above me maybe five foot six at best i wondered if their police force didnt have a height requirement his hair was a golden sunstreaked blond cut very short and close to his squarejawed face he was tanned a nice soft gold as if it were as dark a tan as his pale skin were capable of first donna now the lieutenant didnt anyone sweat skin cancer here he looked at me with greengold eyes the color of new spring leaves they were beautiful eyes with long golden lashes and softened his face to an almost feminine appearance only the masculine jut of the jaw saved him from being one of those men who is beautiful instead of handsome the jaw both ruined his face and saved it from perfection the eyes may have been lovely but they werent friendly it wasnt even the coolness of cop eyes it was hostile since id never met him before it had to be the fact that i was a woman a civilian andor an animator he was either a chauvinist or superstitious i wasnt sure which i preferred he let me have a nice long dose of glaring i just gave blank face waiting for him to get tired of it i could stand there all day and be peacefully blank standing in a nice safe hospital corridor wasnt even close to the worst thing id had to do lately it was always sort of peaceful when no one was trying to kill me edward tried to break the stalemate lieutenant marks this is anita blake chief appleton called you about her he was still using teds happy voice but there was a set to his shoulders that was stiff and not so happy youre anita blake lieutenant marks managed to sound doubtful i nodded yep his eyes narrowed i dont like civilians messing in my case he jerked a thumb at edward forrester here has proven himself valuable he pointed a finger at me you havent edward started to say something but marks but him off with a sharp movement of his hand no let her answer for herself ill answer a question if youll ask one i said whats that supposed to mean it means you havent asked a question yet lieutenant youve just made statements i dont need shit from some fucking zombie queen ah he was prejudiced one mystery solved i was invited down here lieutenant marks i was invited to help you solve this case now if you dont want my help fine but ill need someone from the city government to explain to my boss why the hell i got on a plane to new mexico when i wasnt sure of my welcome i dont treat you right and you run to powers that be is that it i shook my head who got your panties in a twist marks he frowned what do i remind you of your exwife im married to my only wife he sounded indignant congratulations is it the voodoo that i use to raise the dead are you nervous around the mystical arts i dont like black magic he fingered the crossshaped tie tack that was standard police issue almost everywhere but somehow i thought marks was serious about it i dont do black magic marks i drew on the silver chain around my neck until the crucifix spilled into the light im christian episcopalian actually i dont know what youve heard about what i do but its not evil you would say that he said the state of my immortal soul is between god and myself lieutenant marks judge not lest ye be judged yourself or do you skip that part and just keep the parts you like his face darkened and a vein in his forehead started to pulse this level of anger even if he was a rightwinger christian extremist was over the top what in hell is behind that door to have you both so spooked i asked marks blinked at me i am not spooked i shrugged yeah you are youre all bent out of shape about the survivors and youre taking it out on me you dont know me he said no but i know a lot of policemen and i know when someones scared he stepped close enough to me that if it had been a fight id have stepped back put space between us instead i stood my ground i wasnt really expecting the lieutenant to take a swing at me you think youre so fucking tough i blinked at him close enough that if id risen on tiptoe i could have kissed him i dont think lieutenant i know he smiled at that but not like he was happy you think you can take it be my guest he stepped to one side making a sweeping motion towards the door i wanted to ask what was behind the door what could possibly be so horrible that it had edward and a police lieutenant this shaken i stared at the closed door smooth hiding all its secrets what are you waiting for ms blake go ahead open the door i glanced back at edward i dont suppose youd give me a hint open the door anita i muttered bastard under my breath and opened the door the door didnt lead directly into the room it led into a small antechamber with another sealed mostly glass door beyond there was a hush of air circulating through the room as if the room had its own separate air supply a man stood to one side wearing green surgical scrubs complete with little plastic booties over his feet a mask hanging loose from his neck he was tall and slender without looking weak he was also one of the first new mexicans that id met without a tan he handed me a pile of scrubs put this on i took the clothes are you the doctor on this case no im a nurse you got a name he gave a small smile ben im ben thanks ben im anita why do i need the scrubs to guard against infection i didnt argue with him my expertise was more in the line of taking lives not preserving them id bow to the experts i put the scrubs over my jeans tying the string tie as tight as it would go the legs of the pants still bagged around my feet ben the nurse was smiling we werent expecting them to send us a policeman so petite i frowned at him smile when you say that his smile brightened a flash of white teeth the smile softened the face and made him seem less like nurse cratchet and more like a human being and im not a cop his eyes flicked to the gun in its shoulder holster the gun was very black and very noticeable against the red shirt youre carrying a gun i slipped a shortsleeved shirt over my head and the offending gun new mexico law says i can carry as long as its not concealed if youre not a policeman then why do you need the gun im a vampire executioner he held a longsleeved gown out towards me i slipped my arms through the sleeves it tied in the back like most hospital gowns ben tied it for me i thought you couldnt kill a vampire with bullets silver bullets can slow them down and if theyre not too old or too powerful blowing a hole in their brain or heart works sometimes i added wouldnt want ben to get the wrong idea and try to take out an intruding vamp with silver ammo and get munched because he trusted my opinion we had some trouble getting my hair up under the little plastic hair thing but finally managed it though the thin ridge of elastic that held it in place scraped the back of my neck every time i moved my head ben tried to help mo with the surgical gloves but i put them on myself no problem he raised eyebrows at me youve put on gloves before it wasnt a question i wear them at crime scenes and when i dont want blood under my fingernails he helped me tie the mask around my neck you must see a lot of blood in your line of work not as much blood as you see i bet i turned with the mask over my mouth and nose only my eyes were left uncovered and real ben looked down at me and his face looked thoughtful im not a surgical nurse what is your specialty i asked burn unit my eyes widened are the survivors burned he shook his head no but their bodies are still like open wounds just like a burn the protocol is similar what do you mean their bodies are an open wound someone tapped on the glass behind me and i jumped turning to see another man in an outfit just like mine glaring at me with pale eyes he hit an intercom button and his voice came clear enough to hear the irritation in it if youre coming inside then do it i want to sedate them again and i cant do that until youve had a chance to question them or so im told he let go of the button and walked further away behind a white curtain that hid the rest of the room from view gee im just on everybodys happy list today ben put on his mask and said dont take it personally doctor evans is good at what he does one of the best if you want to find a good doctor in a hospital dont ask other doctors or referral services ask a nurse nurses always know whos good and whos not they may not say the bad stuff aloud but if they say something good about a doctor you can take it to the bank ben touched something on the wall that was a little too big to be called a button and the doors whooshed open with a sound like an air lock opening i stepped inside and the doors hushed closed behind me nothing but the white curtain now i didnt want to pull that curtain aside everyone was too damned upset it was going to be bad their bodies were like open wounds ben had said but not a burn what had happened to them as the old saying goes only one way to find out i took a deep breath and pushed the curtain aside the room beyond was white and antiseptic looking a very hospital of a hospital room outside this room there had been some attempt at pastels and a pretense that it was just a building just hallways just ordinary rooms all pretense ended at the curtain and reality was harsh there were six beds each with a whitish plastic hoodtent over the head of the beds and the upper bodies of the patients doctor evans was standing beside the nearest bed a woman in matching scrubs was further into the room checking one of the many blinking beeping pieces of equipment that huddled around each bed she glanced up and the small area of her face that showed was a startling darkness african american female and not fat but beyond that and height i couldnt tell anything underneath the protective clothing i wouldnt recognize her again without the scrubs it was strangely anonymous and disturbing or maybe that was just me she dropped her gaze and moved to another bed doing the same checks writing something down on a clipboard i walked towards the closest bed doctor evans never turned around or acknowledged me in any way white sheets formed tents over each patient held up by some sort of frame work to keep the sheet from touching them doctor evans finally turned to one side so i could see the face of the patient i blinked and my eyes refused to see it or maybe my brain just rejected what i was seeing the face was red and raw as if it should be bleeding but it didnt bleed it was like looking at raw meat in the shape of a human face no meaty skull the nose had been cut off leaving bloody holes for the plastic tubes to be shoved inside the man rolled brown eyes in his sockets staring up at me there was something wrong with his eyes beyond the lack of skin around them it took me a few seconds to realize his eyelids had been cut off the room was suddenly warm so warm and the mask was suffocating me i wanted to pull it off so i could breathe i must have made some movement because the doctor grabbed my wrist dont take anything off im risking their lives with every new person that comes in here he let go of my wrist make the risk worth it tell me what did this i shook my head concentrating on breathing slowly in and out when i could talk i asked whats the rest of the body look like he stared at me his eyes demanding i met his gaze anything was better than looking at what lay in the bed youre pale already are you sure you want to see the rest no i said truthfully even with just his eyes visible i could see the surprise on his face i would like nothing better than to turn and walk out of this room and keep walking i said i dont need any new nightmares doctor evans but i was called in here to give my expert opinion i cant form an opinion without seeing the whole show if i thought i didnt need to see it all trust me i wouldnt ask what do you hope to gain by it he asked im not here to gape at them doctor but im looking for clues to what did this most of the time the clues are on the bodies of the victims the man in the bed made small jerks head tossing from side to side as if he were in a great deal of pain small helpless noises came from his lipless mouth i closed my eyes and tried to breathe normally please doctor i need to see i opened my eyes in time to see him rolling back the sheet i watched him roll it back folding it carefully revealing the mans body an inch at a time by the time i saw him to the waist i knew that hed been skinned alive id hoped it was just the face that was awful enough on its own but it takes a hell of a long time to skin a grown mans entire body a long screaming eternity to do it this well and this thoroughly when the sheet rolled back over the groin i swayed just a little it wasnt a man the groin area was smooth and raw i glanced back up at the chest the bone structure looked male i shook my head is this a man or a woman man he said i stared down and couldnt keep from staring at the groin and what was missing shit i said softly i closed my eyes again it was so hot so very hot with my eyes closed i could hear the hiss of the oxygen the whisper of the nurses booties as she came towards us and small sounds from the bed as he twitched and strained against padded restraints at his wrist and ankles restraints id seen them but hadnt really registered them all i could see was the body yes body i couldnt keep thinking of the man as a he i had to distance myself or i was going to lose it concentrate on business i opened my eyes why the restraints my voice was breathy but clear i glanced down at the body then back up giving doctor evans the most complete eye contact id ever given id stare at him until i memorized the light crowsfeet around his eyes if i just didnt have to keep looking at what lay on the bed they keep trying to get up and leave he said i frowned not that he could see it under the mask surely theyre too hurt to get far weve got them on some very strong painkillers when the pain dies down they try to leave all of them i asked he nodded i made myself look back to the bed why isnt this just a case of a serial not killer what would you call it a serial i shook my head i couldnt think of a word for it why was i called in im a preternatural expert and this could have been done by a person there are no blade marks on the tissue doctor evans said i stared up at him what do you mean i mean that no blade did this because no matter how good they are at torture there are always telltale signs of the instrument used youre right when you say the bodies of the victims have the best clues but not these bodies its almost as if their skin just dissolved away any corrosive agent that could take someones skin and soft tissue like nose and groin wouldnt just stop at the skin it would keep eating through the body he nodded unless it was washed off immediately but theres no residue of any known corrosive agent more than that the body isnt patterned on an acid burn the nose and groin were torn away there are signs of tearing and damage that arent present elsewhere its almost as if whoever did the skinning skinned them then tore off the extra pieces he shook his head ive traveled all over the world to help catch torturers i thought id seen it all but i was wrong are you a forensic pathologist i asked yes but theyre not dead i said he looked at me no theyre not dead but the same skills that let me judge a dead body work here too ted forrester said there were deaths did they die from the skinning now that i was working the room didnt seem so hot if i concentrated very carefully on the business stuff maybe i wouldnt throw up on the patients no they were cut into pieces and left where they fell blade marks on the cut up bodies i assume or you wouldnt have used the word cut there were marks of a cutting tool but it was like no knife or sword or hell bayonet that id ever seen the cuts were deep but not clean something less refined than a steel blade was used what i asked he shook his head i dont know the blade didnt cut through the bones though whoever cut the bodies up pulled the bodies apart at the joints no human would have the strength to do that not multiple times probably not i said you really think a human being could have done this he asked motioning at the bed are you asking me if a person could do this to another person if you travel the world testifying in cases of death by torture then you know exactly what people are capable of doing to each other im not saying a person wouldnt do this he said im saying i dont think it would be physically possible to do it i nodded the cutting and tearing i think might have been human but i agree with the skinning if it were done by a human then there would be tool marks of some kind you say tool marks not blade marks most people assume it takes a blade to skin someone anything that holds an edge can do it i said though its slower and usually messier this is strangely clean yes he said nodding yes thats a good phrase for it as horrible as it is its still very neatly done except for the extra tissue that was removed that was not neatly done but brutally done almost like we have two different i kept wanting to say killers but these people were still alive perpetrators i said finally what do you mean cutting up a body with a dull tool that isnt strong enough to tear through bone then pulling a person apart with bare hands is something more in the line of a disorganized serial killer the careful skinning is something an organized serial killer might do why go to the trouble of carefully skinning the face and groin then pulling off the pieces its either two different mutilators or its two different personalities a multiple personality he made it a question not exactly but not all serial killers are so easy to put in one category or another some organized criminals have moments of savagery that resemble the disorganized killer and some organized minds become more disorganized as they escalate their killing the same isnt true of a disorganized killer there arent enough brownies in the pan for them to ape organized methods so either an organized killer with savage moments of disorganization or or what the good doctor was talking very reasonably to me not angry anymore id either impressed him or at least hadnt disappointed him not yet anyway it could be a pair of killers an organized killer being the brains of the operation and the disorganized being the follower its not that unusual to find killers working in tandem like the hillside strangler or rather stranglers he said i smiled behind the mask there have been a lot more cases than just that one where we had two killers sometimes its two men sometimes its a man and a woman in that case the man is the dominant personality or at least in every case ive ever heard of except one either way one is dominant and the other is to a lesser or greater degree in the control of the other it can be a near complete domination so that the other person is unable to say no or it can be more of a partnership but even in more equal relationships one person is primarily dominant while the other is the follower and youre sure its a serial mutilator he asked no i said what do you mean the serial mutilator idea is the most normal solution i can come up with but it im a preternatural expert doctor evans im rarely called in when the answer wears a human face no matter how monstrous someone thinks this wasnt done by human hands or i wouldnt be here the fbi agent seemed very sure doctor evans said i looked at him have i just wasted both our times here did the feds come in and say pretty much what i just said pretty much he said then you dont need me the fbi is convinced that its a serial mutilator a person sometimes the feds can be very sure of themselves and once theyve committed themselves they dont like to be wrong policemen in general can be like that it is usually the easy answer when it comes to crime if a husband dies the wife probably did do it cops arent encouraged to complicate a case theyre encouraged to simplify it why arent you taking the simple solution he asked several reasons one if it was a serial anything a human id think the police feds whatever would have some clues by now the level of fear and uncertainty among the men is too high if they had a clue to what was happening theyd be less panicked i dont have a superior to report to no ones going to slap my hand or demote me in rank if i guess and im wrong my job and income dont depend on pleasing anyone but myself you do have a boss to answer to he said yeah but i dont have to give regular written reports hes more a business manager than anything he doesnt give a rats ass how i do the job as long as i do it and dont insult too many people along the way i raise the dead for a living doctor evans its a specialized skill if my boss gives me too much grief there are two other animating firms in this country that would take me in a hot minute i could even go freelance youre that good he said i nodded i seem to be and that frees me from a lot of the red tape and politics that the police have to mess with my goal is to keep this from happening to anyone else if i look a little foolish or indecisive along the way thats just fine though ill probably get some pressure to make up my mind and pick a bogeyman not from my boss but from the police and the feds solving something like this could make a cops career being wrong and failing to solve it could he the end of a career but if youre wrong you arent hurt evans said i looked at him if im wrong then no harm no foul if everybodys looking in the wrong direction me the cops the feds everybody then this is going to keep on happening i looked down at the man on the bed that will hurt why why will it hurt you because were the good guys and whoever or whatever is doing this is the bad guy good is supposed to triumph over evil doctor evans or whats a heaven for youre christian i nodded i didnt think you could be christian and raise zombies surprise i said he nodded though i wasnt sure what he was agreeing with do you need to see the others or is this enough you can cover him back up but yeah i should at least look at the others if i dont then ill wonder if i missed something by not looking no one else has made it all the way around the room without having to leave and that includes me the first time i walked in here he was walking to the next bed as he spoke i followed behind not happy to be there but feeling better i could do this if i just concentrated on solving the crime and shoved my empathy in a tight dark box at that moment sympathy was a luxury i couldnt afford the second man was almost identical to the first except for height and eye color blue eyes this time and i had to look away if i locked gazes with any of them theyd become people and id run screaming the third bed was different the wounds on the chest seemed different somehow and when doctor evans rolled the sheet over the groin i realized it was a woman my gaze went back to her chest where something had ripped away her breasts her eyes rolled wildly mouth opening and closing making small sounds and i saw for the first time why no one was talking the tongue was just a ruined stump rolling like a butchered worm in that lipless skinless opening heat washed over me in a rush the room swam i couldnt breathe the mask molded itself to my open gaping mouth i turned and went for the doors i walked slowly i didnt run but if i didnt get out of there i was going to lose what little i had on my stomach or maybe faint of the two i think i preferred throwing up doctor evans pressed the pad that opened the door without a word the doors opened and i went through ben the nurse turned to me mask hastily held in place with a gloved hand when the doors shut behind me he let the mask drop you all right i shook my head not trusting my voice i jerked the mask off my face and still couldnt seem to get enough air it was too quiet in the little room the only sound the soft hush of the air whooshing in recycling the small movement of cloth as ben moved towards me i needed noise human voices i needed out of there i jerked the plastic thingie off my head my hair fell around my shoulders brushed my face i still couldnt get enough air im sorry i said and my voice sounded distant ill be back i opened the outer door and escaped the hall felt cooler though i knew it wasnt i leaned beside the closed door eyes closed breathing in great draughts of air the corridor was full of noise after that silent hissing room people walking moving and lieutenant marks voice not so fucking tough after all eh ms blake i opened my eyes and looked at him he was sitting in the chair that had probably been brought up for the uniform guarding the door the uniformed officer was nowhere to be seen only edward leaned against the far wall hands behind his back he was watching my face watching me as if hed memorize my fear i made it through three patients before i had to leave the room how many did you see before you had to go outside marks i didnt have to leave the fucking room doctor evans said that no one has made it through the room all the way through the room without having to run out that means you didnt make it either marks so piss off he was on his feet now you you witch he spat the last word at me as if it were the worst insult he could come up with dont you mean bitch i said i was feeling better out here in the hallway trading insults with marks was a cakewalk compared to my other choices i said what i meant if you dont know the difference between a real witch and an animator no wonder you havent caught the thing thats doing this what do you mean thing he asked thing thing monster the feds think its a serial mutilator he said i glanced at edward nice of someone to tell me what the feds said edward didnt look guilty in the least he gave me pleasant unreadable and i turned my attention back to marks then why arent there any tool marks from the skinning marks glanced down the corridor where a nurse was pushing a small cart we dont discuss an ongoing investigation in the open where anyone can hear us fine then after ive gone back in there and looked at the last three bodies well go some place more private and talk about the case i think he paled just a bit youre going back in there the victims are the clues lieutenant you know that we can take you to the crime scenes he said it was the nicest thing hed ever said to me great and i need to see them but right this moment were here and the only possible clues are inside that room my breathing had returned to normal and the sick sweat had dried on my forehead maybe i was a touch pale myself but i was mobile and felt almost normal i walked into the middle of the hall and motioned edward over to me as if i had something for his ears alone he pushed away from the wall and came toward me when he was close enough i faked a low kick he looked down for just an instant reacting to it and the second higher kick caught him in the jaw he went backwards hard he had his arms up to defend his face he knew enough to defend the vital areas and worry about standing later my heart was thudding in my chest not from exertion but from adrenaline id never used my newfound kenpo skills in a fight trying it out for real for the very first time on edward was probably not my best idea but hey it had worked though truthfully i was a little surprised it had worked that easily in the back of my head a voice wondered if edward had let me take him down the front of my head said that he had too much ego for that i believed the second voice i stayed where i was in a modified horse stance it was pretty much the only stance i knew well enough to go back to once a kick was launched i had my fists up waiting but didnt move in when edward figured out i wasnt going to do anything else he lowered his arm and stared at me what the hell was that there was blood on his lower lip ive been taking kenpo i said kenpo its sort of like taekwondo with fewer kicks and more fluid movements a lot of hand work a black belt in judo wasnt enough he asked and it was teds voice asking judos great exercise but its not great for selfdefense you have to close with the bad guy and grapple this way i can stay out of reach and still do damage he touched his lip and came away with blood i see that why why did i kick you in the face i asked he nodded and i think he winced ever so slightly great why didnt you warn me about the victims tell me what i was up against i walked in on them cold he said i wanted to see how you handled it cold this is not a pissing contest edward ted i am not competing with you i know youre better than me tougher than me colder than me you win okay stop with the macho bullshit im not so sure he said softly not sure about what i asked whos tougher remember i didnt make it through the whole room either i stared at him fine you want to go one on one great but not now we are supposed to be solving a case we are supposed to be making sure that what happened to those people doesnt happen to anyone else when were back on our own time then you can get competitive until we solve this cut it the fuck out or you are going to seriously piss me off edward got slowly to his feet i backed away out of reach id never seen him use martial arts before but i put nothing past him a sound made me back up further until i could see edward and marks without looking away from edward marks was making a small sniggering sound it took me a moment to realize he was laughing laughing so hard his face was purplish and he seemed to be having trouble breathing edward and i both stared at him when marks could finally talk he said you kick a man in the face and thats not seriously pissed off he straightened hand to his side like he had a stitch in it what the fuck do you call seriously pissed i felt my face going blank my eyes going empty for just an instant i let marks see the gaping hole where my conscience was supposed to be i didnt really mean to but i couldnt seem to help it maybe i was more shaken up from the room and its survivors than i thought its the only excuse i can give marks face went from fading laughter to something like concern he gave me cop eyes but underneath that was an uncertainty that was almost fear smile lieutenant its a good day no one died i watched the thought spill through his face he understood exactly what i meant you should never even hint to the police that youre willing to kill but i was tired and i still had to go back into the room fuck it edward spoke in his own voice low and empty and you wonder why i compete with you i turned eyes that i knew were just as dead as his to meet his gaze i shook my head i dont wonder why you compete with me ted i just told you to stop doing it until the case is solved and then he asked then well see wont we i didnt see fear on edwards face i saw anticipation and that was the difference between us he enjoyed killing i didnt what really scared me was the thought that that might be the only difference between us now it wasnt enough of a difference for me to throw stones in edwards direction i still had more rules than edward did there were still things that he would do that i wouldnt but even that list had been growing shorter of late there was something close to panic fluttering in my stomach not fear of edward or anything he could do but wondering when id turned the corner and become just another monster id told doctor evans we were the good guys but if edward and i were on the side of the angels then what was left to be on the other side something that could skin a person alive without using a tool of any kind something that would jerk the penis off a man and the breasts off a woman with its bare hands as bad as edward was as bad as id become there were worse things and we were about to go hunting one of them i did go back into the room and no i didnt learn a damn thing from the last three victims all that wasted bravery for nothing well not exactly for nothing i proved to myself that i could go back into the room without throwing up or fainting i didnt care if it impressed edward or marks it impressed me if you cant impress yourself then no one else really matters i either impressed doctor evans or he needed a restorative cup of tea because he invited me back to the doctors and nurses lounge theres no such thing as truly undrinkable coffee but i hoped the tea was better for evans sake though i doubted it the coffee came out of a can and the tea was from little bags with strings on them theres only so much you can hope for from prepackaged tea and coffee at home i grind my own beans but i wasnt home and i was grateful for the bitter warmth i added cream and sugar and noticed that the coffee was trembling in the cup as if maybe my hands werent quite steady i was also cold nerves just nerves if edward had nerves you couldnt tell it as he leaned against the wall drinking his coffee black hed scorned sugar and cream tough heman that he was he winced as he sipped and i dont think it was the scalding liquid his lip was swelling slightly from where id kicked him it made me feel better childish but true marks had taken a place on the rooms only couch blowing on his coffee hed taken cream and sugar in his evans settled down into the only chair that looked halfway comfortable sighing as he stirred his tea edward watched me and i finally realized that he wouldnt sit down until i did screw it i sat down in a chair that was far too straightbacked to be comfortable but was placed so i could watch everyone in the room including the door there was a small but fullsize refrigerator against the far wall it was an older model done in an odd shade of brown a small lshaped cabinet area housed a coffee maker a second coffee maker with nothing but hot water in it a sink and a microwave oven doctor evans had used the hot water for his tea there were white plastic spoons in an open packet and a mug of those useless little coffee stirrers thered been a choice of sugar nutrasweet and some other artificial sweetener that id never heard of there was a circle of artificial creamer that had dried into a round crusty ridge where someone had sat a mug down in it i concentrated on the minutia of the cabinet trying not to think for just a few moments i wanted to sip my coffee and not think i still hadnt eaten today and now i didnt want to you said you had some questions for me ms blake doctor evans spoke into the silence i jumped and so did marks only edward stayed halfleaning against the wall unmoved blue eyes watching us all as if he were apart from the tension and the horror maybe he was or maybe it was just an act i just didnt know anymore i nodded trying to focus how did they all survive he tilted his head to one side do you mean technically how did they survive medical detail i shook my head no i mean one person surviving this much trauma or even two ill buy but most people wouldnt survive it or am i wrong evans pushed his glasses more securely on his nose but nodded no you arent wrong then how did all six of them survive i asked he frowned at me im not sure i understand exactly what youre trying to say here ms blake im asking what are the chances that six people of varying sex background physical fitness age etc would all be able to survive the same amount of trauma my understanding is that all the victims that were just skinned have survived right yes doctor evans was watching me closely pale eyes searching my face waiting for me to go on why did they survive theyre tough sons of bitches marks said i glanced at the lieutenant then back to evans are they are they what the doctor asked are they tough sons of bitches he lowered his eyes as if thinking two of the men worked out regularly one of the women was a marathon runner the other three were just ordinary one of the men is close to sixty and didnt have a regular exercise routine of any kind the other woman is in her thirties but didnt he looked at me no they arent particularly tough individuals not physically anyway but ive found that its often the people who arent physically strong or outwardly tough that survive the longest under torture the hemen are usually the first to cave i forced myself not to glance at edward but it was an effort let me test my understanding doctor have any people that have been skinned like the six in that room died he blinked and again looked into the distance as if remembering then he looked at me no the only deaths have been those people torn apart then i ask again why are they all alive why didnt at least one of them die from shock blood loss or a bad heart or hell the pure terror of it people dont die from terror marks said i glanced at him are you absolutely sure of that lieutenant his handsome face looked petulant stubborn yeah im sure i waved the comment away id argue with marks later right now i was chasing a point how did all six of them survive doctor not why this six but why all of them evans nodded i see what you mean how could all of them have survived it i nodded exactly some of them should have died but they didnt whoever skinned them is an expert marks said he knew how to keep them alive no edward said no matter how good you are at torture you cant keep everybody alive even if you do exactly the same thing to each of them some people die and some people live youre not always sure why some make it and some dont his voice was very quiet but it filled the hush of the room doctor evans looked at him nodding yes yes even an expert cant make people survive what was done to these six you should lose some of them for that matter i dont know why theyre all still alive why hasnt one of them contracted some secondary infection they are all remarkably healthy marks stood so abruptly he spilled coffee over his hand he cursed striding to the sink and throwing the cup and all in the sink how can you say theyre healthy he looked over his shoulder at the doctor while he ran his hands under the water they are still alive lieutenant and for their condition that is very healthy indeed magic would do it i said everyone looked at me there are spells that can keep a person alive during torture so that the torture can be prolonged marks tore too much paper towel off the roll and turned on me wiping his hands with small abrupt movements how can you say you dont do black magic i said there are spells that will do it not that i did the spells i said it took him three tries to get the paper towel in the waste basket just knowing about such things is evil think what you like marks but maybe one of the reasons you had to call me in is that youve kept yourself so lily white that you dont know enough to help these people maybe if you were more interested in solving crime than in saving your own soul youd have wrapped this up by now saving a soul is more important than solving crime he said he was striding towards me now i stood up coffee cup in my hand if youre more interested in souls than crime then become a minister marks what we need right now is a cop he stalked towards me and i think would have come close enough to exchange blows but i watched him remember what id done out in the hall i watched him remember caution and he walked far around me to get to the door doctor evans glanced from one to the other of us as if wondering what hed missed marks turned at the door pointing a finger at me if i have my way you are going to be back on a plane tonight you cant ask the devil to help you catch the devil with that he closed the door behind him evans spoke into the silence there must be more in you ms blake than mere toughness something i havent seen yet i looked at him and took a drink of the cooling coffee what would make you say that doctor if i didnt know better id say lieutenant marks is afraid of you he said hes afraid of what he thinks i am doctor evans hes jumping at shadows evans looked up at me his tea forgotten in his big hands the look was a long considering one i had an urge to squirm under such scrutiny but fought it down perhaps you are right ms blake or perhaps he has seen something in you that i have not when you spend all your time worrying that the devil is right behind you eventually you start seeing him whether hes there or not i said evans stood nodding he rinsed his coffee mug in the sink washing it out with a fresh paper towel and soap he spoke without turning around i do not know if i will ever see the devil but i have seen true evil and if there is no devil behind it still it is evil he turned and looked at me and we must put a stop to it i nodded yes i said we must he smiled then but his eyes stayed tired i will work with my colleagues here that are more accustomed to working with the living instead of the dead we will try and discover why these six survive and if its magic i asked he nodded do not tell lieutenant marks but my wife is a witch she has traveled the world with me seeing such things sometimes what we find is more up her alley than mine not often mind you people are quite able to torment one another without aid of magic but occasionally it has been more dont take this wrong i said but why havent you called her in before this he took in a long breath and let it out she was out of the country on another matter why you may ask didnt i call her home sooner i shook my head i wasnt going to ask he smiled thank you for that i reasoned that my wife was needed elsewhere and the fbi seemed so sure it was a person he glanced at edward then back to me the truth is ms blake something about all this frightens me i am not a man who is easily frightened youre afraid for your wife i said he stared at me as if he could look into my mind with those pale eyes wouldnt you be i touched his arm gently trust your instincts doctor if it feels wrong send her away he drew away from my touch smiling tossing the paper towel into the trash can that would be terribly superstitious of me youve got a bad feeling about your wifes involvement with this thing trust your gut dont try to be reasonable if you love your wife listen to your heart not your head he nodded twice then said i will think about what you said now i really must be going i held out my hand he took it thanks for your time doctor my pleasure ms blake he nodded to edward mr forrester edward nodded in return and we were left in the silence of the lounge listen to your heart and not your head damn romantic advice coming from you edward said drop it i said i had my hand on the door handle how would your love life be if you took your own advice he asked i opened the door and walked out into the cool white hallway without answering him marks offer of escorting me to the crime scene seemed to have evaporated with his temper edward drove me we drove in almost complete silence edward never sweated small talk and i just didnt have the energy for it if i could have thought of something useful to say id have said it until then silence was fine edward had volunteered that we were on our way to the latest crime scene and wed meet his other two backups in santa fe he told me nothing else about them and i didnt press it his lip was still swelling because hed been too macho to put ice on it i figured the busted lip was all the slack edward was going to give me for one day id told him in the strongest terms i could manage short of pulling a weapon to stop the competitive crap and nothing would change that least of all me besides i was still riding in a ringing bell of silence as if everything echoed and nothing was quite solid it was shock the survivors if that was the word for them had shaken me down to my toes id seen awful things but nothing quite like that i was going to have to snap out of it before we had our first fire fight but frankly if someone had pulled a weapon on me right that second id have hesitated nothing seemed truly important or even real i know why youre afraid of this thing i said he glanced toward me with the black lenses of his eyes then back to the road as if he hadnt heard anyone else would have asked me to explain or made some comment edward just drove you dont fear anything that just offers death youve accepted that youre not going to live to a ripe old age we he said weve accepted that we arent going to live to a ripe old age i opened my mouth to protest then stopped i thought about it for a second or two i was twentysix and if the next four years were anything like the last four id never see thirty id never really thought about it in so many words but old age wasnt one of my biggest worries i didnt really expect to get there my life style was a sort of passive suicide i didnt like that much it made me want to squirm and deny it but i couldnt wanted to but couldnt it made my chest squeeze tight to realize that i expected to die by violence didnt want it but expected it my voice sounded uncertain but i said it out loud fine weve accepted that were not going to make it to a ripe old age happy he gave a slight nod youre afraid that youll live like those things in the hospital youre afraid of ending up like them arent you his voice was almost too soft to hear but somehow it carried over the rush of wheels and the expensive purr of the engine im trying not to think about it i said how can you not think about it he asked because if you start thinking about the bad things worrying about them then it makes you slow makes you afraid neither of us can afford that two years ago id have been giving you the pep talk he said and there was something in his voice not anger but close you were a good teacher i said his hands gripped the wheel i havent taught you all i know anita you are not a better monster than i am i watched the side of his face trying to read that expressionless face there was a tightness at the jaw a thread of anger down the neck and into his shoulders are you trying to convince me or yourself ted i made the name light and mocking i didnt usually play with edward just to get a rise out of him but today he was unsure and i wasnt part of me was enjoying the hell out of that he slammed on the brakes and screeched to a stop on the side of the road i had the browning pointed at the side of his head close enough that pulling the trigger would paint his brains all over the windows he had a gun in his hand i dont know where in the car it had come from but the gun wasnt pointed at me ease down edward he stayed motionless but didnt drop the gun i had one of those moments when you see into another persons soul like looking into an open window your fear makes you slow edward because youd rather die here like this than survive like those poor bastards youre looking for a better way to die my gun was very steady finger on the trigger but this wasnt for real not yet if you were really serious youd have had the gun in your hand before you pulled over you didnt invite me here to hunt monsters you invited me here to kill you if it works out wrong he gave the smallest nod neither bernardo or olaf are good enough he laid the gun very very slowly on the floorboard hump between the seats he looked at me hands spread on the steering wheel even for you i have to be a little slow i took the offered gun without taking either my eyes or my gun off of him like i believe thats the only gun youve got hidden in this car but i do appreciate the gesture he laughed then and it was the most bitter sound id ever heard from edward i dont like being afraid anita im not good at it you mean youre not used to it i said no im not i eased my own gun down until it wasnt pointing at him but i didnt put it up i promise that if you end up like the people in the hospital ill take your head he looked at me then and even with the sunglasses on i knew he was surprised not just shoot me or kill me but take my head if it happens edward i wont leave you alive and taking your head well both be sure that the jobs done something flowed across his face down his shoulders his arms and i realized it was relief i knew i could count on you for this anita you and no one else should i be flattered or insulted that youve never met anyone else coldblooded enough for this olafs blood is plenty cold enough but hed just shoot me and bury me in a hole somewhere hed have never thought about taking my head and what if shooting didnt kill me he took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes id be in some stinking hole somewhere alive because olaf would never think to take my head he shook his head as if chasing the image away he slid the glasses back on and when he turned to look at me his face was blank unreadable his usual but id seen beneath the mask further than id ever been allowed before the one thing id never expected to find was fear and beneath that trust edward trusted me with more than his life he trusted me to make sure he died well for a man like edward there was no greater trust we would never go shopping together or eat an entire cake while we complained about men hed never invite me over to his home for dinner or a barbecue wed never be lovers but there was a very good chance that one of us would be the last person the other saw before we died it wasnt friendship the way most people understood it but it was friendship there were several people id trust with my life but there is no one else id trust with my death jeanclaude and even richard would try to hold me alive out of love or something that passed for it even my family and other friends would fight to keep me alive if i wanted death edward would give it to me because we both understand that it isnt death that we fear its living the house was a twostory splitlevel ranch that could have been anywhere in the midwest in any uppermiddleclass neighborhood but the large yard was done in rock paths running high to cacti and a circle of those small flowered lilacs that were so plentiful other people had tried to keep their lawns green as if they didnt live on the edge of a desert but not this house this house these people had landscaped for their environment and tried not to waste water and now they were dead and didnt give a damn about environmental awareness or rainfall of course one of them could be a survivor i didnt want to see pictures of the survivors before theyd been injured i was having enough trouble keeping my professional distance without color photos of smiling faces that had been turned into so much naked meat i got out of the car praying that everyone had died in this house not my usual prayer at a crime scene but nothing about this case so far was usual there was a marked police car sitting out in front of the house a uniformed officer got out of the marked car as edward and i walked towards the yard he was medium build but carrying enough weight for someone taller a lot taller his weight was mostly in the stomach and made his utility belt ride low his pale face was sweating by the time hed walked the five feet to us he put his hat on as he walked towards us unsmiling thumb hooked in his utility belt can i help you edward went into his ted forrester act putting his hand out smiling im ted forrester officer he took the time to read the mans name tag norton this is anita blake chief appleton has cleared us both to see the crime scene norton looked us both up and down pale eyes not the least bit friendly he didnt shake hands can i see some id edward opened his wallet to his drivers license and held it out i opened my executioners license for him he handed edwards back but squinted at mine this license isnt good in new mexico im aware of that officer i said voice bland he squinted at me much as he had the license then why are you here i smiled and couldnt quite make it reach my eyes im here as a preternatural advisor not an executioner he handed the license back to me then why the hardware i glanced down at the gun very visible against my red shirt the smile was genuine this time its not concealed officer norton and its federally licensed so i dont have to sweat a new gun permit every time i cross a state line he didnt seem to like the answer i was told to let the two of you in it was a statement but it sounded like a question as if he wasnt quite sure he was going to let us in after all edward and i stood there trying to appear harmless but useful i was a lot better at looking harmless than edward was i didnt even have to work at it most of the time he was better at looking useful though without seeming dangerous in the least he could give off an aura of purposefulness that police and other people responded to the best i could do was look harmless and wait for officer norton to decide what our fate would be he finally nodded as if hed made up his mind im supposed to escort you around the scene miss blake he didnt look happy about it i didnt correct him that miss blake should have been ms blake i think he was looking for an excuse to get rid of us i wasnt going to give him one very few policemen like civilians messing around in their cases i wasnt just a civilian i was female and i hunted vampires a triple threat if ever there was one i was a civvie a woman and a freak this way he started up the narrow walkway i glanced at edward he just started following norton i followed edward i had a feeling id be doing a lot of that in the next few days quiet the house was so quiet the air conditioner purred into that silence reminding me of the recycled air in the hospital room norton came up behind me and i jumped he didnt say anything but he gave me a look i moved out of the entry hall and into the large high ceilinged living room norton followed me in fact he stayed at my heels as i moved around the room like some obedient dog but the message i was getting from him wasnt trust and adoration it was suspicion and disapproval edward had settled into one of the rooms three comfortablelooking powder blue chairs hed stretched himself full length legs crossed at the ankles hed left his sunglasses on so he looked the picture of ease in the midst of that careful living room in that too silent house are you bored i asked ive seen the show he said hed toned down his ted act and was more his usual self maybe he didnt sweat nortons reaction or maybe he was tired of playacting i knew i was tired of watching the show the room was one of those great rooms which meant the living dining and kitchen were all one shared space it was a large space but im not really comfortable with the open floor plan i like more walls doors barriers probably a sign of my own less than welcoming personality if the house was any clue to the family that had lived in it theyd been welcoming and somewhat conventional the furniture was all purchased as sets a powder blue living room set a dark wood dining room set to one side with a bay window and white lacy drapes there was a new hard back southwestern cook book on the kitchen cabinet the receipt was still being used as a bookmark the kitchen was the smallest area long and thin with white cabinets and a black and white cow motif down to a cookie jar that mooed when you took its head off storebought cookies chocolate chip no i didnt eat one any clues in the cookie jar edward asked from his chair no i said i just had to know if it really mooed norton made a small sound that might have been a laugh i ignored him though since he was standing about two feet from me the entire time ignoring wasnt easy i changed direction in the kitchen abruptly and he nearly ran into me could you give me a little more breathing space i asked just following my orders he said face bland did your orders tell you to stand close enough to tango or just to follow me his mouth twitched but he managed not to smile just to follow you maam great then take about two big steps back so we do this without bumping into each other im supposed to make sure you dont disturb the scene maam the names anita not maam that earned me a smile but he shook his head and fought it off just following orders thats what i do there was something just a touch bitter about that last officer norton was on the down side of fifty or looked it he was close to putting in his thirty years and he was still a uniform sitting in a car outside a crime scene following orders if hed ever had dreams of more they were gone he was a man who had accepted reality but he didnt like it the door opened and a man came through with his tie at halfmast the white sleeves of his dress shirt rolled up over dark forearms his skin was a dark solid brown and it didnt look like a tan hispanic or indian or maybe a little of both the hair was cut very short not for style but as if it were easier that way there was a gun on his hip and a gold shield clipped to the waist band of his pants im detective ramirez sorry im late he smiled when he said it and there seemed to be genuine cheerfulness but i didnt trust it id seen too many cops go from cheerful to hardcore up in your face too many times ramirez would try to catch his flies with honey instead of vinegar but i knew the vinegar was there you didnt get to be a plainclothes detective without that streak of sourness or maybe a loss of innocence was a better phrase for it whatever you called it it would be there it was only a matter of how far under the surface it was but i smiled and held my hand out and he took it the handshake was firm the smile still in place but his eyes were cool and noticed everything i knew that if i left the room now hed be able to describe me in detail down to my gun or maybe up from my gun officer norton was still behind me like a pudgy bridesmaid detective ramirez eyes flicked to him and the smile wilted just a touch thank you officer norton ill take it from here the look norton gave him was not friendly maybe officer norton didnt like anybody or maybe he was white and ramirez wasnt he was old and ramirez was young he was going to end his career in uniform and ramirez was already in plainclothes prejudice and jealousy are often close kin or maybe norton was just in a bad mood whatever norton went out like hed been told shutting the door behind him ramirez smile went up a notch as he turned to me i realized that he was cute in a young guy sort of way and he knew it not in an egomaniac way but i was a female and he was cute and he was hoping that that would cut him some slack with me boy was he shopping in the wrong aisle i shook my head but smiled back is something wrong he asked even the slight frown was sort of boyish and endearing he must practice it in the mirror no detective nothings wrong please call me hernando that made me smile more im anita the smile flashed bright and wide anita pretty name no i said its not and were investigating a crime not out on a blind date you can tone the charm down just a touch and ill still like you detective ramirez ill even share clues with you honest hernando he said it made me laugh hernando fine but really you dont have to work this hard to win me over i dont know you well enough to dislike you yet that made him laugh was it that transparent you make a good goodcop and the little boy charm is great but like i said its not necessary okay anita the smile went down a watt or two but he was still open and cheerful somehow it made me nervous have you seen the entire house yet not yet officer norton was trailing a little too close for comfort made it hard to walk the smile closed down but the look in the eyes was real youre a woman and with that black hair probably part something darker than the rest of you looks my mother was mexican but most people dont spot it youre in a section of the country where theres a lot of mixing going on he didnt smile when he said it he looked serious and a little less young the people that want to notice will i could be part dark italian i said a small smile that time we dont have a lot of dark italians in new mexico i havent been here long enough to notice one way or another your first time to this part of the country i nodded what do you think so far ive seen a hospital and part of this house i think its too early to form an opinion if we get a breather while youre here id love to show you some of the sights i blinked at him maybe the boyish charm wasnt just a cop technique maybe he was gasp flirting before i could think of an answer edward came up behind us in his best good ol boy charm detective ramirez good to see you again they shook hands and ramirez wasted a smile on edward that looked just as genuine as edwards since i knew edward was playacting it was sort of unnerving how similar the two expressions were good to see you too ted he turned back to me please continue looking around teds told me a lot about you and i hope for all our sakes that youre as good as he says you are i glanced at edward he just smiled at me i frowned well ill try not to disappoint anybody i walked back out into the living room trailed by detective ramirez he gave me more room to maneuver than norton had but he watched me maybe he did want a date but he wasnt watching me like a potential date he was watching me like a cop to see what i did how i reacted it made me think better of him that he was professional edward had lowered his sunglasses enough to give me a look as i passed by him he was smiling almost grinning at me the look said it all he was amused at ramirez flirting i flipped him off covering the gesture with my other hand so only he would see it it made him laugh and the sound seemed at home here in this bright place it was a place meant for laughter the silence filled in behind his laughter like water closing over a stone until the sound vanished into a profound quiet that was more than quiet i stood in the middle of the bright living room and it was as if it were a display home waiting for the real estate agent to come through with a tour of potential home owners the house was so new it felt like a freshly unwrapped present but there were things that no real estate agent would have allowed a newspaper was spilled over the pale wood coffee table with the business section folded into fourths the business section had new york times written across the top of it but some of the other pieces said los angeles tribune a business person recently moved from los angeles maybe there was a large colored photo pushed to one corner of the coffee table it showed an older couple fiftyish with a teenage boy they were all smiling and touching each other in that posed casual way photos often use they looked happy and relaxed together though you can never really tell with posed photos so easy to fool the camera i looked around the room and found smaller photos scattered throughout on numerous white shelves that took up almost all available wall space the photos sat among souvenirs mostly with an american indian theme the smaller more candid shots were just as relaxed just as smiling a happy prosperous family the boy and man tanned and grinning on a boat with the sea in the background and a huge fish between them the woman and three small girls covered in cookie dough and matching christmas aprons there were at least three photos of smiling adult couples with one or two children apiece the little girls from the christmas photo grandchildren maybe i stared at the couple and that tall tanned teenager and hoped they were dead because the thought of any of them up in that hospital room turned into so much pain and meat was not a comfy thought i didnt speculate they were dead and that was comforting i turned my attention from the photos to the indian artifacts lining the shelves some of it was touristy stuff reproductions of painted pots in muted shades too new to be real kachina dolls that would have looked just as at home in a childs room rattlesnake heads stretched in impotent strikes dead before their murderer opened their mouths to appear fearsome put in among the tourist chic were other things a pot that was displayed behind glass with pieces missing and the paint faded to a dull gray and eggshell color a spear or javelin on the wall above the fireplace the spear was behind glass and had remnants of feathers and thongs beads trailing from it the head of the spear looked like stone there was a tiny necklace of beads and shells under glass with the worn edges of the hide thong that bound them together showing someone had known what they were collecting because every piece that looked real was behind glass cared for the tourist stuff had been left out to fend for itself i spoke without turning around staring at the necklace im no expert on indian artifacts but some of this looks like museum quality according to the experts it is ramirez said i looked at him his face had gone back to neutral and he looked older is it all legal that earned me another small smile you mean is it stolen i nodded the stuff weve been able to trace was all purchased from private individuals theres more yes he said show me i said he turned and started walking down a long central hallway it was my turn to play follow the leader though i gave him more room than either he or norton had given me i couldnt help noticing how nicely his dress slacks fit i shook my head was it the flirting or was i just tired of the two men in my life something less complicated would have been nice but part of me knew that the time for other choices was long past so i admired his backside as we walked up the hall and knew it meant nothing i had enough problems without dating the local cops i was a civilian surrounded by police and a woman too the only thing that would earn me less respect in their eyes was to date one of them i would lose what little clout i had and become a girlfriend anita blake vampire executioner and preternatural expert had some ground to stand on detective ramirez girlfriend would not edward trailed behind us but far enough back that we were at the far end of the hallway when he was barely in the corridor was he giving us privacy did he think it was a good idea to flirt with the detective or was any human better than a monster no matter how nice the monster was if edward had any prejudice it was against the monsters ramirez stood at the end of the hallway he was still smiling as if he were giving me a tour of some other house for some other purpose his face didnt match what we were about to do he motioned to the doors to either side of him artifacts to your left gory stuff to the right gory stuff i made it a question he nodded still pleasant and i moved closer to him i stared into those dark brown eyes and realized that the smile was his blankcop face his face cheerful but his eyes were just as unreadable as any cops id ever seen smiling blankness but still blankness it was unique and somehow disquieting gory stuff i said the smile stayed but the eyes were a little less sure you dont have to play the tough girl with me anita shes not playing edward said hed finally joined us ramirez eyes flicked to him then back to study my face high compliment coming from you forrester if he only knew i thought look detective i just came from the hospital whatever is behind the door cant be worse than that how can you be so sure he asked i smiled because even with the air conditioner on the smell would be worse the smile flashed bright and i think real for a moment very practical he said voice almost laughing i should have known youd be practical i frowned at him why he motioned at his own face no makeup he said maybe i just dont give a damn he nodded that too he started to reach for the door and i beat him to it he raised eyebrows at me but just stepped back and let me open the door which also meant i got to walk in first but hey only fair edward and ramirez had both already seen the show my ticket was fresh and hadnt been punched yet i expected to find a lot of things in the bedroom blood stains signs of a struggle maybe even a clue what i did not expect to find was a soul but the moment i entered that pale white and green bedroom i knew it was there hovering near the ceiling waiting it wasnt the first soul id sensed funerals were always fun souls often hung around the bodies as if unsure what to do but by three days time the souls were usually gone to wherever souls were supposed to go i stared up at this soul and saw nothing if a soul has a physical shape you couldnt prove it by me but i knew it was there i could have sketched the outline of it in the air with my hand knew about how much space it was taking up as it floated near the ceiling but it was energy spirit and though it took up space i wasnt entirely sure it took up the same kind of space as i did as the bed did as anything else did my voice came out hushed as if i spoke too loudly id scare it away how long have they been dead they arent dead ramirez said i blinked and turned to him what do you mean theyre not dead you saw the bromwells in the hospital theyre both still alive i looked into his serious face the smile had vanished i turned back to gaze at that slow hovering presence someone died here i said no one was cut up here ramirez said according to the santa fe pd thats the method of killing that this guy is using look at the carpet theres not enough blood for anyone to have been cut up i looked down at the pale green carpet and he was right there was blood like black juice soaked into the carpet but it wasnt much blood just spots dabs the blood was from the skinning of two adults but if someone had been torn apart limb from limb there would have been more blood a lot more there was still the faint rank smell where someones bowels had let go either under torture or death it was pretty common death is the last intimate thing we ever do i shook my head and debated on what to say if id been at home with dolph and zerbrowski and the rest of the st louis police that i knew well id have just said i saw a soul but i didnt know ramirez and most cops spook around anyone that can do mystical stuff to tell or not to tell that was the question when noises from the front room brought us all around to stare behind us at the still open door mens voices hurried footsteps coming closer my hand was on my gun when i heard a voice yell ramirez where the hell are you it was lieutenant marks i eased away from my gun and knew i wasnt telling the police that there was a soul hanging in the air behind me marks was scared enough of me without that he stepped into the doorway with a small battalion of uniforms at his back almost as if he expected trouble his eyes were both harsh and pleased when he looked at me get the fuck off my evidence blake you are outta here edward stepped forward smiling trying to play peace maker now lieutenant who would give such an order my chief he turned to the cops behind him escort her off the property i held up my hands and started moving towards the door before the uniforms could move in ill go no problem no need to get rough i was at the door almost abreast with marks he hissed close to my face this isnt rough blake you come near me again and ill show you rough i stopped in the doorway meeting his gaze his eyes had turned a swimming aqua blue dark with his anger the doorway wasnt that big and standing in it we were almost touching i havent done anything wrong marks he spoke low but it carried thou shalt not suffer a witch to live i thought of a lot of things to say and do most of which would have gotten me dragged out by a bunch of uniforms i didnt want to be dragged out but i wanted to make marks suffer choices choices i rose on tiptoe and planted a big kiss on his mouth he stumbled back pushing away from me so hard that he fell into the bedroom and left me pushed into the hallway beyond masculine laughter filled the hallway two bright spots of color flamed on marks cheeks as he lay panting on the carpet youre lying in your evidence marks i said get her out of here now i blew marks a kiss and left through a grinning parade of policeman one of the uniforms offered to let me kiss him any time i told him he couldnt handle it and left through the front door to laughter catcalls and masculine humor mostly at marks expense he didnt seem to be a popular guy go figure edward stayed inside for a few moments probably trying to soothe things over like a good ted would do but in the end he came out of the house shaking hands with the cops smiling and nodding the smile vanished as soon as he turned so that i was his only audience he unlocked the car and we got in when we were safe inside of its mudstained windows he said marks has gotten you kicked off the investigation i dont know how he did it but he did it maybe he and the chief go to the same church i said i had snuggled down into the seat as far as the seatbelt would allow edward looked at me as he started the engine you dont seem upset i shrugged marks isnt the first rightwing asshole to get up in my face and he wont be the last wheres that famous temper of yours maybe im growing up i said he shook his head what did you see in the corner of the room that i didnt you were looking at something a soul i said he actually lowered his sunglasses so i could see his baby blues a soul i nodded which means that someone in that house did die and within three days why three days he asked because three days is the limit for most souls to hang around after that they go to heaven or hell or wherever after three days you may get ghosts but you wont get souls but the bromwells are alive you saw them yourself what about their son i asked hes missing edward said nice of you to mention that i wanted to be angry at him for the game playing but i just couldnt find the energy no matter how blasй i was about marks it did bother me i was christian but id lost count of the number of fellow christians whod called me witch or worse it didnt make me angry anymore just tired if the parents are alive then the boy probably isnt i said edward pulled out onto the road easing his way among the plethora of marked and unmarked police cars brought with him but all the other murder vics were cut up we didnt find any body parts in the house if the boy is dead then its a change in the pattern we havent figured out the old pattern yet a change in pattern may give the police the break they need i said you believe that he asked no i said what do you believe i believe that the bromwells son is dead and whatever skinned and mutilated his parents took his body but didnt cut it up however the son was killed it wasnt being torn apart or there would have been more blood he was killed in a way that didnt add blood to the room but youre sure hes dead theres a soul floating around the house edward someones dead and if there are only three people living in a house and two of them are accounted for you do the math i was staring out the car window but wasnt seeing anything i was seeing that young tanned face smiling in the pictures deductive reasoning edward said im impressed yeah me and sherlock holmes by the way now that im persona non grata where are you taking me to a restaurant you said you hadnt had lunch i nodded fine then after a moment i asked what was his name who the bromwells son what was his first name thad thaddeus reginald bromwell thad i said softly to myself had he been forced to watch while his parents were skinned alive mutilated or had they watched him die before they bled wheres your body thad and why did they want it there was no answer i hadnt expected one souls werent like ghosts to my knowledge there was no way to communicate with them directly but i would have answers and soon it had to be soon edward i need to see the pictures from the other crime scenes i need to see everything the santa fe pd have you said only this last case was in albuquerque so screw them ill start from the other end edward smiled ive got copies at my house your house i sat up straighter and stared at him since when do the police share files with bounty hunters i told you the santa fe police like ted you said the albuquerque police liked you too i said they do like me its you they dont like he had a point i could still see the hatred in marks eyes when he hissed at me thou shalt not suffer a witch to live sweet jesus that was actually the first time id ever had that particular verse quoted at me though i suppose someone would have gotten around to it sooner or later being who i am and what i do i just didnt expect it from a police lieutenant during a murder investigation it lacked a certain professionalism marks wont be able to solve this case i said without you you mean it doesnt have to be me but someone with some expertise is going to be needed we are not dealing with a human killer here normal police work is not going to do the job i agree edward said marks needs to be replaced i said ill work on it he said then he smiled maybe with that nice detective ramirez that found you sooo fascinating dont go there edward he does have one thing over your other two boyfriends what i asked he is human id have liked to argue but couldnt when youre right youre right youre agreeing with me he sounded surprised neither jeanclaude nor richard are human as far as i can tell ramirez is human whats to argue about i was teasing you and you go all serious on me you have no idea how refreshing it would be to be with a man that just wanted me for me without any machiavellian plots are you saying that richard has been plotting behind your back just like the vampire lets just say im no longer sure who the good guys are edward richard has become something harder and more complex because his role as ulfric wolf king has demanded it of him and god help me partly i think because i demanded it of him he was too soft for me so hes become harder and you dont like it edward said no i dont like it but since its partially my fault its hard to bitch then dump them both and date some humans you make it sound so simple its only hard if you make it hard anita just dump the boys and start dating other men just like that why not he asked i opened my mouth sure i had an answer but for the life of me couldnt come up with one why not date other people because i loved two men already and that seemed one too many without adding anyone else but what would it be like to be with someone who was human someone who wasnt trying to use me to consolidate his power like jeanclaude both richard and jeanclaude huddled around my humanity like it was the last fire at the end of the world and all the rest was icy darkness richard especially clung to me because i was human and having a human girlfriend had seemed to help him retain human status though lately how human i was was up for debate at least richard had been human until he became a werewolf jeanclaude had been human until he became a vampire id seen my first soul when i was ten at my greataunts funeral id raised my first dead by accident when i was thirteen of the three of us i was the only one who had never been truly human what would it be like to date someone normal i didnt know did i want to find out i realized with a shock that i did i wanted to go out on a normal date with a normal guy and do normal things just once just for a while id been vampires lover werewolfs mate zombie queen and for the last year id been learning ritual magic so i could control all the rest so i guess you could add apprentice witch to the list it had been a weird year even for me id called a break to the romance with both richard and jeanclaude because i needed a breather they were overwhelming me and i didnt know how to stop it would one date with someone else really hurt would going out with someone who was just a guy really bring the world crashing down around my ears would it the answer was probably no but the very fact that i wasnt sure meant i should have run from ramirez and any other nice guy who asked me out i should have said no and kept saying no so why did part of me want to say yes it was only as edward was searching for a parking spot on the rockcovered parking lot behind los cuates that i realized it was a mexican restaurant the name should have been a clue but i just hadnt been paying attention if my mother had liked mexican food she hadnt lived long enough to pass it on to me blake was an english name but before my greatgrandfather came through ellis island it was bleckenstien my idea of ethnic cuisine was wiener schnitzel and sauerbraten so i was less than enthused as we crossed the gravel to the rear entrance of the restaurant for someone who didnt like mexican or southwestern cuisine i was in the wrong part of the country the back entrance led through a long shadowed hall but the main restaurant was bright with white stucco walls bright wall hangings fake parrots dangling from the ceiling and strings of dried chilies everywhere very touristy which usually means the food wont be authentic or very good but a lot of the diners were hispanic and that boded well whatever the food if the actual ethnic group liked the restaurant then the food was authentic and likely good a woman that actually looked hispanic asked if wed like a table edward smiled and said thanks but i see our party i looked where he was looking and saw donna at a booth there were two kids with her one girl about five or six and a boy in his early teens call it a hunch but i was betting i was about to be introduced to her kiddies introduced to edwards potential stepchildren can you stand it i was almost sure i couldnt donna stood and gave edward a smile that would have melted a lesser man into his socks it wasnt the sex though that was in there it was the warmth the perfect trust that only true love can give you that first romantic love that may not last but while it does wow i knew that he was probably giving as good a look as he was getting but his wasnt real he didnt mean it he was lying with his eyes something id only managed to learn recently and part of me is sad about that its one thing to know how to lie but to be able to lie with your eyes says you are someone not to be trusted poor donna she was with two of us the little girl scooted out of the booth and came running towards us arms outstretched chestnut braids flying she gave a glad shriek of ted and flung herself into his arms edward scooped her up and tossed her towards the ceiling she laughed that joyous fullblown sound that children eventually grow out of as if the world bleeds the joy from them unless were very lucky the world teaches us to laugh more quietly more coyly the boy just sat staring at us his hair was the same rich chestnut brown as the girls cut short with a wave of bangs that hung into his eyes the eyes were brown and dark and not friendly edward had said the boy was fourteen but he was one of those boys that look younger he could have passed for twelve easily he looked sullen and angry as he watched edward and donna hug the little girl still in edwards arms so it was a family hug edward whispered something in donnas ear that made her laugh and pull away blushing he swung the girl to his other arm and asked hows my best girl she giggled and started talking in a high excited voice she was telling some long complicated story about her day that involved butterflies and a cat and uncle raymond and aunt esther i assumed they were the neighbors that had played babysitter for the day the boy turned his hostile eyes from edward to me the frown did not lessen but the eyes went from angry to curious as if i wasnt what hed expected i actually get that a lot from men of all ages i ignored the happy family stuff and held out my hand to him im anita blake he gave me his hand half hesitating as if most people didnt offer his grip was unsure as if he needed practice but he said peter peter parnell i nodded good to meet you i would have said his mother said good things about him but that wasnt strictly true and peter struck me as someone who respected truth he nodded vaguely eyes flicking to his mother and edward he didnt like it not one little bit and i didnt blame him i remembered how id felt when my father brought judith home id never really forgiven my father for marrying her only two years after my mothers death i hadnt finished my grieving and he was moving on with his life being happy again id hated him for it and hated judith more even if edward had truly been ted forrester and his intentions honorable it would have been a difficult situation as it was it sucked becca was wearing a bright yellow sundress with daisies on it she had yellow ribbons at the end of each neat braid the hand she put over her mouth to smother a giggle still had that soft round baby look to it she was looking at edward as if he was the eighth wonder of the world in that moment i hated edward hated that he could lie to the child so completely and not understand that it was wrong something must have shown on my face because peter was giving me a strange considering look not angry but thoughtful i forced my face blank and met his eyes he held my gaze for a few seconds but finally had to look away probably not fair to bring out my full stare on one angry fourteenyearold boy but to do less would imply that he was less and he wasnt just young and time would cure that donna took becca back from edwards arms and turned towards me smiling this is becca hi becca i said and smiled because she was one of those children that made it easy to smile and this is peter she said weve met i said donna gave a funny look from peter to me and back to me i realized she thought wed literally met before we introduced ourselves already i said she relaxed and gave a nervous laugh of course silly of me you were just too busy to notice peter said and his voice held what the actual words did not scorn donna looked at him as if she didnt know what to say and finally said im sorry peter she shouldnt have apologized it implied shed done something wrong and she hadnt she didnt know that ted forrester was an illusion she was holding up her end of the bargain for happily ever after apologizing makes you sound weak and from the look on peters face donna needed all the strength she could get donna slid into the booth first then becca and edward on the outside with one leg hanging out from the booth peter had already sat down in the middle of his side of the booth i sat down beside him and he didnt move over so i found enough seat to be comfortable and ended with the line of our bodies touching from shoulder to hip if he wanted to play sullen teenager with edward and his mom great but i was not playing when peter realized i wasnt moving over he finally scooted over with a loud sigh that let me know it had been an effort i did feel sorry for peter and his plight but my sympathy is never endless and the sullen teenager routine might use it up pretty quick becca was sitting happily between her mother and edward she was swinging her legs and her hands were out of sight maybe holding a hand of each of them her contentment was large and complete as if sitting between them not only was she happy but she felt safe the way youre supposed to feel with your parents it made my chest tight to see her so pleased with the situation edward was right he couldnt just leave without some explanation becca parnell more than her mother deserved better than that i watched the little girl sit there and shine between them and wondered what excuse would be good enough nothing came to mind a waitress came to the booth handed plastic menus all around even to becca which pleased her and then went away while we looked at them peters first comment was i hate mexican food donna said peter in a warning voice but i added my two cents worth me too peter looked at me sideways as if he didnt trust my show of solidarity with him really i nodded really ted picked the restaurant he said think he did it just to be irritating i asked peter was looking directly at me eyes a little wide yeah i do i nodded me too donna had an openmouthed astonished look on her face peter anita she turned to edward what are we going to do with the two of them her appealing to edward for help over such a small thing made me think less of her you cant do anything with anita he said and he turned cool blue eyes to peter im not sure about peter yet peter wouldnt meet edwards gaze and the boy squirmed just a bit edward made him uncomfortable on more than one level it wasnt just that edward was doing his mom it was more than that peter was just a little afraid of edward and i was betting that he hadnt done anything to earn it i was betting that edward had tried very hard to win peter over as hed won becca over but peter wasnt having any of it it had probably started out as just the normal resentment of anyone his mom dated but the way he sat there now with his gaze carefully avoiding edwards let me know it was more now peter was more nervous than he should have been around ted as if he somehow had picked up the real edward under all the fun and games it was both good for peter and bad for him if he ever guessed the truth and edward didnt want it known well edward was very practical one problem at a time peter and i bent over our menus and made disparaging comments about nearly every menu item by the time the waitress had come back with a basket of bread id actually seen him smile twice my own younger brother josh had never been sullen but id always gotten along with him if i ever had children not that i was planning on it i wanted boys i was just more comfortable with them the bread wasnt bread but some fluffed pastry thing called a sopapilla there was a plastic container of honey on the table especially for them donna spread honey on a small corner and ate that edward spread honey across one entire end of his bread becca put so much honey on her bread that donna had to take it away from her peter took a sopapilla its the only good part of the meal he said i dont like honey i said me either but this isnt bad he spread a minute amount of honey and ate the small bite hed spread it on then repeated the process i got one and followed his example the bread was good but the honey was very different stronger and with an undercurrent that reminded me of sage this honey tastes nothing like honey back home its sage honey edward said stronger flavor ill say id never had anything but clover honey i wondered if all honey took on the flavor of the plant the bees used it seemed likely learn something new every day but peter was right the sopapillas were good and the honey wasnt bad in small nay microscopic amounts i finally ordered chicken enchilada i mean what could they possibly do to chicken to make it uneatable dont answer that peter had plain cheese enchiladas both of us seemed to be going on the less is better plan i was on my second sopapilla when everyone else including peter had finished their two a piece when i saw bad guys come into the restaurant how did i know they were bad guys instinct nope practice the first one was six foot and almost obscenely broad through the shoulders his arms swelled against the sleeves of his tshirt as if the cloth couldnt contain him his hair was straight and thick tied back in a loose braid i think the braid was for effect because the rest of him was so ethnic he could have been the poster boy for the american indian gq the cheekbones were high and tight under the dark skin a slight uptilt to his black eyes a strong jaw slender lips he wore blue jeans that were tight enough that you could tell his lower body had not had the workout that his upper body had there is only one place where a man will put that much effort into his upper body and ignore his lower prison you dont lift weights in prison to get a balanced effect you lift weights so you look like a complete badass and can hit with everything you got when the time comes i looked for the next clue and the tattoos were there black barbwire chased the swell of his arms just below the sleeves of the tshirt there were two other men with him one taller one shorter the taller one was in better shape but the shorter had a wickedlooking scar that nearly bisected his face giving him the more sinister look all the three of them needed was a sign above their heads that flashed bad news why was i not surprised when they started walking toward us i looked at edward and mouthed whats up the strangest part was that donna knew them i could tell by her face that she knew them and was scared of them could this day get any stranger peter let out a soft oh my god his face showed fear he put his angry sullen look up like a mask but i was close enough to see how wide his eyes were how his breathing had quickened i glanced at becca and she had curled back into the seat between edward and donna she peered out around edwards arm with wide eyes everyone knew what was happening except me but i didnt have long to wait the threatening threesome came right up to the booth i tensed ready to stand if edward did but he stayed seated though his hands were out of sight under the table he probably had a gun out i dropped my napkin accidentally on purpose and when i came out from under the table the napkin was in one hand and the browning hipower was in the other the gun was under the table out of sight but it was pointed at the bad guys from under the table the shot probably wouldnt kill anyone but it would make a big hole in someones leg or groin depending on how tall the person was who happened to be standing in the wrong place at the wrong time harold edward said you brought backup his voice was still teds voice more lively than his usual but it was no longer a pleasant voice i couldnt have told you what had changed in the voice but it raised the tension level another notch becca scooted back until she couldnt see the men hiding her face against edwards sleeve donna reached for her drawing her away from edward and into her arms donnas face was openly fearful like the girls edwards was open almost smiling but his eyes had gone empty his real eyes peeking out id seen monsters real monsters pale under that gaze the short one with the scar shifted from foot to foot yeah this is russell he motioned at the indian and this is newt i almost said newt aloud but figured we had enough problems without me being a smartass and people say i dont know when to keep my mouth shut tom and benny still in the hospital edward asked voice still conversational so far we hadnt attracted too much attention we were getting some glances but not much else yet were not tom and benny russell said his voice matched the smile on his face but i was reminded that smiling is just another way of baring teeth another way to snarl bully for you i said his gaze swiveled to me his eyes were so black that the iris and pupil had melted into one black hole you another psychic bleeding heart trying to keep the indian lands safe for us poor savages i shook my head ive been accused of a lot but never of being a bleeding heart i smiled up at him and thought that if i pulled the trigger i would take out most of his thigh and maybe cripple him for life he was standing that close to the table close enough that i wanted him to back up but i was waiting on edward and he seemed just fine with them towering over us you should leave now edward said and his voice was beginning to sound like edward ted was leaking away leaving his face a blank cold mask his eyes empty as a winter sky his voice was without inflection as if he were saying something totally different edward was emerging from his ted mask like a butterfly pulling free of a chrysalis though i wanted something less pretty less harmless for the analogy because what was pulling free into the light wasnt harmless and if things went wrong it wasnt going to be pretty at all russell leaned over the table large hands spread across the top he leaned way over so he would be close to donnas face ignoring both edward and me either he was stupid or he figured we wouldnt draw first blood in a public place he was right about me but i wasnt so sure about edward you and your friends stay out of our way or you are going to get hurt he wasnt smiling when he said it his voice was flat and ugly youve got a cute little girl there be a shame if something happened to her donna paled and clutched becca tighter i dont know what edward had planned because it was peter who spoke dont you threaten my sister his voice was low and angry no fear showed through russells gaze flicked to peter and he leaned over into his face peter sat unmoving until their faces were inches apart but his eyes flickered back and forth like they were trying to escape his hands gripped the seat edge as if he were literally holding on to keep from backing down and what are you going to do about it little man ted i made it a question russells eyes flicked to me then back to peter he was enjoying the boys fear and the show of bravado hard to be tough muscle if you cant make a fourteenyearold boy back down hed finish scaring peter then turn to me i dont think he considered me a threat his mistake i couldnt see edward through russells bulk but i heard his voice cold and empty do it no i didnt shoot him that wasnt what id asked permission to do or what edward had given the go ahead on how did i know this i just did i switched the gun to my left hand and let out a breath long and soft until my shoulders were relaxed i centered myself like i learned for years in judo and now kenpo i visualized my fingers going into his throat through the flesh when fighting for real you dont visualize hitting someone you visualize throwing the punch through them and out the other side though i would hold back a little you can collapse a mans windpipe with this move and i didnt want to go to jail over this i dropped my right hand down to the seat beside me and brought my hand up with two fingers like a spear pointed russell saw the movement but didnt react in time i drove my fingers into his throat coming to my feet with the strength of the blow he gagged hands going to his throat half collapsing on the table i used my right hand to drive his face into the table once twice three times blood spurted from his nose and he slid bonelessly across the tabletop to end up on floor staring up at the ceiling gagging trying to breathe through his injured throat and the smashed nose i think if he could have breathed better hed have passed out but its hard to pass out when youre gagging he rocked and fell to the floor gagging eyes rolled back into his head not focused i was standing beside the booth staring down at him my gun was still in my left hand at my side unobtrusive against my black jeans most people wouldnt even see the gun theyd see the blood and the man on the floor harold and the tall newt were standing there frozen staring down at russell harold shook his head sadly you shouldnt have ought to have done that edward was standing beside the booth blocking their view of donna and becca he spoke softly so his voice wouldnt carry much beyond our little circle dont ever threaten these people again harold dont come near them for any reason tell riker that they are off limits or the next time it wont just be a broken nose i see the guns harold said voice low he bent down beside russell the big mans eyes still werent focused his blue tshirt had turned purple with blood harold was shaking his head he looked up at me who the hell are you anita blake i said he shook his head again dont know the name i guess my reputation does not proceed me i said it will harold said i said peter get some napkins peter didnt ask questions he just got a double handful of napkins from the dispenser on the table and handed them my way i took them with my right hand and held them out to harold he took them watching my face eyes flicking to the gun still bare against my leg thanks dont mention it he shoved the napkins against russells nose and took one arm get his other arm newt there was a distant wail of sirens coming closer someone had called the cops russell was still unsteady on his feet theyd shoved napkins into his flattened nose and he looked both silly and grotesque with the bloody napkins sticking out of his nose he had to clear his voice twice before he could speak his voice sounded rough clogged painful you fucking bitch i am going to hurt you so bad for this when you can stand without help and youve got your nose packed at the nearest emergency room give me a call id love a rematch he spat in my general direction but didnt have the aim so it splattered harmlessly into the floor gross but not very effective come on harold said he was trying to move the show towards the door the sirens were very close now but russell wasnt finished he turned forcing the other two to turn with him i am going to fuck your bitch and leave the girl and boy for the coyotes russell is not a fast learner i said becca was crying now and donna was so pale i was worried she was going to faint i couldnt turn around enough to see peters face without turning away from the bad guys so i dont know what he looked like but it wasnt a pretty scene the cops spilled in with harold still trying to get russell out the door edward and i used the confusion to put up our guns the two uniforms were a little unsure whom to arrest but the people actually testified to having heard russells threats and seeing him menace us before i hurt him id never seen so much witness cooperation most of the time people are deaf and dumb but having a small pretty little girl in tears helped peoples memories technically russell could press assault charges on me but everyone was jumping over themselves to say that hed been threatening us one man claimed hed seen russell pull a knife amazing how quickly details are added to a story i could not corroborate the knife but i had enough witnesses to the threats that i didnt think id be going to jail edward pulled out his ted id and the officers knew him by reputation if not by sight i pulled out my executioners license and my gun carry permit technically i was carrying concealed when my permit wasnt for this state i explained id worn the jacket to keep from distressing the children the cops nodded wrote it down and seemed to accept it all it helped that russell was being verbally abusive to the officers and was so obviously a badass and i was so harmless looking so small so feminine and so much less scary than he was edward gave them his address said id be staying with him and we were free to go the restaurant offered us a different table but strangely donna and the kids had lost their appetites i was still hungry but no one asked me edward paid for the food and declined a takeout order i put the tip on the bloodstained table way overtipping to try and make up for the mess then we left and i still hadnt eaten today maybe if i asked nicely edward would run through a driveup window at mcdonalds any port in a storm donna started crying out in the parking lot becca joined her only peter stayed silent and apart from the general hysteria the more donna cried the more panicky the girl got like they were feeding off each other the girl was crying in those great hiccuppy sobs bordering on hyperventilation i looked at edward and raised my eyebrows he looked blank i finally gave him a push he mouthed which one girl i mouthed back he knelt by them donna had settled down on the bumper of his hummer cradling becca in her lap edward knelt in front of them let me take becca for a little walk donna blinked up at him as if she saw him heard him but wasnt really understanding he reached for becca and started prying her from her mothers arms donnas arms were limp but the girl clung to her mother screaming edward literally pried her small fingers away and when she was free of her mother becca turned and clung to him burying her face in his shoulder he looked at me over the girls head and i shooed him away he never questioned just walked towards the sidewalk that edged the parking lot he was rocking the girl slowly as he moved soothing her donna had covered her face with her hands collapsing forward until her face and hands met her knees her sobs were fullblown almost wails shit i looked at peter he was watching her and the look on his was disgusted embarrassed i knew in that instant that hed been the adult in more ways than just shooting his fathers killer his mother was allowed hysterics but he wasnt he was the one who held together in a crisis damned unfair if you ask me peter can you excuse us for a few minutes he shook his head no i sighed then shrugged fine just dont interfere i knelt in front of donna touching her shaking shoulders donna donna there was no response no change it had been a long day i got a handful of that short thick hair and pulled her head up it hurt and it was meant to look at me you selfish bitch peter moved forward and i pointed a finger at him dont he settled back a step but he didnt leave his face was angry watchful and i knew that he might interfere regardless of what i said if i went much further but i didnt have to go further id shocked her her eyes were wide inches from mine her face drenched with tears her breathing was still coming in small chestheaving gulps but she was looking at me she was listening i released her hair slowly and she stayed staring at me with a horrible fascination on her face as if i were about to do something cruel and i was your little girl has just seen the worst thing shes ever seen in her life she was calming down taking it in stride until you started on the hysterics youre her mother youre her strength her protector when she saw you fall apart like that it terrified her i didnt mean i couldnt help i dont give a shit what you feel or how upset you are youre the mommy shes the child you are going to hold yourself together until she is not around to see you fall apart is that clear she blinked at me i dont know if i can do that you can do it youre going to do it i glanced up but didnt see edward yet good you are the grownup donna and you are by god going to act like it i could feel peter watching us could almost feet him storing it away for later playback he would remember this little scene and he would think on it you could feel it do you have children she asked and i knew what was coming no i said then what right do you have to tell me how to raise mine she was angry now sitting up straighter wiping at her face with short harsh movements sitting up on the bumper she was taller than i was kneeling i looked up into her angry eyes and told the truth i was eight years old when my mother died and my father couldnt handle it we got a phone call from a state trooper that told us she was dead my father dropped the phone and started to wail not cry wail he took me by the hand and walked the few blocks to my grandmothers house wailing leading me by the hand by the time we got to my grandmothers we had a crowd of neighbors all asking what was wrong what was wrong i was the one who turned to my neighbors and said my mommys dead my father was collapsed in the bosom of his family and i was left standing alone uncomforted unheld tears on my face telling the neighbors what had happened donna stared at me and there was something very close to horror on her face im sorry she said in a voice that had grown soft and lost its anger dont be sorry for me donna but be a mother to your own daughter hold it together she needs you to comfort her right now later when youre alone or with ted you can fall apart but please not in front of the kids that goes for peter too she glanced at him standing there watching us and she flushed embarrassed at last she nodded her head too rapidly then visibly straightened you could actually see her gathering herself she took my hands squeezing them i am sorry for your loss and i apologize for today im not very good around violence if its an accident a cut no matter the blood im fine honestly but i just cant abide violence i drew my hands gently from hers i wasnt sure i believed her but i said im glad to know that donna ill go get ted and becca she nodded thank you i stood nodding i walked across the gravel in the direction edward had gone i liked donna less now but i knew now that edward had to get away from this family donna wasnt good around violence jesus if she only knew who what shed taken to her bed shed have had hysterics for the rest of her life edward had walked down the sidewalk to stand in front of one of the many small houses they all had gardens in front well tended well planned it reminded me of california where every inch of yard is used for something because land is such a premium albuquerque didnt look nearly as crowded and yet the yards were crowded edward was still holding becca but she was looking at something that he was pointing at and there was a smile on her face that showed from two houses away a tension i hadnt realized i was carrying eased from my back and shoulders when she turned so that her face was full to me i saw a sprig of lilac tucked into one of her braids the pale lavender flower didnt match the yellow ribbons and dress but hey it was cute as hell her smile faltered around the edges when she saw me there was a very good chance that i wouldnt be one of beccas favorite people id probably scared her oh well edward put her down and they walked towards me she was smiling up at him swinging his arm a little he smiled down at her and it looked real even to me it looked real you might have really believed he was beccas adored and adoring father how the hell were we going to get him out of their lives without screwing becca over peter would be pleased if ted went poof and donna she was a grownup becca wasnt shit edward smiled at me and said in his cheerful ted voice how are things just dandy i said he raised eyebrows and for a split second his eyes flinched going from cynical to cheerful so fast it made me dizzy donna and peter are waiting for us edward turned so that the girl was between us she glanced up at me and her gaze was questioning thoughtful you beat up that bad man she said yes i did i said i didnt know girls could do that that made my teeth hurt girls can do anything they want to do including protect themselves and beat up bad guys ted said that you hurt that man because he said bad things to me i glanced at edward but his face was all open and cheerful for the child and gave me nothing thats right i said ted says that youd hurt someone to protect me just like he would i met her big brown eyes and nodded yes i would she smiled then and it was beautiful like sunshine breaking through clouds she reached out her free hand to me and i took it edward and i walked back to the parking lot holding the childs hands while she halfwalked halfdanced between us she believed in ted and ted had told her that she could believe in me so she did the odd thing was that i would hurt someone to protect her i would kill to keep her safe i looked across at edward and for just a moment he looked back at me from the mask we stared at each other over the child and i didnt know what to do i didnt know how to get us all out of the mess that he had made becca said swing me edward counted out one two three and swung her up and out forcing me to swing her other arm we moved across the parking lot swinging becca between us while she gave that joyous fullthroated laugh we sat her down laughing in front of her mother donna was composed and smiling i was proud of her becca looked up at me shining mommy says im too big to swing now but youre strong arent you i smiled at her but i looked at edward when i said yes i am donna and edward did a tender but decorous goodbye peter rolled his eyes and scowled as if theyd done a lot more than a semichaste kiss hed have had a cow if he could have seen them smooching earlier at the airport becca kissed edward on the cheek giggling peter ignored it all and got in the car as soon as he could as if afraid ted might try to hug him too edward waved until the car turned onto lomos and out of sight then he turned to me all he did was look at me but it was enough lets get in the car and get some air conditioning going before i grill you about what the hell is going on i said he unlocked the car we got inside he started the engine and the air conditioner though the air hadnt had time to cool yet we sat in the expensive hum of his engine with the hot air blowing on us and silence filled the car are you counting to ten he asked try a thousand and youll be closer ask i know you want to okay well skip the tirade about you dragging donna and her kids into your mess and go straight to who the hell is riker and why did he send goons to warn you off first it was donnas mess and she dragged me into it my disbelief must have shown on my face because he continued she and her friends are a part of an amateur archeology society that tries to preserve native american sites in the area are you familiar with how an archaeological dig is done a little i know they use string and tags to mark where an object is found take pictures drawings sort of like you do for a dead body before you move it trust you to come up with the perfect analogy he said but he was smiling ive gone with donna on weekends with the kids they use freaking toothbrushes and tiny paint brushes to gently clean the dirt away or dental picks i know you have a point i said pot hunters find a site that is already being explored or sometimes one that hasnt been found and they bring in bulldozers and backhoes to take out as much as possible in the least amount of time i gaped at him but that destroys more than they can possibly take out and if you move an object before its site is recorded it loses a lot of its historical value i mean the dirt its found in can help date it what is found near an object can tell all sorts of things to a trained eye pot hunters dont care about history they take what they find and sell it to private collectors or dealers who arent too particular about how an object was found a site that donna was volunteering on was raided she asked you to look into it i said you underestimate her she and her psychic friends thought they could reason with riker since they were pretty sure it was his people behind it i sighed i dont underestimate her edward she and her friends didnt understand what a bad man riker is some of the really big pot hunters hire bodyguards goon squads to help take care of the bleeding hearts and even the local law riker is suspected of having been behind the deaths of two local cops its one of the reasons that things went en smoothly in the restaurant all the local cops know that rikers a suspected top killer not personally but of hiring it done i smiled not a pleasant smile i wonder how many traffic tickets he and his men have acquired since it happened enough that his lawyer filed a harassment suit there is no proof that hikers people were involved just the fact that the cops were killed at a dig that had been partially bulldozed and an eye witness that saw a car with a partial plate that might have been one of his trucks is the witness still among the living i asked my you do catch on quick i take it thats a no hes missing edward said so why come after donna and her kids because the kids were with her when she and her group formed a protest line protecting a site that was on private land that riker had gotten permission to bulldoze she was their spokesperson stupid she should not have taken the kids like i said donna didnt understand how bad a man riker was and what happened her group was manhandled abused beaten they fled donna had a black eye and what did ted do about this i was watching his face arms crossed over my stomach all i could see was his profile but it was enough he hadnt liked it that donna had gotten hurt maybe it was just that she belonged to him a male pride thing or maybe maybe it was more donna asked me to have a talk with the men i take it that would be the two men that you put in the hospital i seem to remember you asking harold if two guys were still in the hospital edward nodded yeah only two in the hospital and none in a grave you must be slipping i couldnt kill anyone without donna knowing so i made an example of two of his men let me guess one of them would be the man who gave donna the black eye edward smiled happily tom and the other one he pushed peter and threatened to break his arm i shook my head the air had begun to cool and it raised goose bumps even through my jacket or maybe it wasnt the cold the second guy has a broken arm now among other things edward said edward look at me he turned and gave me his cool blue gaze truth do you care for this family would you kill to protect them id kill to amuse myself anita i shook my head and leaned close to him close enough to study his face to try and make him give up his secrets no jokes edward tell me the truth are you serious about donna you asked me if i loved her and i said no i shook my head again dammit dont keep evading the answer i dont think you do love her i dont think youre capable of it but you feel something i dont know exactly what but something do you feel something for this family for all of them his face was blank and i couldnt read it he just stared at me i wanted to slap him to scream and rant until i broke through his mask into whatever lay underneath id always been on sure ground with edward always known where he stood even when he was planning to hurt me but now suddenly i wasnt sure about anything my god you do care for them i slumped back in my seat weak i couldnt have been more astonished if hed sprouted a second head that would have been weird but not this weird jesus mary and joseph edward you care for them all of them he looked away edward the stone cold killer looked away he couldnt or wouldnt meet my gaze he put the car in gear and forced me to buckle my seat belt i let him pull out of the parking lot in silence but when we were sitting at the stop sign waiting for the traffic to clear on lomos i had to say something what are you going to do i dont know he said i dont love donna but i said he turned slowly onto the main street shes a mess she believes in every new age bandwagon that comes along shes got a good head for business but she trusts everyone shes useless around violence you saw her today he was concentrating very hard on the driving hands gripping the wheel tight enough for his knuckles to be white becca is just like her trusting sweet but tougher i think both the kids are tougher than donna theyve had to be i said and couldnt keep the disapproval out of my voice i know i know he said i know donna everything about her ive heard every detail from cradle to the present did it bore you i asked some of it he said carefully but not all of it i said no not all of it are you saying that you do love donna i had to ask no no im not saying that i was staring so hard at his face that we could have been driving on the far side of the moon for all the attention i gave the scenery nothing mattered more right that second than edwards face his voice then what are you saying im saying that sometimes when you play a part too long you can get sucked into that part i and it becomes more real than it was meant to be i saw something on his face that i had never seen before anguish uncertainty are you saying that you are going to marry donna youre going to be a husband and a father pta meetings and the whole nine yards no im not saying that you know i cant marry her i cant live with her and two kids and hide what i am twentyfour hours a day that good an actor im not then what are you saying i asked im saying im saying that part of me a small part of me wishes i could i stared at him openedmouthed edward assassin extraordinaire the undeads perfect predator wished he could have not a family but this family a trusting new age widow her sullen teenage son and a little girl that made rebecca of sunnybrook farm look jaded and edward wanted them when i trusted myself to be coherent i said what are you going to do i dont know i couldnt think of anything helpful to say so i resorted to humor my shield of last resort just please tell me they dont have a dog and a picket fence he smiled no fence but a dog two dogs what kind of dogs i asked he smiled and glanced at me wanting to see my reaction maltese their names are peeka and boo oh shit edward youre joking me donna wants the dogs included in the engagement pictures i stared at him and the look on my face seemed to amuse him he laughed im glad youre here anita because i dont know a single other person who id have admitted this to do you realize that your personal life is now more complicated than mine is i said now i know im in trouble he said and we left it on a lighter note on a joke because we were more comfortable that way but edward had confided in me about a personal problem in his way hed come to me for help about it and being who i was id try to help him i thought we would solve the mutilations and murders eventually i mean violence and death were our specialties i was not nearly so optimistic about the personal stuff edward did not belong in a world with a woman who had a pair of toy dogs named peeka and boo edward was not now nor ever would be that cutesy donna was it wouldnt work it just wouldnt work but for the very first time i realized that if edward didnt have a heart to lose that he wished he had one to give but i was reminded of the scene in the wizard of oz where dorothy and the scarecrow bang on the tin mans chest and hear the rolling echo the tinsmith had forgotten to put in a heart edward had carved his own heart out of his body and left it on a floor somewhere years ago id known that i just never knew that edward regretted the loss and i think until donna parnell came along he hadnt known it either edward did take me through a driveup window but he didnt want to stop he seemed anxious to get to santa fe since he was rarely anxious about anything i didnt argue i requested we go through a carwash while i ate my french fries and cheeseburger he didnt say a word just drove into one beside the highway that let us ride through in the car when i was little id loved watching the suds slide down the windows and the huge brushes roll by it was still nifty though not the thrill a minute it had been when i was five but the carwash did mean that i had a clear view out all the windows the dirty windows had made me feel ever so slightly claustrophobic id finished my food before we left albuquerque i sipped on my soda as we drove out of town and towards the mountains these were not the black mountains but a different range that looked more normal they were jagged and rocky looking with a string of glittering light near their base whats with the light show i asked what edward asked the glitter what is it i felt his attention shift from the road but he was wearing his sunglasses and i couldnt really see his gaze shift houses the sun is hitting the windows on the houses ive never seen sunlight on windows glitter like that albuquerque is at feet the air is thinner than youre used to it makes light do strange things i stared at the sparkling windows like a line of jewels imbedded in the mountains its beautiful he moved his whole head this time so i knew he was really looking at it if you say so after that we stopped talking edward never did idle chatter and apparently he had nothing to say my mind was still reeling from edward being in love or as close as he would probably ever get it was just too weird i couldnt think of a single useful thing to say so i stared out the window until i thought of something worth saying i had a feeling it was going to be a long quiet drive to santa fe the hills were very round covered in dry brownish grass i had the same feeling id had when i stepped off the plane in albuquerque desolate id thought the hills were close until i spotted a cow standing on one the cow looked tiny small enough for me to cover with two fingers held up which meant the hills were really small mountains and not nearly as close as they appeared to the road it was late afternoon or early evening depending on how you looked at it it was still daylight but you could feel night looming even in the brightness the day had worn away like a piece of candy sucked too long no matter how bright the sunshine i could feel the darkness pressing close partly it was my mood confusion always makes me pessimistic but it was also an innate sense of the coming night i was a vampire executioner and i knew the taste of night on the breeze just as i knew the feel of dawn pressing against the darkness there had been times when my life had depended on dawn coming nothing like near death experiences to hone a skill the sunlight had begun to fade to a soft evening gloom when id finally had enough of the silence i still had nothing helpful to say about his personal life but there was the case id been asked here to help solve a crime not to play dear abby so maybe if i just concentrated on the crime wed be okay is there anything about the cases that youve withheld from me anything im going to be pissed that i didnt know beforehand changing the subject he asked i wasnt aware we were on a subject i said you know what i meant i sighed yeah i know what you meant i slumped in my seat as far as the seatbelt would allow arms crossed over my stomach my body language was not happy nor was i i dont have anything to add to the donna situation or nothing helpful so concentrate on business he said you taught me that i said you and dolph keep your eye and mind on the important stuff the important stuff is what can get you killed donna and her kiddies arent a threat to life so put them on the back burner he smiled his normal closelipped iknowsomethingyoudontknow smile it didnt always mean he knew something i didnt sometimes he did it just to irritate like now i thought you said youd kill me if i didnt stop dating donna i rubbed my neck against the expensive seats and tried to ease a tension that was beginning at the base of my skull maybe i had been invited here to play dear abby at least in part shit you were right edward you cant just leave it would screw up becca for one thing but you cannot keep dating donna indefinitely shes going to start asking for a date for the wedding and what are you going to say i dont know he said well neither do i so lets talk about the case at least with that weve got a solid direction we do he glanced at me as he asked we know we want the mutilations and murders to stop right i asked yes he said well thats more than we know about donna are you saying you dont want me to stop seeing her he asked and that damn smile was back smug he looked smug im saying i dont know what the hell i want you to do let alone what you should do so lets leave it alone until i get some brilliant idea okay he said great i said now back to the question i asked what havent you told me about the crimes that you think i should know or rather that i think i should know i dont read minds anita i dont know what youll want to know dont be coy edward just spill the beans i dont want any more surprises on this trip not from you he was quiet for so long i thought he wasnt going to answer so i prompted him edward i mean it im thinking he said he moved in his seat shoulders tightening and loosening as if he were trying to get rid of tension too i guess even for him this had been a stressful day odd to think of edward letting anything truly stress him id always thought he walked through life with the perfect zen of the sociopath so that nothing truly bothered him id been wrong wrong about a lot of things i went back to watching the scenery there were cows scattered close enough to the road that you could make out color and size if it wasnt a jersey a guernsey or a black angus i didnt know it i watched the strange cows standing at impossible angles on the steep hillsides and waited for edward to finish thinking twilight seemed to last a long time here as if the light of day gave up the fight slowly struggling to remain and keep the darkness at bay maybe it was just my mood but i wasnt looking forward to darkness it was as if i could sense something out there in those desolate hills something waiting for the night something that could not move during the day it could be just my own overactive imagination or i could be right that was the hard part about psychic abilities sometimes you were right and sometimes you werent sometimes your own anxiety or fear could poison your thinking and make you almost literally see ghosts where there were none there were of course ways to find out is there a place where you can i pull over out of sight of the main road he looked at me why im sensing something and i just want to make sure im not imagining it he didnt argue when the next exit came up he took it we took a side road from the exit it was dirt and gravel and full of huge dry potholes the shocks on his hummer took the road like silk flowing down hill comfy a soft roll of hills hid us from the main highway but the road was very flat in front of us giving a clear view of the road as it went almost straight towards a distant rise of hills there were a handful of tiny houses on either side of the road the major cluster some ways ahead with a small church sitting to one side by itself as if it were part of the houses and not the church had a steeple with a cross on top of it and i assumed a bell inside of it though we were too far away to be sure the town if it were a town looked down on its luck but not empty there were people there and eyes to see us just our luck the land had been so empty and the road we go down has a town stop the car i said we were as far from the first house as we could get without backtracking edward pulled over to the side of the road the dust rose in a cloud to either side of the car settling over the clean paint job in a dry powder you guys dont get much rain up here do you no he said anyone else would have elaborated but not edward even the weather wasnt a topic of conversation unless it affected the job i got out of the car and walked a little way into the dry grass i walked until i could no longer sense edward or the car when i looked back i was yards away edward was standing on the drivers side door arms crossed on the roof hat tilted back so he could watch the show i dont think there was another person i knew who wouldnt have asked at least one question about what i was about to do it would be interesting to see if he asked any questions afterwards darkness hung like a soft silken cloth hanging against the sky and the living light it was a soft comfortable twilight an embracing dark a breeze blew across the open land and played with my hair everything felt fine good had i imagined was i letting edwards problems get to me was the memory of the survivors in their aircompressed hospital room making me see shadows i almost just turned around and walked back to the car but i didnt if it were my imagination then it wouldnt hurt to check and if it wasnt i turned and faced away from the car away from the distant houses and looked nut into the emptiness of course it wasnt really empty there was grass rustling in the wind it sounded so dry like corn in autumn just before its harvested the ground was covered in a thin layer of pale reddishbrown gravel with paler dirt showing through the ground ran until it met the hills that continued on and on towards the darkening sky not empty just lonely i took a deep cleansing breath let it out and did two things at once i dropped my shields and spread my arms wide hands reaching i was reaching with my hands but it wasnt just my hands i reached outward with that sense i have magic if you like the word i dont i reached outward with that power that let me raise the dead and mix with werewolves i reached outward towards that waiting presence that id felt or thought id felt there there like a fish tugging on my line i turned to face the direction of the road it was in that direction going towards santa fe it i had no better word i felt its eagerness for the coming night and knew that it could not move in daylight and i knew that it was large not physically but psychically because we were not close to it and yet id picked it up miles away how many miles i couldnt say but far very far to have sensed it it didnt feel evil that didnt mean it wasnt evil just that it didnt think of itself as evil unlike people preternatural entities are rather proud of being evil they embraced their malignancy because whatever this was it wasnt human it wasnt physical spirit energy pick a word but it was up ahead and it was not contained in any physical shell it was free floating no not free something slammed into me not physically but as if a psychic truck had run me down i was on my butt in the dirt trying to breathe as if someone had hit me in the chest and knocked the wind out of me i heard edwards running footsteps but i couldnt seem to turn around i was too busy relearning how to breathe he knelt by me gun in hand what happened he was looking out into the thick twilight not at me searching searching for the danger his sunglasses were gone and his face was very serious as he searched for something to shoot i gripped his arm shaking my head trying to talk but when i finally had air enough all i said was shit shit shit it wasnt helpful but i was scared most of the time when i get this scared i get cold shocky but not when its psychic shit when something goes wrong with magic i never go shocky or get cold i stay warm if anything its like tingling warm as if id stuck my finger in a light socket whatever it was had sensed me and shut me down i pulled my shields around me like clutching a coat against a blizzard but strangely it had backed off though if that one swat of power was any indication it could slice me dice me and serve me on toast if it wanted to it hadnt wanted to i was glad thrilled but why hadnt it hurt me worse how had i sensed it from so far away and how had it sensed me usually my greatest talent is with the dead did that mean whatever it was was dead or had something to do with the dead or was this one of the new psychic abilities that my teacher marianne had warned me might crop up god i hoped not i didnt need more strange shit in my life i had plenty i forced myself to stop the useless cursing and said put up the gun edward im all right besides theres nothing to shoot and nothing to see he put a hand under my arm and pulled me to my feet before i was ready id have been very happy to stay sitting for a while i leaned on him and he started moving us back towards the car i stumbled and finally had to tell him stop please he held me up still searching the new dark gun still in hand i should have known hed keep the gun out it was his security blanket sometimes i could breathe again and if edward stopped dragging me on i might be able to walk the fear had faded because it was useless id tried a bit of magic and i hadnt been good enough i was learning ritual magic but i was a beginner power isnt enough youve got to know what to do with it like a gun with the safety on it makes a fine paperweight but thats about it unless you know what to do with it i slid into the car had my door closed and locked before edward opened his door tell me what happened anita i looked at him it would serve you right if i just looked at you and smiled something crossed his face a frown a snarl quickly lost to that perfect blankness he could manage youre right ive been a secretloving bastard and it would serve me right but youre the one who said we needed to stop the pissing contest and solve the crime ill stop if you will i nodded agreed so he said start the car and get us out of here somehow i didnt like sitting on the nearly deserted road in the freshly spilled darkness i wanted to be moving sometimes movement gives you the illusion that youre doing something edward started the car turned around in the weeds and drove back towards the highway talk ive never been to this area before for all i know what i sensed is always here just some local bugaboo what did you sense something powerful something thats miles away towards santa fe something that may be connected to the dead in some way which would explain why it called to me so strongly im going to need to find a good local psychic to see if this thing is always around or not donna will know some psychics whether theyre good i cant say and im not sure she can either its a place to start i said i snuggled into my seatbelt hugging myself you got any local animators necromancers anyone who works with the dead if it is something connected to my type of power then an ordinary psychic might not sense it i dont know of any but ill ask around good we were back out on the highway the night was very dark as if thick clouds hid the sky the headlights seemed very yellow against the blackness do you think this whateveritis has anything to do with the mutilations he asked i dont know you dont know a hell of a lot he said he sounded grumpy thats the problem with psychic shit and magic sometimes its not very helpful ive never seen you do anything like what you just did you hate the mystical crap yes i do but ive had to accept what i am edward this mystical crap is a part of who and what i am i cant run from it because it is me you cant hide from yourself not forever and you cant ever outrun yourself i raise the dead for a living edward why should it be a shock that i may have other abilities its not he said i glanced at him but he was watching the road and i couldnt read his face its not i said i called you in to be backup not just because youre a shooter but because you know more about preternatural stuff than anyone else i know that i trust you hate the psychics and the mediums because you are one but you still deal in reality and that makes you different from the rest of them youre wrong edward i saw a soul today hovering in that room it was real just as real as the gun in your holster psychics witches mediums they all deal in reality its just not the same reality that you deal with but it is real edward it is very very real he didnt say anything to that just let the silence fill the car and i was content with silence because i was tired terribly terribly tired id found that doing psychic shit sometimes exhausted me a hell of a lot faster than physical labor i ran four miles every other day lifted weights took kenpo class and judo and none of it made me as tired as having stood in that field and opened myself to that thing i never sleep in a car because i dont trust the driver not to have a wreck and kill me that is the truth about why i dont sleep in cars no matter what i say out loud my mother was killed in a car accident and ive never really trusted cars since i settled down in my seat trying to find a comfortable place for my head i was suddenly so tired so tired my eyes burned i closed my eyes just to rest them and sleep dragged at me like a hand pulling me under i could have fought it but i didnt i needed the rest and i needed it now or i wouldnt i be worth shit soon and the thought crossed my mind as i let myself relax that i did trust edward i really did i slept huddled in the seat and didnt wake until the car stopped were here edward said i struggled to sit up feeling stiff but rested where teds house i sat up straighten teds house edwards house i was finally going to get to see where edward lived i was going to snoop and strip some of his mystery away if i didnt get killed finding out edwards secrets would make the entire trip worthwhile if i did get killed id come back and haunt edward see if i could make him see ghosts after all the house was adobe and looked old or genuine not that i was an expert but there was a feel to the house of age we unloaded my luggage from the back of the hummer but i had eyes mostly for the house edwards house id never really hoped to see where he lived he was like batman he rode into town saved your ass then vanished and you never really expected an invitation to see the bat cave now here i was standing in front of it cool it wasnt what id pictured id thought maybe a hightech condo in the city la maybe this modest appearing adobe house hugging the land was just not what id had in mind it was part of his secret identity his tedness but still edward lived here and there had to be more reason than just ted would have liked it i was beginning to think i really didnt know edward at all the light over the front door switched on and i had to turn away shielding my night vision id been staring right at it when it glared to life i had two thoughts one who had turned on the light two the door was blue the door was painted a blueviolet a rich rich color i could also see the window nearest the door its trim was painted the same vibrant blue id seen it at the airport though with more flowers and an addition of fuchsia i asked whats with the blue door and trim maybe i like it he said ive seen a lot of doors painted blue or turquoise on a lot of houses since ive been here what gives very observant a failing of mine now explain they think witches cant cross a door painted blue or green i widened my eyes you believe that i doubt most of the people who paint their doors believe it anymore but its become part of the local style my guess is that most people who do it dont even remember the folklore behind it like putting out a jack o lantern at halloween to frighten the goblins away i said exactly and because i am so observant who turned on the porch light either bernardo or olaf your other backups i said yes cant wait to meet them in the spirit of cooperation and no more surprises olaf doesnt like women much you mean hes gay no and implying that to him will probably mean a fight so please dont if id known id be calling you in i wouldnt have called him in at all the two of you in the same house on the same case is going to be a fucking disaster thats harsh you think we cant play nice together id almost guarantee it he said the door opened and our conversation cut off abruptly i was wondering if it was the dreaded olaf the man in the doorway didnt look much like an olaf but then what does an olaf look like the man was six foot give or take an inch it was hard to tell his exact height because his lower body was completely covered by a white sheet that he had clutched in one hand at his waist the sheet spilled around his feet like a formal dress but from the waist up he was anything but formal he was lean and muscular with a very nice set of abs he was tanned a lovely even brown though some of that was natural color because he was american indian oh yes he was his hair was waist length falling over one shoulder and across the side of his face heavy and solid black tusseled from sleep though it was early to be in bed his face was a soft full triangle with a dimple in his chin and a full mouth was it racist to say that his features were more white than indian or was it just true you can close your mouth now edward said near my ear i closed my mouth sorry i mumbled how embarrassing i didnt usually notice men this much at least men i didnt know what was wrong with me today the man folded the sheet over his free arm until his legs showed and he could come down the two steps without tripping sorry i was asleep or id have come out to help sooner he seemed perfectly at ease in his sheet though he was going to a lot of effort to spill it over the same arm that was holding it in place so he could grab a suitcase bernardo spottedhorse anita blake he was holding the sheet with his right hand and he looked mildly perplexed as he dropped the suitcase and started the process of switching everything to the other hand the sheet slipped down in front and i had to turn my head away fast i kept my head turned because i was blushing and wanted the darkness to hide it i waved my hand vaguely behind me well shake hands later when youre wearing clothes edwards voice you flashed her great everybody noticed im sorry bernardo said truly we can get the luggage i said go get a robe i felt someone move up behind me and i wasnt sure how i knew but i knew it wasnt edward youre modest i expected a lot of things from edwards descriptions but not modesty i turned around slowly and he was standing too close invading the hell out of my personal space i glared at him what were you expecting the whore of babylon i was embarrassed and uncomfortable and that always made me angry the anger showed in my voice the halfsmile on his face faded round the edges i didnt mean any offense his hand came up as he said it as if hed touch my hair i stepped back out of reach whats with the touchiefeelie routine i saw the way you looked at me in the doorway he said i felt the heat ride up my face but i didnt turn away this time if you want to come to the door looking like a playgirl centerfold dont blame me for staring but dont make more of it than it is youre nice eye candy but the fact that youre coming on this strong isnt flattering to either of us either youre a whore or you think i am the first im willing to believe the second i know isnt true i walked up to him now invading his space the blush gone leaving me pale and angry so back off it was his turn to look uncertain he stepped back put the sheet into as much of a cover as it could be and bowed it was an oldfashioned courtly movement as if hed done it before and meant it it was a nice gesture with his hair spilling all around but id seen better not for six months but i had seen better he raised up and his face was solemn he looked sincere there are two kinds of women that hang around with men like edward like me that know what we are the first are whores no matter how many guns they own the second is strictly business i call them madonnas because they never sleep with anyone they try to be one of the guys the smile played along his lips again forgive me if im disappointed that youre one of the guys ive been here for two weeks and im getting lonely i shook my head two weeks poor baby i pushed past him and grabbed my overnight case i looked at edward next time remind me about everybodys little foibles he raised his hand in a boy scout oath i have never seen bernardo do that with any woman at first meeting her i swear it my eyes narrowed but i looked into his eyes and believed him how did i get the honor he picked up my suitcase and did smile you should have seen the look on your face when he came down the steps in the sheet he laughed and it was very masculine ive never seen you that embarrassed bernardo came up next to us i really honestly didnt mean to flash you i just dont wear anything to bed so i threw this on wheres olaf edward asked pouting that youre bringing her in great i said one of you thinks hes a lothario and the other one wont talk to me thats just perfect i turned and followed edward toward the house bernardo called from behind us dont mistake olaf anita he likes women in his bed and hes not nearly as particular as i am about how he gets them there id be more careful of him than of me edward i said he was just inside the door he turned back and looked at me is bernardo right is olaf dangerous to me i can tell him about you what i told him about donna whats that i asked we were all still in the doorway not quite in the house i told him if he touched her id kill him if you come to my rescue then hell never work with me never respect me i said edward nodded thats true i sighed ill handle it on my own bernardo had moved up behind me closer than i wanted him i used the carryon bag to accidentally move him back a step or two olaf has been in prison for rape i looked at edward and let my disbelief show on my face is he serious edward just nodded his face had gone to its usual blankness i told you in the car that i wouldnt have invited him if id known you were coming in on this but you didnt mention the rape conviction i said he shrugged i should have what else should i know about good ol olaf thats it he looked behind me to bernardo can you think of anything else she needs to know only that he brags about the rape and what he did to her all right i said youve both made your point i only have one question edward just looked at me expectantly bernardo said shoot if i kill another one of your backups do i owe you another favor not if he deserves it i dumped the bag on the doorsill shit edward if you keep putting me together with fucking crazies and i keep having to defend myself ill be owing you favors until were in our graves bernardo said youre serious you really killed his last backup i glanced at him yeah im serious and i want permission to off olaf if he gets out of hand without having to owe edward another pound of flesh whod you kill bernardo asked harley edward said shit really i walked up to edward invading his space trying to read past the blank blue of his eyes i want permission to kill olaf if he gets out of hand without owing you another favor and if i dont give it he asked voice low drive me to a hotel because im not staying in a house with a bragging rapist if i cant kill him edward looked at me for a long slow moment then gave a small nod done as long as hes in this house outside the house play nice i would have argued but it was probably the best i was going to get edward was very protective of his backups and since i was one of them i could appreciate the attitude i picked up my bag from the floor and said thank you now wheres my room oh shes going to fit in just fine bernardo said and there was something in his voice that made me look at his face his handsome face had thinned to a blankness an emptiness that left his dark brown eyes like two burned holes in his face it was as if hed dropped his mask and let me sec inside because id proven myself monster enough to handle it maybe i had but i knew one thing olaf or bernardo either one better not walk in their sleep there was a fireplace against the far wall but it was narrow and white formed of the same smooth whiteness as the walls there was an animal skull mounted over the fireplace i would have said deer but the skull was heavier than that and the horns long and curving not a deer but something close kin and not from this country the narrow mantlepiece held two tusks as in elephant tusks and smaller animal skulls a low white couch faced the fireplace a large block of unpolished marble sat to one side of it with a small white china lamp on it a small alcove above the lamp held a huge chunk of white crystal there was a black lacquered table against the far wall between two doorways a second larger lamp sat on the table two chairs sat facing each other in front of the fireplace they had carved arms with winged lions on the arms and legs they were black leather and looked vaguely egyptian your room is this way edward said no i said ive waited a long time to see your home dont rush me mind if i take your luggage through to your room while you explore help yourself i said gracious of you he said and put an extra touch of sarcasm into his voice dont mention it i said edward picked up both my bags and said come on bernardo you can get dressed you didnt let us look around on our own bernardo said you didnt ask its one of the joys of being a girl and not a guy i said if im curious i just ask they went through a far door though the room was small enough that far was relative there was wood to one side of the fireplace in a woven basket of pale almost white reeds i ran my hand down the smooth coolness of the black marble coffee table that sat nearest the fireplace there was a black vase on the table full of what looked like either small wild flowers or large blackeyedsusans the deep yellow gold and the brown center didnt really match anything in the room even the navajo rug that took up most of the floor was in shades of black white and gray there were more flowers in an alcove between the far doorways the alcove was large enough to be a window except it didnt look out on anything the flowers spilled from the opening like a mass of gold and brown water a huge riotous bouquet when edward came back into the room without bernardo i was sitting on the white couch with my feet stretched out underneath the coffee table i had my hands clasped over my stomach and was trying to picture a roaring fire and a cold winter evening but somehow the fireplace looked too clean too sterile he sat down beside me shaking his head happy i nodded what do you think its not a restful room i said and for heavens sake look at all the wall space get some paintings i like it this way he had settled down on the couch beside me feet stretched out hands on his stomach he was mimicking me but even that couldnt ruin my mood i was going to see every room in detail before i left i could have tried to be cool about it but i didnt sweat being cool with edward wed moved beyond that in our strange friendship i really wasnt trying to play king of the hill with edward the fact that he was still playing the game with me just made him look silly though i hoped the gameplaying was over for this trip maybe ill get you a painting for christmas i said we dont buy christmas presents for each other edward said we were both staring at the fireplace as if visualizing that makebelieve inc maybe ill start one of those bigeyed children or a clown on velvet i wont hang it if i dont like it i glanced at him unless its from donna he was very still suddenly yes donna added the flowers didnt she i said yes he said white lilies or an orchid maybe but not wild flowers not in this room she thinks they brighten up the place oh they do i said he sighed maybe ill tell her how much you love those pictures of dogs playing poker and she can buy you some prints she wouldnt believe it he said no but i bet i could come up with something that she would believe that youd hate just as much he stared at me you wouldnt i might this sounds like the opening to blackmail what do you want i stared at him studying that blank face so youre admitting that donna and her crew are important enough for you so that blackmail would work he just looked at me with those pitiless eyes but the blank face wasnt enough now there was a chink in his armor big enough to drive a truck through theyre hostages edward if anyone ever thinks of it he looked away from me closing his eyes do you really think youre telling me something i havent thought about my apologies youre right like teaching your grandmother to suck eggs what he turned and was halflaughing i shrugged just an old saying it means that im lecturing someone who taught me what im lecturing about and what have i taught you he asked humor dying face turning serious you cant take all the credit my mothers death started the lesson early but i learned that if you care for people they can die if other people know you care for someone they can use that person against you you ask why i dont date humans hostages edward my life is just too damn violent for cannon fodder to be near and dear to my heart you taught me that and now ive broken the rule he said voice soft yep i said and where does that leave richard and jeanclaude he asked oh i make you uncomfortable and now its my turn just answer the question i thought about it for a second or two then answered truthfully because id spent a lot of the last six months thinking about it about them jeanclaude is so not cannon fodder if anyone ive ever met knows how to take care of himself its jeanclaude i guess you cant be a fourhundredyearold anything without being a survivor and richard edward was watching my face as he asked studying me as i so often studied him and i wondered for the first time if my face was empty more often than it was full if i hid my emotions my thoughts even when i wasnt meaning to how can you really tell what your own face shows richard can survive a shotgun blast to the chest with nonsilver shot can you say the same about donna it was blunt maybe too blunt but it was truthful his eyes shut down like curtains had pulled hiding hiding there was no one home it was the face he wore when he killed sometimes though sometimes when he killed he wore the most joyous expression i ever saw on his face you told me that they huddle around your humanity are you saying you huddle around their monstrousness he asked i looked into that so carefully unreadable face and nodded yeah it took me a while to realize it and longer to accept it ive lost enough people in my life edward im tired of it the chances are very good that both the boys will outlive me i held up my hand before he could say it i know that jeanclaude isnt alive trust me i probably know that better than you do you guys look serious talking about the case bernardo walked into the room wearing blue jeans and nothing else hed tied all that hair back in a loose braid he padded barefoot towards us and it made my chest tight it was one of richards favorite ways to walk around the house he only put shoes and a shirt on to go out or if company was coming over i watched a very handsome man walk towards me but i wasnt really seeing him i was seeing richard missing him i sighed and struggled to sit up straighten on the couch call it a hunch but i was betting that edward didnt have heart to heart talks with bernardo at least not about donna edward had also straightened no we werent talking about the case he said bernardo looked from one to the other of us with a smile playing on his lips but his eyes didnt match he didnt like the serious air and it not being about the case and him not knowing what it was about id have asked edward wouldnt have told me but id have still asked sometimes it was good to be a girl you said you had the files on the santa fe cases i said edward nodded standing ill bring them to the dining room bernardo show her the way my pleasure he said edward said treating anita like a girl would be a mistake bernardo it would piss me off to have to replace you this late in the game with that edward left through the far right door there was a wash of night air and a buzz of insects before he closed the door behind him bernardo looked at me shaking his head ive never heard edward talk about any woman the way he talks about you i raised eyebrows at him meaning dangerous he talks about you like youre dangerous intelligence showed in his solid brown eyes an intelligence that had been hiding behind his good looks and charming smile an intelligence that didnt show when he had his monster face on for the first time i thought that it might be a mistake to underestimate him he was more than just a gun for hire how much more remained to be seen what im supposed to say i am dangerous are you he asked still studying me with that intense expression i smiled at him well you get to go down the hall first he tilted his head to one side why dont we go together side by side because the halls too narrow or am i wrong youre not wrong but do you really think ill shoot you in the back he spread his arms wide and turned a slow circle do i look armed he was smiling when he faced me again charming i didnt buy it unless i run my hands through all that thick hair and down your pants i dont know youre unarmed the smile faded a touch most people dont think about the hair which meant that he did have something hidden away if he was truly unarmed hed have teased and offered me a chance to search its got to be a blade the hair isnt thick enough to hide a gun not even a derringer i said he reached behind his head and drew out a slender blade that hed woven through his hair he held it up then flipped it hilt to blade back and forth dancing it through his long slender fingers isnt it an ethnic stereotype that youre good with a knife i asked he laughed but not like it was funny he bounced the blade once more in his hand and it made me tense i was still standing behind the couch but knew that if he were really good id never get behind cover or draw my gun in time he was just too damn close i can cut my hair and put on a suit but im still going to be an indian to most people if you cant change it might as well embrace it he slipped the knife back into his hair making it look smooth and easy id have had to use a mirror and even then id have probably cut off half my hair you try to play in corporate america i asked yeah he said so now you dont do corporate stuff i still play in corporate america i protect the suits that want flashy muscle something exotic to impress their friends about what a big shot they are you do the knife act on command i asked he shrugged sometimes i hope it pays well i said he smiled it either pays well or i dont do it i may be their token indian but im a rich token indian if youre as good as edward thinks you are youd do better at bodyguard work than i do why i asked because the majority of protective work wants their bodyguard to blend in they want you not to be flashy or exotic youre pretty but its more a girl next door pretty nothing too beautiful i agreed with him but said oh that won you a lot of brownie points youve pretty much told me i dont have a chance so why should i bother lying i had to smile point taken you may be a little dark around the edges but you can pass for white bernardo said im not passing bernardo i am white my mother just happened to be mexican you got your fathers skin he asked i nodded yeah what of it no ones ever got up in your face about it have they i thought about it my stepmothers hurried comments to strangers that i was not hers no i wasnt adopted i was her stepdaughter me and cinderella the really rude ones would ask what was her mother judith would always answer quickly her mother was mexican though lately it was hispanicamerican no one could accuse judith of not being politically correct on the issue of race my mother had died long before people had worried about political correctness being in vogue if someone asked she always said proudly mexican if it was good enough for my mother it was good enough for me that memory i didnt share id never really shared it with my father i wasnt about to start with a stranger i chose another memory that didnt hurt quite so much i was engaged once until his mother found out my mother had been mexican he was blond and blueeyed the epitome of wasp breeding my futureinlaw didnt like the idea of me darkening her family tree that was a brief unemotional way to say some very painfully things he had been my first love my first lover i thought he was everything to me but i wasnt everything to him id never let myself fall so completely into anyones arms before or since jeanclaude and richard were both still paying the bill for that first love do you think of yourself as white i nodded yeah now ask me if i think im white enough bernardo looked at me are you white enough not according to some people like who like none of your damn business he spread his hands sorry didnt mean to step on your toes yes you did i said you think so yeah i said i think youre jealous of what that i can pass and you cant he opened his mouth and emotions flowed over his face like water anger humor denial he finally settled on a smile but it wasnt a happy one you really are a bitch arent you i nodded you dont pull on my chain and i wont pull on yours deal he said the smile flashed wider now allow me to escort your lily white ass to the dining room i shook my head lead on tall dark and studly as long as i get to watch your ass while we walk down the hall only if you promise to tell me how you like the view i widened my eyes you mean give you a critique on your butt he nodded and the smile looked happy now are you this big an egotist or just trying to embarrass me guess both i said the smile spread to a grin you are as smart as you look just get moving romeo edward doesnt like to be kept waiting damn straight we went down the short hallway him leading me following he put an extra glide into his walk and yes i watched the show call it a hunch but i was betting bernardo would actually ask me for the critique probably out loud in front of other people why is it when you have a sure thing to bet on theres never anyone around to take your money there were more heavy dark beams in the dining room more offwhite walls if the chairs were a clue the dining table was black and silver but the table was hidden under a tablecloth that looked like another navajo rug though this one had some color dull red stripes running with black and white there was even a black metal candelabra with red candles in the middle of the table it was nice to see some color that hadnt been added by donna it had taken me years to break jeanclaude of his fixation on black and white decor since i was just edwards friend and nothing more it wasnt my business how he decorated there was a fireplace in the corner nearly identical to the one in the living room except for a black piece of wood set into the white stucco i would have called it a mantel but it didnt stick out that far the true mantel was decorated in more red candles of every shape and size some sitting with their waxy bottoms directly on the mantel some in black metal holders there were two round ones that stuck up above the rest on the kind of holders where you spear the candle to hold it into place a silveredged mirror that looked antique was hung behind the candles so that when they were burned youd get their reflection strange i hadnt thought edward was the candlelight type there were no windows in the room just a molded doorway leading out the other side the walls were utterly white and utterly blank somehow the lack of decoration made the room seem more claustrophobic rather than less a man appeared in the far doorway he had to bend over to keep his bald head from smacking the top of the door he was taller than dolph who was six foot eight which meant he was the tallest person id ever met the only hair on his head was heavy black eyebrows and a shadow of beard along his chin and cheeks he was wearing the draw string bottoms of mens pajamas they were black and looked satin he had on slippers the kind that have no heels and always seem in danger of falling off olaf because who else could it be moved in the slippers like they were part of his flesh once he got over stooping through the door he moved like a welloiled machine muscles rippling under his pale skin he was tall but there wasnt an ounce of fat on him it was all hard lean muscle he walked around the table towards us and i moved without thinking to keep the table between us he stopped moving i stopped moving we stared at each other across the table bernardo was at the end of the table nearest the door watching us he looked worried probably wondering if he was supposed to come to my rescue if i needed one or maybe he just didnt like the tension level in the room i know i didnt if i hadnt moved away as he walked in would the tension level have been lower maybe but id learned long ago to trust my gut and my gut said to stay out of reach but i could try and be nice you must be olaf i didnt catch your last name im anita blake his eyes were dark brown set deep in the bones of his face like twin caves as if even in daylight his eyes would be shadowed he just looked at me it was as if i had not spoken i tried again im nothing if not persistent hello earth to olaf i stared into his face and he never blinked never acknowledged my words in any way if he hadnt been glaring at me id have said he was ignoring me i glanced at bernardo but kept my gaze on the big man across the table what gives bernardo he does talk right bernardo nodded he talks i turned my full attention back to olaf youre just not going to talk to me is that it he just glared at me you think not hearing the dulcet sounds of your voice is some kind of punishment most men are such jabber mouths silence is nice for a change thanks for being so considerate olaf baby i made the last word into two very separate syllables i am not your baby the voice was deep and matched that vast chest there was also a guttural accent underneath all that clear english german maybe it speaks be still my heart olaf frowned i did not agree with your being included on this hunt we do not need help from a woman any woman well olaf honey you need help from someone because the three of you havent come up with shit on the mutilations a flush of color crept up his neck into his face do not call me that what honey he nodded you prefer sweetheart honeybun pumpkin the color spread from pink to red and was getting darker do not use terms of endearment to me i am no ones sweetheart id been all set to make another scathing remark but that stopped me and i thought of something better how sad for you what are you talking about how sad that you are no ones sweetheart the color that had been fading from his face flushed dark now almost as if he were blushing are you feeling sorry for me his voice rose a notch not yelling but like the low growl of a dog just before it bites as he got more emotional the accent got thicker very german very lowland grandmother blake was from badenbaden on the border between germany and france but greatuncle otto had been from hamburg i couldnt be a hundred percent sure but it sounded like the same accent everyone should be someones sweetheart i said but my voice was mild i wasnt angry i was baiting him and i shouldnt have my only excuse was that all the talk of rape had made me scared of him and i didnt like that so i was doing something that was actually very masculine i was pulling the tail of the beast to make myself feel braver stupid the moment i realized why i was doing it i tried to stop i am no ones fool and that means i am no ones sweetheart he spoke carefully enunciating each word but his accent was thick enough to walk on he had started to move slowly around the table muscles tense like some big predatory cat i flashed my jacket on the left side showing the gun he stopped moving forward but his face was furious lets start over olaf i said edward and bernardo here told me what a big bad guy you were and that made me nervous which made me defensive when im defensive im usually a pain in the ass sorry about that lets pretend that i wasnt being a smart ass and you werent being all big and bad and start over he stilled that was the only word i had for it the quivering tension in his muscles eased like water running down hill but it wasnt gone just shoved away somewhere i had a glimpse into olaf he operated from a great dark pit of rage that it was directed mostly at women was accidental the rage needed some target or hed turn into one of those people that drive their cars through restaurant windows and start shooting strangers edward has been most insistent that you are to be here but nothing you will say can make me like it his words were pulling free of the accent as he regained control of his temper i nodded are you from hamburg he blinked and for an instant puzzlement replaced the sullenness what are you from hamburg he seemed to think about it for a second or two then gave a small nod i thought i recognized the accent the scowl was back full force you are an expert on accents he managed to sound sarcastic no my uncle otto was from hamburg he blinked again and the scowl wilted around the edges you are not german he sounded very sure my fathers family is from badenbaden on the edge of the black forest but uncle otto was from hamburg you said only your uncle had the accent by the time i came along most of the family except for my grandmother had been in this country so long there was no accent but uncle otto never lost his hes dead now olaf made it half question half statement i nodded how did he die grandma blake says aunt gertrude nagged him to death his lips twitched women are tyrants if a man allows it his voice was a touch softer now thats true of men or women if one partner is weak the other partner moves in and takes charge nature abhors a vacuum bernardo said we glanced at him i dont know what the expressions were on our faces but bernardo held his hands up and said sorry to interrupt olaf and i went back to looking at each other he was close enough now that i might not be able to draw the browning in time but if i moved away now all my peacemaking efforts would be for nothing hed either be insulted or see it as weakness on my part neither reaction would be helpful so i stood my ground and tried not to look as tense as i felt because no matter how calm i sounded my stomach was in one hard knot i had one chance to make this work if i blew it then the rest of this visit was going to be an armed camp and we needed to be solving the crime not fighting each other you are either a leader or being led olaf said which are you ill follow if someones worth following and who decides anita blake who is worth following i had to smile i do his lips twitched again and if edward put me in charge would you follow me i trust edwards judgment so yeah but let me ask you the same question would you follow me if edward put me in charge he flinched no i nodded great we know where we stand and where is that he asked im sort of goaloriented olaf i came down here to solve a crime and im going to do that if that means at some point taking orders from you so be it if edward puts me in charge of you and you dont like it take it up with him just like a woman to put the responsibility off on a mans shoulders i counted to ten and shrugged you talk like your opinion matters to me olaf i dont give a damn what you think of me women always care what men think of them i laughed then you know i was starting to feel insulted but you are just too funny i meant it he leaned towards me trying to use his height to intimidate it was impressive but ive been the smallest kid around for as long as i can remember i will not take it up with edward i will take it up with you or dont you have the balls to stand up to me he gave a harsh laugh oh i forgot you dont have balls he reached for me in a quick motion i think he meant to grope me but i didnt wait to see i threw myself backward into the floor and was drawing the browning before my butt hit the floor drawing the gun meant i didnt have time to slap my hands down and take the impact the way you were supposed to i hit hard and felt the shock all the way up my spine hed drawn a blade as long as his forearm from somewhere the blade was coming down and the browning wasnt quite pointed at his chest it would be a race to see who drew first blood but it was almost a guarantee that wed both bleed everything slowed down to that crystalline vision as if i had all the time in the world to point the gun to avoid the blade and at the same time everything was happening too fast too fast to stop it or change it edwards voice cut through the room stop it the first one to draw blood i will personally shoot we froze in midaction olaf blinked and it was as if time had resumed normal flow maybe just maybe we werent going to kill each other tonight but i had the gun pointed at his chest and his hand was still upraised with the knife though knife seemed too small a word sword was more like it where had he pulled it from drop the knife olaf edward said have her put up the gun first i met those hard brown eyes and saw a hatred there like what id seen earlier in lieutenant marks face they both hated me for being things that i could not change one for an innate godgiven talent and the other because i was a woman funny how one unreasoning hatred looks so much like another i kept the gun very steadily pointed at his chest id let all the air go out of my body and was waiting waiting for olaf to decide what wed be doing tonight either wed be fighting crime or wed be digging a grave maybe two if he was good enough i knew what my vote was but i also knew that the final vote wasnt mine it wasnt even olafs it was his hatreds you drop the knife and anita will put up the gun edward said or she will shoot me while im unarmed she wont do that she is afraid of me now olaf said maybe edward said but shes more afraid of me olaf looked down at me a glimmer of puzzlement rising up through the hatred and anger i am going to shove this blade inside her she fears me tell him anita i hoped i knew what edward wanted me to say i will shoot you twice in the chest you may get a slice of me before you fall to the ground if youre really good you might even slit my throat but youll still be dead i hoped he made up his mind soon because it was awkward holding a shooting stance while sitting on your butt i was going to get a crick in my back if i didnt get to move soon the fear was fading leaving only a dull emptiness behind i was tired and the night was still young hours to go before id sleep i was tired of olaf i had a feeling if i didnt shoot him tonight id get another chance who are you more afraid of anita olaf or me edward asked i kept my gaze on olaf and said you edward tell him why it sounded like a teacher telling his student what to say but from edward id take it because you would have never let me get the drop on you like this you would have never let your emotions compromise your safety olaf blinked at me you do not fear me he made it a question and seemed disappointed there was something almost littleboyish about his disappointment im not afraid of anything i can kill i said edward can be killed olaf said yes but can he be killed by anyone in this room thats the question olaf looked at me puzzled now more than angry he began to lower the blade slowly edward said drop it in a quiet voice olaf dropped the blade to the floor it hit with a ringing clang i got to my knees and then scuttled backwards along the edge of the table lowering the gun as i moved i got to my feet at the head of the table near bernardo i looked at him move over around by edward i didnt do anything he said just do it bernardo i need a little space right now he opened his mouth as if to argue but edward cut him off do it bernardo did it when they were all at the other end of the room i put the gun up edward had an armful of cardboard box it was overbrimming with files he set it down on the tabletop you didnt even have a gun olaf said i didnt need one edward said olaf pushed past edward to the hallway beyond i hoped he was going pack and leave but doubted wed get that lucky i hadnt known olaf for hour and i already knew why he was no ones sweetie a murder always breeds a lot of paper but a serial murder you can drown in the paperwork edward bernardo and i were swimming upstream wed been at it for about an hour and olaf hadnt come back maybe he had decided to pack up and go home though i hadnt heard any doors or cars but i wasnt sure how soundproof the house was edward didnt seem bothered by olafs absence so i didnt give it much attention either i had read one report through back to front one to get an overview and see if anything jumped out at me one thing did there were slivers of obsidian in the cut up bodies an obsidian blade maybe though we were in the wrong part of the world for it or were we did the aztecs ever get up this far i asked edward didnt treat it like a weird question yes so im not the first one to point out the obsidian clue might mean aztec magic no he said thanks for telling me that were looking for some sort of aztec monster the locals cops talked to the leading expert in the area professor dallas couldnt come up with any deity or folklore that would account for these murders or the mutilations you sound like youre quoting is there a report around here somewhere he looked out over the mound of papers somewhere isnt there an aztec deity that the priests skinned someone as an offering or is that mayan he shrugged the good professor couldnt make a connection thats why i didnt tell you the police have been looking into the aztec angle for weeks nothing i brought you down here to think different thoughts not follow old ones id like to talk to the professor all the same if thats okay with you i made sure he got the sarcasm look at the reports first try to find what weve missed then ill introduce you to professor dallas i looked at him trying to read behind those baby blues and failing as usual when do i get to see the professor tonight that raised my eyebrows gee that is quick especially since you think im wasting our time she spends most nights in a club near albuquerque she being professor dallas i said he nodded whats so special about this club if your career was aztec history and mythology wouldnt you just love to interview a real live aztec a live ancient aztec in albuquerque i didnt try and keep the surprise out of my voice how well maybe not live he said a vampire i said he nodded again has this aztec vamp got a name the master of the city calls herself itzpapalotl isnt that like an aztec goddess i asked yes it is talk about delusions of grandeur i was watching his face trying to catch a hint did the cops talk to the vamp yes and she wasnt helpful you didnt believe her did you neither did the cops but she was on stage at her club during at least three of the murders so shes cleared i said which is why i want you to read the reports first anita weve missed something maybe youll find out what but not if you keep looking for aztec bogeymen we raised that rock and as much as the police would like it to be the master of the city it isnt so why the offer to take me down to see her tonight just because shes not doing the murders doesnt mean she cant have information that could help us the police questioned her i made it a statement yeah but funny how vampires dont like talking to the police and how much they like talking to you you know you could have just told me that we were seeing the master vamp of albuquerque tonight i wasnt going to take you down there tonight unless you got bitchy about it i was actually hoping you wouldnt make the aztec angle until youd read everything first why i told you it was a blind alley we need new ideas things we havent thought of not things the police have already crossed off the list but you havent crossed this itzawhatever off your list have you the goddess will let you call her by her english translation obsidian butterfly its also the name of her club you think shes involved dont you i think she knows something that she might share with a necromancer but not a vampire executioner so i go down off duty so to speak so to speak im jeanclaudes human servant one third of his little triumvirate of power if i go visiting the master of this city without police credentials then ill have to play vamp politics i hate vamp politics edward looked out over the table when youve read your hundredth witness report tonight you may change your mind even vampire politics look good after reading enough of this shit gee edward you sound almost bitter im the monster expert anita and i dont have a fucking clue we looked at each other and again i had the sense of his fear his helplessness things that edward just didnt feel or so id thought bernardo came in with a tray of coffees he must have caught something in the air because he said did i miss something no edward said and he went back to the papers in his lap i stood and started sorting papers you havent missed anything yet i just love being lied to were not lying i said then why is the tension level so high in here shut up bernardo edward said bernardo didnt take it as an insult he just shut up and handed out the coffee i sorted out all the witness reports i could find then spent the next three hours reading them id read one report back to front and found out nothing the police and edward hadnt known weeks ago now i was looking for something new something that the police edward the experts theyd called in nobody had found it sounded egotistical but edward seemed sure id find it whatever it was though i was beginning to wonder if it was confidence in me or sheer desperation on edwards part that made him so sure id find something id give it my best shot and that was all i could do i looked down at several stacks of witness reports and settled in to read i know most people read each report in full or almost in full then move to the next but in a serial crime you were looking for a pattern on serial murders id learned to divide the files up into parts all the witness statements then all the forensic reports then the pictures of the crime scene etc sometimes i did the pictures first but i was putting it off id seen enough in the hospital to make me squeamish so the pictures could wait and i could still do legitimate work on the case without having to see all the horrors procrastination with a purpose what could be better bernardo kept making us all coffee and continued to play host going back and forth when the coffee ran low offering food though we both declined when he brought me my umpteenth cup of coffee i finally asked not that im not grateful but you didnt strike me as the domestic type bernardo why the perfect host routine its not even your house he took the question as an invitation to move closer to my chair until his jeanclad thigh was touching the arm but it wasnt touching me so that was fine you want to ask edward to go for coffee i looked across the table at edward he didnt bother to look up from the papers in his hands i smiled no i was more thinking id get my own bernardo turned and leaned his butt against the table arms crossed over his chest muscles played in his arms as if he were flexing just a bit for my benefit i didnt think he was even aware he was doing it as if it were habit truthfully he asked i looked up at him and sipped the coffee hed brought me that would be nice ive read the reports more than once i dont want to read them again im tired of playing detectives and wish we could just go kill something or at least fight something me too edward said he was watching us now with cool blue eyes but we have to know what were fighting and the answer to that is in here somewhere he motioned at the mounds of papers bernardo shook his head then why havent we or the police found the answer in all this paper he ran his finger down the nearest stack i dont think paperwork is going to catch this bastard i smiled up at him youre just bored he looked down at me a little startled expression on his face then he laughed head back mouth wide as if he were howling at the moon you havent known me long enough to know me that well laughter was still sparkling in his brown eyes and i wished it were a different pair of brown eyes my chest was suddenly tight with missing richard i looked down at the papers in my lap not sure if it would show in my eyes if my eyes showed sorrow i didnt want bernardo to see it if my eyes showed longing i didnt want him to misinterpret it are you bored bernardo edward asked bernardo turned at the waist so he could see edward with a minimum of movement it put his bare chest facing me no women no television nothing to kill bored bored bored i found myself staring at his chest i had an urge to rise up out of my chair spill the papers to the floor and run my tongue over his chest the image was so strong i had to close my eyes i had feelings like this around richard and jeanclaude but not around strangers why was bernardo affecting me like this are you all right he was bending over me face so close that his face filled my entire vision i jerked back pushing the chair and rising to my feet the chair crashed to the floor papers spilled everywhere shit i said with feeling i picked up the chair he bent down to help pick up the papers his bare back made a firm curved line as he started shoveling the papers back into a pile i watched the way the small muscles in his lower back worked fascinated by it i stepped away from him edward was watching me from across the table his gaze was heavy as if he knew what i was thinking feeling i knew it wasnt true but he knew me better than most i didnt want anyone to know that seemed to be unwarrantedly attracted to bernardo it was too embarrassing edward said leave us alone for a while bernardo bernardo stood with a bundle of papers looking from one to the other of us did i just miss something yes edward said now get out bernardo looked at me he looked a question at me but i gave nothing back i could feel my face unreadable and empty bernardo sighed and handed me the papers how long ill let you know edward said wonderful ill be in my room when daddy decides to let me come out he stalked through the nearest door where olaf had vanished through no one likes being treated like a child i said its the only way to deal with bernardo edward said his gaze was very steady on my face and he looked way too serious for comfort i started sorting the papers in my hands i used the cleared space on the table that id made hours ago when i was still leaning over the table instead of slumping in the chair to read i concentrated on sorting and didnt look up until i felt him beside me i looked then and found his eyes werent blank they were intense but i still couldnt read them you said you hadnt been dating either of them for six months i nodded have you been dating anyone else he asked i shook my head no sex then he said i shook my head again my heart was beating faster i so did not want him to figure this out why not he asked i looked away then unable to meet his eyes i dont have any moral high ground to preach from anymore edward but i dont do casual sex you know that youre jumping out of your skin every time bernardo comes near you heat climbed up my face is it that noticeable only to me he said i was grateful for that i spoke without looking at him i dont understand it hes a bastard even my hormones usually have better taste than that edward was leaning against the table arms crossed over his white shirt it was exactly how bernardo had been sitting but it didnt move me and i didnt think it was just the shirt edward just did not affect me in that way and never would hes handsome and youre horny the heat that had been fading flared until it felt like my skin would burn dont say it that way its the truth i looked at him then and let the anger show in my eyes damn you maybe your body knows what you need i widened eyes at him meaning what a good uncomplicated fuck thats what i mean he still looked calm unmoved as if hed said something entirely different what are you saying fuck bernardo give your body what it needs you dont have to go back to the monsters to get laid i cannot believe you said that to me why not if you were having sex with someone else wouldnt it be easier to forget richard and jeanclaude isnt that part of their hold on you especially the vampire admit it anita if you werent celibate you wouldnt be missing them as much i opened my mouth to protest closed it and thought about what hed said was he right was part of the reason i was still mooning over them the lack of sex yeah i guess it was but it wasnt just that i miss the sex yeah but i miss the intimacy edward i miss looking at them both and knowing theyre mine knowing i can have every inch of them i miss sunday after church and having richard stay over to watch old movies i miss watching jeanclaude watch me eat a meal i shook my head i miss them edward your problem anita is that you wouldnt know an uncomplicated fuck if it bit you on the ass i wasnt sure whether to smile or be mad so my voice was a little amused and a little angry and your relationship with donna is so uncomplicated it was at the beginning he said can you say that about either of yours i shook my head im not a casual person edward not in anything he sighed i know that when you give your friendship its for life when you hate someone its forever when you say youre going to kill someone you do it one of the things making you squirm about your boys is the fact that for you love should be forever and whats wrong with that he shook his head sometimes i forget how young you are and what does that mean it means you complicate your life anita he raised a hand before i could say it and said it for me i know ive screwed up with donna but i went into it meaning to be casual meaning it to just be part of the act you always go into everything like its life or death only life and death are life and death and you think that sleeping with bernardo would fix all that itd be a start he said i shook my head no your final word he asked yes i said fine i wont bring it up again great i said and looked into that blank edward face being with donna has made you more personal more warm and fuzzy im not comfortable with the new edward neither am i he said edward went back to his side of the table and we both started reading again usually silence between us was companionable and not strained but this quiet was full of unsaid advice me to him about donna and him to me about the boys edward and i playing dear abby to each other it would have been funny if it hadnt been so sad an hour later id finished the witness reports i stretched my lower back while still sitting in the chair just bending slowly at the waist until my hands touched the floor or almost touched the floor three stretches and i could press my palms flat to the floor better i got up and checked my watch midnight i felt stiff and strange estranged from this quiet room and the peaceful surroundings my head was filled with what id read and what id read hadnt been peaceful standing i could see edward hed moved to the floor lying flat on the floor holding the reports up in front of his face if i had lain down id have been asleep edward always did have a will of iron he glanced at me i got a glimpse of what he was looking at hed moved on to the pictures something must have shone on my face because he placed the pictures face down on his chest you finished with the witness reports yeah he just looked at me i went around the table and sat in the chair hed started the night in he stayed lying on the floor i would have said like a contented cat but there was something more reptilian about him than feline a coldness how could donna miss it i shook my head business concentrate on business the majority of the houses are isolated ones mostly because of the wealth of the owners theyve got enough money to give them land and privacy but three of the houses were located in developments like the bromwells with neighbors all around those three attacks occurred on one of the few nights that all the neighbors were gone and he said and i thought this was going to be a brainstorming session i want your ideas he shook his head i brought you down here for a set of fresh eyes anita if i tell you all our old ideas it may lead you down the same wrong paths weve already taken tell me what you see i frowned at him what he said made sense but it still felt like he was keeping secrets i sighed if this was a person id say he or they stake out the houses night after night waiting for that one night when all the neighbors were out of the way but do you know the odds of an entire street clearing out on any given night in the suburbs long odds edward said i nodded damn straight a few people had plans for that night one couple went to a nieces birthday party another family had their once a month dinner with the inlaws two couples from different crime scenes were both working late but the rest of the people didnt have plans edward they just all left home about the same time on the same night for different reasons he was watching me eyes blank but steady intense and neutral at the same time from his face i didnt know whether i was saying something hed heard a dozen times before or something brand new detective sergeant dolph storr likes to stay neutral and not influence his people so i was kind of used to it but edward made dolph seem positively loaded with influence i continued but it was like slogging through mud without any feedback at all the detective in charge of the second case he noticed it too he went out of his way to ask why they left their houses the answers are almost identical where the police take the time to ask details go on edward said face still blank dammit edward youve read all the reports im just repeating what you already know but maybe youll end up someplace new he said please anita just finish your thought they all got restless a spur of the moment trip to get ice cream with the kids one woman decided to go grocery shopping at eleven oclock at night some of them just got in their cars and went for a drive no place in particular just had to get out for a while one man described it as cabin fever a woman mrs emma shit ive read too many names in too short a space of time was it an unusual name edward asked without a single change of expression i frowned at him and leaned across the table lying on it to reach the reports i shuffled through them until i found the one i wanted mrs emma taylor said the night just felt awful i just couldnt stand being inside she goes on to say outside the air was suffocating hard to breathe so he asked so i want to talk to her why i think shes a sensitive if not a psychic theres nothing in the reports that say shes either if you have the gift and you ignore it or pretend its not real it doesnt go away power will out edward if shes a strong sensitive or a psychic that has neglected her powers for years then shell be either depressed or manic shell have a history of treatment for mental illness how serious will depend on how gifted she is he finally looked interested youre saying that having psychic ability can drive you crazy im saying that psychic ability can masquerade as mental illness i know ghost hunters that hear the voices of the dead like whispers in their ears one of the classic symptoms of psycophernia empaths people who draw impressions from other people can be depressed because theyre surrounded by depressed people and they dont know how to shield themselves really strong clairvoyants can spend their lives getting visions from everything they touch unable to turn it off again seeing things that arent there psycophernia demonic possession can mask itself as multiple personality i could give you examples for the next hour matching mental illness with different types of power youve made your point he said he sat up and didnt seem the least bit stiff maybe the floor was good for his back i still dont understand why you want to talk to this woman the report was taken by detective loggia he was very thorough he asked good questions you noticed that he took more time with why people left than the rest of the cops just like i noticed it edward shrugged loggia didnt like the way everyone cleared out too damn convenient but he couldnt come up with anything that tied the people together into a conspiracy a conspiracy i almost laughed then stopped at the seriousness in his face did someone actually suggest that an entire uppermiddleclass to morethanmiddleclass neighborhood conspired together to kill these people it was the only logical explanation for why they all left within thirty minutes of each other on the night of the murders so they investigated all these people i asked thats where some of the extra paperwork comes from and i said nothing edward said nothing i made it a question a few neighborhood squabbles over kids destroying the flowers one affair where the husband that turned up dead was banging the next door neighbors wife edward grinned the neighbor was lucky that the other man got cut up in the middle of a string of serial killings otherwise hed have been the top of the hit parade could it have been a copycat i asked the police dont think so and believe me they tried to make the pieces fit i believe you the police hate to let a good motive slide since most of the time motive isnt even one of their top priorities most people kill over stupid things impulse screw motive do you have a logical reason why all these people would vacate their houses just at the right time for the killer or killers to make their move i nodded yep he looked up at me a slight smile on his face im listening its very common in hauntings for people to be uncomfortable in the area where the ghost is strongest youre saying ghosts did this i waved a hand wait wait until im done he gave a small nod dazzle me i dont know if its dazzling but i think its how it was done there are spells that supposedly can make a person uneasy in a house or a place but the spells i read in college were for one person or one house not a dozen homes and twice that many people im not even sure a coven working together could affect that big an area i dont know that much about actual witchcraft of any flavor well need to find a witch to ask but i think its moot i just mentioned it as a possibility its a possibility the cops havent come up with yet nice to know i havent entirely wasted the last five hours of my life but you dont think it was witches edward said i shook my head witches of almost any flavor believe in the threefold rule what you give out comes back to you threefold what goes around comes around edward said exactly and no one is going to want this shit coming back on them threefold i would have said they also believe in do what you will only harm none but you can have bad pagans just like you can have bad christians just because your belief says something is wrong doesnt mean someones not going to break the rules so what do you think caused them all to leave their homes just when our killer needed it i think whatever is doing this is big enough and powerful enough to simply arrive on the spot and want the people to go and they went edward frowned at me im not sure i understand what you mean our monster arrives knows which house it wants and he fills the rest of the houses with dread driving the other families out that takes a hell of a lot of power but to then turn around and shield the murder house so that that one family doesnt flee thats truly impressive i know some preternatural critters that can throw a sense of unease around them mostly i think to keep hunters at bay but i dont know anything that can cause this kind of controlled panic so youre saying you dont know what it is he said and there was just a tinge of disappointment in his voice not yet but if this is true then it rules out a hell of a lot of things i mean some vampires can throw out fear like this but not on this large a scale and if they could do the other houses they couldnt shield the murder house i know a vampire kill when i see it anita and this isnt one i waved my hands in the air as if clearing it im just throwing out examples edward even a demon couldnt do this how about a devil he asked i looked at him saw he was serious so i gave him a serious answer i wont go into how long its been since anyone saw a devil a greater demon above ground but if it were anything demonic id have felt it today in the house the demonic leave a stain behind edward couldnt one that was powerful enough hide its presence from you probably i said im not a priest so probably but whatever is mutilating these people doesnt want to hide i shook my fiend its not demonic id almost bet the farm on it but again im not a demonologist i know that donna can help us locate a witch tomorrow i dont think she knows any demonologists there are only two in the country father simon mccoupen who has the record in this century in this country for number of exorcisms performed and doctor philo merrick who teaches at the university of san francisco you sound like you know them edward said i attended a class taught by merrick and a talk given by father simon i didnt know you were that interested in demons lets just say that im tired of running into them without knowing much about them he looked at me sort of expectantly when did you run into a demon i shook my head i wont talk about it after dark if you really want to know ask me again tomorrow when the sun is shining he looked at me for a second or two as if he wanted to argue but he let it go which was just as well there are some stories some memories that if you tell them after dark they seem to gain weight substance as if there are things listening waiting to hear themselves spoken of again words have power but even thinking about them is sometimes enough to make the air in a room heavy id gotten better over the years at turning off my memories it was a way to stay sane the list of what our murderer isnt is getting longer edward said now tell me what it is i dont know yet but it is preternatural i leafed through the pages until i found the part id marked four of the people now in the santa fe hospital were only found because they wondered outside their homes at night skinned and bleeding neighbors found them both times theres a transcript of the call somewhere in this mess the woman who found the carmichaels had hysterics over the phone i thought about what id seen in the hospital and tried to imagine finding one of my neighbors perhaps a friend in that condition in the middle of the street i shook my head and chased the image back i did not want to imagine it i had enough nightmares of my own thank you very much i dont blame her i said but my point is this how could they walk around in that condition one of the survivors attacked his neighbor when the man came to help he bit his shoulder so badly that the man was taken to the hospital with the mutilation victims doctor evans said that they have to restrain all the patients in albuquerque or they try to get up and leave dont you find that strange yes its all strange is there a point in here somewhere and i heard that thread of tiredness in his voice i think that whatever skinned them was is calling them calling them how he asked the same way a vampire calls a person hes bitten and mindraped the skinning or something about it gives the monster a hold over them why doesnt the monster just take them with him the night he skins them edward asked i dont know can you prove that the skinned victims are being called by some bogeyman no but if the doctors would okay it i wonder where one of the survivors would go if no one stopped him maybe the mutilation victims could lead us right to the thing you saw the hospital today anita they are not going to let us take one of their patients and set him free between you and me im not sure i could stand to watch it myself well the great edward afraid at last another voice said we both turned to see olaf standing in the far doorway he was wearing black dress slacks and a black polostyle shirt the shirtsleeves a little short for his long arms i guess there just arent a lot of choices when you wear jolly green giant sizes he glided into the room and if i hadnt spent so much time around vampires and shapeshifters id have said he was good at gliding for a human he was very good edward stood as he spoke what do you want olaf has the girl solved your mystery not yet edward said olaf stopped at the edge of the table closest to us not yet such confidence you have in her why four hours and that is the best question you can come up with i said olaf turned to me with a snarl shut up i took a step forward and edward touched my elbow he shook his head i stepped back gave them some room truthfully i wasnt up to arm wrestling olaf and i couldnt really shoot him just for yelling at me it kind of limited my options edward answered olafs question when you look at her olaf you see just the surface just the small attractive packaging underneath all that prettiness is someone who thinks like a killer and a cop and a monster i dont know anyone else who bridges all three worlds as well as she does and all the preternatural experts you find are specialists theyre witches or clairvoyants or demonologists he glanced at me as he said the last then back to olaf but anita is a generalist she knows a little about most of it and can tell us whether we need to find a specialist and what kind of specialist we need and what kind of magical specialist do we need he put a lot of sarcasm into that question a witch someone who works with the dead hed remembered my earlier request about finding out what id sensed on the road were making a list and checking it twice i said edward shook his head olaf turned to me was that a joke a little one yes perhaps you should not try to make jokes i shrugged he turned back to edward you told me all this before she came you waxed eloquent about her abilities but i have worked with your magical people in the past and you never talked about them as you speak of her what is it about her that is so god damned special edward glanced at me then back to olaf the greeks believed that once there were no male and female that all souls were one then the souls were torn apart male and female the greeks thought that when you found the other half of your soul your soul mate that it would be your perfect lover but i think if you find your other half you would be too much alike to be lovers but you would still be soul mates i was fighting hard to keep my face from showing the growing surprise at this little speech i hoped i was succeeding what are you trying to say olaf demanded she is like a piece of my soul olaf you are mad olaf said a lunatic soul mates bah i kind of agreed with olaf on this one then why is the thought of giving her a gun while i hunt her one of my greatest fantasies edward asked because you are mad olaf said hear hear but i didnt say it out loud you know that i have no greater compliment to give than that edward said if i wanted to kill you olaf i would just do it the same with bernardo because i know that im better than both of you but with anita ill never be sure unless we do go up against each other for real if i die without knowing which of us is better ill regret the not knowing olaf stared down at him you cannot mean to say that this girl this die zimtzicke of a girl is better than bernardo or me thats exactly what i mean die zimtzicke meant a quarrelsome or bitchy woman couldnt really argue with that one i sighed olaf had hated me before now he was going to feel forced to be competitive this i did not need and compliment though it was it was not reassuring to know that edward fantasized about killing me oh excuse me hunting me while i was armed to see which of us was better oh yeah that was much more sane i checked my watch it was am frankly boys i dont know whether to be flattered or frightened but i do know one thing its late and im tired if we are really going to see the big bad vampire tonight then it has to be now you just dont want to look at the pictures tonight edward said i shook my head no not just before trying to sleep i dont even want to read the forensic reports tonight ill look at the gory remains first thing tomorrow afraid olaf said i met his angry eyes i need some sleep if im to function well while im here if i see the pictures right before bedtime i cant guarantee sleep he turned back to edward your soul mate is a coward no shes just honest thank you edward i went to stand closer to olaf so that i had to crane my neck back to see his face and he loomed over me there was really no way to get decent eye contact so i stepped back to a more comfortable angle for my neck and settled for meeting his deepset eyes if id been a man id have probably felt compelled to look at the pictures to prove myself worthy of all edwards praise but one of the good things about being a woman is that my level of testosterone poisoning is lower than most mens testosterone poisoning olaf looked confused probably not a new sensation for him show me to my room then explain it to him edward i want to get some extras if im going to be interviewing vamps tonight edward led me past the brooding olaf and out the door that everyone seemed to disappear through the hallway was white and so unadorned it looked unfinished he pointed out bernardos room as the first door and olafs was right beside mine do you really think olaf and i bunking next door to each other is a good idea by putting you right beside him it shows him im not afraid for you but i am i said he smiled just take some basic precautions youll be fine nice to know one of us confident if you hadnt noticed he outweighs me by like a ton youre talking like it would be a standup fight i know you anita if olaf comes through your door tonight youll just shoot him i studied his face are you setting him up so i will kill him he blinked and i saw for a moment that id surprised him no no i meant what i said to olaf if i wanted him dead id just kill him i put you next door to him because i know how he thinks hell think its a trap too easy and hell behave himself tonight what about tomorrow night edward shrugged one night at a time i shook my head and opened the door edward called to me before i could go inside or even turn on the light i turned back to face him you know most women get all mushy when a man tells them theyre his soul mate im not most women his smile widened amen to that i looked at him you know what you said in there scares me the thought that you fantasize about hunting me and killing me thats creepy edward sorry he said but he was still smiling still amused but honestly if youd said the soul mate stuff and meant it like loveydovey that could have scared me more ive known since we met that you might kill me some day but fall in love with me that would be just too weird the smile faded a notch or two you know if we could love each other our lives would be less complicated truth edward have you ever had a romantic thought about me he didnt even have to think about it he just shook his head me either ill meet you out front by the car ill wait for you here he said i looked at him why i dont want you smarting off to olaf on your way out if im not there to stop the fight would i do that he shook his head get the extra firepower and lets start the drive id like to get to bed before dawn good point i went into the room closing the door behind me there was a knock on the door almost immediately i opened it back up slowly but was pretty sure it was edward it was well take you into the club as my guest just a friend if the vamps dont know who you are they might be more careless around you let something slip that would make sense to you that wouldnt make sense to me what happens if i get outted during the evening think her worship will resent you sneaking the executioner into her club ill tell her that you wanted to see the best show in town and thought that they might not want the executioner around but that youre strictly there in an unexecution work mode will you say it just like that unexecution work mode he smiled probably she likes her men to be either very serious or very cute she you talk like you know her ted only kills rogues he is very welcome in a lot of the local monster hangouts edward the actor i said i do good undercover work i know you do edward but it always makes you uncomfortable to see me do it i shrugged youre such a good actor edward sometimes it makes me wonder which act is real the smile faded leaving his face blank and empty like some of him had slithered away with his smile go get your gear anita i closed the door with him still standing there in some ways i understood edward better than either of the men i had been dating in other ways he was the biggest mystery of all i shook my head literally shaking it off and looked around the small bedroom if we came back here at dawn id be tired and tired could mean careless i decided to make some changes now while i was fresh the rooms only chair would go under the doorknob but not until i was in for the night i moved a line of miniature kachina dolls from the dresser to the windowsill if anyone opened the window one or more of the dolls would fall there was a small mirror on the wall that was framed by deer antlers i placed it under the window just in case the dolls didnt fall id leave my suitcase to one side of the door entrance so if the door did somehow manage to open without knocking the chair over olaf might trip over the suitcase of course i was almost as likely to trip over it trying to get to the bathroom on the way out the moment i thought of it i had to go id hit the bathroom on the way out edward could stand outside and make sure olaf didnt interrupt i searched through my suitcase it was illegal for me to carry my vampire gear without a court order of execution carrying it without one was like premeditated murder but no law against carrying a few extras i had two thin vials of holy water with little rubber caps you hit the cap with your thumb and it popped open sort of like a grenade but only dangerous to the vamp which made it a lot more user friendly than a grenade i slipped the holy water into each of my back pockets they barely showed through the dark cloth i already had my cross but id had crosses ripped off of my throat before so i had backups i put a plain silver cross with chain in one front pocket of my jeans and another one in the pocket of the black dress jacket i opened the box of new ammunition that id packed id had to leave my apartment almost two years ago now when id lived in my apartment id put glazer safety rounds in my guns because i didnt want my neighbors to take a stray bullet glazers will not go through walls but as edward and some of my police friends had pointed out id been lucky glazers will shatter bone but dont really go through bone the difference between a shotgun and a rifle round sort of edward had actually come into town just to take me out to the shooting range and test fire stuff hed asked me questions about specific gun fights and what id learned was that the reason the glazers had done what i wanted them to do was mostly being almost point blank every time i used them for a kill what i needed was something that was a reliable kill from a safer distance than arms length it also might explain why id hit some older vamps from a distance but they hadnt stopped maybe not maybe they were just that old but edward had been very convincing something with more penetrating power more stopping power ammo meant not to wound but to kill because lets face it when was the last time id wounded anyone that i hadnt meant to kill wounding was an accident for me killing was the goal id settled on the hornady custom xtp handgun ammo to be exact the mm luger jhpxtp silvercoated of course there were other hollow point bullets that will expand to a bigger mass but some of them dont penetrate nearly as far into a body mass with a vamp you need to make sure you hit something vital not just that you make a big hole there were even bullets that penetrated further into a mass which meant theyd reliably go through a body and out the other side but all the hornady xtps were designed to penetrate the target but not so far as to pass through the target object and create a hazard that last was a quote from some of the hornady manufacturing literature the ammo followed the fbi penetration requirements the feds even more than little ol me have to worry about what happens when a bullet hits the bad guy and keeps traveling is it going to hit a kid a pregnant woman a nun out for her morning stroll once a bullet hits the mark and keeps traveling you really never know where it will end up so the plan is to make sure it doesnt leave the target but that the target doesnt get up either of course edward had made his own recipe for killing hed taken silver hollow points and filled the end with holy water and mercury then sealed the top with wax id been afraid that the wax would make the bullets jam in a gun but they ran through like silk smooth dependable like edward himself the ammo was a hell of a show so edward had told me i hadnt used edwards homemade surprise yet i was still vaguely wary of them he shouldnt have told me that they might jam the gun or maybe i would have been nervous of them anyway with these even if you hit in a nonlethal area missed the heart the head everything vital you still did damage the holy water and silver mercury would explode through the vamps body burning where they touched the holy water would cut through the body like acid hit a vamp even in a leg or arm with this shit and they might lose all interest in killing you and just want to stop the pain i stared at the two boxes of ammo and finally loaded up with the hornady xtp edwards specials in their box if i did have to shoot any vamps tonight i had no court order of execution and carrying the homemade seemed too much like premeditation premeditation is the difference between first degree murder and second degree murder or even manslaughter if you had a good lawyer and a sympathetic jury there were people in jail at this very moment for killing vamps i did not want to be one of them besides we were just going down there to ask questions nothing major so i told myself as i closed the suitcase and left the other bullets behind but i knew better than most that what should be simple always grows complex when you add a vampire add a master of the city any city and you never really know what youre walking into id killed three masters of the city one with a sword one with fire one by killing their human servant never just a straight on shoot out i probably wouldnt be shooting anyone tonight but i loaded up my extra clip with the bullets id only use them if id used up the first clip if i emptied thirteen of the xtps into something and it didnt go down all bets were off id worry about murder charges later after i survived survival first try to stay out of jail second my priorities in order i slipped the extra clip into the right pocket of my jacket and went off to find edward he was after all the one who had taught me my priorities i was cooling my heels in the living room when bernardo and olaf came out of the far rooms they had both changed clothes bernardo was in white dress slacks with a sharp crease and a roll of cuff a white vest showed off his darkly muscled arms hed added heavy silver arm bracelets at midbicep and matching ones at each wrist a silver saints medallion glittered against the smooth darkness of his chest most of his hair fell like a black dream around all that white except for a braid on one side it was a thick braid because he just had that much hair and hed woven silver chains with tiny bells here and there in his hair so he stalked into the room to the sound of gentle chimes he looked at me through a curtain of blackness caressing one side of his face the other graced by the silver on black glint of the braid it was to say the least eyecatching it was a little bit of a struggle to tear my gaze from bernardo and look at olaf he had gone for a black shirt that seemed utterly sheer to hide his shoulder holster hed put on a leather jacket it was way too hot for leather though admittedly with his totally shaved head black jeans and black boots with silver toes and heels the leather jacket looked about the right speed you guys look spiffy whats the occasion were going to a club bernardo said as if that explained it i know that i said he was frowning now you should change i pushed to my feet from the couch why he walked toward me i caught glimpses of dark flesh above his white leather loafers and the hem of his pants no socks he stopped at the edge of the couch as if id pulled back or made some other sign that i wasnt happy i know you can look as good as we do he gave a little selfdeprecating smile or as good as olaf here maybe not as good as me he smiled and i was a good smile meant to melt something a little lower than my heart but id been working on my reaction to him i was not a slave to my libido richard and jeanclaude could attest to that i looked at him in all his light and dark glory if i cant look as good as you why try at all the smile widened to a grin that made his face look somehow more real and less handsome less handsome less practiced but i liked it more he took a step closer and that teasing practiced look was back this was a man who knew how to flirt but if anything will turn me off its a very practiced approach as if the man has done it a thousand times before to a lot of different women which always seems to imply that i am no different from all the rest not flattering i think you might might be able to approach my glory if you tried even knowing it was an act i had to smile i just dont want to work that hard bernardo if i am forced to change then everyone changes olaf said i looked at him was he handsome not really but he was striking if he could tone down the bad boy routine he could probably pick up plenty of girls at the club or maybe even if he didnt tone it down it always amazes me how many women like dangerous men men who almost from the moment you meet them you know are bad news me i prefer my men kinder gentler nice niceness is highly underrated by most people i dont remember anyone putting you in charge olaf when edward asks me to change clothes ill change he took a step towards me but whatever he was going to say or do stopped when edward came into the room he was wearing a red tank top with a shortsleeved silk shirt that matched the tank the shirt would hide his shoulder holster if he were careful his jeans were new and black and with his yellow hair grown out enough to have a little curl to it he actually looked sort of cute edward never looked cute i knew when i was beaten i raised hands in surrender and started walking towards the bedrooms then stopped i turned back to him i thought the point to taking me down there without cops was that the monsters might talk to anita blake vamp executioner so that means no undercover crap why would changing clothes be undercover for you bernardo asked i looked at him then looked at edward if you want my services you take whatever the hell im wearing i dont dress up outside the office edward said lets go down there with you a little under wraps look around the club meet the monsters before they find out who you are why you know the answer you want me to look around use my expertise before they know i have any expertise he nodded but you also want me to be anita blake and impress the monsters yes he said hard to do both be a tourist until they make you then be yourself the best of both worlds i said exactly i looked at him is this all your plan no hidden agenda he smiled and it was teds smile slow lazy innocent would i do that to you i just shook my head and started for the bedrooms forget i asked ill change into something more festive i said without turning around edward didnt call me back and say no need to change so i kept walking we were undercover tonight apparently i hate undercover work i am just so damn bad at it i had also not packed with an eye for club hopping i changed into the newest blackest jeans i had the nikes would have to do because i hadnt brought anything else except more nikes all my shirts were just different colors of one or two styles if i find something comfy ive learned to buy doubles if i really like something and multiple colors if i really really like a style this means i am usually wearing last years style long after the fashion trend has moved on but its not like i care i had a royal blue cotton tee with a scoop neck almost all the shirts id packed had a scoop neck the blue was a little softer than the rest of the colors i added a touch of eye shadow enough eyeliner to be dramatic enough mascara so that the eyeliner didnt overwhelm my eyelashes a hint of blush and some kissass red lipstick i couldnt really get a good look in the rooms small mirror but at least the makeup looked good the shoulder holster was very black against the blue shirt but the black suit jacket took care of that since i couldnt take the jacket off without flashing the guys i added my wrist sheaths with matching silver knives if i was going to be stuck with the jacket all night i might as well carry them besides you never know when youll need a good blade i ran a brush through my hair and called it done apparently i looked okay because bernardo said i take it back if youd packed a dress youd be prettier than i am i shook my head no i wouldnt but thanks for saying it lets go edward said she is showing too much breast olaf said i looked at his completely sheer black shirt i can see your nipples his face darkened i think he was actually blushing bitch yeah sure you and the horse you rode in on i said edward moved between us soothing the big man to me he said dont tease him unless you want the trouble he started it i said he looked at both of us his face that icy gaze that id seen him wear when he killed i dont care who starts it but i will finish it is that clear olaf and i looked at edward then at each other slowly we both nodded it is clear olaf said crystal i said good his face transformed into a smiling face somehow appearing years younger how did he do it then lets go we went obsidian butterfly the club was located between santa fe and albuquerque the club was set back from the road like one of the indian casinos it had highclass tourist trap written all over it the parking lot was so full we had to circle to find a spot the building was done in fauxaztec temple or for all i knew real aztec temple but the outside of the building looked like a movie set red neon traced square carved faces and the name was traced in more red neon there was a line stretching around the corner of the building and out into the hot summer dark this was not my town i didnt know the manager so i couldnt jump the line i also did not want to stand in the line edward walked up the line confident as if he knew something i didnt we followed him like obedient puppies we werent the only foursome trying to get into the club we were the only foursome that wasnt made up of couples to blend in we needed at least one more woman but edward didnt seem to be trying to blend in he walked up to the head of the line where a large broadshouldered man of very indian descent stood barechested wearing what looked like a skirt but probably wasnt and a heavy fauxgold collar that covered most of his shoulders like a mantle he was wearing a crown covered in macaw feathers and other smaller feathers that i couldnt identify if this was just the bouncer at the door i was actually interested in seeing the show though i hoped they had access to lots and lots of pet parrots and hadnt actually slaughtered birds just for the outfits were professor dallass party shes expecting us edward said in his best hailfellowwellmet voice the feather and gold bedecked man said names he uncrossed his arms and looked at a clipboard that had been in his hand the entire time ted forrester bernardo spottedhorse olaf gundersson and anita lee the new last name stopped me apparently he was serious about me going in incognito ids i tried very hard to keep my face blank but it was an effort i didnt have any fake id i looked at edward he handed his drivers license to the man then still smiling said and now arent you glad that i didnt let you leave your license in the car he handed a second license to the man he looked at both for longer than i thought he should have as if he suspected something my shoulders were actually tight waiting for him to turn to me and say ahhah fake id but he didnt he handed both licenses back to edward and turned to bernardo and olaf they wailed with their licenses out as if theyd done this before edward moved back to stand by me and handed me the license i took it and looked at it it was a new mexico license with an address on it that i didnt know but it was my picture and it said anita lee the height weight and the rest were accurate just the name and address was wrong better put it in your pocket i may not be around to find it next time he said i slipped it in my pocket along with my other license a lipstick and some money and an extra cross i wasnt sure whether to be flattered or insulted that edward had set up a secret identity for me of course maybe it was just the license but knowing edward thered be more to it there usually was the big double doors were opened by another large muscled guy in a skirt though he didnt have a feather crown or a nifty collar a lesser bouncer apparently the doors led into a darkened room thick with an incense i didnt recognize the walls were completely covered with heavy drapes only another set of double doors showing the way another bouncer this one blond and tanned the color of thick honey opened the door he had feathers woven into his short hair he winked at me as we went through the door but it was bernardo he watched the closest maybe he was looking for weapons but i think he was watching bernardos butt he wouldnt see a weapon from the back bernardo had transferred his gun to a front cross draw because the gun had showed a lump at the back which told you how snug the pants fit in back the room we entered was large stretching out and out into the near darkness people sat at square stone tables that looked suspiciously like altars to me or at least what hollywood is always using for altars the stage took up most of the far left wall but it wasnt a stage not really it was being used as a stage but it was a temple it was as if someone had sliced off the top of a pyramid temple and transported it here to this night club in a city so far removed from the lush jungles where the building began that the stones themselves must be lonely a woman appeared in front of edward she looked as ethnic as the first doorman with high sculpted cheekbones and a fall of shiny black hair that fell to her knees as she moved through the tables she had menus in her dark hands so i assumed she was the hostess but her dress was red with a black design and i knew silk when i saw it the dress was vaguely oriental and didnt match the decor of the room or the waitresses hurrying to and fro in odd loose dresses made of some rough material the waitresses struggled along in loosefitting sandals while the hostess glided before us in high heels the same scarlet as her dress and perfectly manicured nails she was beautiful in a tall slender graceful fashion like a model but she was a discordant note as if she belonged to a different theme she showed us to a table that was in the very front with a view dead center of the temple there was a woman at the table who stood and offered us her hand as we sat down her handshake was firm and her hand was about my size it takes practice to have a firm handshake with hands this small professor dallas call me dallas was shorter than i was and so petite that in the right clothes shed have looked prepubescent she wore tan docker pants a white polo shirt with a tweed jacket complete with leather elbow patches as if shed read the dress code for college professors and was trying to conform her hair was shoulder length a baby fine medium brown her face was small and triangular and as pale and perfect as god had intended it to be her glasses were gold wire frames and too large for the small face if this was her idea of party clothes someone needed to take her shopping but somehow i didnt think the good doctor gave a shit i like that in a woman a man stepped out of the oddshaped door at the top of the temple the moment he stepped out silence fell in rings around him spreading out and out into the murmuring audience until it was so quiet i could hear the pulse of my own blood id never heard a crowd this large go so quiet so quickly id have said it was magic but it wasnt not exactly but this mans presence was a sort of magic he could have worn jeans and a tshirt and hed still have commanded your attention of course what he was wearing was pretty eyecatching all on its own his crown was a mass of thin long feathers a strange greenish bluish goldish color so that as he moved they shifted color like a trapped greenish rainbow hovering in a fan of colors above his forehead his cape hung nearly to his knees and seemed to be formed of the same feathers as his headdress so that he moved in a wave of iridescence the body that showed was strong square and dark i was sitting close enough to tell if he was handsome or not but staring at him i wasnt sure it was impossible to separate his face from that presence and so the face didnt matter much he was attractive not because of the length of a nose or the turn of a chin but just because i found myself sitting up a little straighter in my seat as if coming to attention the moment i did it i knew that even if it wasnt magic it was something i had to fight to tear my gaze from him and look at the others at the table bernardo was gazing at him as was doctor dallas edward was gazing out over the hushed crowd olaf was studying the doctor he watched her not as a man watches a woman but as a cat watches a bird through cage bars if dallas noticed she ignored it but somehow i think she didnt notice i think even with the mans presence filling the room his rich voice riding the air id have felt olafs gaze like a cold wind down my spine that dallas was oblivious to it made me worry about her just a little and made me very sure that i never wanted olaf alone with her her survival instincts just werent up to it the man king or high priest talked in rich tones i caught part of it something about the month of toxcatal and a chosen one i could not concentrate on his voice any more than i could gaze upon him because to give him too much of my attention meant i was caught up in the spell he was weaving over the crowd it wasnt a spell in the true sense of the word but there was power in it if not magic the difference between magic and power can be very small id been forced to accept that fact in the last two years the high priest was human but there was a taste of ages to him there are just not that many ways for a human to last centuries one way is to be the human servant of a powerful master vamp unless obsidian butterfly was more generous about sharing her power than most of the masters of the city that id met the high priest belonged to her he was too powerful an echo of his master to be endured unless she was that master master vamps have a tendency to either destroy or own that which is powerful the high priest had been powerful in life a charismatic leader now centuries of practice had turned that charisma into a kind of magic id had full fledged vamps not affect me this much if this was the servant how scary was the master going to be i sat there at the stone table flexing my shoulders to feel the tightness of the shoulder holster i was glad id packed an extra clip of bullets i moved my wrists just enough to feel the knives resting against my arms i was very glad id brought the knives you can stab vamps and keep them alive but still make your point i was finally able to separate the power of his voice from the word most vamps when they can do tricks with their voices the words themselves hold the key they say beautiful and you see beauty they say terror and you feel afraid but this voice had little to do with the words it was just an overwhelming aura of power like a great white noise hum the audience may have thought that they were hanging on every word but the man could have recited a grocery list with similar effect the words were you saw him as the god tezcathpoca in our opening dance now see him as a man the lights had been dimming as the priest spoke until he was left in near darkness only the iridescent gleam of feathers showed as he moved the light came up on the other side of the stage revealing a man pale skin that glowed in the lights from his bare feet to equally bare shoulder his back was to the audience and for a moment i thought he was nude there was nothing to break up the curve of his body from the swell of his calves to his thighs the tight roundness of his buttocks the lean waist the spread of shoulders his hair looked black under the lights cut so close to his head that it looked shaved he turned slowly revealing the barest of gstrings a color so close to his skin that you knew the illusion of nudity was a planned effect his face shone unadorned like a star starkly beautiful he looked somehow pure and perfect which wasnt possible no one human was perfect but he was pretty a line of black hair ran down the center of his chest and stomach to vanish into the thong our table was close enough and his body white enough that i could see the thin line of hair encircling his nipples to meet that thin line down his chest like the soft arms of a t i actually had to shake my head to clear it maybe it was being celibate or maybe there was more magic in the air than just the voice of the human servant i looked back at the stage and knew that it was only a trick of the light that made his skin seem to glow i looked over at professor dallas she had her head bent very close to edward talking to him in whispers if she saw the show almost every night it was nothing new to her but the lack of attention that she paid the man made me turn and search the dim tables around us most eyes especially the women were turned rapt to the stage but not all eyes some were drinking holding hands with their dates doing other things i turned back to the stage and just looked at him drinking in the lines of his body damn it was just me or rather it was just a normal human reaction to a nearly naked and attractive man id have preferred a spell at least then i could blame someone else my hormones my fault i needed more hobbies that was it more hobbies that would fix everything the lights came up slowly until the priest was visible once more it was traditional that twenty days before the great ceremony brides would be chosen for him i caught a glimpse of fur and for just an instant i thought it was a line of shapeshifters in their halfhuman halfbeast guise but it was men dressed in leopard skins not hanging loose like cloaks but as if the skins were sewn around their bodies some of them were too tall for the skins so that a loot or more of bare leg showed below the animal feet or out of the clawed arms they moved among the tables in a strangely graceful line encased in fur with their faces framed through the open jaws of the dead animals a man passed within touching distance of our table and i saw the black rosettes that decorated the golden skin more closely and it wasnt leopard i was spending a lot of time with st louis wereleopards id killed the wereleopard leader because he was trying to kill me among other things but id left the leopards without a leader and shapeshifters without a leader are anyones meat so i was de facto leader until we could work something else out id been learning how to forge them into a stronger unit or pard one of the ways you did that was sheer physical closeness not sex but closeness i stared at the skin and my hand went out without thinking the mans movement stroked my hand over the once living fur the spots were larger the markings werent as neat somehow i watched the cat heads on the men and the heads were more square not the rounded almost feminine line of leopard jaguars they were jaguars which made perfect sense with the aztec motif but like the bird feathers i wondered how theyd obtained the skins and was it legal i knew it wasnt right i dont believe in killing for decoration i wear leather because i eat meat just using the whole animal nothing wasted the man turned and looked at me his eyes were blue his face tanned a pale gold that matched the line of belly fur just before it turned white the moment he looked at me energy danced down my skin like a hot breath a shapeshifter great there was a time not long ago that that much power this close would have drawn an answering energy from me but not this time i sat there staring at him and i was safe behind my shield that squeezed down a layer of energy that stood between me and all the psychic shit i gave him innocent brown eyes and he moved off through the tables as if i was no longer interesting which was fine with me i didnt reach out for it but the energy came here and there from them it would have been so much worse without the shielding they had to be werejaguars or the costumes were like the ultimate false advertising somehow this didnt strike me as a show that promised anything it couldnt deliver the werejaguars picked women from the audience took them by the hand and led them towards the stage a petite blonde was pulled from her seat giggling a short square woman with skin the color of tanned leather was pulled solemnfaced and didnt seem to be nearly as pleased but she let herself be led to the stage a taller more slender hispanic woman was next with long black hair that shimmered as she moved like an ebony curtain she stumbled on the steps and only the werejaguars arm saved her from falling she laughed as he steadied her and i realized she was drunk a figure appeared in front of me blocking my view of the stage i looked up into a dark face framed by snarling jaws the jaguars golden glass eyes rode above the mans face as if the dead animal were staring at me too the man reached a square dark hand out to me i shook my head the hand stayed pale palm up waiting i shook my head again no thanks anyway dallas leaned around edward across the table having to nearly crawl on it to get close to me it stretched her body in a long line her long ponytail pooling on the stone olafs hand hovered over that spill of hair and the look on his face was strange enough to distract me from everything else her voice made me look at her face instead of olafs they need someone your size and body type to round out the brides someone with long hair she was smiling nothing bad is going to happen she gave me a cheerful smile that made her look even younger the man leaned over me and i could smell the fur and him not sweat just his scent and that made my stomach contract made me have to concentrate on holding my shields because the part of me that was tied to richard and his beast wanted to respond wanted to spill outward and wallow in that scent the animal impulses true animal impulses always threw me the mans voice was thickly accented and sounded unsuited to whispering it was a voice for shouting orders do nothing that you do not wish to do but please come to our temple maybe it was the please or the accent or the absolute seriousness in his face but i believed i still might not have gone with him but edward leaned into me and said tourist think tourist he didnt say play along anita remember were undercover because with a shapeshifter this close hed hear anything that was said at the table but edward had said enough i was a tourist a tourist would go i gave the man my left hand and let him pull me to my feet his hand was very warm some lycanthropes seem to adopt their alter egos body temperature even richards skin grew warmer near the full moon but that couldnt be it tonight we were only days away from the dark of the moon as far from the shining fullness that called the beasts as we could get the man was just warm too hot for fur the priest in his feathers encouraged the audience to applaud as the last reluctant bride me joined the grouping around the nearly naked man the werejaguar stood me on the side with the giggling blond the smell of beer was strong enough that i knew the giggling wasnt just nervousness perfect i looked past the man doing my best to ignore him to the two women on the other side the tall one with all the hair was swaying slightly on her spike heels her skirt was leather and the blouse looked like a red camisole the other woman was that solid that some people call fat but it isnt she was square and wore a loose black shirt over black pants she caught my eye and we shared a moment of discomfort audience participation was great as long as the audience wants to participate these are your brides the priest said your reward enjoy them the solid woman and i both took a step back as if it were choreographed the blonde and the tall one with all the hair melted into his arms cuddling and laughing the man played to them but it was their hands that wandered over his body he was very careful where he touched them i thought at first it was just fear of being sued but there was a stiffness a tightening of his body when their hands wandered over his bare buttocks that said he wasnt having as good a time as it looked from the audience youd have never noticed he came away from them with orangered lipstick like a wound on his pale skin and pale pink like a patch of glitter down his face he reached out to us and both of us shook our heads we took another step back and a step closer together solidarity she offered me her hand not to shake but to hold and i realized she was scared not just nervous i was neither just not happy she whispered im ramona i gave her my name and i what seemed to matter more held her hand i felt like mommy on the first day of school when the bullies are waiting the priests voice came you are his last meal his last caress do not deny him ramonas face changed grew soft her hand fell away from mine the fear was gone i called softly ramona but she moved forward as if she never heard me she moved into the mans arms he kissed her with more tenderness than hed shown the other two she kissed him back with a passion and a strength that made anything the other two had done seem pale and watered down the other two women had gone to their knees on either side either because they couldnt stand upright anymore or the better to run their hands over both the man and the new woman it looked like a mild version of a pornographic fourway he drew back from ramona laying a second kiss on her forehead as if she were a child she stayed unmoving eyes closed face slack it was illegal to force anyone to do anything against their will by use of magic i looked at ramonas empty face waiting waiting for what came next all decision all choice washed away if id been myself tonight instead of whoever the hell i was supposed to be id have called them on it i should still turn them in to the cops but truthfully unless they did worse i wasnt going to turn them in if the master of the city could help us solve the mutilation murders if the murders stopped a few mindgames could be overlooked there was a time when i wouldnt have tolerated it when i wouldnt have looked the other way for any reason they say everyone has their price once i thought i was the exception to the rule but if it was a choice of letting this nice woman be made to do some things she didnt want to do or seeing another crime scene another survivor they could have the woman not have in the true sense of the word but to my knowledge mindmagic by a human servant wasnt permanent of course until tonight i hadnt known a human servant could do mindrape i really didnt know how much danger this woman was in and yet and yet i would risk her as long as nothing worse happened if they told her to strip all bets were off i had rules limits they just werent the same ones theyd been four years ago or two years or a year ago the fact that i let them mindrape her and didnt complain bothered me but not enough the blonde woman leaned into the man and bit his butt not hard but enough to make him jump his back was to the audience so i was probably the only one who saw the anger that showed for just a moment in that handsome face the priest stayed on his side of the stage as if he didnt want to distract from the show but i knew hed turned his attention to me the full force was like pressure against my skin his voice a most reluctant bride to leave him lonely in his hour of need i felt his power and now that power was wedded to the words when he said need i felt need my body tightened with it but i could ignore it i knew i could stand there and be unmoved that he could do his worst and i could stand against it but no human could have done it anita blake vamp executioner could stand firm but anita lee undercover partygoer well if i just stood there the game was up at the very least theyd know i wasnt an ordinary tourist times like these are one of the reasons i hate undercover work i ignored the priests rich voice and just walked toward the man he was having trouble keeping the blondes hand out of the front of his gstring the other woman knelt in a pool of her own dark hair hanging on his leg one hand playing with the side strap of the gstring only ramona stood there face blank hands at her sides waiting for orders but the priest was concentrating all his energies on me she was safe until he finished with me the darkhaired woman got the strap to slide over the smooth bone of his hip and the blonde used it as a chance to plunge her hand under the cloth his eyes closed head going back body reacting automatically even as his hand grabbed her hand and tried to pull her hand out of his pants apparently she was hanging on not hurting him exactly but not letting go i doubted the club would have tolerated this level of abuse if the performer had been a woman and the audience member a man some forms of sexist double standards do not work in a mans favor a woman they would have rushed on stage and saved her but he was a man and he was on his own i touched ramonas shoulders and moved her to one side like she was furniture she moved where i put her eyes still closed made me feel worse that she was that pliant but one problem at a time i put my hand on top of his and moved his hand away from the blondes wrist his hand didnt move at first then he looked at me really looked at me his eyes were large a soft pure gray with a circle of black around the iris like someone had used the same eye pencil to trace his eyes that theyd used on the sweep of eyebrow and dark lashes strange eyes but whatever he saw in my eyes seemed to reassure him because he let go of the blonde theres a nerve in the arm about three fingers down from the bend of the elbow if you hit it right its pretty painful i dug my fingers into her flesh as if id find that nerve and drag it to the surface i was pissed and i wanted to hurt her i succeeded she gave a small scream her hand opened and i was able to move her arm back fingers digging into the nerve she didnt struggle just whimpered and stared up at me with large unfocused eyes but the pain was chasing the liquor away if i kept it up long enough i could have sobered her up in oh fifteen minutes or so if she didnt pass out first i spoke low but my voice carried the stage had great acoustics my turn the tall hispanic woman crawled away from the man scuttling in her tight skirt until she fell flat on her face you have to be pretty drunk to fall from a crawling position she got to one elbow and her voice came thick but panicked hes yours i drew the blonde a few steps farther away from the man and slowly let go of her arm i told her stay she cradled her arm against her body huddling over it the look she gave me was not friendly but she didnt mouth off i think she was afraid of me i wasnt having a great night first i let the nice lady be mindraped then i terrorize drunken tourists i would have said how could the night get worse but worse was waiting i looked back at the nearly naked man and didnt know what to do with him i walked back over to him because i couldnt figure a graceful way off stage id probably blown my cover as a tourist but edward had let me bring a gun and knives into the club in fact we were all loaded for bear or vampire or whatever the bouncers unless they were idiots had to have seen some of the weapons i was just not supposed to be a vamp executioner but ive never played victim well i should never have come on stage but too late now the man and i stood facing each other his back still to the audience he leaned into me breath warm against my hair he whispered my hero thank you i nodded and that small movement brushed my thick hair against his face my mouth was dry and it was hard to swallow my heart was suddenly beating too hard too fast as if id been running it was a ridiculous reaction to a strange man i was horribly aware of how close he was how little he was wearing and how my hands just hung at my sides because to move at all would brush against him what was the matter with me i had not been noticing men this badly in st louis was there something in the air in new mexico was it just lack of oxygen from the elevation he rubbed his face against my hair whispered i am cesar that small movement put the curve of his jaw the skin of his neck next to my face there was a trace of the womens perfume mixing along his face overlaying the clean scent of his skin but underneath it all was a sharper scent it was the smell of warmer flesh than human slightly musky so rich it was almost a damp smell as if you could bathe in the scent like water but the water would be hot hot as blood hotter the scent was so strong that i swayed and for a second i could feel the brush of fur against my face like rough piled velvet the sensory memory poured through me and overwhelmed all my careful control the power poured upward in a spill of heat along my skin id managed to cut the direct links to the boys so that i was alone in my own skin but the marks were still there coming to the surface at odd moments like this one shapeshifters always recognize each other their beasts always know and though i had no beast of my own i had a piece of richards that piece reacted to cesar if id been expecting it i might have been able to prevent it but it was too late now it wasnt dangerous just a spill of heat pulsing along my skin a dance of energy that didnt belong to me cesar had jerked back from me as if id burned him then he smiled it was a knowing smile like we shared a secret he wasnt the first shapeshifter to mistake me for one of them to my knowledge i was one of only two humans in the world that had this close a tie to a shapeshifter the other mans tie was to a weretiger not a werewolf but the problems were similar we were both part of a vampires triumvirate and neither of us seemed happy cesars hands went to either side of my face hesitating just above my skin i knew he was feeling the push of that otherworldly energy like a veil that had to be pushed aside to touch except he didnt he spilled his own power into his hands so that he held me in a pulsing shell of warmth it made me close my eyes and he hadnt even touched me yet not with his hands i opened my mouth to tell him not to touch me but as i drew breath to speak his hands touched my face i wasnt ready he pushed his power into mine it hit like a jolt of electricity raising the small hairs on my body tightening places low on my body raising gooseflesh in a wash down my skin the power flowed towards cesar like a flower turning towards the sun i couldnt stop it the best i could do was ride the power instead of letting it ride me he bent his face towards me still cradling my face between his hands i put my own hands on top of his as if i was going to hold on power poured from his mouth as he hovered over my lips the power ran through my body and spilled out of halfparted lips like a hot wind our mouths met and the power flowed into each of us mingling as it brushed like two great cats rubbing furred sides along each others bodies the warmth grew to heat until it almost hurt to stay tied to his lips as if any second now our flesh would burn into each other melting through skin muscle bone until we fell into the center of each other like molten metal cutting through layers of silk the energy had turned sexual as it usually did for me embarrassing but true we drew back from the kiss at the same time blinking at each other like sleepwalkers awakened too early he gave a nervous laugh and leaned into me as if to kiss me again but i put a hand on his chest and held him away i could feel his heart thudding against my palm i could suddenly feel the blood racing in his body my eyes were drawn to the big pulse in his throat i watched that rapid rise and fall in the side of his neck as if it were some sort of jewel something to watch sparkle and glitter in the lights my mouth was suddenly dry and it wasnt sex i actually stepped into him pressed my body down the front of his brought my face close to his neck and that jumping beat of life i wanted to go down on that soft skin sink teeth into his flesh taste what lay beneath i knew with a knowledge that was not mine that his blood would be hotter than a humans not warm but hot a scalding rush of life to warm cold flesh i had to close my eyes turn my head step away with my hands over my eyes i had no direct link to either of the men but i held their power in me richards burning warmth and jeanclaudes cold hunger for a space of heartbeats i had wanted to feed on cesar this when i had walled up the marks boarded them up chained them locked them with everything i had when the marks were open between the three of us the desires that ran through me the things that i thought were too horrible or maybe just too alien not for the first time i wondered what piece of me each of them held in their bodies what dark desire or strange urge did i leave behind if i ever talked to either of them again maybe id ask or then again maybe i wouldnt i felt someone hovering close i shook my head dont touch me let us get back stage then i can apologize it was the priests voice i lowered my hands and found him standing beside me he held out his hand to me i didnt touch him we meant no harm i laid my left hand in his and found his skin quiet there was nothing but human warmth and the solid feel of him he led me towards an area to the far left of the stage cesar was already there with the three other women the werejaguars were there like guards and it seemed to have made the blonde and the one with all the hair brave again they were pawing cesar and he was kissing ramona who was kissing him back with enthusiasm the priest led me towards them and i hung back i whispered i cant i meant that i couldnt touch cesar again so soon i didnt trust myself and i didnt want to have to say it out loud i didnt have to the priest seemed to understand he leaned close please just stand near them no one will touch you i dont know why i believed him but i did i stood near the nearorgy trying not to look as uncomfortable as i felt then a large white screen came down out of the ceiling and before it was solidly in place the priest drew me to one side a woman my size with hair my length appeared and moved towards the miniorgy i watched her join the group and a jaguar dragged the blonde out a woman that matched the blond came to take her place they replaced everyone even cesar with actors who did a shadow orgy against the white screen thrown large for the audience the actresses matched all the women chosen at least for a shadow play which is what dallas had meant when she said they needed someone my size with long hair to complete the brides the actors werent really doing anything but it must have looked awful from the audiences point of view clothes flew and the women were topless i wondered if the shadows looked as topless as the real thing the priest drew me away until we stood in a small curtain area he spoke low but clearly so i guess we could talk without being heard on stage you would never have been chosen if we didnt think you human our deepest apologies i shrugged no harm done he looked at me and there was a weight of knowledge in his eyes that i couldnt lie to you are frightened of what lies inside you and you have not made peace with it that much was true no i havent made peace with it you must accept what you are or you will never know what your true place in the world is your true purpose dont take this wrong but i dont need a lecture tonight he frowned at that and there was a flash of anger he wasnt used to being talked to like that i was betting that everyone was afraid of him maybe i should have been but what fear i had of him or them had vanished when i realized i wanted to take a bite out of cesars neck that scared me more than anything they could do to me tonight all right almost anything they could do tonight never underestimate the creativity of a being that is hundreds of years old most of them know more about pain than we poor humans will ever know unless we are very very unlucky i was either feeling lucky or stupid he made a small motion and the werejaguar that had chosen me came to us he dropped to one knee head bowed the priest said you chose this woman yes pinotl did you not feel her beast his head lowered even more no my lord i did not choose the priest said the kneeling man drew a knife from his belt the handle was turquoise in the shape of a jaguar the blade was about six inches of black obsidian the man held the blade up to the priest who took it as reverently as it had been offered the man undid some hidden catch on the jaguar skin and pushed the hood back so that his head was bare his hair was thick and long tied in a long club at the back of his head he raised a dark face that was so square and chiseled it looked like he could have poised for aztec temple carvings if you were into mesoamericans his profile was perfect he raised his face up to the priest his face was empty of all expression just a calm waiting there was a roar from the audience that made me glance at the actors but i turned back to the priest and the man before id really seen anything i had a glimpse of seminude bodies and an impression of something large and phallic strapped around the man normally that would have made me take a second glance just to make sure i was seeing what i thought id seen but no matter what was happening out there the real show was here it was in the serene upturned face of the man and the serious eyes of the priest the dull gleam of the black blade they could use all the props they wanted no matter how big but it wouldnt come close to the two men and the quiet intensity stretching between them i didnt know exactly what was about to happen but i had an idea he was being punished because hed chosen a lycanthrope from the audience instead of a human but i was human or at least not a lycanthrope i couldnt let him get sliced up not even if it meant admitting who i was could i i touched the priests arm lightly what are you going to do to him the priest looked at me and his eyes seemed like deep caves a trick of shadows punish him my fingers tightened on his arm trying to feel it through the slick softness of feathers i just want to make sure youre not going to slit his throat or something really dramatic what i do with our men is my business not yours the force of his disapproval was strong enough that i took my hand off his arm but i was worried now what he was going to do damn edward and his undercover idea it never worked for me pretending reality always screwed it up the priest laid the blade point against the mans cheek there was no fear in his face nothing but an eerie serenity that made my throat tight and a thrill of fear slide down my spine god i hated zealots and thats what i was seeing wait i said do not interfere the priest said im not a lycanthrope i said lies to save a stranger nothing but contempt in his voice im not lying the priest called cesar he appeared like a welltrained dog coming to his masters call maybe the analogy was unfair but i wasnt feeling particularly charitable right now if i blew our cover had to say who i was i didnt know if i was going to be blowing something that edward had planned by saying who and what i was i didnt know if i was endangering us edward hadnt shared enough of his plans which i would take up with him when the evening was over but my first concern was safety was saving a stranger from being sliced up worth our lives no was keeping a stranger from being killed worth maybe risking our lives probably i had so many unanswered questions and so little real information that i felt like i must be killing brain cells thinking around all the things i didnt know cesar appeared beside me on the far side of me away from the priest i think hed spotted the blade what has he done he picked her out of the audience and did not sense her beast the priest said i dont have a beast i said cesar laughed and it was too loud he covered his mouth with his hand for a moment as if to remind himself we had to be quiet i saw the hunger in your face he said hunger like it should have been in capital letters great more shapeshifter slang that i didnt know i tried to think of a short version that would make sense i made two starts before i finally said there is too much i will sum up i even threw in the bad spanish accent the priests face stayed blank and unhappy he did not get the movie reference cesar choked back another laugh hed probably seen the princess bride the hunger you saw was not from some beast i said the priest gave his full attention to the man kneeling in front of him it was as if id been dismissed he sliced the mans cheek open the thin cut spread and blood welled in liquid lines down the dark skin shit i said he placed the knife against the mans other cheek i grabbed his wrist please listen to me the priest turned his dark eyes to me cesar i am not your cat to call cesar said the priests dark gaze slid from me to the man beside me be careful that what is pretense does not become real cesar it was a threat though i didnt understand exactly what the threat had been but i knew a threat when i heard one cesar moved up beside me she merely wishes to speak my lord pinotl is that so much to ask she also touches me they both stared at my hand on his wrist ill let go if i have your word that you wont cut him until youve heard me out those eyes came back to rest fully on my face and i felt the force of him thundering down on me i could almost feel his skin vibrate under my hand i cant let you bleed him for something that wasnt his fault he never said a word but i felt movement behind me and i knew it wasnt cesar because he turned toward the movement i looked back and found two of the jaguar men coming towards us they were probably not going to hurt me just stop me from interfering i turned back to the priest met his eyes i let go of his wrist i had a few seconds to decide whether to draw a gun or a knife they werent trying to kill me so the least i could do was return the favor i slipped a knife out holding it against my leg trying to he unobtrusive id made the decision to go for the knife and not the gun i hoped it was the right decision one of jaguars was the tanned blueeyed one the other was the first african american id seen in the club his face very contrasting with all the pale spotted fur they advanced on me in a roil of energy a low growl escaped from one of their throats the faintest of threats that one faint sound raised the hair at the back of my neck i backed up putting the kneeling man between me and the two jaguars the priest had laid the obsidian blade against the mans right cheek he hadnt started cutting yet are you just going to cut each cheek is that it will it stop there the blade tip bit into his cheek even in the dark i could see the first liquid drop a faint gleam like a dark jewel if you just want to slice him up a little fine its your business i just dont want to see him mutilated or killed for something he couldnt have sensed the priest sliced the other cheek slower this time i think i was making things worse i asked it out loud of everyone and no one am i making things worse the cheek closest to me began to heal the skin reknitting as i watched i had an idea i stepped closer to the priest and the kneeling man i kept an eye on the two jaguars across from them but they just stood watching theyd backed me off maybe thats all they were supposed to do i touched the kneeling mans chin turned his face towards me the other cheek was completely healed id never seen an obsidian blade used and hadnt been a hundred percent that it didnt act like silver but it didnt shapeshifters healed the damage the priest was still holding the obsidian knife upright in his hand the audience broke into thunderous applause the sound rising like thunder through the small backstage area the actors were pouring away from the white screen the act was almost over everyone had turned at the noise and the movement even the priest i put my finger against the tip of the obsidian knife and pressed the tip was like glass the pain sharp and immediate i drew back with a hiss what have you done the priest demanded and his voice was too loud it must have carried out into the crowd i spoke lower i wont heal not as fast as he did itll prove that im not a lycanthrope the priests anger filled the air like something hot and touchable you do not understand if someone would talk to me instead of hugging their secrets so damn close i wouldnt be blundering into things the priest handed the blade back to the kneeling man he took the knife and bowed his forehead to it then he licked the blade carefully around the sharp edges until he came to the point and my blood then he slid the tip between his lips into his mouth sucking it down like a woman taking a man into her mouth his mouth worked around the blade and i knew it was cutting him as he swallowed it i knew it was cutting him up but he made it look as if it were something wonderful orgasmic as if he were having a very good time he watched me as he did it and his eyes werent serene anymore they had filled with heat it was the same heat you could see in any mans eyes when was thinking about sex but not when the man was sucking on a glass sharp blade cutting his mouth tongue throat drinking his own blood with a taste of my blood as a chaser someone grabbed my hand and i jumped it was cesar we must be on stage you must take your seat he was watching the kneeling man all the men carefully he eased me around the group of them and all eyes followed like i was some wounded gazelle the other three women were already in place standing behind the now dim white screen theyd taken off some clothing the giggling blonde was down to pale blue bra and panties still laughing her head off the hispanic had taken off her skirt and was down to a pair of crimson panties that matched the red camisole she was still wearing shed kept the matching red high heels she and the blonde were leaning against each other swaying and laughing ramona wasnt laughing she still stood quietly unmoved and unmoving the priests voice came from backstage disrobe for our audience his voice was soft but ramona grabbed the bottom of her shirt and lifted her bra was an ordinary bra white and simple it wasnt meant to be lingerie and i doubted shed planned on anyone seeing it tonight she let her shirt fall to the floor her hands went to the top button of her pants i pulled away from cesar and grabbed ramonas hands no dont her hands went slack in mine as if even that small interference had broken the spell but she didnt look at me she didnt see what was in front of her just the internal landscape that i couldnt see i picked her shirt back up and placed her hands over it she clutched it automatically covering most of the front of her cesar took my arm the screen is going up there is no time the screen began to slowly lift you cant be the only one dressed he said he tried to slide the jacket from my shoulders and bared the shoulder holster well scare the audience i said the screen was to our knees he grabbed the front of my shirt jerking it out of my pants baring my stomach he dropped to his knees and was licking my stomach as the screen came up completely i tried to grab a handful of hair to pull him off me but there wasnt enough hair to grab the hair was much softer than it looked much softer than my hair would have been if you shaved it to stubble his teeth bit gently into my skin and i put my hand under his chin raising his face so that he either had to take his teeth out of my skin or bite deeper he let go let me raise his face to stare upward at me there was a look in his eyes that i couldnt read but it was something large and more complex than you see in a strangers eyes complex i didnt need tonight he was on his feet in a movement so liquid and graceful that i knew that edward would spot him for what he was not human he went to the one with all the hair first giving her a tonsilcleaning kiss as if hed crawl into her from the mouth down then he spun her like a dance move and jaguar men were there to escort her and her arm full of clothes back to her table the blonde was next she kissed him running pale nails down his back she gave a little jump and wrapped her legs around his waist forcing him to hold her weight or fall the kiss was long but she was in control of it cesar walked her to the edge of the stage still clinging to his body like a limpet the jaguar men pried her away from his body one pale limb at a time until they had to carry her above their heads while she struggled and then finally went limp laughing as they carried her back to her table ramona seemed to wake up she blinked around her as if shed woken and wasnt sure where she thought she should be she stared down at her blouse clutched to the front of her and screamed cesar tried to help her on with her blouse and she slapped at him i went to her trying to help her but she seemed afraid of me too now as if her panic had spread to include all of us the jaguar men tried to help her off stage and she fell trying to keep them from touching her it was finally a man from her table who came and escorted her out of the lights out of the ring of strangers she was crying and speaking softly in spanish as he led her back to the table i would have to talk to someone about her i couldnt leave town without knowing that the mind tricks werent permanent if it had been a vampire with a one on one call like that he could have called her any time any night and she would answer his call she would have no choice cesar stood in front of me he raised my hand i think to kiss it but it was the hand that id cut to prove i wouldnt heal not that anyone had cared cesar raised my hand and stared at the small wound in the tip of my finger it was a small cut and didnt bleed much but it wasnt healing either if id been a lycanthrope the small prick would have closed up and healed by now he looked at me over the still bleeding finger what are you he whispered long story i whispered back he kissed the wound like a mother with a childs scrape then his mouth slid over my finger down to my hand he drew it slowly back out fresh blood welled to the tip of my finger bright and sparkling under the lights his tongue flicked out rolling the drop of blood into his mouth he leaned close as if to kiss me but i shook my head and moved towards the steps that would lead me off the stage and away from him the jaguar men were there to help me off the stage but i looked at them and they backed off letting me walk down the steps by myself edward held my chair for me and i let him food had been served while i was on stage edward handed me a linen napkin i wrapped it around my finger holding pressure to it dallas actually got up from her chair and came to talk to me hanging over the back of my chair what happened back there ive been a volunteer before and ive never seen anyone hurt i looked up at her her face close in the dimness all serious and concern if you think no one gets hurt then you havent been paying attention she frowned looking puzzled i shook my head it was too late and i was suddenly too tired to try and explain i cut myself shaving she frowned harder but also got the point that i didnt want to talk i sat back down leaving me to edward he leaned into me laying his mouth against my ear and whispering so low it was like he was breathing into my ear he knew how good a shapeshifters hearing was not to mention vamps do they know who you are i turned putting my mouth against his ear having to raise on one knee in my seat putting my body in a line against his it looked intimate but it allowed me to whisper to him in a voice so low i wasnt sure he would hear no but they know im not human not a tourist i put my arm across his shoulders one hand on his shoulder holding him because i didnt want him to move away i wanted the next question answered what are you planning he turned to me a look on his face that was far too intimate too teasing for the conversation he leaned into me mouth pressed so close to my ear that it must have looked to the others like he had his tongue down it no plan just thought you being you might scare the monsters from talking to us it was my turn to whisper no plan you promise would i lie to you i jerked back from him and slugged him in the shoulder not hard but he got my point would edward lie to me would the sun rise tomorrow yes to both the actors that had taken our places were finally on stage in robes the priest in his feathers was introducing them getting the applause they deserved was glad they ruined the effect and didnt leave poor ramona convinced shed done terrible things i was actually surprised that theyd spoiled the trick like a magician revealing his secrets well allow you to eat before the next and last act of our show the lights came up and we all turned to our meals id thought the meat was beef but when i put the first bite in my mouth the texture told me i was wrong the waitress had brought me an extra napkin and i used that to spit the bite into whats wrong bernardo asked he was eating the meat and enjoying himself i dont eat veal i said i took a forkful of an unrecognizable vegetable then realized it was sweet potatoes i didnt recognize the spices in them of course cooking wasnt exactly my area of expertise everyone was eating the meat except me and strangely edward hed taken a bite but then he concentrated on the flat bread and the vegetables too you dont eat veal either ted olaf asked he put another bite in his mouth and chewed slowly as if trying to draw every ounce of flavor no edward said i know its not moral indignation about the poor little calves i said and you worry about the poor little calves edward said he gave me a long look as he asked i couldnt read his eyes but they werent blank i just couldnt read them what else was new i dont approve of the treatment of the animals no but truthfully i just dont like the texture dallas was watching us all as if we were doing something a lot more interesting than discussing meat you dont like the texture of veal i shook my head no i dont olaf had turned to the other woman he took his latest bite of meat and offered it to her on the end of his fork you like veal she got a strange little smile on her face i eat veal here almost every night she didnt take his bite that he offered but took another bite from her own fork i felt like i was missing something but before i could ask the lights went down again the final act was about to begin if i was still hungry surely thered be something open on the way home there usually was the lights went down until the room was left in darkness a dim spot light cut the darkness the light was only a faint white gleam when it finally stopped at the far far end of the darkened room a figure stepped into that pale gleam a crown of brilliant red and yellow feathers was bent towards the light a cloak of smaller feathers covered the figure from neck to the edge of the light the crown raised revealing a pale face it was cesar he turned his face to one side giving profile and showing that he had earrings going from lobe to halfway up the edge of his ear gold glittered as he moved his head and the light grew stronger he lifted something in his hands and a note of music filled the near dark a thin trilling note like a flute but not the song was beautiful but eerie as if something lovely were crying a jaguar man lifted off the feathered cloak and vanished into the darkness a heavy gold collar lay across his shoulders and chest if it were real it was a fortune in precious metal hands came from either side of the dark ness appearing in the light taking the feathered crown without ever showing themselves cesar walked slowly and halfway up the room i could see what he was playing it looked like a panpipe but not exactly the song cut through the darkness crawled through it one moment uplifting the next mournful it looked like he was truly playing it and if so it was impressive jaguar men stripped him of everything he was carrying a small shield a strange stick that looked sort of like a bow but not a bag of short arrows or something like them he was close enough now that i could see the jade decoration that he wore in front of his kilt though i knew it wasnt a kilt but skirt wasnt right either the front was covered in feathers the rest some rich cloth more hands came into the light to undo the garment and take it and the jade away they were close enough now that the darkness and light couldnt hide that the hands belonged to the jaguars they stripped him down to the fleshcolored gstring hed worn before or one like it the song rose into the dimness as he neared the last few rows of tables you could almost see the notes rising upward like birds i dont usually wax poetic about music but this was different somehow you knew it wasnt just a song just something to listen to and forget or hum in odd moments when you think of ritual music you think of drums something with a beat to remind us of our hearts and the ebb and flow of our bodies but not all ritual is made to remind us of our bodies some of its made to remind us of why the ritual is happening all ritual at its heart is for the sake of divinity all right not all but most most of it is us yelling hey god look at me look at us hope you like it we are all just children at heart hoping dad or mom likes the present picked out of course sometimes mom and dad can have quite a temper cesar let the flute or pipes hang from a thong around his neck he knelt and removed his own sandals then handed them to a woman at the nearest table there was a shifting in the dimness as if she wasnt sure she wanted them maybe after the earlier show she was afraid to take them couldnt really blame her on that one he stopped at the table just behind that one and spoke quietly to another woman she stood and removed one of the gold earrings from his ear then he went from table to table and let sometimes men but mostly women take the last of his decoration from his body which probably explained why the earrings were the least expensive least authentic pieces hed been wearing except for the last earrings a medium sized jade ball set in each earlobe but it was the figurines that dangled beneath moving as his head moved swaying as he walked that made the earrings special each figure was nearly three inches high brushing his shoulders like the hair he did not have as he got closer you could see the green stone was intricately carved into one of those squat deities the aztecs were so fond of he stopped at our table and i was surprised because hed carefully ignored the other brides on this walk he raised me to my feet with one hand in mine then turned his head so i could reach the earring i didnt want to stop the show but they were too expensive a gift to accept unless they were fake the moment i touched the cool stone i knew it was real jade it was too heavy too smooth to be anything else i dont wear earrings and ive never had pierced ears so i was left feeling the back of his ear in the near dark trying to figure out how to undo the earring he finally reached up and helped me hands doing quickly and almost gracefully what id been fumbling at by watching him i realized that they unscrewed and when he turned his head i was able to get the second one out myself i knew enough about jewelry to know that the screws were modern it was real jade real gold but it wasnt an antique or at least the clasps were modern the stones rested heavy and very solid in my hands he leaned over and whispered breath warm against my cheek i will get them back from you after the performance dont interfere he laid a gentle kiss on my cheek and walked to the bottom step he took the flute from around his neck and broke off one of the many reeds scattering it on the step i sat back down the jade gripped in my hands i leaned into edward whats about to happen he shook his head ive never seen this particular show i looked across the table at professor dallas i wanted to ask her what was going on but she had all her attention on the stage cesar had broken part of the flute on every step as he walked up them four jaguar men were waiting at the top grouped around a small roundish stone the priest was there too but without the cape he was even broader through the shoulders than hed seemed and though not tall you got the impression of sheer strength sheer physicality he seemed more warrior than priest cesar had made it to the top of the temple the four jaguar men grabbed him by wrist and ankle lifting him over their heads steadying his body with their hands they paced the stage with him held above their heads showing him to the four corners of the stage even the one that faced away from the audience then they brought him to the small round stone and laid his body across it so that his head and shoulders leaned back and the lowest part of his chest and upper stomach were curved over the stone i was on my feet before i saw the obsidian blade in the priests hand edward grabbed my arm look to your left he said i glanced and found two of the jaguar men waiting if i made a run for the stage i bet theyd try and stop me cesar had said that hed come for the earrings after the performance which implied hed be alive to do it hed warned me not to interfere but dammit they were going to cut him up i knew that now what i didnt know was how badly they were going to cut him up dallas had gotten up from her seat and was at my other arm whispering its part of the show cesar plays sacrifice twice a month not always this exact sacrifice but its part of his job she spoke low and soothingly like you talked to a crazy person on a ledge i let her and edward ease me back into my seat i was gripping the jade earrings so hard the edges dug into my hands dallas knelt beside me keeping a hand on my arm but she watched the stage the jaguar men held him and you could see their grip tighten sec them take in their collective breaths cesars face showed nothing not fear not anticipation just waiting for it the priest drove the blade into the flesh just below the ribs cesars body jerked in reaction but he didnt cry out the blade tore across him digging into the meat widening the hole his body danced with the wound but he never made a sound blood poured across cesars pale skin bright and almost unreal under the lights the priest reached his hand into the wound nearly up to his elbow and cesar cried out i grabbed dallass arm he cant survive without his heart not even a shapeshifter can survive that they wont take his heart i swear it she stroked my hand where it gripped her like youd soothe a nervous dog i leaned in close to her and whispered if they take his heart when i could have stopped it ill have your heart on a knife before i leave new mexico you still willing to swear her eyes had gone wide i think she was holding her breath but she nodded i swear it the funny thing was that she believed the threat instantly most people you tell them youre going to cut their heart out and they wont believe you people believe youll kill them but get too graphic and they take it like a joke or an exaggeration professor dallas believed me you could see it in her face most college professors wouldnt have made me wonder about dallas more than i already did the priests voice came into the utter silence that had filled the room i hold his heart in my hand in the long gone days we would have torn it from his chest but those days are gone and you heard felt the regret in his words we worship as we can not as we would he slid his hand out slowly and i was close enough to hear the wet fleshy sound as his hand pulled out of the wound he raised a hand covered in blood above his head and the audience cheered they cheered they fucking cheered the jaguar men lifted cesar from the altar and tossed him down the steps he tumbled bonelessly coming to rest on the floor directly in front of the steps he lay on his back gasping fighting to breathe and i wondered if the priest had damaged a lung or two when he went fishing for the heart i just sat there staring at him he did this twice a month it was part of his job shit not only didnt i understand it i didnt want to if he was into pain and death i didnt need to know anything else about him i was eyeball deep in sadomasochistic wereleopards back home i didnt need another one the priest was talking but i didnt hear him i didnt hear anything but a great roaring like white noise in my ears i watched the wereleopard twitch body jerking blood pouring down his sides across the floor but even as i stared the blood was slowing it was hard to tell through all the blood and torn flesh but i knew he was healing two of the human bouncers came and picked him up one taking his ankles the other lifting under his arms they carried him through the tables past us i stood stopping them dallas stood with me as if afraid of what id do i stared into cesars eyes there was real pain there he wasnt having a good time or didnt seem to be but you dont do shit like this on a regular basis unless you enjoy it on some level his hands were lying on his chest as if he were trying to hold himself together i pried one hand up the skin was slick with blood i pressed the jade earrings into his hand closed his fingers around them he whispered something but i didnt bend down to hear dont ever come near me again i sat back down and they carried him away i started to reach for a napkin to wipe my hands but dallas grabbed my arm shes ready to see you now i hadnt seen anyone talk to her but i wasnt questioning it if she said it was time fine we could meet the master of the city and get the hell out of here i started to reach for the napkin again but she moved it out of reach it is fitting that you meet her with the blood of sacrifice on your hands i looked at her and grabbed the napkin out of her hands she actually struggled to keep it and we had a little tug of war before i jerked it away from her but a woman appeared at my elbow she wore a redhooded cloak and came up only to my shoulder but even before she turned her head so i could see the face that lay inside that cloak i knew what she was itzpapalotl obsidian butterfly master of the city and selfproclaimed goddess i hadnt felt her coming i hadnt heard her or sensed her she just appeared beside me like magic it had been a long time since a vampire had been able to do that i think i stopped breathing for a second or two as i met her eyes her face was as delicate as the rest of her her skin a milkpale brown her eyes were black not just brown but truly black like the obsidian blade she was named for most master vamps eyes are like drowning pools things to fall into and be trapped but her eyes were like solid black mirrors reflecting back not something to fall into but something to show you the truth i saw myself in those eyes a miniature reflection perfect in every detail like a black cameo then the image split doubling tripling my face stayed in the center with a wolfs head on one side and a skull on the other as i watched the three images grew closer until the wolf and skull were superimposed over my face and for a split second i couldnt tell where one image left off and the others began one image floated above the rest the skull rose above the first two spilling upward through the blackness filling her eyes until the skull filled my vision and i was able to stumble back nearly falling edward was there catching me dallas had moved to stand beside the vampire bernardo and olaf were at edwards back and i knew in that instant that if hed given the word theyd have both drawn guns and fired it was a comforting thought suicidal but comforting because i could feel her people now which meant she had to have been blocking me hiding them i felt the vampires underneath the building around it through it there were hundreds of them and most of them were old hundreds of years old and obsidian butterfly i glanced at her but was careful not to meet her eyes this time it had been years since id had to avoid a vampires eyes id forgotten how hard it is to look someone in the face without making eye contact like some elaborate game them trying to catch my glance and bespell me me trying to keep away she had a fall of straight black bangs but the rest of her hair was pulled back from her face to reveal delicate ears set with jade ear spools she was a delicate thing petite even standing next to me and professor dallas but i wasnt fooled by the packaging what lay inside was a vampire not that old i doubted she was a thousand years yet id met older much older but id never met any vampire under a thousand that echoed in my head with the power that this one did power breathed off her skin like a nearly visible cloud and id learned enough of vampires to know that the echo of power wasnt on purpose some of the masters with special abilities like causing fear or lust just gave off that power constantly like steam rising from a pot it was involuntary partially at least but id never met one that leaked power pure power edward was talking to me probably had been talking to me for a while i just hadnt heard anita anita are you all right i felt the press of a gun not pointed at my back but drawn using my body to shield it from the room things could get ugly really fast im all right but my voice didnt sound all right it sounded hollow and distant like i was in shock maybe i was a little she hadnt exactly rolled my mind but she knew things about me in that first contact that most vampires never figured out i realized suddenly that she knew what kind of power i was that was her gift to be able to read power her voice when it came was heavily accented and much deeper than that fragile throat should have held as if the voice was an echo of that immense power whose servant are you she knew i was a vampires human servant but not whose servant i was i liked that made me feel better she read only power not details unless of course she was only pretending not to know but somehow i didnt think shed pretend ignorance no this was one that liked showing off her knowledge she breathed arrogance as she breathed power but why not be arrogant she was after all a goddess selfproclaimed anyway youd have to be either absolutely arrogant or crazy to claim godhood jeanclaude master of the city of st louis she cocked her head to one side as if listening to something then you are the executioner you did not give your true name at the door not all vampires will talk to me if they know who i am what is it you wish to speak with me about the mutilation murders again she turned her head to one side as if listening ah yes she blinked and looked up at me the price for an audience is what lies on your hands i must have looked as puzzled as i felt because she elaborated the blood cesars blood i wish to take it from you how i asked just call me suspicious she simply turned and started walking away her voice came like the sound to a badly dubbed film sound long after it should have been heard follow me and do not clean your hands i glanced at edward do you trust her i asked he shook his head me either i said are we going or staying olaf asked i vote for going bernardo said i hadnt really looked at him since the sacrifice began he was looking a little pale olaf wasnt olaf looked fresh and brighteyed as if he were enjoying the evening dallas said it would be a grave insult if you refuse her invitation she rarely gives personal interviews voluntarily you must have impressed her i didnt impress her i attracted her i said dallas frowned attracted her she likes men i shook my head she may have sex with men but what attracts her is power professor she looked at me searching my face you have that kind of power i sighed well find out wont we i started walking in the direction that the cloaked figure had gone she hadnt waited for us to decide shed just walked away like i said arrogant of course we were about to follow her into her private lair that was arrogance too or stupidity arrogance or stupidity sometimes theres not much difference between the two i didnt know where to go but dallas did she led us to a small door set to one side of the temple steps hidden by curtains the door was still open like a black mouth steps led down where else just once id like to see a vamp whose major hideout was up instead of down dallas walked down the steps with a spring in her step and a song in her heart her ponytail bounced as she skipped down the steps if she had a single misgiving about going down into that darkness it didnt show dallas confused me on one hand she didnt see that olaf was dangerous and she wasnt afraid of any of the monsters in the club on the other hand shed believed me when i told her id cut her heart out id seen it in her eyes how could she believe that threat from a total stranger and not see the other dangers didnt make sense to me and i didnt like what i didnt understand she seemed utterly harmless but her reactions were weird so i put a question mark by her which meant i wouldnt be turning my back on her or treating her like a civilian until i was convinced that that was what she was i was going too slowly for olaf he pushed past me and followed dallass bouncing ponytail down the stairs he had to stoop to keep from bumping his head on the ceiling but he didnt seem to mind fine with me let him take the first bullet but i followed them down into the dark no one had offered me violence not really not yet so it seemed rude to have a gun naked in my hand but id apologize later unless i knew the vampire personally i liked having a loaded gun in hand the first time i paid a call or maybe it was the narrow stairs the close press of stone as if it would close around us like a fist and crush us have i mentioned that im claustrophobic the stairs didnt go down very far and there was no door at the end of them jeanclaudes retreat in st louis was something of an underground fortress the barely hidden doorway the short stairs no second door arrogance again olaf blocked my view of dallas but i saw him reach the dimly lit doorway at the bottom he had to stoop even further to get through the door and hesitated before standing up on the other side there was a sense of movement around him or rather to either side of him quick almost not there like things you see out of the comer of your eyes it reminded me of the hands that had stripped cesar as he walked between light and darkness he stayed just in the doorway his body nearly filling it completely blocking what little light there had been i caught the faintest edge of dallas she led him away from the door further into the firelit dark i called down olaf are you okay no answer edward tried olaf i am fine i glanced back at edward we had a moment of staring into each others eyes both of us thinking the same thing this could be a trap maybe she was behind the murders maybe she just wanted to kill the executioner or maybe she was a centuriesold vampire and she just wanted to hurt us for the hell of it could she make olaf lie you mean mind tricks i asked he nodded not this fast i may not like him but hes stronger than that i looked at him searching his face in the dim light could they force him to lie you mean a knife at his throat edward said yeah he gave a faint smile no not this quick not ever youre sure of that i asked my life on it were betting all our lives on it he nodded yes we are but if edward said that olaf wouldnt sell us out on fear of death or pain then i believed him edward didnt always understand why people did what they did but he was usually right about the fact that they were going to do it motive evaded him but he was seldom wrong so i kept walking down the steps i strained my peripheral vision trying to see on either side of the doorway as i walked through it i didnt have to bend over to go through the room was square and small maybe sixteen by sixteen it was also packed nearly corner to corner with vampires i put my back against the wall to the right of the door gun clutched twohanded pointed at the ceiling i wanted badly to point it at someone anyone my shoulders ached with the tension of not doing it no one was threatening me no one was doing a damn thing except standing staring milling around the way people do so why did i feel like i should have entered the room shooting tall vampires short vampires thin vampires fat vampires every size every shape and almost every race moved around that small stone room after what had happened upstairs with their master i was careful not to make eye contact with any of them my gaze swept over the room taking in the pale faces and getting a quick head count when i got over sixty i realized the room was at least twice the size id originally thought it had to be just to hold this many of them it only looked small because it was packed so tight the torchlight added to the illusion flickering dancing uncertain light edward stayed in the doorway his back to the doorframe shoulder touching mine lightly his gun was up like mine his eyes searching the vamps whats wrong whats wrong look at them my voice was breathy not because i was trying to whisper that would have been useless but because my throat was tight my mouth dry he scanned the crowd again so my gaze flashed to him then back to the waiting vampires shit ed ted shit it wasnt just the number of them it was my own ability to sense them that was the problem id been around a hundred vamps before but they hadnt affected me like this i didnt know if having walled off my link to jeanclaude made me more vulnerable to them or if my necromancy had grown since then or maybe itzpapalotl was just that much more powerful than the other master had been maybe it was her power that had made them so much more than most vamps there were close to a hundred in this room i was getting impressions from all of them or most of them my shields were great now i could keep out a lot of the preternatural stuff but this was too much for me if i had to guess there wasnt a vamp in the room under a hundred i got flashes from individual ones if i looked at them too long a slap in the face of their age their power the four females in the right corner were all over five hundred years old they watched me with dark eyes darkskinned but not as dark as they would have been with a little sun the four of them watched me with patient empty faces her voice came from the center of the room but she was hidden behind the vampires shielded by them i have offered you no violence yet you have drawn weapons you seek my aid yet you threaten me its not personal itz i stumbled over her name you may call me obsidian butterfly it was odd talking to her without being able to glimpse her through the waiting figures its not personal obsidian butterfly i just know that once i put up the gun chances of drawing it again before one of your brood rips my throat out is damn small you mistrust us she said as you mistrust us i said she laughed then her laughter was the sound of a young woman normal but the strained echoes from the other vampires were anything but normal the laughter held a wild note to it a desperation as if they were afraid not to laugh i wondered what the penalty was for not following her lead the laughter faded away except for one high pitched masculine sound the other vampires went still that impossible stillness where they seem like wellmade statues things made of stone and paint not real not alive they waited like a host of empty things waited for what the only sound was that high unhealthy laughter rising up and up like the sounds the movies have you hear in insane asylums or mad scientists laboratories the sound raised the hair on my arms and it wasnt magic it was just creepy if you put up your guns i will send most of my people away that is fair is it not it was fair but i didnt like it i liked having the gun naked in my hands of course the gun only worked if shooting a few of them would stop the rest from rushing us and it wouldnt if she said go to hell theyd start digging a hole if she told them to rush us they most certainly would so the guns were just a security blanket a delaying tactic before the end it took only a few seconds to think it through but that awful laughter kept going like it was one of those creepy dolls with a laugh track inside of it i felt edwards shoulder pressing against mine he was waiting for me to give the answer trusting my expertise i hoped i didnt get us killed i put the gun back in its holster i rubbed my hand against my leg id been holding the gun too long and too damn tight me nervous edward put his gun up bernardo was still in the stairway and i realized that he was making sure nothing came down the stairs and blocked our retreat it was kind of nice working with more than just two people and knowing everyone on your side was willing to shoot anything that moved no bleeding hearts no empathy just business of course olaf was off to one side with dallas he had never pulled a gun he had waded into this many vampires following her bouncing ponytail to destruction or at least to potential destruction the vampires drew a breath each chest rising as one as if they were many bodies with one mind life for lack of a better term flowed back into them some of them looked almost human but many of them were pale and starved and weak their faces were too thin as if the bones of their skull would push out through the sickly skin they were all pale but the natural skin color of many was darker than caucasian so even pale they werent the ghostly paleness i was used to seeing i realized with something like shock that most of the vampires i knew were caucasian here white skin was the minority a nice reversal the vampires began to glide towards the door or some of them glided some of them shuffled as if they didnt have energy to pick their feet up as if they were truly ill to my knowledge vampires couldnt catch any disease but these vampires looked sick one of them stumbled and fell at my feet landing heavily on hands and knees he stayed where he was head hanging down his skin was a dirty white like snow that had lain too long by a busy road a greyish white the other vampires moved around him as if he were a bump in the road they flowed past him and he didnt seem to notice his hands looked like the hands of a skeleton barely covered with skin his hair was a blond so light it looked white hanging down around his face he raised his face up slowly and it was like looking at a skull his eyes had sunk so far into his head that they seemed to burn at the end of long black tunnels i wasnt afraid of looking in this ones eyes he didnt have enough juice to roll me with his eyes i could tell that just standing here the bones of his cheeks pushed so hard against the thin skin that it looked like they should tear through a pale tongue slid from between thin nearly invisible lips his eyes were a pale pale green like bad emeralds the thin walls of his nose flared as if he were scenting the air he probably was vamps didnt rely on scent the way shapeshifters did but they had a much better sense of smell than humans he closed his eyes in the middle of drawing a deep breath he shuddered and seemed to swoon faint id never seen a vamp act like this it caught me off guard and that was my fault i saw him tense and my hand was going for the browning but there was no time he was less than a foot away i never even touched the gun before he slammed into me he knocked the breath from my body his hand was on my face turning my head to one side baring my neck before i had time to breathe i had a sense of movement even though i couldnt see him i felt his body tense and i knew he was coming in for a strike he made no effort to control my hands i kept going for the gun but i would never get it out and pointed in time he was going to sink fang into my neck and i couldnt stop it it was like a car accident i just had time to see it coming and to think i cant stop it there wasnt even time to be afraid something jerked the vampire backwards his hand curled in my jacket and didnt let go his desperate grip nearly pulled me off my feet but i got the gun out before i worried about staying on my feet a large very azteclooking vamp had the skeletal vamp holding him pinned against his body only that one arm with its clutching hand not pressed to the larger mans body edward had his gun out pointed at the vampires hed gotten to his gun first but then he hadnt been shoved up against a wall and manhandled or would that be vampirehandled the big vamp jerked the thin one hard enough that he nearly pulled me off my feet but that one clutching hand stayed curled in my jacket catching on the shirt underneath i had the browning pointed at the vamps chest though i wasnt sure if the hornady ammo was safe to shoot at arms distance into one target pressed directly in front of another person i wasnt sure if the ammo would go through the first vamp and into the second the second vamp had saved me it really wouldnt be nice to blow a hole in him the other vampires were leaving the room in a hurrying line to get past us and up the stairs out of harms way cowards but it was thinning out the ranks which would be great eventually id care that there werent so damn many vamps in the room but right now the world was narrowed down to the vamp that had hold of me first things first the big vamp kept backing up trying to get the skeletal one to let go of me we kept moving further into the room edward paced us gun held twohanded pointed at the vampires head i finally put the barrel of my gun underneath the vamps chin i could blow his brains up without hitting the second vampire obsidian butterflys voice slashed through the room like a whip the sound made me wince shoulders tightening as if it had been a blow these are my guests how dare you attack them the skeletal vampire started to cry and his tears were clear human vampires tears are tinged red they cry bloody tears please please let me feed please you feed as we all feed as befits a god please please mistress please you disgrace me before our visitors then she spoke low and rapidly in a language that was sort of spanish sounding but it wasnt spanish i dont speak spanish but ive heard it spoken often enough to know it when i hear it and this wasnt it whatever she was saying upset both vampires the big one pulled so hard that he finally jerked me off my feet because the other vamp was still holding on i ended up on my knees my jacket and shirt dangling from the vamps hand one arm pulled up at an awkward angle my gun was pressed into his stomach now and again i wondered if at point blank range the new ammo would kill both vamps it was a miracle that i hadnt accidentally shot his head off edward was still there gun pointed at the vamps head the first hint i had that something else had gone wrong was a faint glow the glow grew into something pure and white my cross had spilled out of my shirt the vampire kept his grip on me but started to scream in a high pitiful voice the cross flared bright and brighter until i had to turn my head and shield my eyes it was like having magnesium burning around your neck so bright it only got this bright when something very bad was near i didnt think the something bad was the thing still hanging onto me i was betting the cross was glowing for her benefit maybe others but mostly hers a lot of things in the room could kill me but nothing else in the room was worth this much of a light show let him go to his destiny she said i felt the arm that was still pulling so desperately go limp i felt him kneeling felt it through the barrel of the gun still pressed against him edward said anita it was a question but i didnt have an answer yet i blinked past the light trying to see the vampire put a hand on either side of my shoulders his eyes were squeezed shut against the light his face stretched wide with pain the white light glistened on fangs as he moved in to feed stop or die i said im not sure he even heard me his hand caressed the edge of my cheek and it was like being touched by fleshy sticks his hands didnt even feel real i yelled ill kill him do so its his choice her voice was so matter of fact so uncaring that it made me not want to do it his hand grabbed my hair tried to twist my face to one side his head was drawn back for a strike but he couldnt push past the glare of the cross but he might work up to it as weak as he was he should have run screaming from this much holy light anita edwards voice and it wasnt a question now more a preview the vampire let out a scream that made me gasp his head threw back then down and his face moved in a white blur towards me the gun went off before i realized id squeezed the trigger just a reflex a second gun echoed so close on my shot that it sounded like a single gunshot the vamp jerked and his head exploded blood and thicker things sprayed half my face i knelt in a sudden deafening silence there was no sound nothing but a line distant ringing in my ears like tinny bells i turned in a sort of slow motion to see the vamps body sprawled on its side i got to my feet and still couldnt hear anything sometimes thats shock sometimes its just gunshots going off next to your ears i scraped at the blood and thicker pieces on the left side of my face edward handed me a white handkerchief probably something ted would carry but i took it i started trying to scrape the stuff off of me the cross was still glowing like a captive star i was already deaf if i didnt stop having to squint around the light i was going to be blind as well i looked around the room most of the vamps had fled up the stairs away from the crosss glow but what was left huddled around their goddess shielding her i think from us i blinked through the glare and i think i saw fear on one or two faces you dont see that often on several hundred years worth of vampire it might have been the cross but i didnt think that was it i slipped the cross back into my shirt the cross was still cool silver it never burned unless vampire flesh touched it then it would flare into actual flame and burn the vamp and any human flesh that happened to be touching it at the same time usually the vamp would jerk away before you got past second degree burns so id never gotten a scar from one of my own crosses the vampires stayed in front of their mistress and the fear was still there on at least one face the cross could keep them at bay but that wasnt what they feared i looked down at the body the entrance hole was just a small red thing with black scorch marks around it but the exit hole was nearly a foot in diameter there was no head on the body only the lower jaw and a thin rim of back brain left the rest had been blown in a wide spray across the floor and across me edwards mouth was moving and sound came back in a kind of doppler shift so that i heard only the end of it ammo are you using now i told him he knelt by the body and inspected the chest wound i thought the hornady xtp wasnt supposed to make this much of a mess going out his voice still sounded like it was distant tinny but i could hear again it meant that my hearing would go back to normal eventually i dont think they did any firing tests at point blank range it makes a nice hole at point blank range in like a penny out like a pizza i said you had questions about the murders obsidian butterfly said ask them she was standing in the middle of her people but no longer shielded i dont know if she decided we werent going to shoot her or if she thought it was cowardice to hide behind others or if wed passed some kind of test but if she were willing to answer my questions then id take it any way i could get it i saw dallas and olaf to one side of the vamps dallas had her face hidden against his chest and he was holding her comforting her helping her not see the mess on the floor olaf was looking down at her as if she were something precious it wasnt love more the way a man will look at a really nice car that he wants to own he looked at her like she was a pretty thing that hed wanted but hadnt expected to get he stroked her hair running his fingers through the long dark ponytail over and over playing with her hair watching it fall against her back i wasnt the only one watching them cruz take the professor upstairs i think shes seen enough for one night a short male vamp very hispanic went to them but olaf said ill take her upstairs no edward said i dont think so i said itzpapalotl said that will not be necessary the three of us exchanged a glance though i didnt meet her eyes dead on but there was an understanding between us i think olaf needed to stay away from the professor maybe a state or two away from her cruz pulled dallas out of olafs reluctant arms and led the crying woman up the stairs and away from the horror wed stretched out on the floor though we hadnt made the vampire a horror we just killed him itzpapalotl had starved him until he faced a glowing cross for the chance to feed starved him until hed let two humans point guns at him and not even try to get away hed wanted to sink fangs into human flesh more than hed wanted to live i dont usually feel sorry for vampires that try to feed off of me especially without permission but this one time id make an exception hed been pitiful now he was dead pity has never stopped me from pulling a trigger and edward didnt feel pity i could stare down at what was left of that skeletal body and think poor thing but i felt nothing about the death it wasnt just that i didnt feel regret i felt nothing absolutely nothing i looked at edward and he looked at me and id have given a great deal for a mirror right that second staring into edwards blank face those empty eyes that felt nothing i realized that i didnt need a mirror i already had one maybe id have been afraid of that revelation but the vampires began to flow out towards us survival first moral issues later richard might say that was one of my biggest problems jeanclaude wouldnt theres more than one reason why richard and i havent settled down to a happy ever afterlife and theres more than one reason why i havent cut jeanclaude loose itzpapalotl glided forward still shrouded in the scarlet cloak it was so long that you couldnt see her feet and she moved so smoothly that it looked like she was on wheels there was something artificial about her the four silent women moved on her left and something bothered me about the way they moved it took me a second or two to realize what it was they were moving in utter unison perfect step one lifted a hand to brush a strand of black hair from her face and all the others followed the movement like puppets though there was no stray hair on their faces from the breaths that raised their chests to the small jerk of a finger they imitated each other no not imitated that was too mild a word they were like one being with four bodies the effect was eerie because they didnt look alike one was short and square one was tall and thin the other two were delicate and did look something alike all of them had paler skin than itzpapalotl as if in life they hadnt been much darker than they were now the tall vamp that had tried to pull the starving vamp off me walked to her right he was the tallest of the ones that looked pure aztec six feet at least with shoulders and muscles to match his hair fell in a black wash down ins back held from his face by a crown of feathers and gold his nose was pierced though that was too mild a word for the three inches of thick gold that bisected his face gold earplugs stretched his earlobes to a thin line of flesh his skin was the color that old ivory sometimes gets not a pale gold but a pale copper palest bronze it was a striking color with the coal black hair and the perfectly black eyes he moved two steps back at her right and like the women he moved as if this had always been his place three male vamps moved a little distance from the man they were all that shining ivory white that i was used to seeing they were dressed in the same clothing as the bouncers those skirtthong bathing suit thingies but they had no adornment their arms and legs were pale and empty they were even barefoot i knew servants when i saw them or prisoners maybe one was medium height with curly brown hair cut short and a darker brown line of beard and mustache outlining the perfect whiteness of the skin the eyes were pale blue the second man was shorter with short hair turned salt and pepper as if hed died after the hair had gone grey the face was lined but strong and the body still muscular so that his age at death was hard to tell older than the others fortyish though i was no judge of age of death in vamps his eyes were the dark gray of storm clouds echoing his hair color he held a leash in one hand and on the end of that leash the third man crawled not on all fours but on his hands and his feet legs hunched monkey like or like a whipped dog his hair was short and a surprising yellow curling soft it was the only thing on him that looked alive his skin was like old paper clinging and yellowed to his bones his eyes were sunk so far back into his head that i couldnt tell what color they were the end of the entourage was five very hispanic aztecy bodyguards bodyguards are bodyguards regardless of the culture the century or state of life or would that be death i knew muscle when i saw it and the five vamps were muscle even carrying obsidian blades and obsidianedged clubs and looking somewhat less than serious in feathers and jewelry they exuded that aura of badass olaf had moved back to stand with us and the three of us faced them bernardo had stayed near the stairway making sure our retreat wasnt cut off so nice to work with other professionals olaf had his gun out now too and was watching the vamps with a look that wasnt neutral it was hostile i didnt know why but he seemed pissed go figure the vamps stopped about eight feet from us the dead vampire lay on the floor between us the body had already stopped bleeding when you take a head off of a vamp they bleed just like a human quarts and quarts of the red stuff it is a freaking mess when you decapitate someone but this vampire had bled only a small oddshaped space on the stone floor barely a foot across and a second even smaller pool under the chest not nearly enough blood for what wed done to him the silence seemed thicker than it should have and olaf filled it you can check his pulse if you want olaf dont edward said olaf shifted either uncomfortable or fighting down the urge to do something worse than mouthing off youre the boss he said but not like he meant it i doubt this one had a pulse i said and i was looking at the vampires while i said it it takes energy to make a vamps heart beat and he didnt have any you feel pity for him itzpapalotl said yeah i guess i do your friend does not i glanced at edward his face showed nothing it was nice to know there were still some differences between us i felt pity he didnt probably he doesnt but there is no regret in either of you no guilt why should we feel guilty we just killed him we didnt turn him into a crawling starved thing even under the masking cloak i could feel her grow still with that awful stillness that only the old ones have her voice came warm with the first thread of anger you presume to judge me no just stating facts if he hadnt been starved worse than any vamp ive ever seen outside of a coffin prison he would never have attacked me i also thought that they could have tried harder to get him off of me but didnt say it out loud i really didnt want to piss her off with eighty or so vamps waiting upstairs between us and the door that wasnt even taking into account the werejaguars and if i told my starved ones that they could feed off of you all of them what would they do she asked the starved vamp on the leash looked up at that his eyes never stayed on anyone too long flitting from face to face to face but hed heard her my stomach jerked tight in a knot hard enough to hurt i had to blow out a breath to be able to talk around the sudden flutter of my pulse thered been at least ten fifteen of the starved ones theyd attack us i said they would fall upon you like ravening dogs she said i nodded hand settling more securely on the butt of my gun yeah if she gave the order my first bullet was going between her eyes if i died i wanted to take her with me vindictive but true the thought frightens you she said i tried to see her face in that hood but some trick of shadow left only her small bowed mouth visible if you can feel all these emotions then you can tell a lie from a truth she lifted her face a sudden defiant movement a look passed over her face the barest flicker across that calmness she really couldnt tell lie from truth yet she sensed regret pity fear truth and lie should have come in there somewhere my starved ones are useful from time to time so you starve them deliberately no she said the great creator god sees they are weak and does not sustain them as he sustains us i dont understand they are allowed to feed as gods feed not as animals i frowned sorry i still dont get it we will show you how a god feeds anita she said my name like it was meant to be said making it a rolling three syllable word making of the ordinary name something exotic shapeshifter coming down bernardo said he had his gun up and pointed i have called a priest to feed the gods let him come down i said i looked at that delicate face and tried to read what was there but there was nothing home that i could talk to nothing i could understand i dont mean to be insulting my apologies if i am being insulting but we came here to talk about the murders i would like to ask you some questions your vast knowledge of things arcane and things aztec has brought us to you edward said i fought not to raise eyebrows at him just nodding yeah what he said she actually smiled you still believe i and my people are merely vampires you do not truly believe that we are gods she had me there but she couldnt smell a lie im christian you saw that when the cross glowed that means im a monotheist so if you guys are gods then its something of a problem for me that was so diplomatic even i was impressed we will prove it to you then we will offer you hospitality as our guests then we will talk business ive learned over the years that if someone says theyre a god you dont argue with them unless youre better armed so i didnt try and get the business moved up she was nuts and had enough muscle backing her in this building to make her brand of craziness contagious or even fatal so wed do arcane vampire shit then when the selfproclaimed goddess was satisfied id get to ask my questions how bad could it be watching them prove they were gods dont answer that the werejaguar that came through the door was the blueeyed blond with his golden tan that had first passed so near our table that id touched his fur he came through the door with a neutral face emptyeyed as if he wasnt entirely sure he wanted to be here his gaze took in the room and hesitated over the dead vamp in the middle but he fell to one knee in front of itzpapalotl his back to us and our guns furcovered head bowed what would you have of me holy mistress i fought to keep my face blank holy mistress good grief i want to show our visitors how a god is fed he looked up then looking into her face who am i to worship holy mistress diego she said the brownhaired vampire startled at the name and though his face was blank empty i knew he wasnt happy yes my dark goddess what would you have of me seth will offer sacrifice to you she caressed a delicate hand across the fur of the mans hood as you like my dark goddess diego said his voice was as empty as his face tried to be the werejaguar seth crawled on all fours mimicking the animal whose skin he wore he pressed his forehead to his hands lying nearly prostrate at diegos feet rise priest of our dark goddess and make sacrifice to us the werejaguar stood and he was nearly half a foot taller than the vampire he did something on the front of the jaguar skin and it opened enough for him to lift the headpiece over his head so that the animals sightless glass eyes stared back at us over the mans shoulders the head flopped bonelessly like a brokennecked thing his hair was a rich honey blond sunstreaked held back in a long club woven back and forth so that it looked like a lot of hair but held close to his head so the jaguar skin would slip on easily it was just like the hairdo on the one who had gotten cut up by the priest back stage turn so our visitors can see all itzpapalotl said the men turned so we had a side view the werejaguars earlobes were covered in thick white scars he drew a small silver knife from his belt the hilt was carved jade he placed the sliver blade against his earlobe steadying it with his other hand and sliced it open blood spilled in scarlet lines on his fingers down the blade to drip on the shoulders of the jaguar skin diego went to the taller man putting a hand behind his neck and another at the small of his back it looked oddly like a kiss as he drew the werejaguars head downward the vampires mouth sealed around the earlobe drawing it and some of the ear into his mouth his throat worked as he swallowed sucking on the wound drawing it down the pale blue of his eyes had spread to a sparkling fire like palest sapphires sparkling in the sun his skin began to glow as if there was white fire inside the brown of his hair darkened or maybe that was illusion because of how glowing white his skin had become the werejaguar had closed his eyes head thrown back breath catching in his throat as if it felt good one of his hands lay on the vampires bare shoulder and you could see the pressure of his fingers in that pale glowing flesh diego drew back flashing fangs the wound closes another offering my cat she said the vampire moved back just enough for the other man to use the silver blade on the other ear then he fell on him like a lover long refused he drew back eyes sparkling with blue light he looked blind and heavylidded as he drew back from him the wound closes it was actually interesting that the wound closed as fast as it did vamps had an anticoagulant in their saliva that should have kept it flowing and silver should have forced the shapeshifter to heal human normal but the wound was closing pretty fast not fast enough to make me comfortable but a lot faster than it should have the only thing i could figure was that itzpapalotl had somehow given her shapeshifters even more healing ability than a normal shapeshifter maybe normal silver bullets wouldnt work on them not to kill them anyway it was something to think about just in case i want them to see what it is to be a god diego show them my cat the werejaguar opened a seam on the fur that looked almost like it was velcroed shut he slit open the front of the fur having to stop and undo the belt that held knives and a small pouch the belt dropped to the floor and he slipped the fur down his body the golden tan was an all over tan complete with um you know nude sun bathing how unhealthy the jaguar slipped out of the skin until he stood completely nude he still had the silver knife in his hand i didnt have a clue what he was about to use it on but having to strip couldnt be a good sign he cupped his own penis and it had come out of the fur smooth and hard excited he put the point of the blade against that delicate skin and drew it in a thin crimson line his breath ran out in a ragged gasp it was echoed by me and olaf bernardo said shit eeeyah i dont think i had as much sympathy as the guys but that had to hurt edward was the only one of us who hadnt made a sound either he knew what was coming or nothing surprised him diego itzpapalotl said show them what it means to be a god there was a thread of warning in her voice as if she were warning him to do his job i wasnt sure why because diego had seemed to thoroughly enjoy the ear sucking why wouldnt he do this diego dropped to his knees and his face was very close to the offered blood all he had to do was reach out and take it but he stayed kneeling staring at the cut flesh with eyes that still blazed pale blue fire he stayed kneeling until the cut began to heal and finally vanish as if the flesh had absorbed it id never seen a shapeshifter heal silver that well never seth looked over his shoulder one hand still around his naked penis though it was beginning to wilt a little holy mistress what do you wish me to do sacrifice she said and there was enough heat in that one word to make me shiver seth put the blade point to his flesh again it seemed harder to get a clean cut when he wasnt fully erect but he managed blood spread in fine rivulets over his skin staining his fingers with tiny hits of red diego stayed kneeling but made no move to feed the fire faded from his eyes the glow leeched out of the skin leaving him still lovely a contrast of pale skin dark hair and blue eyes but he looked defeated somehow hands limp in his lap the four women moved around behind itzpapalotl gliding as a unit until they stood in a halfcircle behind the kneeling vampire you have disappointed me again diego the goddess said he shook his head and bowed it eyes closing i am sorry for that my dark goddess i would not disappoint you for the sun and the moon itself but his voice was tired when he said it like it was a memorized line but his heart wasnt in it the four vamps surrounding him pulled black leather bound rods from their belts and lifted leather bags off the ends dozens of thin leather cords spread out from each bag like obscene flowers silver balls were braided in the cords so that they sparkled in the torchlight it was a cat o nine tails except it had a lot more tails why do you insist on refusing this honor diego why do you make us punish you i am not a lover of men my dark goddess and i will not do this i am sorry that my refusal pains you but this one thing i will not do again his voice was tired as if hed said all of it before many times before he was about five hundred years old like the four women that surrounded him had he been turning the honor down for five centuries the four women watched their goddess not glancing even at the vampire at their feet itzpapalotl gave a small nod four arms went back flaring the cat o nine tails in a fan of silver and leather they whirled it through the air like they knew what they were doing they hit him in sequence right to left each whip landing a blow then the next the next the next the blows fell so close together it was like the sound of hard rain except that this rain was smacking into flesh and you could hear it thudding home they whipped him until they drew blood then they stood motionless around him waiting do you still refuse yes my dark goddess i still refuse when you raped these women long ago did you dream of the price you would pay no my dark goddess i did not you didnt believe in our gods did you no my dark goddess i did not you thought your white christ could save you didnt you yes my dark goddess i did you were wrong his head hunched between his shoulders as if he were trying to draw into himself like a turtle the metaphor was funny the gesture was not yes my dark goddess i was wrong she gave another nod and the women began to whip him in a blur that made the whips gleam silver like lightning in their hands blood ran in streamers down his back but he never cried out never asked for mercy i must have made some movement because edward stepped close to me not grabbing my arm but touching it i met his eyes and he gave the barest shake of his head i wouldnt really risk our lives for a vampire i didnt know really i wouldnt but i didnt like it olaf made a small sound he was watching it with glowing eyes like a child at christmas who comes down to find that hed gotten exactly what he wanted hed put up the gun his big hands clasped in front of him clasped so hard they were mottled and a fine tremor ran up his arms i might not like it but olaf did i glanced at edward sort of nodding to the big man edward gave the barest of nods he saw it too but he was ignoring it i tried i caught bernardos eyes he was staring at the big man a look very close to fear on his face he turned and concentrated on the stairs turning his back on everything in the room id have liked to join him but i couldnt turn away it wasnt just macho crap you know if edward could stand to watch it then so could i though there was a little of that mostly it was if diego could endure it i could watch it if i wasnt going to stop it then i had to at least watch to do nothing to help him and to turn away would have been too much cowardice for me to swallow id have choked on it the best i could do was try to watch other things around him the way the womens arms went up and down like machines as if they would never tire the five guards stood impassive but the vamp that walked at itzpapalotls right side watched it with halfparted lips eyes intent as if afraid to miss even the smallest movement he was almost as old as the goddess herself seven eight hundred years and for five hundred of those years hed been watching this particular show and he still enjoyed it i knew in that moment that i never wanted to make an enemy of the creatures in this room i never wanted to be at their mercy because they had none the other two spanish survivors had moved back to stand against the far wall as far from the show as they could get the one with salt and pepper hair stared at the ground as if there was something of great interest there the starved one on his leash had curled into a fetal position as if he were trying to disappear altogether the women turned diegos back into bloody ribbons a red pool formed at his feet he curled his upper body over his legs until he was like a little hull of pain blood began to drip down his shoulders to form a second puddle in front of him he was weaving even that low to the ground as if he might pass out i hoped he passed out soon i finally did take a step forward and edward grabbed my arm no he said you feel pity for him itzpapalotl said yes i said diego was one of the strangers that came into our lands he thought we were barbarians we were things to be conquered robbed raped slaughtered diego never saw us as people did you diego there was no answer this time he wasnt exactly unconscious but close enough that he was beyond words you didnt think we were people did you cristobal i didnt know who cristobal was but there was a high keening sound it was the vampire on the leash he unrolled from his tight fetal ball the keening ended in that same awful laughter that id heard earlier the laughter rose up and up until the vampire holding the leash jerked it tight pulling him like youd discipline a dog i realized that the leash was a choke collar shit answer me cristobal the vampire let up on the leash enough for the starved one to get a ragged breath his voice when it came was strangely cultured smooth and sum no we did not think you were people my dark goddess then the ragged laughter came from those thin lips and he huddled around himself again they broke into our temple and raped our priestesses our virgin priestesses our nuns twelve of them raped these four priestesses they did unspeakable vile things to them forced them with pain and threats of death to do whatever the men wanted them to do the womens faces never changed during the speech as if it were about someone else they had stopped whipping the man they just stood there watching him bleed i found them dying in the temple from what had been done to them i offered them life i offered them vengeance i made them gods and then we hunted down the strangers that had raped them the ones that left them for dead we took each of them made them one of us so their punishment would last forever but my teyolloquanies were too strong for most of them there were twelve of them once now only two remain itzpapalotl looked at me and there was a challenge in her face a look that demanded an answer do you still feel pity for him i nodded yes but i understand hate and revenge is one of my best things then you see the justice here i opened my mouth edwards hand tightened on my arm until it was painful he forced me to think before i answered id have been careful but he didnt know that he did a terrible unforgivable thing they should have their revenge in my head i added though five hundred years of torment seemed a bit much i killed people when they deserved it anything beyond that was up to god i just didnt think i was up to making decisions that would last five hundred years edward eased up on my arm and started to let go of me when she said so you agree with our punishment his hand locked back onto my arm if anything tighter than before i glared up at him hissing under my breath youre bruising me he let me go slowly reluctantly but the look in his eyes was warning enough dont get us killed id try not to i would never presume to question the decision of a god which was true if i ever met a god i wouldnt question their decision the fact that i didnt believe in any god with a little g was beside the point it wasnt a lie and it sounded perfect for the situation when youre prefabricating as fast as you can it doesnt get better than that she smiled and she was suddenly young and beautiful like a sudden glimpse of the young woman she must have been once it was almost more of a shock than the rest id expected a lot of things but not itzpapalotl to have retained even a shred of her humanity i am very pleased she said and she looked it id pleased the goddess made her smile be still my heart she must have made some sign because the whipping continued they beat him until the white of his spine showed through in places where the flesh had worn completely away a human would have died long before they got that far or even a shapeshifter but the vampire was as alive as when they started he had collapsed into a little ball his forehead on the floor arms trapped under his body his weight resting on his legs he was unconscious but the body didnt fall over it was propped up by its own weight olaf was making a highpitched hiss under his breath fast and faster if the circumstances had been different id have said he was working up to an orgasm if that was what he was doing i so didnt want to know i ignored him or did my best to the werejaguar stood there through it all nude body going limp the cut long healed as he watched the vampires body torn apart he watched it with a neutral face but occasionally when a blow was particularly vicious or when the first hint of bone showed through he winced gaze sliding away as if he didnt want to watch but was afraid to actually turn his head away enough that one word and the whips stopped drooping like wilted flowers the silver balls had all turned crimson and blood dripped from the end of the whips in slow spatters the womens faces had never changed as if the faces were just masks and what lay underneath was inhuman and held all the emotions that the masks could not show as if the monstrousness inside was more human than the human shells they wore the four women walked in a line to a small stone basin in the far comer they dipped each whip into the water in turn then ran their hands over each lash almost lovingly olaf tried twice to speak had to clear his throat and finally said do you use saddle soap and mink oil on the leather the four women turned as one toward him then they all looked at itzpapalotl she answered for them you sound knowledgeable about such things not as knowledgeable as they are he said and he sounded impressed like a cellist seeing yoyo ma perform for the first time they have had centuries to perfect their craft do they use their craft just on the bodies of the men who hurt them he asked not always she said can they speak he asked he was watching them as if they were something precious and lovely they have taken a vow of silence until the last of their tormentors is dead i had to ask are they executing them periodically no she said i frowned and the question must have shown on my face we do not execute them we merely harm them and if they die of their injuries then so be it if they survive then they live to see another night so youre not going to give diego any medical attention i asked edwards hand had never let go of me during the torture as if he truly didnt trust me not to do something heroic and suicidal his hand dug into me again and id had my fill let me the fuck go now or we are going to have a disagreement ted i wasnt feeling good about watching diego bleed i was feeling worse because it hadnt bothered me as much as i thought it should have id have helped him if i could have as long as it wasnt suicide he was a stranger and a vampire i wasnt risking our lives for him and that was that had there been a time when i would have risked us all even for a strange vampire i just didnt know anymore diego has survived far worse than this he is the strongest of all of them we broke all the others before they died they did everything we asked them in the end except diego and still he fights us she shook her head as a dismissing it all but we must show you how it is to be done properly chualtalocal show them how the sacrifice is to be embraced the vamp that stood at her right hand stepped forward he walked around the fallen diego as if he were a pile of trash to be avoided and left for someone else to clean up he faced the werejaguar as diego had faced him but things had changed seth had been all pumped up from having his ears sucked when he first stripped hard and eager to please now he was just naked and his eyes kept going to the bloody mess that diego had become as if he was wondering when his turn was coming make your offering my cat she said seth was looking from diegos body to the vampire in front of me my holy mistress i am willing you know i am but i i seem to be he swallowed hard enough that i heard it even over the still faint ringing in my ears i seem to be make your sacrifice seth or suffer my wrath the four sisters weird had hung their cat o nine tails on small hooks in the wall all in a row like a sadomasochistic version of the seven dwarves with their identical possessions they glided back towards us all like sharks scenting blood in the water seth seemed to know they were there he actually grabbed himself and started trying to get some attention going but his eyes were flicking wildly through the room as if looking for an escape he was making the effort but nothing was happening edward wasnt holding onto my arm anymore maybe that was it or maybe id just had enough for one night youve scared him shitless its hard to get it up when youre scared she and chualtalocal looked at me and their black eyes held nearly identical expressions not that i chanced looking into the eyes long but it was still there disdain how dare i interfere edward made as if to grab me again i held up a hand to him dont touch me he let his hand fall back but his eyes were not happy with me fine i wasnt happy with anyone right now and are you offering to help him overcome his fear itzpapalotl asked the look on her face said plainly that she didnt expect me to offer sure i said i dont know who looked the most surprised but i think it was edward though bernardo was a close second from the doorway olaf just watched me like a fox watching a rabbit through the fence whos just spotted a hole big enough to crawl through i ignored him it was probably best to always ignore olaf if possible ignore him or kill him that was my vote i held my hand out to the werejaguar he hesitated glancing from the vamp in front of him to me to the goddess behind him i wiggled my fingers at him come on seth we dont have all night go with her do as she says as long as you offer fitting sacrifice he took my hand tentatively and though he was a six foot plus naked man there was something very little boyish on his face maybe it was the near panic in his baby blues he was scared scared that he was going to end up on the floor meat for the four sisters weird i didnt blame him for worrying i think if i hadnt stepped in that was exactly what was about to happen but id had all the torture i could handle for one night it wasnt moral outrage it was just plain outrage i wanted to ask my questions and get the hell out of here vampires can live a very long time theoretically forever which means their idea of getting down to business can be damn leisurely the vamps might have had eternity i didnt i led seth the werejaguar off to the other side of the room the easiest thing would have been to work him by hand but i was like so not doing that the option i was voting for wasnt that simple but it was something i was willing to do i was going to call that part of me that was richards mark not the connection to him that was safely walled away id packed it so tight i wasnt even sure i could open to the mark even on purpose but i held a part of it inside me the same part that had recognized cesar the same part that let me deal with the wereleopards back home that electric rush of energy was a turn on to wereanimals id discovered it accidentally now i was going to try and do it on purpose but it wasnt like a switch maybe someday it would be but right now it took some preparation to get it going it was maddening that something that came out at odd moments when i didnt want it would refuse to come out when i did but psychic shit is like that unpredictable its one of the reasons its so hard to study in laboratory conditions x does not always equal y i put my hands on my hips and looked at him from head to foot and didnt know where to start my life would be both easier and harder if i was into casual sex but for better or worse it wasnt my cup of tea can you undo your hair why he sounded suspicious and i didnt blame him look i could have let her turn you over to her pet torturers but i didnt so work with me here his hands went to the knot at the back of his head he pulled long pins out of his hair and finally a comb that was made of bone the hair uncurled slowly as if it were stretching from some long sleep sliding down his back in a heavy mass i walked behind him and he started to turn and watch me i touched his shoulder made him face front im not going to hurt you seth im probably the only person in this room that wont he kept his face front but there was a tension to his shoulder his back that said he didnt like it i didnt care we needed to do this fast call it hunch but the goddess didnt strike me as patient i unrolled his hair helping it slide down his back the colors were extraordinary bright yellow rich gold a pale almost white all of it streaked together each color blending into the next the way sea water blends one color into the next distinct but making a whole i ran my hands through the thick warmth of his hair until it lay spread across his back an inch past his waist i grabbed two handfuls of hair and pressed it to my cheek there was the close smell of sweat and the scent of the fur hed worn he had a cologne faint on his skin something so sweet it smelled like candy i spread the hair apart until i could see the skin of his back and laid my face against the warmth of him he smelled warm as if you could sink your teeth into him like something fresh from the oven i walked around him hands trailing lightly over his skin touching mostly the fall of that sunstreaked hair i came to stand in front of him looked up into those wide still halfafraid eyes but a glance down his body showed that id made some progress not enough but some i didnt look at the vampires or edward or anybody i concentrated just on the man in front of me to look elsewhere was to lose ground i took his hand and that pale golden tan looked darker against the paleness of my skin i lowered my face over his hand as if id kiss it but i brushed my lips barely against his skin moving up his arm breathing in the scent of his skin i opened my mouth laying my breath like a warm touch just above the skin of his arm it raised the pale hairs on his arm in a march of goosebumps he flexed the hand i was holding rolling me into his body with my back resting against the front of him his other arm wrapped around from the other side enfolding me in the warmth of his body he laid his face on the top of my head and a spill of his hair fell across me like a warm sweet scented curtain the firelight danced through the gold of his hair turning it into an amber cage carved of light he kissed the top of my head then laid a gentle kiss against my temple the top of my cheekbone my cheek he was so tall that in bending over he enveloped me in his body covering me in the feel of him the candy smell of his cologne breathed along his skin and my body constricted with it the smell was the key the power spilled upward in a warm liquid rush that brought me to tiptoe made me luxuriate against his body like a cat with catnip wanting to roll my body in the scent my body writhed against his as the power rode in almost painful waves so warm it was almost hot rising off my body like invisible steam one hand stayed around my waist the other touched my chin turning my face back to meet his mouth he kissed me and for a second i stiffened but id learned that if you called the power you didnt fight it you embraced it if you fought it then you had less control i kissed him back i expected the power to push out my mouth into his like it had with cesar but it didnt the kiss was nice but it was just the feel of his lips on mine his warmth pushed against mine his power like a trembling shadow spilling along mine we stood wrapped in a curtain of his hair a circle of arms and a vibrating blanket of that skindancing power that was all shapeshifter he shuddered against me arms hugging me close i could tell he was ready for sacrifice without looking but i had to glance down anyway he was ready i pulled free of him gently youre ready to go back to the vamps seth i think youre ready to make a sacrifice i made myself look him in the eyes he bent and kissed my forehead gently thank you youre welcome we walked back to the vamps hand in hand but it wasnt the vampires that made me uncomfortable as we crossed the room it was the humans bernardo looked like he was reconsidering my status as untouchable madonna olaf had an almost hungry look on his face it was closer to the way werewolves looked at you on the night of full moon than the way a man looks at a woman edward had a slight frown between his eyes which for him meant he was bothered by something the vampires looked about like id expected itzpapalotl looked serious as if she hadnt known i could call the power up on purpose its why theyd apologized for dragging me up on stage earlier i gave seth over to chualtalocal like a father handing the bride to the groom then i moved back to stand by edward he looked at me as if he was the one trying to read me for a change and failing it was almost worth it if i could confuse edward did you enjoy yourself my cat the goddess asked yes holy mistress i did are you ready to make sacrifice yes holy mistress then do so she looked past him to me as if she didnt like what she saw something about what id done with seth had disturbed her had she expected me to take him off in the corner and just do him by hand like a fluffer in a porno movie had the fact that id used power as well as mild sex disturbed her or had she seen something i hadnt or understood something i did not no way of knowing short of asking and admitting that kind of ignorance to master vamps is a good way to get killed so no questions about magic just eventually hopefully about the case seth picked up the small silver blade again he cradled his flesh in his hand and set the tip of the blade against himself i caught bernardo turning back towards the door the blade tip bit into flesh and i looked away i think we all did except for olaf it might have startled him the first time but he was over the shock blood was being spilled flesh being cut olaf couldnt miss that he watched the cutting but then i caught him turning away out of the corner of my eye and i had to look i had to see what was bad enough for olaf not to be able to stomach it the vampire had gone to his knees i guess maybe id expected him to just lick the blood off but he wasnt he was sucking at it the way that diego had sucked at seths ears except this wasnt an ear the vampire had covered almost every inch of seth with its mouth seths eyes were closed and there was a look of concentration on his face i looked away again and found myself meeting the dead eyes of the four fallen nuns those empty angry faces were almost harder to stare at than a vampire going down on someone i literally turned my back on all of them and found that olaf had done the same thing he was hugging himself and staring at nothing his discomfort rose off of him in almost visible waves even with his back turned the sounds carried i wished for the ringing in my cars to get worse soft sucking sounds wet sounds the sound of flesh in flesh and the sharp intake of breath that was probably seth his breath came in three fast pants and he spoke please holy mistress i am not sure of my control tonight you know the punishment she said surely that is incentive enough to hold yourself in check i glanced back then and found that seth was staring back over his shoulder at the four women in the corner when he turned back he looked scared the vampire was still feeding sucking throat swallowing surely the wound had healed by now unless theyd made a second wound while i was being embarrassed and not looking seth dug his fingernails into the palms of his hands his hands paled with the force of squeezing nails into his own flesh he threw his head back suddenly breath coming fast faster fastest the vampire pulled off of him leaving him hard and still intact the wound has closed chualtalocal stood and went back to his mistress the moment there was room seth collapsed to his knees opening his hands slowly as if they hurt there were bloody halfmoons where his nails had bitten into his palms but it had worked any distraction to keep him out of the clutches of the goddesss pet freaks i offer you hospitality to you and your friends you may have seth if you like and finish him as his body seems to so badly need i suddenly knew what she meant by hospitality somehow i didnt think that was aztec culture though if i remembered correctly hadnt some of the aztecs sent cortez and his men women along with food and gold maybe this wasnt any different but i didnt want to mess with it dawn is coming i can feel it pressing against the darkness like a weight about to tear the night apart she turned her head to one side and seemed to think or maybe she was sensing the night the air something yes she said i feel it too then if it isnt too large an insult can we skip the hospitality for tonight and get to the murders only if you give me your word that you will return and taste our hospitality before you go back to saint louis i glanced at edward he shrugged i guess it was up to me what else was new when it came to monster i dont agree to having sex with your people but ill agree to a return visit you seemed to like seth i would offer you cesar who your power seemed to like even more but he does not make sacrifice nor does he act as hospitality it is his price for letting us come so near killing him twice a month you mean because he lets you nearly tear his heart out twice a month he doesnt have to make sacrifice or all the other stuff that is what i mean it made me think better of ol cesar id seen his show and now id seen some of the behind the scenes stuff and i had to say that it was a close call which was worse letting someone cut your chest open and touch your still beating heart or letting vamps suck blood off of tender body parts and be offered for sex to strangers no come to think of it id have rather had my chest cut open as long as i knew id heal completely every time its not that seth isnt lovely to look at im sure it would be a pleasure to be with him but i dont do casual sex thanks for thinking of me though i know the police spoke with you they did i do not think they learned anything of value from me maybe they didnt ask the right questions i said and what are the right questions i was about to do something that the police wouldnt like at all i was about to tell the monsters someone they had suspected at one point of being the murderer details of the crime but she needed specific details or how was she to recognize the marks of some aztec bogeyman i knew how the cops had done it theyd been so general it was almost useless to show up i understood why they did it that way once i opened my mouth and let out details to itzpapalotl then she was contaminated theyd never be able to slip her up in an interrogation because she got the secret details from me what i knew and the police couldnt was that theyd never interrogate the truth out of her she was the kind of vamp that could sit in a dark room and watch the colors on the inside of her own eyeballs and be content the only thing they could threaten her with was the death penalty and if she was behind the murders it was already a death penalty one of the downfalls to a swift and certain punishment was that it took a lot of the give and play out of an interrogation once someone knows they are going to be executed you cant bargain with them can we clear the room out a little what do you mean can we have fewer of your people in here im going to share confidential police information with you and i dont want it to get out whatever you say in this room remains in this room no one here will talk of it to anyone else i can promise you this she was utterly sure of herself arrogant but why not all of her people were terrified of her if what happened to diego was commonplace then think what the exotic stuff must be if she dictated that the secrets were safe they were safe edward stepped close to me he lowered his voice though he didnt try and whisper are you sure about this im sure edward she cant help if she doesnt have enough information we looked at each other for a few seconds then he gave a small nod i turned luck to the waiting vampire okay i said and i told her about the survivors and the dead i dont know what i expected maybe for her to be titillated or to go aha and recognize the monster responsible what i got was serious attention good questions at the right places and a glimpse at a very intelligent mind behind all the games if she wasnt a delusional sadistic megalomaniac wouldbe goddess she might have been likable the skins of men are valuable to xipe totec and tlazolteotl the priests would flay the sacrifice and wear the skin the heart had many uses for the gods even the flesh was used at least in part sometimes the insides of a sacrifice would have some strange thing inside it and be an omen then the other organs might be kept for a time and studied but it was rare can you think why they would cut out the tongues to keep them from speaking the secrets they have seen she said it like of course that was the reason it made sense ritually i guess why cut off the eyelids so they can never not see the truth even though they cannot speak it i do not know if this is why they have done these awful things why would someone remove the outward secondary sex characteristics i do not understand she said and she was holding the cloak close about her as if she were cold wed been talking long enough i had to remind myself not to look directly in her eyes the genitalia on the men the breasts on the women were removed she shuddered and i knew something i hadnt before itzpapalotl the goddess of the obsidian blade was frightened it sounds like some of the things the spanish did to our people but the flaying and taking the organs thats more aztec than european she nodded yes but our sacrifices were messengers to the gods we caused pain only for sacred purposes not for cruelty or a whim all blood was holy if you died at the hand of a priest you died knowing it served a greater purpose literally your death helped the rain to fall the maize to grow the sun to rise in the sky i do not know of any god that would flay people and leave them alive death is necessary for the messenger to reach the gods death is part of the worship of the deity the spaniards taught us to kill for the sake of killing not as a sacred trust but just for slaughter she stared past me at the four women that waited patiently for her to notice them for her to give them a purpose we have learned the lesson well but i would rather have stayed in a world where it was not true i saw in her face that she had some clue to what shed lost to what her vampires had lost when she decided they would become as cruel as their enemies the spaniards killed so many of our people along the road to acachinanco that they tied white handkerchiefs over their noses because of the stench of rotting bodies she looked at me then and the hatred in those eyes burned along my skin after five hundred years she still carried a grudge you had to admire someone who could hold on to hate like that i thought i knew how to hold a grudge but looking into her face i realized i was wrong there was room in me for forgiveness in itzpapalotls face there was room for only one thing hatred shed been angry about the same thing for over five hundred years shed been punishing people for the same crimes for five hundred years it was impressive in a psychotic sort of way i hadnt learned much more about the murders than when id stepped through the doors id mostly learned negatives a genuine aztec didnt recognize the murders as the work of any god or cult associated with the aztec pantheon it was good to know something to cross off the list police work is mostly negatives finding out what you dont know so you can decide what you do i didnt know anything positive about the murders but i knew one thing for absolute certain as i listened to the outrage in her voice about atrocities older than the entire country we were sitting in i never wanted this woman mad at me id told people that id chase them into hell to have my vengeance but i probably didnt mean it itzpapalotl would mean every word it was still dark as edward drove us homeward still night true dark the vampires still roamed but that soft edge in the air let you know the light is coming if we hurried wed make it into bed before true dawn if we dawdled wed get to see the sun come up none of us seemed to be dawdling we sat in the car in a silence that no one seemed willing to break we left the club behind and drove out into the hills beyond towards santa fe stars spread like a blanket of cold fire across the soft black silk of the sky the sky had that larger than life empty quality it gets over large bodies of water or in the desert olafs voice came out of the darkness low and strangely intimate the way voices can be in a car at night if wed accepted their hospitality do you think i could have had the vampire they whipped i raised an eyebrow define have i said have to do with as i liked what would you have done with him if they had bernardo said you dont want to know and i dont want to hear it edward said he sounded tired i thought you liked women olaf bernardo said it i didnt say it honest for sex i like women but so much blood it shouldnt have gone to waste he sounded wistful i turned in my seat and tried to see his face in the dark so its not just women who have to be careful around you is that it does it just have to bleed to be attractive leave him alone anita about this leave him the fuck alone i turned to look at edward he rarely cussed and he rarely sounded as tired and almost overwhelmed as he did now okay i mean sure edward glanced in the rearview mirror there wasnt a car in either direction for miles i think he was looking at olaf he stared into the mirror a long time i think they had some major eye contact going he finally blinked and went back to staring at the road but he didnt seem happy what arent you telling me us bernardo said what isnt he telling us all right what arent you telling us its not my secret to tell edward said and that was all hed say he and olaf had a secret and they werent willing to share we finished the rest of the drive in silence the sky was still black but it was a paler black the stars dim in it dawn was tremblingly close when we went into the house i was so tired my eyes burned but edward took me by the arm and led me down the small hallway away from the bedrooms he kept his voice low be very careful of olaf hes big and bad i get it he dropped his hand from my arm shaking his head i dont think you do look i know hes a convicted rapist i saw the way he looked at professor dallas tonight and i saw his reaction to the blood and torture i dont know what youre not telling me but i know that olaf would hurt me if he could i know that youre afraid of him i took a breath yeah im afraid of him good edward said he hesitated then said you fit his vic profile excuse me his favorite victims are petite women usually caucasian but always with long dark hair i told you i would never have brought him in on this case if id known you were coming down too it isnt just because youre a woman youre his physical ideal for a victim i stared at him for a few seconds mouth opened then closed it and tried to think what to say thanks for telling me edward shit you should have told me this up front i was hoping he could hold his act together but i saw him tonight too im worried that hell snap i just dont want you to be the one in the way when it happens send him back to wherever he came from edward we dont need him if he adds to the problem he shook his head no hes got a specialty thats perfect for this case and that specialty would be he gave that small smile go to bed anita its already dawn no i said almost but not quite he studied my face you can really feel the sunrise without looking i nodded yep he looked at me and it was as if he were trying to read me now for the first time i felt that maybe just maybe edward was as puzzled by me as i was by him sometimes he escorted me to my room and left me at the door like an overprotective date i was glad id prepared the room for safety before i left if someone came through the window theyd knock the dolls over or step on the mirror with its antlers the door would have a chair and the suitcase in front of it the room was as safe as it was going to get i undressed putting the guns and knives on the bed until i could decide exactly what was staying where for overnight a mans extra large tshirt that hung past my knees came out of the overnight bag id started keeping one change of clothes nightclothes and toiletries in the overnight bag ever since the airline lost my luggage on a business trip the last thing i pulled out of the overnight bag was my toy penguin sigmund i used to only sleep with sigmund every so often but lately hed been my constant companion under the sheets a girl needs something to cuddle with at night the browning hipower was my other constant companion at home it stayed in a holster id rigged to my headboard here i put it under my pillow making very sure the safety was on it always made me slightly nervous to put a loaded gun under my pillow seemed less than safe but not nearly as unsafe as being unarmed if olaf came through the door i had brought four knives with me one of them went between the mattresses i put the firestar back into the suitcase i wanted something bigger than a handgun i had a sawedoff shotgun and a miniuzi normally id have brought more big guns but i knew edward would have more and better and he would share i finally decided on the miniuzi with a modified clip that held thirty rounds with enough humph to cut a vampire in half it was a gift from edward so the ammo was probably illegal but then so was the gun id been almost embarrassed about carrying it at first but one night last august i used it for real id pointed it at a vampire pulled the trigger and cut him in half it had looked like his body was torn in half by some giant hand his upper body had fallen slowly to one side his lower body collapsed to its knees i still had the vision of it like a slow motion image there was no horror or regret it was just a memory the vampire had come with a hundred of his friends to kill us id tried to kill one of them as messily as possible to get the rest to leave us alone it hadnt worked but that was only because the vampires were more afraid of their master of the city than of me maybe the uzi was overkill for a human being but if by some chance i emptied the browning into olafs chest and he didnt go down i wanted to make sure he didnt reach me id cut him in half and see if the pieces could crawl it was after five when i finally closed my eyes sleep sucked me under like a roll of black water dragging me deep and instantly into a dream i stood in a dark place there were small stunted trees everywhere but they were dead all the trees were dead i could feel it something crashed over to my right something large moving through the trees and a sense of dread rode before it like a wind i ran hands up to protect my face from the dry branches i tripped over a root and went sprawling there was a sharp pain in my arm it was bleeding blood poured down it but i couldnt find a wound the thing was getting closer i could hear tree trunks snapping with sharp explosions it was coming it was coming for me i ran and ran and ran and the dead trees stretched out forever and there was no escape a typical chase dream i thought and the moment i thought it i realized it was a dream and the dream changed faded into another dream richard standing in nothing but a sheet one tanned muscled arm reaching out to me his brown hair falling in a froth of waves around his face i reached for him and as my fingertips brushed his a smile curving his lips the dream shattered and i woke i woke blinking into a patch of sunlight that spilled across the bed but it hadnt been the light that had woken me there was a light tapping on my door a mans voice edward says get up it took me a moment to realize it was bernardos voice it didnt take freud to analyze the dream at the end with richard in a sheet i was going to have to be careful around bernardo embarrassing but true i sat up in bed yelling through the door what time is it ten okay im coming i listened but didnt hear him walk away either the door was more solid than it looked or bernardo was quiet if it had just been edward id have thrown on a pair of jeans under the oversized tshirt and had some coffee but there was company in the house and it was all male i managed to get into the bathroom and dress without meeting anyone in the hallway i was wearing dark blue jeans a navy blue polo shirt white jogging socks and in black nikes normally id left the guns off until i went out into the big bad world but at edwards house the big bad world was staying in the next room so i put the firestar mm in an inner pants holster set for a righthanded cross draw brushed cleaned and armed i wandered toward the smell of bacon the kitchen was small and narrow and white but all the appliances were black and the starkness of the contrast was almost too much first thing in the morning there was another bouquet of wild flowers in the middle of a small white wooden table donna had struck again but truthfully i agreed with her the kitchen needed something to soften it the two men sitting at the table did nothing to humanize the room olaf had shaved so that the only hair left were the black lines of his eyebrows he wore a black tank top black dress slacks couldnt see the shoes but i was betting on a monochrome look he was also wearing a black shoulder rig with a big automatic of some kind i didnt recognize the brand a blackhilted knife was in a holster under his left arm shoulder holsters chaff when you wear them with tank tops but hey it wasnt my problem bernardo wore a white shortsleeved tshirt and black jeans hed pulled the top layer of his hair back on either side with a large multicolored barrette there was still plenty of hair to fall down past his shoulders stark and black against the pure whiteness of his shirt he was wearing a ten mil beretta just in back of his right hip i couldnt see a knife on him but i was betting it was there edward was at the stove emptying a pan of scrambled eggs onto two plates he was also wearing black jeans with matching cowboy boots and a white shirt that was a twin of the one hed worn yesterday gee guys do i have to go back to my room and change they all looked at me even olaf what youre wearing is fine edward said he carried the plates to the table and put one in front of each of the empty chairs there was a plate of bacon in the center of the table beside the flowers but i dont match i said edward and bernardo smiled olaf didnt big surprise you guys look like youre in uniform i said i guess we do edward said he sat down in one of the empty chairs i sat in the other one you should have told me there was a dress code we didnt do it on purpose bernardo said i nodded which is what makes it funny i am not changing clothes olaf said no ones asking you to i said i was making an observation my eggs had bits of green and red things in them whats in the eggs green peppers red chilies and diced ham edward said gee edward you shouldnt have i liked my scrambled eggs the way god intended them plain i pushed the eggs around with my fork and reached for the bacon half the plate was barely cooked the other half done to a crisp i went for the crisp the bacon on olafs plate was the crispy kind too oh well i said grace over the food edward kept eating but the others hesitated uncomfortable with their mouths full its always fun to say grace at a table with people who dont that uncomfortable silence the panic while they wonder whether to keep chewing or to stop i finished praying and took a bite of bacon yum whats the game plan for today i asked you havent finished looking at the files edward said bernardo groaned i think it is a waste of time olaf said we have gone over the files i do not believe that she will find anything new shes already done that edward said olaf looked at him a piece of bacon half way to his mouth what do you mean edward told them that is nothing olaf said its more than you came up with edward said quietly if i am such a burden on this job maybe i should leave olaf said if you cant work with anita maybe you should olaf stared at him you would rather have her as backup instead of me he sounded astonished yes edward said i could break her in half over my knee olaf said the astonishment was turning to anger i suspected that most emotions turned into anger for olaf maybe edward said but i doubt shed give you the chance i held up my hand dont make this a competition edward olaf turned to me slowly he spoke very slowly very clearly i do not compete with women afraid you cant measure up i asked the moment i said it i wished i hadnt the momentary satisfaction wasnt worth the look on his face as he rose from his chair i leaned into the table and drew the firestar pointing it in his general direction under the table olaf stood looming over me like a muscular tree edward has spent the morning talking to me about you trying to convince me that you are worth listening to he shook his head you are a witch and i am not the thing we hunt may be magical and we need your expertise maybe this is all true but i will not be insulted by you youre right i said im sorry it was a cheap shot he blinked at me you are apologizing yes on the rare rare occasions when im wrong i can apologize edward was staring at me across the table what i asked he just shook his head nothing olafs hatred of women is sort of a handicap and i try not to make fun of people with handicaps edward closed his eyes and shook his head you just couldnt leave it alone could you i am not a cripple if you hate anyone or anything with an unreasoning uncompromising hatred then you are blind where that hatred is concerned the police kicked me out of a crime scene yesterday because the cop in charge is a rightwinger squeakyclean christian and he considers me devil spawn so hed rather more people get killed and mutilated than have me help him solve the case he hates me more than he wants to catch this monster olaf was still standing but some of the tension had drained way he seemed to actually be listening to me do you hate women more than you want to catch this monster he looked at me and for once his eyes werent angry they were thoughtful edward called me because i am the best i have never walked away from a job until the quarry was dead and if it takes my preternatural expertise to help kill the monster can you deal with that i dont like it he said i know that but thats not what i asked can you handle my expertise helping you kill the monster can you take my help if it is the best thing for the job i dont know he said at least he was being honest even reasonable it was a start the question olaf is which do you love more the kill or your hatred of women i could feel edwards and bernardos stillness the room held its collective breath waiting for the answer i would rather kill than do anything else olaf said i nodded great and thank you he shook his head if i take your help it does not mean that i consider you my equal me either i said someone kicked me under the table i think it was edward but olaf and i nodded at each other not exactly smiling but i think we had a truce if he could control his hatred and i could control my smartass impulses the truce might last long enough for us to solve the case i managed to reholster the firestar without him noticing which made me think less of him edward had noticed and i think so had bernardo what was olafs specialty what good was he if he didnt know where the guns were after breakfast we headed back into the dining room bernardo had volunteered to do the dishes i think he was looking for any excuse to get out of the paperwork though i was beginning to wonder if bernardo had been as badly spooked by the mutilations as edward had been even the monsters were afraid of this one last night id been ready to look at the forensic reports next but in the clear light of day i could admit that it was cowardice reading about it was not as bad as seeing it i so did not want to look at the photos i was afraid to see them and the moment i admitted that to myself i moved them to the top of the list edward suggested we stick all the pictures on the walls of the dining room and put pin holes in your nice clean walls i said dont be barbaric edward said well use sticky putty he held up a small packet of the pliable yellow rectangles he peeled off some and handed it to olaf and me i squeezed the stuff between my fingers rolling it into a ball it made me smile i havent seen this stuff since elementary school the three of us spent the next hour putting the pictures up on the wall just handling the sticky putty made me remember fourth grade and helping miss cooper hang christmas decorations on the walls wed hung cheerful santas fat candy canes and bright balls now i was hanging vivisected bodies closeups of skinless faces shots of rooms full of body parts by the time we had one wall covered i was mildly depressed finally the pictures took up almost all the empty white wall space i stood in the center of the room and looked at it all sweet jesus too harsh for you olaf asked back off olaf i said he started to say something else but edward said olaf it was amazing how much menace he could put into one ordinary word olaf thought about it for a second or two but in the end he let it go either olaf was getting smarter or he was afraid of edward too guess which way i was voting wed grouped the photos by crime scene in large clusters this was my first glimpse of the bodies that had been torn apart doctor evans had described the bodies being cut by a blade of unknown origin then disjointed by hand but that had been a very clean description of what had actually been done at first all my eyes could see was blood and pieces even knowing what i was looking at my mind refused to see it at first it was like looking at one of those d pictures where at first its just colors and dots then suddenly you see it once you see it you cant unsee it my mind was trying to protect me from what i was looking at by just simply not allowing me to make sense of it my mind was protecting me and it only does that when its bad really really bad if i had just walked out now before my eyes made sense of it i might escape the full horror of it all i could turn on my heel and march out of here i could just refuse to take one more terror into my brain probably a good idea for my own sanity but it wouldnt help the next family that this thing got hold of it wouldnt stop the mutilations the deaths so i stood there and made myself stare up at the first picture waiting to see what was really there the blood was brighter than movie blood a cherry red theyd gotten to this scene before the blood had started to dry i spoke without turning around how did the police find the bodies so quickly in this house the blood is still fresh edward answered the husbands parents were supposed to meet them for an early breakfast before work i had to look away from the picture at the floor you mean his parents found him like this it gets worse edward said how could it possibly get worse i asked the wife told her best friend she was pregnant the breakfast meeting was to tell the husbands parents they were about to be grandparents for the first time the rug swam in my vision like looking at it through water i reached back for a chair and eased my way into it i put my head between my knees and breathed very carefully you all right edward asked i nodded without raising up i waited for olaf to make a sarcastic remark but he didnt either edward had warned him off or he thought it was horrible too when i was sure i wasnt going to throw up or faint i spoke with my head still between my knees when did the parents arrive at the house what time i heard paper rustle sixthirty i rested my cheek against my knee it felt good when did the sun come up i dont know edward said find out i said gee the rug on the floor was kind of pretty i raised up slowly still practicing nice even breaths the room did not swim good the grandparentstobe arrived at sixthirty it takes what ten minutes less for them to recover enough to call the cops then uniforms arrive on the scene first it could take thirty minutes or an hour more for a crime scene photographer to arrive and yet the blood is still fresh it hasnt dulled yet let alone started to brown the parents nearly walked in on it edward said yeah i said what difference does that make olaf asked if dawn was close to sixthirty then the critter can be out in daylight or it went to hole close to the murder scene if it wasnt close to dawn then it may be limited to darkness edward was smiling down at me like a proud parent even with your head between your knees youre still thinking about the job but what does it gain us olaf said if the creature is limited to darkness or daylight i looked up at him he was looming over me again but i kept sitting down wouldnt look very macho if i stood up and fell down if its limited to darkness then it may help us figure out what kind of critter it is there really arent that many preternatural creatures that are limited exclusively to darkness it would help narrow the list and if it holed up near the first murder scene edward said we might find some traces i nodded yeah the police tramped over that area within an inch of its life olaf said are you saying you can find something that they cant his arrogance was showing with the first murder especially the police were looking for a human perpetrator if youre looking for a human being you look for different things than if its a monster i smiled besides if we didnt all think we could find things that the police couldnt we wouldnt be here edward wouldnt have called us in and the police wouldnt have shared the files with him olaf frowned i have never seen you smile like this edward unless you are pretending to be ted you took like a proud teacher whose pupil is doing well more like frankenstein with his monster i said edward thought about it for a second then nodded and grinned pleased with himself i like that olaf frowned at both of us you did not create her edward no i said but he helped make me the woman i am today edward and i looked at each other and the smiles faded from both our faces leaving us solemn am i supposed to apologize for that he asked i shook my head do you feel like apologizing for it no he said then dont im alive edward and im here i stood and didnt sway at all life was good lets find out if any of the killings took place after daylight when ive looked at all this shit lets go see some murder scenes i looked at edward if thats all right with you you are the boss he gave a small nod thats fine but to keep ted working with the santa fe pd well need to include them at the murder sites yeah i said police dont like civvies mucking up their murder scenes makes them testy besides youre already persona non grata in albuquerque edward said weve got to keep some of the cops willing to talk to you and thats really bugging me i said im barred from the freshest crime scenes the newest evidence i dont need another handicap on a case like this you dont know what it is either do you edward said i shook my head and sighed not a damn clue bless his chauvinistic heart but olaf didnt say i told you so i went back to staring at the pictures and suddenly i could see it i let out a breath and said softly wow the room seemed hot dammit i was not going to have to sit down again i put my fingertips on either side of the wall steadying myself but it must have looked like i was trying for a closer look trust me i was as close as i ever wanted to get i finally had to close my eyes for just a few seconds when i opened them i was okay or as okay as i was likely to be body parts scattered like flower petals stirred into a red mess my eye flicked from one bloodcovered lump to another i was almost sure that was a forearm and the ball of a knee joint showed whitely amid all the red id never seen so many pieces before id seen bodies torn apart before but that had been for food or punishment but there was a terrible completeness to this destruction i moved on to a shot of the same image but from a slightly different angle i tried to put the body together in my head but kept coming up short on parts i finally turned around theres no head and no hands i pointed at small lumps in the blood unless those are fingers was the body completely disjointed even down to the finger bones edward nodded every victim has been almost completely dismembered down to the joints why i asked i looked at edward wheres the head they found it down the hill behind the house the brain was missing how about the heart i asked i mean theres the spine almost intact but i dont see any viscera where are all the internal organs they didnt find them edward said i leaned back halfsitting on the table why take the internal organs did they eat them is it part of some magical ritual or is it just part of the ritual of the killing itself a souvenir there are a lot of organs in the body olaf said you put them all in one container and they can be heavy bulky they also rot very quickly unless you put them in some form of preservative i looked at him but he wasnt looking at me he was looking at the pictures he hadnt given a lot of detail but something in the way he said it made him sound like he knew what he was talking about and how do you know how heavy the internal organs of a human body can be he could have worked in a morgue edward said i shook my head but he didnt did you olaf no he said and now he was looking at me his eyes had been turned into two dark caves by the deep set of his face and a trick of light or would that be darkness he stared down at me and without seeing his eyes i could feel the intensity of that stare as if i were being studied measured dissected i kept my gaze on olaf but asked what is his specialty edward why did you call him in on this particular case the only person ive ever seen do anything close to this is him edward said i glanced at him and his face was calm i turned back to olaf i was told you went to jail for rape not murder he looked right at me and said the police arrived too soon a cheerful voice called out from the front of the house ted its us it was donna and the us could only mean the kids edward left at a goodly walk trying to head her off i think olaf and i might have still been staring at each other when she walked in on us but bernardo came in and said were supposed to hide the pictures how olaf asked i took the candelabra off the table and said put the table cloth over the door i stood aside and let bernardo drag it off the table olaf said arent you going to help him you are one of the boys after all im not tall enough to hold it up over the entire door i said he gave a small smile derisive but he moved up to help bernardo block the open doorway with the tablecloth i was left standing behind them with the black iron candelabra in my hands i stared at the tall bald man and was halfregretful that i wasnt tall enough to smash the heavy iron candelabra into his skull just as well id owe edward another favor if i killed one of his backups just because hed scared me i could hear edward in his best consoling ted voice trying to convince her that she didnt need to say hi to everyone she argued polite but firm that of course she did the more he tried to keep her away the more she wanted to see call it a hunch but i was betting it was me she wanted to see the house was arranged so that you couldnt enter the three guest bedrooms without going through the dining room donna wanted to make sure where i was and that i hadnt been in anyones bed but my own or at least not in teds did she think that i was racing ahead of them to my room to throw clothes over my nakedness whatever the motive she was coming this way i heard beccas voice shit i ducked under the rug across the door and nearly ran into them donna stopped walking with a small oomph of surprise her eyes were wide as she looked at me as if id scared her peter was watching me with cool brown eyes as if it was all too boring for words but underneath the perfect teenage boredom was a light an interest everybody wondered why the tablecloth was in front of the doorway it was becca who said it why is the rug in front of the door i kept calling it a tablecloth because thats what edward was using it for but it still looked like a rug kids stick to the basics donna looked at edward yes ted why is the tablecloth in front of the door because were holding it bernardo said from behind the improvised curtain she stepped close to the cloth and why are you holding it ask ted bernardo and olaf said together donna turned back to edward i usually know what edward will say but with donna i was out of guesses weve got the pictures from the case spread all over the room they arent something i want you or the kids to see gee he went for the truth it must be true love oh she said she seemed to think about it for a second or two then nodded becca and i will take the goodies through to the kitchen she lifted a white stringwrapped box took becca by the hand and went towards the kitchen becca was straining backwards saying but mommy i want to see the pictures no you dont sweetie donna said and very firmly led the child away i thought that peter would follow but he stood there looking at the door way then glanced at edward what kind of pictures he asked bad ones edward said how bad anita edward said some of the worst ive seen and ive seen some awful stuff i said i want to see peter said i said no edward said nothing just looked at him peter scowled at us you think im a baby i wouldnt want your mom to see them either edward said shes a wimp he said i agreed with him but not out loud your mother is who she is edward said it doesnt make her weak it just makes her donna i stared at him trying very hard not to gape but i wanted to id never heard him cut anyone any slack for anything edward was not just judgmental he was a harsh judge what chemical alchemy did the woman have to have won him over i just did not get it i think what ted is trying to say is that it isnt your age that makes us not want to show you the pictures you think i cant handle it peter said yeah i said i think you cant handle it i can handle anything that you can handle he said arms crossed over his thin chest why because im a girl he actually blushed as if embarrassed i didnt mean that but of course he had but hey he was fourteen id let it slide anita is one of the toughest people ive ever met edward said peter squinted at him arms still hugging his chest tougher than bernardo edward nodded tougher than olaf and i thought more of the kid that hed put the two men in that order he knew instinctively which was the scariest man or maybe it was just olafs size no i think peter had a feel for the bad guys its something you either have or you dont it cant really be taught even tougher than olaf edward said there was a disgruntled sound from behind the rug the sound of olafs ego getting bruised peter looked at me and the look had changed you could almost see him thinking trying to put my petite female self in the same category as olafs aggressive male presence he finally shook his head she doesnt look as tough as olaf if you mean arm wrestling im not he frowned and turned back to edward i dont understand i think you do edward said and if you dont i cant explain it to you peters frown deepened part of the problem with the toughguy code i said is that a lot of it cant be explained but you understand it peter said he sounded almost accusatory ive spent a lot of my time around very tough guys thats not it peter said youre different from any girl ive ever met shes different from any girl you will ever meet edward said peter looked from one to the other of us moms jealous of her i know edward said bernardos voice came from inside the room can we lower the rug now dont tell me you tough hemen are getting tired i said lactic acid builds up in everybodys muscles chickie bernardo said id started the name calling so i let the chickie comment go you need to join your mom and becca in the kitchen i said do i he was looking at edward and i realized he was appealing to edward asking permission yes i said and looked at edward trying to tell him with my eyes not to do this but he had eyes only for the boy they stared at each other and something passed between some knowledge something drop the cloth edward said no i said and grabbed peters arm i spun him around so his back was to the door id caught him by surprise so he didnt struggle before he could decide what to do about me edward spoke let him go anita i looked at him around peters shoulder and realized he was taller than me by a few inches dont do this he wants to see let him see donna wont like it i said whos going to tell her i looked into peters dark eyes he will when he gets mad enough at you or her or both i wouldnt do that peter said i shook my head i didnt believe him and that more than anything made me let go of his arm and back off if edward showed peter this little corner of hell and word got back to donna it might be enough to break them up permanently i was willing to trade some of peters innocence for that harsh but true the rug fell away on olafs side first then bernardo was left holding the rug in his arms like a limp child he looked at edward and shook his head but he stepped back beside olaf and let peter walk into the room i followed behind him and edward olaf had moved back near the far door bernardo laid the cloth on the table and stepped back to the far end of the table i took up station to the far wall almost mirroring olaf but at the opposite door wed all moved to separate corners of the room and all of us tried to separate ourselves from what was happening i dont think even olaf approved peter took in all the pictures turning around and around he paled and his voice was a little breathy are those people yes edward said he stayed right beside peter not touching not too close but very definitely with him peter walked to the nearest wall to the pictures id just been looking at what happened to them he asked we dont know yet edward said peter looked at the pictures eyes flicking from one horrible image to another he didnt walk the room or study any one picture as closely as i had but he looked he saw what was there he didnt scream or faint or throw up hed proven his point he wasnt a wimp i wondered if i should warn him about the possibility of nightmares nah hed either have them or he wouldnt he was still pale with a light dew of sweat on his upper lip but he was mobile and his voice was breathy but calm i better help mom in the kitchen he walked out still hugging his arms around himself as if he were cold no one said a word as he walked out when i was pretty sure he was out of ear shot i walked up to edward well that went better than i thought it would it went about the way i thought it would edward said shit edward the kid is going to have nightmares maybe maybe not petes a tough kid he was looking out through the doorway as if he could still see the boy his gaze was faraway i stared at him youre proud of him proud of the fact that he looked at this i motioned at the pictures and didnt freak why shouldnt he be proud olaf asked i looked at him if edward were peters dad maybe but hes not i turned back to edward i stared at him his face was its usual blankness but there was a flinching around the eyes i touched his arm and the touch was enough he looked at me youre treating him like a prospective son i shook my head you cannot have this family i know that he said i dont think you do i said i think youre actually beginning to think about doing it for real he dropped his gaze not meeting my eyes shit edward shit i hate to admit it but i agree with her olaf said if it was just the boy then i would see no problem i think you can make of him what you will but the woman and the girl he shook his head it will not work i dont understand why you even want a family bernardo said for different reasons neither of you believe in marriage edward said true olaf said but if men like us do marry it should not be a woman like donna she is too he struggled for a word and finally said innocent and you know that i do not say that about many women maybe thats one of her attractions edward said and he seemed as truly puzzled as the rest of us youre already screwing her why marry her this from bernardo if all i wanted was sex id have gone elsewhere edward said she any good bernardo asked edward just looked at him one long look bernardo raised his hands sorry sorry just curious dont be curious about donna edward said he turned to me you believe in marriage underneath all that toughness is a midwestern girl that still believes in the white picket fence i do believe in marriage but not for people like us edward i dont know what he would have said to that because the phone rang and he went to answer it saved by the bell i said he intends to marry this woman olaf said i nodded im afraid so if he wants to marry her its his business bernardo said olaf and i stared at him until the smile on his face faded to a look of puzzlement what olaf may be a serial rapist bernardo or even a serial killer but in his own twisted way he has more scruples than you do doesnt that worry you bernardo shook his head no i sighed edward came back into the room his face was back to his normal edward face as if all the near revelations of just a minute ago had never happened the monster did another couple in albuquerque last night shit i said are you going without me edward was watching my face just a little too closely so i knew there was a surprise coming your presence has been requested on site i could feel the surprise on my face is lieutenant marks not in charge anymore it was him on the phone youre kidding me i said edward shook his head and smiled i dont get it id guess that someone up the feeding chain chewed his ass for kicking you out they probably gave him a choice of working with you or being off the case i had to smile a case like this can make a career exactly edward said well we know marks price now price bernardo asked you guys bribed him no i said but his principles that he so kindly spat in my face yesterday werent as precious to him as his career always nice to know how strong a persons convictions are not that strong edward said apparently not i said i heard donna coming down the hallway talking loudly to becca but i think it was to warn us that they were coming the men grabbed the rug and went for the doorway edward said in his loud cheerful ted voice saddle up boys and girls we got work to do i went for my room if we were going to go outside the house i needed more weapons i sat in the front seat beside edward it was probably my imagination but i could feel someone staring at the back of my neck if i wasnt imagining it i was betting on olaf id added the shoulder holster complete with browning hipower usually it was the only gun i wore until someone tried to kill me or some monster showed in the flesh but id kept the firestar in its inner pants holster too many pictures of dismembered corpses for comfort i even took all the knives which tells you how insecure i was feeling being stared at hard enough to bore a hole through my flesh was beginning to get on what nerves i had left it wasnt my imagination i could feel it i turned in the seat and met bernardos eyes there was a look on his face when i turned around that was nothing i wanted to see i had an uncomfortable thought that he was fantasizing and i just might be in the starring role what are you staring at i asked he blinked but it seemed to take a long time for his eyes to really focus on me rather than whatever was inside his head he gave a slow almost lazy smile i wasnt doing anything like hell i said you cant tell me what to think anita he said youre presentable enough go get a date id have to wine and dine her and then i couldnt count on sex at the end of the evening what good is that then get a hooker i said i would if edward would let me out on my own i turned and looked at edward he answered the question without me having to voice it ive forbidden olaf from dating while hes here olaf resented it so i told bernardo the same thing very even handed i said it is totally unfair to punish me because olaf is a psycho bernardo said if i cannot meet my needs then why should you be able to olaf said there was something in his voice that made me look at him he was staring straight ahead no eye contact to anyone i turned around in my seat and looked at edward where do you come up with these people the same place i find vampire hunters and necromancers he said he had a point enough of a point that we finished the drive to albuquerque in silence i felt i had enough moral high ground to throw stones but evidently edward disagreed since he knew olaf better than i did i wasnt going to argue at least not now people talk of ranchstyle houses but this really was a ranch a ranch as in cowboys and horses it was a dude ranch for tourists so whether it counted as a really real ranch i wasnt sure but it was the closest thing to an actual working ranch that id ever set foot on the ranch really wasnt in albuquerque but in the middle of nowhere in fact the house and corrals sat in the middle of a whole lot of nothing empty space with bunches of dry grass and strange palish soil stretching out and out to the horizon hills ringed the ranch like smooth piles of rock and brush edward drove us under an entrance that had a cows skull nailed to it and said dead horse ranch it was so similar to a hundred western movies id seen on television that it seemed vaguely familiar even the corral full of horses spilling in an endless nervous circle seemed stagemanaged the house wasnt exactly what i had pictured being low to the ground and made of white adobe much like edwards house but newer if you could have just erased the plethora of police cars emergency units and even some fire rescue equipment it would have been picturesque in a lonesome downontheprairie sort of way a lot of the police cars had revolving lights and the crackle of police radios was thick in the air i wondered if it was the lights the noise or just this many people making the horses nervous i didnt know much about horses but surely rushing back and forth around their pen wasnt normal behavior i wondered if they had been running in circles before the cops came or after were horses like dogs could they sense bad things didnt know didnt even know who to ask we were stopped just inside the gate by a uniformed cop he took our names and went off to find someone who would let us pass or find someone to tell him to kick us out i wondered if lieutenant marks was here since hed issued the invite it seemed likely what kind of threat to his career had they used to get him to invite me back we waited none of us spoke i think wed all spent a lot of our adult lives waiting for one uniform or another to give us permission to do things it used to get on my nerves but lately i just waited maturity or was i just getting too worn down to argue over small stuff id have liked to say maturity but i was pretty sure that wasnt it the uniform came back with marks trailing behind him marks pale tan suit jacket flapped in the hot wind giving a glimpse of his gun riding just behind his left hip he stared at the ground as he walked briskly all business but he was careful not to look at us at me maybe the uniform got to us first but he stood a little back from the open drivers side door and let the lieutenant catch up marks finally got there and he looked fixedly at edward as if he could exclude me by just not looking at me who are the men in the back otto jefferies and bernardo spottedhorse i noticed that olaf had to use an alias but bernardo got to keep his real name guess who was wanted for crimes elsewhere what are they i wouldnt have known how to answer that question but edward did mr spottedhorse is a bounty hunter like myself and mr jefferies is a retired government worker marks looked at olaf through the glass olaf looked back government worker what sort of government worker the kind that if you contacted the state department theyd confirm his identity marks tapped on olafs window olaf rolled the window down with the nearly silent buttons on the door handles yes he said in a voice that was totally devoid of his usual german burr what did you do for the state department call them and ask olaf said marks shook his head i have to let you and blake inside my crime scene but not these two he jerked a thumb at the back seat they stay in the car why bernardo said marks looked at him through the open window his blue green eyes were mostly green right now and i was beginning to realize that meant he was angry because i said so and ive got a badge and you dont well at least it was honest edward spoke before bernardo could do more than make inarticulate noises its your crime scene lieutenant we civilians are just here on your sufferance we know that he twisted in his seat to give the two men direct eye contact but turned so marks couldnt see his face well i could and it was cold and full of warning they will be happy to stay in the car wont you boys bernardo slumped in his seat arms crossed on his chest sulking but he nodded olaf just said of course whatever the good officer says his voice was mild empty the very lack of tone was frightening as if he were thinking something very different from the words marks frowned but stepped back from the car his hand hovered around his body as if he had a sudden desire to touch his gun but didnt want to appear spooked i wondered what had been in olafs eyes when he spoke those mild words something not mild that i was certain of the uniformed cop had detected something in marks he stepped closer to his lieutenant one hand on the butt of his gun i didnt know what had changed in olaf but he was suddenly making the cops nervous he hadnt moved only his face was turned towards them what was he doing with just his facial expression that had them so jumpy otto edward said softly so that the sound didnt carry outside the car but as he had in the house when he said olaf that one word carried a menace a promise of dire consequence olaf blinked and turned his head slowly towards edward the look on his face was frightening feral somehow as if hed let down his mask enough to show some of the madness inside but as i looked at him i thought this was a face to deliberately frighten people a sort of tease not the real monster but a monster that people could understand and fear without thinking too hard olaf blinked and looked out the far window face bland and as inoffensive as it got edward turned the car off and handed his keys to bernardo in case you want to listen to the radio bernardo frowned at him but took the keys gee thanks dad edward turned back to the police officers were ready to go when you are lieutenant he opened his door as he said it the door swinging open made marks and the uniform take a step or so back i took it as my cue and got out on my side it wasnt until i came around the front of the hummer in full sight that marks finally paid attention to me he stared at me and his face was harsh he could manage not to show outright hatred in his face but he couldnt manage neutral he didnt like me being here he didnt like it one little bit who had twisted his tail in a knot hard enough to force him to let me back on board he opened his mouth as if hed say something closed it and just started walking towards the house the uniformed officer followed at his heels and edward and i trailed behind edward had his good ol boy face on smiling and nodding to the police officers the emergency workers everyone and everything in his path i just stayed at his side trying not to frown i didnt know anybody here and id never been comfortable greeting strangers like longlost friends there were a lot of cops outside in the yard i spotted at least two different uniforms enough plainclothes to open up a discount mens store and some plainclothes detectives that stood out i dont know what they do during fbi training that is different from anywhere else but you can usually spot them the clothes are slightly different more uniform less individual than with regular cops but its more an aura about them an air of authority as if they know that their orders come straight from god and yours dont i used to think it was insecurity on my part but since im rarely insecure that cant be it whatever it was they had it the feds had arrived that could speed things up be a big help or slow things to a crawl and fuck up what little progress had already been made it depended almost entirely on how the police in charge got along with each other and how protective everyone was of their turf these crimes were gruesome enough that we might actually see some cooperation between jurisdictions miracles do happen usually when theres a body on the ground the police of whatever flavor are inside at the scene walking on the evidence but there were too many people out here there couldnt possibly be that many more inside the house the house was big but not that big only one thing would keep them out in the new mexico heat the scene was a bad one gory piteous frightening though no one will admit out loud to that one pick an adjective but the police milled around the yard in the heat with their ties the women in high heels on the loose gravel cigarettes had appeared in a lot of hands they talked in small hushed voices that didnt carry above the crackle of radios they huddled in small groups or sat alone on the edge of cars but not for long everyone kept moving as if to remain still was to think and that was a bad thing they reminded me of the horse nervously running in circles a uniformed police officer was sitting at the open doors of the ambulance the emergency medical technician was bandaging his hand how had he gotten hurt i hurried to catch up with marks if he were the man in charge hed know what had happened edward just fell into step behind me no questions just following my lead he had ego problems with me sometimes but on the job there was nothing but the job you left the shit outside the door you could always pick it up on your way back out i caught up with marks on the long narrow wraparound porch what happened to the uniform thats getting his hand bandaged marks stopped in midstride and looked at me his eyes were still a hard pitiless green you always think of green eyes as being pretty or soft but his were like green glass he had a big hate on for me a big one i smiled sweetly and thought fuck you too but id learned lately to lie even with my eyes it was almost sad that i could lie with my eyes they really are the mirror to the soul and once they go you are damaged not beyond repair but damaged we stared at each other for a second or two his hatred like a fine burning weight my pleasant smiling mask he blinked first like thered been any doubt one of the survivors bit him my eyes widened are the survivors still inside he shook his head theyre on their way to the hospital anybody else get hurt when you ask that at a scene where vics are down you almost always mean other cops marks nodded and some of the hostility drained from his eyes leaving them puzzled two other officers had to be taken to the hospital how bad i asked bad one nearly got his throat ripped out have any of the other mutilation vics been that violent no he said how many vics were there two and one dead but were missing at least three other people maybe five weve got a couple unaccounted for but other guests heard them talking about a picnic earlier were hoping they missed the show i looked at him he was being very helpful very professional thank you lieutenant i know my job ms blake i never said otherwise he looked at me then at edward then finally settled his gaze on me if you say so he turned abruptly and walked through the open door behind him i looked at edward he shrugged we followed marks in though i noticed wed lost the uniformed officer somewhere in the walk across the yard no one was spending more time inside than they had to the living room looked as if someone had taken white liquid and poured it down to form the sloping walls the curved doorways leading away into the house the freeform fireplace there was a bleached cow skull above the fireplace a brown leather couch wrapped a huge nearly perfect square in front of the cold fire there were pillows with native american prints on them a huge rug that looked almost identical to one of edwards took up most of the center of the floor in fact the entire place looked like an updated version of edwards place maybe i still hadnt seen edwards sense of style maybe this was just a type of southwestern style that id just never seen there was a large open section that had been a dining room area the table was still there there was even a chandelier formed of what looked to be deer antlers there was a pile of white redsoaked cloth to one side of the table blood was seeping out of the bottom of the cloth bundle leaking across the polished hardwood floor in tiny rivulets of crimson and darker fluids a photographer was snapping pictures of something on the table my view was hidden by three suitcovered backs panic clawed at my throat and it was suddenly harder to breathe i didnt want the men to move i did not want to see what was on the table my heart was pounding in my throat and i had to take a deep shaking breath clearing my throat the deeper breath had been a mistake the smell of fresh death is like a cross between an outhouse and a slaughterhouse there was an acrid stink and i knew the intestines had been perforated but there was another smell under the almost sweet smell of too much blood a smell of meat id tried to find other words for it but it was the closest i could come to describing it it was like drowning in the scent of raw hamburger meat a person reduced to so much meat that one smell made me want to run to just turn on my heel and walk away this was not my job i was not a cop i was here as a favor to edward if i left now he could bill me but of course it was too late because i wasnt here just because of a favor to anyone now i was here to help stop this from happening again and that was more important than any nightmares i was about to accumulate a thin heavy line of liquid oozed off the edge of the table and fell slowly to the floor with a sparkle of crimson from the bright chandelier the short man in the middle turned and caught a glimpse of us his face was grim but when he caught sight of us of me something close to a smile curled his lips he left the others grouped around the table and came towards us he was short for an fbi agent but special agent bradley bradford walked with a confident swinging stride that covered ground and made taller men sometimes have to hurry to keep up wed met over a year ago in branson missouri on a vampire case that had turned out to be vampires plus a little something older and less local people had died but mostly the monsters had died bradford must have been happy with my performance because he kept in touch i knew that he was now assigned to the new fbi preternatural division last i heard they were calling it the special research section just like the serial killer profiler unit was now called investigative support the fbi tries to avoid sensational buzzwords like serial killer or preternatural or monster but call it what you like a spades a spade he started to put his hand forward to be shaken then stopped his hands were encased in plastic gloves splattered with blood and a spot on one side that was too black too thick to be blood he smiled an apology as he lowered his hands i knew who had twisted marks tail and gotten me back in the ball game i took shallow even breaths and tried not to embarrass him i hadnt thrown up at a murder scene in nearly two years be a shame to spoil my record now anita its good to see you again i nodded and felt myself smile i was happy to see bradley but we really need to start meeting when there arent bodies on the ground see light joking i could be cool i was also delaying the final walk to what lay on the table i could do semiclever repartee all damn day if i just didnt have to see what was bleeding in the dining room why was this one getting to me so badly no answer but it was another agent joined us he was tall slender skin actually dark enough to be called black his hair was cut close to his head in a low wellgroomed wedge he straightened his tie and settled his coat in place with longfingered hands that seemed to dance even in these small movements im not one of those women who notices hands usually but there was something about his that made me think poet musician as if he did other things with them besides shooting practice special agent franklin this is ted forrester and anita blake he shook hands with edward but didnt answer the ted smile with one of his own he turned serious eyes to me his hand was enough longer than mine that shaking was a little awkward but we managed but it was somehow an unsatisfying handshake as if we still didnt have the measure of each other some men still use a handshake as a way of sizing you up how long have you been in the house ms blake he asked just got here i said he nodded as if it were important bradford has painted a glowing picture of you there was something in his voice that made me say i take it you dont share bradfords opinion of me i smiled when i said it he blinked and looked startled then his shoulders relaxed just a touch and a very small smile played across his lips lets say im skeptical of civilians with no special training coming into a crime scene i raised eyebrows at the no special training edward and i exchanged glances the ted face was slipping letting some of his own natural cynicism leak into those blue eyes that nearly boyish face civilians he said softly we dont have badges i said that must be it he said voice still soft and vaguely amused franklin frowned at us are we amusing you bradford stepped between us almost literally lets let them look at the scene then well decide things franklins frown deepened i dont like it your objection has been noted franklin bradford said and there was a tone in his voice that said hed had enough of the younger man franklin must have heard it too because he smoothed his perfect tie once more and led the way towards the dining room bradford followed him edward looked at me asking a question with his eyes im coming i said once id tried being more macho than the police nothing pleased me i was heapbigvampireslayer but lately i just didnt give a crap i didnt want to do this anymore it was almost a shock to realize that i really didnt want to be here id seen too many horrors in too short a space of years i was burning out or maybe id already burned out and hadnt realized it panic tightened my stomach into a hard knot i had to get it under control i had to separate myself from the task ahead or i was going to lose it i tried to take a few calming breaths but the smell came thick on my tongue i swallowed wished i hadnt and stared at the tips of my shoes i stared at the ends of my nikes as they touched the fringe of the dining room rug until the knot in my gut eased and i felt calm there was still a soft flutter in my chest but it was the best i could do agent franklin said ms blake are you all right i raised my eyes and saw what lay on the table i let out a low wow yes bradford said wow is good the table was pale natural pine a pale almost white wood it matched the walls and the rest of the decor and made a dramatic showpiece for the thing on the table thing it no other pronouns would do distance distance mustnt think that this was once a human being at first all i could see was the blood and pieces of meat it was like a jigsaw puzzle with pieces missing the first thing i was sure of was the neck i could see the broken edge of the spine sticking up above the flesh of the neck i looked around for the head but none of the bloodcovered lumps was the right size but there was a leg nearly perfectly whole only ripped away from the hips but it was intact it had not been disjointed once i saw that i found a hand lying on its back fingers cupped as if cradling something i bent closer hands in my pockets because id forgotten my own surgical gloves back in st louis how unprofessional of me i leaned over the hand and i wasnt smelling the stink anymore i wasnt thinking oh my god how awful the world narrowed down to a nickelsized lump cupped in the hand i saw what was there the hand had long carefully groomed fingernails some broken off as if shed struggled she i looked to the ring finger and found a wedding band set that looked heavy and expensive though to be sure id have to move the hand and i wasnt ready for that yet i registered all the information as if from a great distance because id found a clue i concentrated on that like it was a life line and maybe it was theres something in her hand it may be only a piece of cloth but i bent so low over it that my breath caressed the skin and brought a scent up from it to me musty an animal smell my breath did one other thing it moved the edge of the thing in her hand the one tiny edge wasnt as bloodlogged and it moved as i blew across the hand i straightened i think its a feather i looked around the room trying to see where it could have come from except for the antler chandelier nothing else in the room seemed made of animals bradford and franklin looked at each other what i asked what made you say her franklin asked the nails the wedding ring set i glanced up at the rest of the body the only other clue that this had been a woman was maybe the size of the neck dainty she was small about my size maybe a little smaller i heard myself say it and felt nothing i felt empty like a shell thrown up on the sand empty and echoing it felt a little bit like being in shock and i knew that later id pay for it either id have screaming hysterics once i had some privacy or id broken something in myself that might never come back might never fix besides the fact that its female what else do you see franklin asked i didnt like being tested but somehow i just didnt have the energy to bitch about it the other vics were disjointed down to their finger bones this one isnt when i first heard that survivors were being carefully skinned then mutilated and that the dead were all torn apart i thought we might dealing with a pair of killers one very organized and in charge the other disorganized and following but the bodies werent torn up they were very carefully dissected it was organized very thought out but this i motioned at the thing on the table this was not organized either our organized killer is beginning to dissolve and become less coherent or we have two killers like i originally thought if we have two killers then the organized one in charge has lost control over his follower this murder was not well planned that means mistakes which will help us but it may also mean that anyone that crosses paths with this thing is dead higher body count from here on out more frequent kills maybe maybe not not bad ms blake i even agree with you on most of it thank you agent franklin i wanted to ask what parts didnt he agree with but was pretty sure where we disagreed you still think this is a human serial killer he nodded i do i looked at the remains like lumpy red paint tossed across the table the bloodstains had spread until i was standing in the edge of it the cops hated to have you tracking blood everywhere i stepped back and the stain spread out towards me i took another step back my foot crunched in something i knelt and found salt on the floor someone had gotten messy during lunch i stood up this is fresh kill agent franklin real fresh how long would it take a person even two people to reduce another human being to this his long hands played over his tie again i wondered if he knew he did that when he was nervous if he didnt id play poker with him any day i really couldnt give an estimate not and be accurate fine do you really think a person is strong enough to tear someone apart like this quickly enough to have the blood this fresh the damn things bleeding like its still alive its so damn fresh i dont think a human being could do this much damage this quickly you are entitled to your opinion i shook my head look franklin it was logical for you to assume the killer or killers were human it usually is human in your line of work im assuming youre with the investigative unit he nodded great see you hunt people thats what you do they are monsters but not real monsters i dont hunt people i hunt monsters thats just about all i do i dont think ive ever been called into a case where the perp was human or at least where magic wasnt involved your point he said very stiff eyes angry my point is that if they had thought this was a monster to begin with theyd have sent it over to bradfords new unit but they didnt did they his eyes were a little less angry more uncertain no they didnt everyone thought it was human so why shouldnt you assume the same thing if theyd dreamt that it was nonhuman they wouldnt have sent it to you right i suppose so great then lets work together not at cross purposes if we split our manpower between looking for people and looking for monsters it will cost time and if youre wrong ms blake if it is a human being doing these terrible things and we stop investigating down that avenue it could cost more lives he shook his head its not my initial report im standing by ms blake its the chance that it is a human perpetrator we will continue to treat this as a normal investigation he looked at bradford that is my final recommendation he turned to edward and you mr forrester are you going to dazzle me with your profiling abilities edward shook his head no what do you offer to this investigation then when we find it ill kill it franklin shook his head we are not judge jury and executioner mr forrester we are the fbi edward looked at him and most of teds good ol boy charm seemed to have seeped out of his eyes leaving them cold and uncomfortable to meet i have two men with me out in the car one of them is an expert on this type of crime if this was done by a person then hell be able to tell us how it was done his voice had gone bland smooth and empty who is this expert franklin asked why is he still out in the car bradford said otto jefferies and because lieutenant marks wouldnt let him in edward answered by the way i said thanks for getting me back on the case bradley bradley smiled dont thank me help us solve the damn thing who is otto jefferies franklin asked hes a retired government worker edward said how does a retired government worker have expertise on this type of killing edward looked at him until franklin began to fidget smoothing his hands down not just his tie but his suit coat he even checked his cuffs though to make the movement really effective you needed cufflinks buttons just didnt do it im sure you are implying something by your so pointed gaze but my question stands what land of government worker would have this kind of expertise franklin may have been nervous but he was also stubborn call the state department edward said theyll answer your questions i want you to answer my questions edward gave a small shrug sorry if i told you the truth id have to kill you he said the last with a good ol boy smile and an aweshucks shine in his eyes which probably meant he was serious bring your men in bradley said i must protest involving more civilians in this case franklin said duly noted bradley looked at edward bring them in mr forrester im agent in charge on site edward went for the door for now franklin said bradley looked up at the taller man i think you need to be elsewhere franklin where would i be of better use than overseeing the crime scene anywhere that is away from me bradley said franklin started to say something then looked at both of us in turn and finally at bradley i wont forget this agent bradford nor will i agent franklin franklin turned abruptly and walked out hands sliding over his clothes when he was out of earshot i said he doesnt seem to like you making a new division for preternatural crimes wasnt a popular move with everyone until now the investigative division has been handling them gee and i thought the fbi was above such petty disputes bradley laughed god dont i wish this is a really really fresh scene bradley i dont mean to tell you your job but shouldnt we be searching the area for the creature we did a ground search turned up nothing weve still got the helicopter up we also sent off for geology maps of the ranch in case theres a cave we missed would a geology survey cover manmade ruins i asked what do you mean this area of the country is supposed to be lousy with ruins just because nothings visible from above ground doesnt mean there wont be something buried a room or even a kiva whats a kiva bradley asked a sacred underground room for ceremonial magic its one of the few things that most of the southwestern tribes or pueblos have in common bradley smiled dont tell me youre also an expert on native american religious practices too i shook my head nope i had a brief overview in my comparative religion class in college but i didnt take native american as one of my electives knowing that kiva do exist and their general use pretty much exhausts my knowledge of the southwestern tribes now if you need to know details about the sioux sun worshipping rituals those i remember ill check with the surveying company and see if they mark manmade structures good the locals called in some tracking dogs the dogs wouldnt come in the house they refused to track were they bloodhounds i asked bradley nodded why bloodhounds are a very friendly breed they are not attack dogs sometimes on the preternatural bad stuff they refuse the trail you need some trollhunds trollwhat bradley asked trollhunds they were originally bred to hunt the greater european forest trolls when the trolls went extinct the breed almost died out theyre still a rare breed but they are the best you can find for tracking preternatural bad guys unlike the bloodhound they will attack and kill what they trail how do you know so much about dogs bradley said my dads a vet edward had reentered with olaf and bernardo at his back hed heard the last your dad a doggie doctor i didnt know that he was looking intently at me and i realized that edward didnt really know much more about me then i did about him are there any trollhunds in this area bradley asked it of edward he shook his head no if there were id know it id have used them you knew about trollwhatsits too bernardo asked edward nodded if youre a varmint hunter so should you bernardo frowned at the criticism then shrugged i do more bodyguard work than critter killing these days he was looking at everyone everything but the table and contents maybe you should go back to guarding other peoples bodies edward said i dont know what id missed but edward was angry with him bernardo looked at him maybe i should no one is stopping you damn you ted and bernardo walked out i looked at olaf as if for a clue to what had just happened but olaf had eyes only for the remains his face was transformed it took me a few seconds to realize what the expression on his face was because it was wrong it did not match what was happening he stared down at the remains of that woman with enough raw lust in his eyes to burn down the house it was a look that should have been saved for privacy to be shared between your beloved and yourself it was not a look for public consumption when you were looking at the bleeding remains of a woman you did not know staring into olafs face i was cold cold all the way down to my nikes fear but not of the monster or rather not of that monster if you had given me a choice between whatever was doing these killings or olaf right that moment i wouldnt have known who to pick it was sort of like choosing between the tiger and the tiger maybe i was standing too close i dont know he just suddenly turned his head and looked full at me and just like id known in the car what bernardo was thinking i knew that olaf was looking for a star in his own little fantasy i held my hands up shaking my head and backed away from him dont even go there otto i was beginning to really hate all these aliases she was almost exactly your height his voice had a soft almost dreamy quality drawing a gun and shooting him was probably overkill but i certainly didnt have to stand there and help his imagination i turned to bradley someone said there were other bodies lets go see five minutes ago youd have had to drag me into the next chamber of horrors now i grabbed bradleys arm and half pulled him half let him lead me deeper into the house i could feel olafs gaze against my back like a hand hot and close i didnt look back nothing ahead of me could be worse than watching olaf paw through the womans remains knowing that he was thinking of me while he did it bradley led me to a door that had been halftorn out of its hinges something big had pushed through here bradley had to use both hands to get the door to one side it seemed to have settled into the carpet wedging itself he jerked back and i jumped pulse in my throat damn splinters he held up the palm of his gloved hand and there was a small crimson spot on the plastic he jerked the glove off the splinter seemed to have come off with the glove but it was bleeding freely some splinter i said dammit bradley looked at me you better let somebody look at it he nodded but didnt turn to go dont be insulted but not everyone is happy with me forcing you back on this case i cant leave you alone in here with evidence if there were ever questions raised it would be hard to explain ive never pocketed evidence from a crime scene in my life im sorry anita but i cant take the chance will you follow me out to the ambulance he was having to cup one hand under the other to catch the blood so it didnt reach the carpet i frowned but nodded fine he started to say something then turned and walked back to the living room we were about a fourth of the way through the room when edward asked otto wants to open the table cloth and see whats inside ill send the photographer and agent franklin in to oversee it bradley kept going for the door having to hurry a little to keep his own blood from contaminating the scene neither edward nor olaf nor the uniform that had magically appeared to watch them fondle the evidence asked how hed hurt his hand maybe no one cared i followed bradley across the gravel turnaround to the ambulance there i were still too many people mulling around outside shouldnt they be out searching for the creature it wasnt my job to tell them their job but this was the freshest crime scene yet and there just didnt seem to be enough frantic activity to suit me bradley sat down at the end of the ambulance and let the techs treat his wound because it was a wound splinter my ass hed stabbed himself i tried to be a good girl and just stand there but i think my impatience showed because bradley started talking we did send people out to search when we arrived and we arrived damn quick i didnt say anything he smiled then grimaced as the emt did something to his hand that hurt walk far enough away from the house to give a look then come back and tell me what you see i looked at him he motioned me off with his good hand i shrugged and started walking the heat was like a weight across my shoulders but without humidity it just wasnt as bad the gravel crunched under my feet louder than it should have been i walked in the opposite direction from the horse corral the horses were still running in their endless chase like a maniac merrygoround i threaded my way through the cars marked and unmarked the fire truck had driven away i wasnt sure why it had been here in the first place though sometimes when you call you get more emergency vehicles than you need especially if the caller panics and isnt specific enough i stopped beside the silent revolving lights of a car who had called the police did we actually have a witness if we did why hadnt anyone mentioned it if we didnt then who had called for help i walked until the hot dry wind rustling through the clumps of grass was louder than the electric squawk of radios i stopped and turned back towards the house the cars were small enough that i could have covered one of them with my hand id probably walked farther out than i needed to go far enough out that if i yelled for help they might not hear me not bright i should walk further in but i needed to be clear of it for awhile i needed to be out in the wind alone i compromised i drew the browning and put off the safety pointing the barrel at the ground onehanded now i could enjoy the solitude and still be safe though truthfully i wasnt sure if what we were chasing gave a damn about bullets silver or otherwise bradley had said to look i looked the ranch lay in a large round valley or maybe a plateau since wed had to drive up some hills to get here whichever the land stretched flat and smooth for miles to the rim of distant hills of course id been surprised by distances here so maybe the hills were really mountains and the land stretched for a very long way in every direction there were no trees there was almost no vegetation above thigh height to me whatever had taken that door out had been big bigger than a man though not by much i turned in a slow circle scanning the ground and there was nowhere for something that large to hide theyd walked this ground when they first arrived full of confidence that the creature couldnt have gotten far they marched out and out and out and found nothing the helicopter buzzed overhead high enough that it didnt disturb the wind but low enough that i was pretty sure it was looking at me they were looking for anything unusual and i was standing out here by myself unusual enough the helicopter circled a few times then buzzed off to search somewhereelse i looked out at the empty land there was nowhere to hide where had it gone where could it have gone underground maybe or it flew away if it flew away i couldnt help them find it but if it went underground caves or an old well maybe id suggest it to bradley and probably be told that theyd checked it but hey i was here to offer suggestions wasnt i i heard someone behind me and whirled i had the gun halfway up when i recognized detective ramirez he had his hands up and to each side away from his gun i let out the breath id been holding and holstered the gun sorry thats okay he said he was wearing another white dress shirt with the sleeves rolled back over dark strong forearms the tie was a different color but it still hung loose like a necklace and the top two buttons of his shirt were open so that you could see the smooth hollow of his throat no its not im not usually this jumpy i hugged myself not because i was cold far from it but because i badly wanted someone to hold me i wanted to be comforted edward had many uses comfort was not one of them ramirez came up beside me he didnt try and touch me just stood very close and looked out over the land where i was looking he spoke still staring out in the distance the case getting to you i nodded yeah i dont know why he gave a sharp laugh and turned to me face halfway between astonishment and humor you dont know why i frowned at him no i dont he shook his head smiling but his eyes were gentle anita this is an awful case ive never seen anything this bad ive seen things as bad as the vivisected victims the ones that died his face sobered youve seen things that bad before i nodded what about the mutilations he asked his face was very serious now his smooth nearly blackbrown eyes watched my face i shook my head ive never seen anything like the survivors i laughed but it wasnt a happy sound if survivor is the word for them what kind of life are they going to have if they live i hugged myself tighter staring at the ground trying not to think ive been having nightmares ramirez said i looked up at him police dont admit things like that often especially not to civilian consultants that theyve just met we looked at each other and his eyes were so gentle so genuine unless he was a much better actor than i thought he was ramirez was letting me see the real him i appreciated it but didnt know how to say it out loud you dont verbalize something like that the best you can do is return the favor the trouble was i wasnt sure what the real me was anymore i didnt know what to put in my eyes i didnt know what to let him see i finally stopped trying to pick and choose and think i settled for confused bordering on scared he touched my shoulder lightly when i didnt say anything he moved into me wrapping his arms across my back holding me against him i stayed stiff in his arms for a second or two but didnt pull away i relaxed against him in inches until my head rested in the curve of his neck my arms tentatively around his waist he whispered it will be all right anita i shook my head against his shoulder i dont think so he tried to see my face but i was standing too close at too awkward an angle i pulled back so he could see my face and suddenly i felt awkward standing there with my arms around a stranger i pulled away and he let me go only keeping the fingers of one hand grasped in his he gave my hand a little shake talk to me anita please ive been doing cases like this for about five years when im not looking at the messily dead im hunting vampires rogue shapeshifters you name it his was holding my hand solidly now wrapped in the warmth of his skin i didnt pull away i needed something human to hold onto i tried to put into words what id been thinking for awhile now a lot of cops never use their guns not in thirty years ive lost count of how many people ive killed his hand tightened on mine but he didnt interrupt when i started out i thought vampires were monsters i really believed it but lately im not so sure and regardless of what they are they look very human i could get a call tomorrow that would send me down to the morgue to put a stake through the heart of a body that looks every bit as human as you and me once ive got a court order of execution i am legally sanctioned to shoot and kill the vampire or vampires in question and anyone that stands in my way that includes human servants or people with just a bite on them one bite two bites they can be healed cured but ive killed them to save myself to save others you did what you had to do i nodded maybe maybe but that doesnt really matter anymore it doesnt matter whether im right to do it or not just because its a righteous kill doesnt mean it doesnt affect you i use to think that if i was right it would he enough but its not he drew me a little closer with his hand what are you saying i smiled i need a vacation he laughed then and it was a good laugh open and joyous nothing special about it but his own astonishment id heard better laughs but none when i needed it more a vacation just a vacation i shrugged i dont see myself taking up flower arranging detective ramirez hernando he said i nodded hernando this is part of who i am i realized we were still holding hands and i drew away from him he let me no protest maybe if i take a break ill be able to do it again what if a vacation isnt enough he asked ill cross that bridge when i come to it it wasnt just the brutal day in and day out of the job my reaction to bernardos body and letting a perfect stranger comfort me were so unlike me i was missing the guys but it was more than that when i left richard i left the pack all my werewolf friends when i left jeanclaude i lost all the vamps and strangely one or two of them were friends you can be friends with a vampire as long as you remember that they are monsters and not human beings how you can do both at the same time i cant really explain but i manage i hadnt just cut myself off from the men in my life for six months id cut myself off from my friends even ronnie veronica sims one of my few human friends had a new hot romance she was dating richards best friend which made socializing awkward catherine my lawyer and friend had only been married two years and i didnt like to interfere with her and bob youre thinking something very serious ramirez said i blinked and looked at him just realizing how isolated i am even back home here i am so i shook my head without finishing it he smiled youre only isolated if you want to be anita ive offered to show you the local sights i shook my head thanks really under other circumstances id say yes whats stopping you he asked the case for one if i start dating one of the local cops then my credibility goes down the tubes and im not too high on some lists already what else he had a very gentle face soft as if he would be very gentle in everything he did ive got two men waiting back home waiting to see who im going to choose or if im dumping both of them his eyes widened two im impressed i shook my head dont be my personal life is a mess sorry to hear that i cant believe i just told you all that it isnt like me im a good listener yeah you are may i escort you back i smiled at the oldfashioned phrasing can you answer some questions first ask he sat down on the ground in his dark brown pants lifting the pant legs so they wouldnt bunch i sat down beside him who called the police a guest where is he or she hospital severe shock brought on by trauma no physical injuries i asked he shook his head who were the mutilation vics this time the wifes brother and two nephews all over twenty they lived and worked on the ranch what about the other guests where were they he closed his eyes as if visualizing the page most of them were off on a planned outing an overnight camping trip into the mountains but the rest borrowed the ranch cars that are kept for the guests use and left let me guess i said they just felt restless jittery had to get out of the house ramirez nodded just like the neighbors around all the other houses its a spell ramirez i said dont make me ask you again to use my first name i smiled and looked away from the teasing look in his eyes hernando this is either a spell or some sort of ability the creature possesses to cause fear dread in the ones it doesnt want to kill or hurt but im betting on a spell why because its too selective to be a natural anxiety like a vampires ability to hypnotize with its eyes a vamp can bespell one person or a room full of people but it cant do an entire street except for one house its too exact you need to be able to organize your magic for this and that means a spell he picked one of the roughlooking blades of grass running it between his fingers so were looking for a witch i know something about wiccan and other flavors of witchcraft and i dont know any way a lone wiccan or even a coven could do this im not saying there isnt a human spell worker involved somewhere but there is definitely something otherworldly nonhuman at work here we got some blood traces off the broken door i nodded great i wish someone would tell me when we find a clue everyone including ted is playing it so close to the chest ive spent most of my time going over ground that someone else has already figured out ask me and ill tell you anything you want to know he tossed the grass blade to the ground but we better be getting back before you get a worse reputation than just dating me i didnt argue put any woman in an area run mostly by men and rumors will fly unless you make it very clear that you are off limits there is also a certain competitiveness that sets in some men are either trying to run you out of town or get into your pants they dont seem to know any other way to deal with a woman if youre not a sexual object youre a threat always makes me wonder what kind of childhoods they had hernando stood brushing grass and dirt off the back of his pants he seemed to have had a dandy childhood or at least hed turned out well congrats to his parents someday hed bring home a nice girl and have nice children in a nice house with yard work on the weekends and every sunday dinner at one set of grandparents or another a nice life if you can get it and he still got to solve murders talk about having it all what did i have what did i really have i was too young for a midlife crisis and too old for an attack of conscience we started walking back towards the cars i was hugging my arms again and had to force myself to stop i lowered my arms to my sides and walked along beside ramirez ah hernando like nothing was wrong marks said that one of the first cops on the scene had his throat nearly bitten out how did that happen i wasnt here for the first rush the lieutenant waited to call me in there was a trace of harshness in his voice he was gentle but not if you pushed him but i heard that the three living victims attacked the cops they had to subdue them with batons they just kept trying to take pieces out of them why would they do that how would they do it i mean you skin most people and rip off pieces they arent going to feel like fighting i helped pick up some of the earlier survivors and they didnt fight they just lay there and moaned they were hurt and they acted hurt have they ever traced down thad bromwell the son of the first scene i saw hernandos eyes widened marks didnt call you i shook my head he is such a shithead i agreed what did they find the body hes alive he was away on a camping trip with friends hes alive i said then whose soul had i seen hovering in the bedroom i didnt say it out loud because id forgotten to mention the soul to the police marks had been ready to chase me out of town if id started talking about souls floating near the ceiling hed have gotten matches and a stake but someone had died in that room and the soul was still confused about where to go most of the time if the soul hovers it hovers over the body the remains only three people lived in the house two of them mutilated and the boy somewhere else i had an idea these new mutilation victims they kept fighting kept trying to take bites out of the officers he nodded are you sure about the bites not just hitting but like they were trying to feed i dont know about feeding but it was all bite wounds he was looking at me strangely youve thought of something i nodded i may have i have to see the other body the one behind the door first but then i think its time to go back to the hospital why i started walking again and he grabbed my arm turned me to face him there was fierceness in his eyes an intensity that trembled down his arm youve only been here a couple of days ive been dealing with this for weeks what do you know that i dont i looked at his hand until he let me go but i told him he was having nightmares about this shit and i hadnt gotten to that point yet im an animator i raise zombies for a living my specialty is the dead one thing that the living dead have in common with one other from zombie to ghoul to vampire is that they must feed off the living to sustain themselves zombies dont eat people he said if a zombie is raised and the animator that raised it cant control it then it can go wild it becomes a flesheating zombie i thought that was just stories i shook my head no ive seen it what are you saying im saying that maybe there are no survivors maybe there are just dead and the living dead he actually went pale i touched his elbow to steady him but he stood straight im all right im all right he looked at me what do you do with a flesheating zombie once its gone amok there isnt anything anyone can do except destroy it the only way to do that is fire napalm is good but any fire will do theyll never let us roast these people not unless we can prove what im saying is true how can you prove it he asked im not sure yet but ill talk to doctor evans and well come up with something why would the earlier vics be docile and these new ones be vicious i dont know unless the spell or the monster is changing maybe growing stronger i just dont know hernando if im right about there being no survivors then ive had my brilliant idea for the day he nodded face very serious he stared at the ground jesus if they are all dead then that means that this thing were after is making more of itself id be surprised if it was ever human but maybe i dont know i do know that if it is growing stronger and the skinned ones are growing more violent i then the creature may be controlling them we looked at each other ill call the hospital and get more men down there call the santa fe hospital too he nodded and broke into a halfrun across the gravel moving through the cars like he had a purpose the other cops were watching him as if wondering what the rush was i hadnt asked hernando if theyd checked for underground hiding places shit i went to find bradley and ask him then id go back into the house one last time see the last body and then off to the hospital to answer the ageold question what is life and when is death a sure thing the mans face stared up at me eyes wide glazed unseeing his head was still attached to his spine but the chest had been split open as though two great hands had dug into his rib cage and pulled the heart was missing the lungs had been ripped probably when the rib cage gave the stomach had been punctured giving a sour smell to the smaller room the liver and intestines lay in a wet heap to one side of the body as if they had all spilled out at the same time the lower intestine still curled down inside the lower end of the body cavity by smell alone i was pretty sure that the intestines hadnt been pierced i sat back on my heels beside the body blood had splattered the lower half of the mans face drops of it scattering across the rest of his face and into his graying hair violent very violent and very quick i stared into his sightless eyes and felt nothing i was back to being numb and i was not complaining i think if id seen this body first then id have been horrified but the remains in the dining room had just used me up for the day this was awful but there were worse things and those things were in the next room but it wasnt the body that was interesting it was the room there was a circle of salt around the body a book lay within the circle covered so thickly in blood that i couldnt read the pages it was opened to theyd taken all the pictures and videos they were going to in this room so i used borrowed gloves to raise the book up it was bound with embossed leather but there was no title the middle half of the book had soaked so much blood up that the pages were sticking together i didnt try and pry them apart the police and the feds had technicians for delicate work i was careful not to close the book and lose the place the man was probably reading from for all i knew the book had been on the desk that the man shoved against the door and it had simply fallen to the floor opening on its own but to think that meant we had no clue so wed all pretend we were sure that the man had deliberately opened the book in the middle of being chased by a monster that had just butchered his wife he went for this book opened it started to read why the book was handwritten and i read enough to know that it was a book of shadows it was the spell book sort of of a practicing witch one that followed an older or more orthodox tradition than the neopagan movement gardian or alexandrian maybe though again i couldnt be sure id had one semester in college on comparative witchcraft though now im sure they called it comparative wiccan of the wiccan practitioners i knew personally none of them practiced anything this traditional i put the book carefully back whered id found it and stood the bookshelves against the near wall were full of books on psychic research the preternatural mythology folklore and wicca i had some of the same books at home so the books alone werent proof of much but the clincher was the altar it was an antique wooden chest with a silk cloth over the top there were silver candlesticks with partially burned candles in them the candles had runes carved into them other than the fact that they were runes i couldnt read them there was a round mirror with no frame sitting flat between the candles there was a small bowl of dried herbs to one side a larger bowl of water and a small carved box tight shut is that what i think it is bradley asked an altar he was a practitioner i think that book is his book of shadows his spell book for lack of a better term what happened here theres salt in the floor of the dining room thats not unusual bradley said no but a salt circle is i think he was somewhere further back in the house he heard his wife screaming or heard the monsters something alerted him he didnt come running with a gun bradley he came running with a handful of salt maybe he had something else in his hands or on his person some charm or amulet i dont see it but that doesnt mean its not here are you saying he threw salt at this thing yes why for gods sake salt and flame are two of our oldest purifying agents i use salt to bind a zombie back into its grave you can throw it on fairies fetches a whole host of critters and it will make them hesitate maybe not much more so he threw salt and maybe some charm at the creature then what i think thats why the monster stopped and why the tablecloth full of trophies is still sitting by the table why didnt the monster go back and get the trophies after he killed the man i dont know maybe he finished the spell before he died maybe he drove it from the house id like to get a real wiccan in here to look over the scene wiccan you mean witch yes but most of them prefer the term wiccan politically correct bradley said i nodded yeah what could a real wiccan tell us that you cant she might know what spell he used if the spell drove the thing from the house then we might be able to use a version of the same spell to trap or even destroy it something this man did drove the creature out of this house before it was ready to go he forced it to leave behind its goody bag and to leave without gutting his body its the first weakness weve seen in this thing franklin wont like bringing in a witch neither will the locals if i force everyone to bring this wiccan in and it doesnt work or she talks to the media then the next time you see me i wont be an fbi agent arent you supposed to try every angle to solve this crime isnt that your job the fbi doesnt use witches anita i shook my head how the hell did you get me in then forrester had already brought you in on the case all i had to do was stand up to marks and franklin i said he nodded i outrank franklin then why is he so snotty it seems to be a natural talent of his i dont want to get you fired bradley i went to the overturned desk and started opening the drawers there was a gun cabinet in the living room most people who had a cabinet full of them kept one for personal protection what are you looking for he asked i opened the larger bottom drawer and there it was come here bradley he came to peer into the drawer the gun was a mm smith and wesson it lay on the side of the drawer where it had fallen when the desk tipped over bradley stared down at the gun maybe its not loaded maybe he had the ammo locked in the living room can i touch it he nodded i lifted it and just by the weight i was pretty sure it was loaded but it wasnt a gun i was familiar with so i popped the clip and showed it to bradley full he said voice soft full i slid the clip back inside the gun hitting it sharply with the palm of my hand to make it click he had a loaded mm in his desk but he grabbed salt and his book of shadows he didnt waste time grabbing for the gun he either knew what the thing was or he sensed something about it and knew the gun wouldnt work and that the spell would i raised the gun up so that bradley looked at it the barrel pointed at the ceiling the spell worked bradley we need to know what it was and the only way to know that is to get a witch in here cant you take the book and just show her pictures what if the position of the book is important what if there are clues to the spell in the circle itself i dont practice this kind of ritual magic bradley for all i know if you get someone in here they may be able to sense something that i cant do you really want to take the chance that pictures and just seeing the book in their own home will be just as good as seeing it here like this youre asking me to risk my career i am asking you to risk your career i said but im also asking you to not risk any more innocent lives do you really want to see this done to another couple another family how can you be so sure that this is the key im not sure but its the closest thing weve seen to a break in this case id hate to lose it because of career jitters its not just that anita if we use anything more exotic than psychics and we fail then the entire unit could be disbanded i placed the gun in his hand he stared at it i trust you to do the right thing bradley thats why youre one of the good guys he shook his head and to think i blackmailed marks to get you back on the case you knew i was a pain in the ass when you fought to get me back on the case its one of my many charms that earned me a weak smile he was still holding the gun flat across his hand his fingers tightened around it you know any witches in the area i grinned at him no but i bet ted does i shook my head ive never hugged an fbi agent but im tempted that made him smile but his eyes stayed cautious unhappy i was asking a lot from him i touched his arm i wouldnt ask you to bring in a witch if i didnt think it was our best shot i wouldnt ask just on a whim he gave me a long look i know you are one of the least whimsical people ive ever met i would say you should see me when im not neck deep in corpses but it doesnt really matter i dont get much lighter than this ive checked the cases youve helped the st louis pd solve anita gruesome stuff how old are you now i frowned at the question then answered it twentysix how long have you been helping the police about four years the bureau switches its agents off the serial killer shit about every two years whether they want to transfer or not then after a break they can come back you think i need a break everyone burns out eventually anita even you actually im thinking about a vacation when i get home he nodded thats good i looked up at him do i look like i need a break ive seen it before in other agents eyes seen what i asked like your eyes are a cup and every horror you see is another drop added your eyes are full of the things youve seen the things youve clone get out while theres still some room for things that dont bleed that is damn poetic for an fbi agent one friend stayed with it until he had a heart attack i think im a little young for that i said another friend ate his gun we stared at each other im not the suicidal type i also dont want to see you in jail my eyes widened whoa i do not know what youre talking about the state department confirmed otto jefferies is a retired government worker but they couldnt access the rest of his file at the present time ive got a friend at the state department with a level two secret clearance he couldnt access otto jefferies files either hes a total black out which means hes a spook of some kind you do not want to get involved with the spooks anita if they try to recruit you say no dont try to find out who otto really is or what he did dont get nosy or youll end up in a hole somewhere just work with him leave him alone and move on you sound like youre talking from personal experience i said he shook his head im not going to talk about it you brought it up i said i told you just enough to get your attention i hope just trust me on this stay the fuck away from these people i nodded its okay bradley i dont like otto and he hates women so dont worry i dont think it would occur to him to try and recruit me good he put the gun back in the desk drawer and closed it besides i said what would the top secret set want with me he looked at me and it was a look that i wasnt used to getting the look said i was being naive anita you can raise the dead so i can think of a half a dozen uses for that one talent alone like what prisoner dies in interrogation doesnt matter raise him up again a world leader is assassinated we need a few days to get our troops ready raise the leader for a few days give us time to control the panic or stop the revolution zombies are not alive bradley they couldnt pass for a countrys leader from a distance for two or three days dont even try and say you couldnt pull that off i wouldnt do it i said even if it meant that hundreds of lives could be saved or hundreds of americans could be evacuated in safety i looked at him i i dont know no matter how good the cause seems at the beginning anita eventually it wont be eventually when youre so far in you cant see daylight theyll ask things of you that you wont want to do i was hugging myself again which irritated me no one had approached me to do anything on an international level olaf thought i was good for only one thing and that did not include helping the government but it did make me wonder how edward had met him edward was spooky but was he a spook i looked up at bradleys so serious face ill be careful then i had a thought did someone approach you about me i was thinking about offering you a job with us i raised eyebrows at him he laughed yeah after looking through your file it was decided that youre too independent too much a wild card it was decided that you not thrive in a bureaucratic setting you got that right but i am flattered you thought of me his face went back to serious and there were lines in his face that i hadnt seen before it made him look forty plus most of the time he didnt your file got flagged anita it got moved up the line i dont know where to or who asked for it but there is government work out there for the independent wild card if they have specialized enough skills i opened my mouth closed it and finally said id say you were joking but youre not are you he shook his head i wish i was edward had said that he wouldnt have brought olaf in if hed known i was coming it made it sound like olaf had been invited in not volunteered but id ask edward id make sure thank you for telling me bradley i dont know much about this stuff but i know youre taking a chance telling me at all i had to tell you anita you see it was me that pulled your file in the first place i was the one that pushed to get you invited in i brought you to someones attention for that i am heartily sorry its okay bradley you didnt know he gave a small shake of his head and the look on his face was bitter but i should have i didnt know what to say to that it turned out i didnt have to say anything bradley walked out of the room i waited a second or two then followed him out but i couldnt shake the unease hed meant to scare me and hed succeeded it was all big brother watching and paranoia he already had me wondering if olaf had invited himself or even if edward could have been asked to recruit me it wouldnt surprise me that edward worked for the government at least part time he took money from anyone it would have seemed silly if i hadnt seen the look on bradleys face if he hadnt told me about my file he said file like everyone had a file maybe they did but someone had requested my file i had a sudden image of my life my crimes all printed in neat type crossing one shadowy desk after another until it reached where or would the question be who blake anita blake it even sounded funny of course the federal government has never been known for its sense of humor edward let me drive his hummer to the hospital he stayed behind to wait for the witch she was donnas friend so hed play ted and hold her hand through the crime scene it would be her very first crime scene talk about being thrown in at the deep end to sink or swim even id had a gentler introduction to police work than this olaf stayed to commune with the bodies fine with me i did not want to be in a car or any small confined space with olaf without edward along to chaperone i think the police and the feds would have gladly given him to me for the ride though all hed really done was confirm my supposition that the killer would not have willingly left his trophies behind though olaf knew less about magic than i did he didnt know why the killer left i was the only one with a scenario for that and even i would be relieved if the wicca practitioner seconded my opinion if she didnt then we were truly out of guesses in fact almost no one wanted to go with me franklin thought i was nuts what did i mean the survivors werent survivors but the living dead bradley wasnt willing to leave franklin as the ranking agent on site the geology maps were on the way and i dont think he wanted franklin in charge of the search marks wouldnt leave the scene to the feds and he also thought i was nuts ramirez and one uniform followed me in an unmarked car i didnt really think theyd find the monster there had been no track no tracks meant either it could fly or it dematerialized either way they werent going to find it not on foot not with maps so i felt free to go to the hospital another reason to go into albuquerque was that edward had found me a name a man who was known as a brujo a witch donna had only given ted the name on the condition it would not be used to harm the man shed only been given the name on the strict understanding that no harm would come to him the one who gave up the name didnt want the brujo to come back and hurt her he would work evil spells for money as well as personal vengeance if you could prove in court that he performed real magic for nefarious purpose it was an automatic death sentence his name was nicandro baco and he was supposed to be a necromancer if he were hed be the first one other than me that id ever met the name came with one other warning be careful of him he was much more dangerous than he looked just what i needed a necromancer with an attitude oh wait i was a necromancer with an attitude if he got shitty with me wed see who was the bigger fish was that a chip on my shoulder or overconfidence wed see oh and bernardo went with me he sat in the passenger seat slumped down until the seatbelt id insisted he wear cut across his neck his handsome face was set in a scowl arms crossed over his chest i think hed have crossed his legs if hed had room words like closedoff brooding came to mind shadows stretched across the road though there were no trees or buildings to cast them it was like the shadows just spilled out of the earth itself to lie across the road like a promise of the night to come if you went by the watch on my wrist it was early evening if you went by the level of daylight it was late afternoon we had about three hours of daylight left i drove through the gathering shadows with a feeling of urgency pressing against me i wanted to be at the hospital before dark i didnt know why and i didnt question it we were being followed by a police car surely they could fix the ticket it was frightening how quickly and smoothly the car went over eighty without me noticing it there was something about the roads and the way they spilled out and out across the empty landscape that made lower speeds seem like crawling i kept it at a solid eighty and ramirez kept up with me he seemed to be the only one who believed me maybe he felt the urgency too the silence in the car wasnt exactly companionable but it wasnt uncomfortable either besides i had enough problems without playing crying shoulder for one of edwards sociopathic friends bernardo broke the silence i saw you and that detective getting it on there in the grass i frowned at him he was watching me with hostile eyes i think he was trying to pick a fight though i didnt know why we were not getting it on i said looked pretty cozy to me jealous i asked his face hardened thinning into angry lines so you do sleep around just not with us bad guys i shook my head it was a comforting hug not that its any of your business didnt think you were the comforting hug type im not so he said so this case is getting to me i hear that he said i glanced at him his face was turned away only a thin rim of profile showing through his hair like the moon just before it goes dark i turned back to the road if he didnt want eye contact fine with me i thought you were avoiding the pictures and forensic stuff i said ive been here two weeks longer than you have ive seen the pictures ive seen the bodies i dont need to see it all again what exactly did you and edward quarrel about today quarrel he said and gave a low chuckle yeah you could say we quarreled what about i dont know why the hell im here tell me what or who to shoot and ill do it ill even guard bodies if the price is right but theres nothing to shoot at nothing but dead bodies i dont know shit about magic i thought you were a licensed bounty hunter that specialized in preternatural critters i was with edward when he cleaned out a nest of lycanthropes in arizona fifteen of them we mowed them down with machine guns and grenades he had an almost wistful tone to his voice ah the good ol days before that id killed two rogue lycanthropes but afterwards i got a lot of calls for this shit i took the ones that were basically just hits the only difference was that the vic wasnt human those i could handle but i am not a detective call me in when the kill is in sight and ill be there but not this this fucking waiting around looking for clues who the hell looks for clues were assassins not sherlock holmes he shifted in his seat and struggled to sit up straighter arms still holding himself tight he did the headshake to get the hair back away from his face the headshake is a very feminine gesture a man has to be muy macho for it not to be bernardo managed maybe he assumed that since you helped him out with the shapeshifters that youd be useful with this he was wrong i shrugged then go home i cant i glanced at him i could see most of his profile and it was a nice one you owe him a favor too yes mind me asking what sort of favor same as you you killed one of his other backups he nodded and had to run his hands through his hair to slide it back from his face want to talk about it why he looked at me and his face for one of the few times wasnt teasing but serious even solemn he looked less handsome without the smile and glow in his eyes but he also seemed more real being real will get me into trouble faster than any amount of charm do you want to talk about how you killed harley he asked not really then why did you ask you seem uptight i thought it might help to talk or is that just a girl thing he smiled and it almost reached his eyes i think its a girl thing because i dont want to talk about it okay lets talk about something else what he was staring out the far window now one shoulder pressed against the glass the road went down between two hills and the world was suddenly dark gray we were literally running out of daylight but this last attack had most definitely been a daylight attack so why was i so worried about the coming night maybe it was just years of hunting vampires where darkness meant that we humans no longer had any advantage i hoped it was just old habits but the fluttering in my stomach didnt think that was it how long have you known edward i asked about six years shit i said he looked at me then whats wrong ive known him for five i was hoping youd known him longer he grinned at me wanting to pump me for information eh something like that he turned in the seatbelt until most of his body was facing me one leg drawn up into the seat let me pump you and you can pump me all you want his voice had dropped a notch or two his head was to one side the hair sweeping across the seat like black fur i shook my head youre horny and im available that isnt very flattering bernardo he moved back in his seat sweeping his hair back to his side of the seat now that is a girl thing what is complicating things needing the sex to be about something more than sex i dont know i know a guy or two that make it just as complicated you dont sound happy with him or them did edward call you before olaf or after i asked after but youre changing the subject no im not edward is an expert on people he knows who to call for any given situation for any kill olaf makes sense i make sense you dont make sense he knows that this isnt your type of crime you lost me edward encouraged me to sleep with you bernardo looked at me shocked i think nice to know he could be edward match making we are talking about the same edward right maybe donna has changed him i said nothing changes edward hes a mountain hes just there i nodded true but he wasnt encouraging me to pick out curtains with you he said and i quote what you need is a nice uncomplicated fuck bernardos eyebrows went up into his hair edward said that yeah he did he was looking at me now i could feel his gaze on me even while watching the road it wasnt sexual now it was intense i had his attention are you saying that edward brought me on to tempt you i dont know maybe maybe im wrong maybe its just a coincidence but hes not happy with my choice of lovers first there are no coincidences when it comes to edward second who could you possibly be sleeping with that would bother edward he wouldnt care if you were doing your dog i ignored the last comment because i couldnt think of a comeback for it though notice i didnt disagree usually edward just wanted to know if you could shoot anything else was not important ill answer your question if you answer mine first try me you may look like the cover boy for the native american gq but theres no sense of you coming from a different culture too white for you and his voice was angry id touched the chip on his shoulder look my mothers family is mexican american and you have a sense of their culture when you interact with them my fathers family is german and theyll say things do things that are sort of european or have a foreign flavor to them you dont seem to have any specific culture or background you talk like generic middle america like television or something he looked at me and he was angry now my mother was white my father was indian im told he died before i was born she gave me up at birth no one wanted a little mixed baby so i went from one foster home to another when i was eighteen i joined the army they found out i could shoot i killed things for my country for a few years then i went freelance and here i am his voice had grown increasingly bitter until it almost hurt to hear it saying i was sorry would have been insulting saying i understood would have been a lie thanks for answering the question seemed wrong too nothing to say he asked shocked sorry for me give me a little pity sex i looked at him then it someone has sex with you it isnt out of pity and you damn well know it but you dont want to have sex with me its not because of your ethnicity or lack thereof or your background ive got two guys waiting for me at home two is one too many three would be ridiculous why doesnt edward like them bernardo asked ones a werewolf and the other is a vampire my words were bland but i watched his face long enough to see the reaction he gaped at me he finally closed his mouth and said youre the executioner scourge of the undead how can you be doing a vampire im not sure i can answer that question even to myself but currently im not doing him at all did you think the werewolf was human was he trying to pass at first but not for long i knew what he was when i took him to my bed he let out a low whistle edward hates the monsters but i didnt think hed give a damn if one of his backups slept with them he cares i dont know why but he does so he thought what that one night with me would change your religion make you swear off the monsters he was staring at me now studying my face ive heard that shapeshifters can change the shape of their bodies at will is that true some of them can i said we were in the outskirts of albuquerque strip malls and fast food restaurants can your boyfriend yes can he change the shape of all his body at will i felt the blush roll up my neck into my face and couldnt stop it bernardo laughed i guess he can no comment he was still laughing softly to himself a very masculine chuckle is your vampire an old one four hundred years and counting i said wed left the strip malls behind and turned into a residential area we were coming up to the first landmark on the directions edward had given me wed used up nearly an hour of daylight i almost drove past the turnoff to nicandro bacos place but if i was right if the thing we were dealing with was another type of undead from any that id ever heard of then another necromancer might be nice to have around for all i knew this type of undead was a regional specialty and baco would know more than i did i turned checking the rearview to see that ramirez was still behind me we were actually all going the speed limit can you read the directions to me i asked he didnt answer just picked the piece of paper up off the dashboard and began reading off street names youre safe on the directions for a little bit lets get back to our little talk i frowned at him do we have to let me get this straight bernardo said youve been shacking up with a shapeshifter that has such fine control of his body that he can make any one part of it bigger or smaller i said i was counting streetlights under my breath didnt want to miss the turn we had time to see this guy and get to the hospital before dark but not if we got badly lost no man makes things smaller during sex i dont care what he is hes still male i shrugged i was not going to discuss richards size with bernardo the only person i had discussed it with had been ronnie and that had been over much giggling while she shared embarrassing facts about her boyfrieind louie it has been my experience that women tell more intimate details to their friends than men do men may brag more but women will talk the nitty gritty and share the experience more so where was i bernardo said ah youre doing this shapeshifter that has such fine control of his body that he can make any part bigger or smaller at will i squirmed in the seat but finally nodded bernardo smiled happily and youre doing a vampire that has been having sex for over four hundred years he suddenly sounded fauxbritish can one assume that he is wellskilled by now the blush that had been fading came back with a burn id almost have welcomed darkness to hide behind yes i said shit girlfriend i may be good but im not that good i am just a poor mortal boy i cant compete with the lord of the undead and the wolfman we were in a section of town that seemed nearly deserted gas station with bars on the windows and graffiti spread across everything like a contagious disease the storefront across from it had boarded up windows and more graffiti the afternoon was still thick with reflected sunlight but somehow the light didnt quite reach the street as if there was something here that kept it at bay the skin on my back crept so hard i jumped whats wrong bernardo asked i shook my head my mouth was suddenly dry i knew we had arrived before he called out there it is los duendos the dwarves the air was thick and oppressive with the weight of magic death magic either they had just killed something to gain power for a spell or they were actively working with the dead right at this very moment since the sun was still up that was a trick most animators couldnt raise the dead until after dark theoretically i am powerful enough to raise the dead at high noon but i dont i was told once that the only reason i couldnt do it was that i believed i couldnt do it but nicandro baco didnt seem to share my doubts maybe i wouldnt be the biggest fish after all now i got an attack of the doubts too late to get edward down here for backup if baco got a whiff of police hed either run be uncooperative or try to hurt us his power breathed along my body and i was still sitting in the car what was he going to be like in person bad how bad as the old saying goes only one way to find out id pulled into a deserted parking lot about two blocks down and around the corner from the bar ramirez had pulled in beside me and he and the uniform officer rigby walked over to us rigby was medium height well built and moved like he worked out he had an easy confidence and a ready smile that went all the way to his eyes he was entirely too comfortable in his own skin as if nothing really bad had ever touched him he lacked entirely that air that most policemen have of having been ridden hard and put up wet he looked older than i was but his eyes were younger and i resented that ramirez had spent his drive time checking out nicandro baco alias nicky baco he was suspected of murders but witnesses had a strange way of disappearing or forgetting what theyd seen he was associated with a local biker gang ah club biker gangs now preferred the more politically correct term of club according to ramirez the local club was called los lobos not to be confused with the music group ramirez said id blinked at him then i got the joke oh yeah los lobos the music group he looked at me are you all right i nodded even two blocks away i could feel a touch of bacos magic i was betting if someone took the time theyd find spells charms wards set up here and there in the surrounding area i didnt think he was aware of me yet i think the only reason id sensed him so strongly was he was in the middle of a spell the charms were scattered around the neighborhood to give off a certain unease he might have literally driven the other businesses out of business illegal as well as unethical of course why hed want to destroy the entire economy of the area surrounding his bar was a mystery to me id worry about it later murder and mayhem first possible real estate scam later some days you just have to prioritize the lobos are small and local but theyve got a bad rep ramirez said how bad i asked drug running murder murder for hire assault assault with a deadly attempted murder rape kidnapping bernardo said kidnapping as if the other crimes were to be expected but not the last ramirez looked at him and his eyes went from friendly to cool he didnt like bernardo for some reason we think they abducted a teenage girl but nobody ever surfaced and the only witness just saw her being dragged into a van that looked like one that their leader roland sanchez owned at the time but a lot of people own gray vans have you had a lot of disappearing teenage girls i asked our share but no we havent noticed a pattern of young women being abducted by the gang im not saying they wont do it but theyre not making a habit of it glad to hear it i said ramirez smiled youre armed and he handed me a slender cellphone press this button and itll call this phone he held up a matching phone rigby and i will come running with backup my eyes flicked to rigby who actually tipped his hat at me at your service maam maam either he was five years younger than he looked or he used maam for all women i turned from his peaceful eyes to ramirez his eyes were kind but they werent peaceful hed seen too much of life for true tranquility i liked his eyes better youre not going to try and argue me out of just bernardo and i walking into the bar we suspect baco of using magic to kill people that is an automatic death sentence if he gets a whiff of police then hell clam up and start asking for a lawyer if you want information from him youll have to play ordinary citizen now if you planned to go in there alone without bernardo or some man with you then id argue i frowned at him i can take care of myself he shook his head in the world that this gang runs in women do not exist except through men my frown deepened youve lost me all women are either someones mother daughter wife sister girlfriend lover they would not know what the hell to do with you anita go in as bernardos girlfriend he had his hand up stopping me from interrupting before i could even open my mouth and try trust me on this you need to have some sort of status that they can grasp quickly and easily flashing your animators license is too close to a badge no woman in her right mind would just wander in there for a drink you have to be something he glanced at bernardo not like he was happy id go in with you as your boyfriend but like it or not i look like a cop or so ive been told i looked at him i wasnt sure what it was about most policemen but after a while they really did look like cops even off duty sometimes it was partially the clothes partially some indefinable air of authority or bad attitude or something whatever it was ramirez had it rigby was in uniform and i wouldnt have taken him as backup anyway he made me nervous with his air of contentment policemen should never be that well pleased with themselves it means they havent had much experience yet i looked at bernardos smirking face agreed under protest good ramirez said but he was looking at bernardo too like he didnt like the look on his face he held a finger up near the taller mans face you get out of line in there with anita and i will personally make you sorry for it bernardos eyes drifted from amused to cool it reminded me of the way edwards eyes lost emotion until they were empty and somehow harsh i stepped between them enough to get both of them looking at me i can take care of myself when it comes to bernardo detective ramirez thanks anyway id used his title to remind bernardo who and what he was even edward treaded soft around the cops ramirezs face had closed down empty suit yourself ms blake i realized that he thought id used his title because i was angry with him shit why was i always ass deep in male egos in the middle of any given crisis its okay hernando i just like to remind everyone that im a big girl i touched his arm lightly he looked at me and his eyes softened okay that was male short hand for apology and apology accepted though truthfully if one of the parties involved hadnt been female the short hand would have been shorter i stepped away from both of them and changed the subject amazing how many bad guys and monsters will talk to me and not the police he nodded face still serious amazing thats one word for it the look he gave me was so studied so searching that i wondered if hed been checking me out as well as baco i didnt ask i didnt really want to know but he was right about baco if he was what people said then he wouldnt want the police anywhere near his homes or his work area they were not kidding about the automatic death penalty the last execution in this country of a spell caster had been two months ago it had been in california which is not a death penalty state for any other crime theyd tried and convicted a sorcerer or would that be sorceress of trafficking with the demonic shed used a demon to kill her sister so shed inherit the parents estate they suspected shed also killed her parents but they couldnt prove that and who cared they could only kill her once id read some of the trial transcript shed been guilty i had no doubt on that point but it had been three months from arrest to conviction to the carrying out of the sentence it was unheard of in the american justice system hell it usually takes longer than that to get a hearing date let alone a fullblown trial but even california had learned its lesson a few years back theyd arrested a sorcerer for very similar crimes theyd tried to give the sorcerer the usual wait for a trial because some congressman or other was arguing that the death penalty shouldnt be allowed even in cases of magical assassination that sorcerer had called a greater demon in his cell it killed every guard on the cellblock and some of the prisoners hed finally been tracked down with the help of a coven of white wiccans the death total had been fortytwo fortythree something like that he was killed during the capture attempt he took thirty slugs which meant people had emptied their clips into his body once it went down for none of the police to get caught in the crossfire they must have been standing over him pointing down overkill you bet but i didnt blame them they never did find all the body parts of the guards at the prison new mexico was a death penalty state i was betting that they would be able to beat californias three months turnaround from arrest to completion of sentence i mean after all in this state they might actually put you to death for a good oldfashioned murder add magic to it and theyd be scattering your ashes to the wind faster than you could say beelzebub the actual method of execution is the same for everyone america does not allow burning at the stake for any crime but after youre dead they burn the body to ash if you were convicted of a crime involving magic then they scatter the ashes usually into running water very traditional there are parts of europe where its still legal to burn a witch at the stake theres more than one reason that i dont travel outside the country much anita are you still with us ramirez asked i blinked sorry just thinking about the last execution in california i dont blame baco for being worried ramirez shook his head me either be very careful these are bad people anita knows about bad people bernardo said the two men looked at each other and again i got that hint that ramirez didnt like him bernardo seemed to be teasing him did they know each other i decided to ask do you guys know each other they both shook their heads why bernardo asked you guys seem to have some sort of personal shit going on bernardo smiled then and ramirez looked uncomfortable its not personal with me bernardo said rigby turned away coughing if i hadnt known better id have said he was covering a laugh ramirez ignored him all attention for bernardo i know anita knows how to handle herself around the bad guys but a knife blade in the back doesnt care how good you are the lobos pride themselves on using blades instead of guns guns are for sissies i said something like that i had the black suit jacket on over the navy blue polo shirt if i buttoned two buttons the jacket hid the firestar in front and still left me plenty of room to reach for it and the browning in fact the slender cell phone swinging in the right side pocket was more noticeable than the guns i just love taking a gun to a knife fight bernardo had thrown a black shortsleeved dress shirt over his white tshirt it fanned in back and covered the beretta mil on his hip me too he said and smiled it was a fierce smile and i realized that this may have been the first time in weeks that he was going up against something flesh and blood and killable were going in for information not to do the ok corral you do understand that i said youre the boss he said but i didnt like the way his eyes looked they were anticipatory eager id felt paranoid this morning when i slipped the knife in its spine sheath now i moved my head a little back and forth feeling the handle against my neck it was comforting i almost always carried the wrist sheaths and their matching knives but the spine sheath was optional one minute youre paranoid and packing too much hardware the next youre scared and underarmed lifes like that or my lifes like that do you know what los duendos are ramirez asked bernardo said it meant the dwarves ramirez nodded but around here its folklore theyre small beings that live in caves and steal things but theyre supposed to be angels that got left suspended between heaven and hell during lucifers revolt so many angels were leaving heaven that god slammed the gates shut and los duendos got trapped outside of heaven they were suspended in limbo why didnt they just go to hell bernardo asked it was a good question ramirez shrugged the story doesnt say i glanced at rigby standing behind ramirez he was standing so easy ready prepared like a grownup boy scout he didnt seem worried about anything it made me nervous we were about to go into a bar that was thick with bikers bad guys there was a necromancer inside so powerful that it made my skin crawl from blocks away the rest of us looked confident but it was confidence born of having been there and done that and survived rigbys confidence struck me as false not false confidence but based on a false assumption i couldnt know for sure without asking but i was betting rigby had never really been in any situation where he thought he might not come out the other side there was a softness to him despite the lean muscles id take a few less muscles and more depth to the eyes any day i hoped that ramirez didnt have to come in with rigby as his only backup but i didnt say it out loud everyone loses their cherry sometime somewhere if things went wrong tonight might be rigbys night did you tell us that little story for a reason hernando i mean you dont think that baco or this biker gang are los duendos he shook his head no i just thought you might want to know it says something about baco to name his bar after fallen angels i opened the drivers side door of the hummer bernardo took the hint and went for the passenger side door not fallen angels hernando just caught in limbo hernando leaned into the open window of the car but theyre not in heaven anymore are they with that last cryptic comment he stepped back and let me raise the window he and rigby watched us drive off they looked sort of forlorn standing there in the abandoned broken parking lot or maybe it was just me feeling forlorn i looked at bernardo dont kill anyone okay he slid back in his seat snuggling against the leather he looked more relaxed than id seen him in hours if they try to kill us i sighed then we defend ourselves i said see i knew youd see things my way dont start the fight i said he looked at me with eager brown eyes can i finish it i looked back at the road searching for a parking space whatever spell baco had been working was over the atmosphere was a little easier to breathe but there was still something in the air like close lightning waiting to strike yeah we can finish it he started humming under his breath i think it was the theme from the magnificent seven to quote an overused movie line i had a bad feeling about this by the time i found a parking space bernardo and i had a plan i was an out of town necromancer wanting to talk shop with one of the only other necromancers id ever heard of if it hadnt been so damn close to the truth it would have been a lousy cover story even being the truth almost it sounded weak but we didnt have all day and besides i dont think being sneaky was a strong suit for either of us we were both more comfortable with the bustthedoordownandstartshooting school than the concoctagoodcoverstoryandinfiltrate bernardo reached his hand out for me just before we crossed the street i frowned at him he waggled his hand at me come on anita play fair he was holding his right hand out to me i stared at the offered hand for a heartbeat but finally took it his fingers slid around my hand a little slower and a little more proprietarily than necessary but i could live with it lucky for us that i was righthanded and bernardo was lefthanded we could hold hands and not compromise either of our gun hands usually i was the only one armed when i was cuddling so it was only my gun hand we had to worry about ive dated men that i couldnt walk hand in hand with like an awkward rhythm between us bernardo was not one of those men he slowed his pace to let me catch up to his longer legs until he realized i was a step ahead of him tugging on his hand i have a lot of tall friends no one ever complains that i cant keep up the door to the bar was black and blended so well with the buildings facade that you almost missed it bernardo opened the door for me and i let him it might blow our cover to argue over who got to hold the door for who though if he had been my real boyfriend wed have had the discussion ah well the minute i stepped inside the bar no the second i stepped inside the bar i knew we were not going to blend in so many things had already gone wrong we were not so much overdressed as wrongly dressed if bernardo had ditched the black dress shirt and just worn the white tshirt and if it hadnt looked fresh out of the box then he might have mingled i was so the only suit jacket in the room but even the polo shirt and jeans seemed a little much beside what some of the women were wearing can you say shortshorts a girl near us and i meant girl if she was eighteen id eat something icky looked at me with hostile eyes she had long brown hair that swung past her shoulders the hair was clean and shiny even in the dim light her makeup was light but expertly applied she should have been deciding who to take to prom instead she was wearing a black leather bra with metal studs on it and matching shorts that looked like theyd been painted over her narrow hips a pair of those clunky platform highheels completed the look those platform shoes had been ugly in the seventies and eighties and they were still ugly two decades later even if they were back in style she was hanging all over a guy that had to be thirty years or more her senior his hair and ragged beard were gray at first glance youd think he was fat but he was fat the way an offensive lineman was fat flesh with muscle under it his eyes were hidden behind small round sunglasses even though the bar was cast in permanent twilight he sat at the table closest to the door big hands resting on the wood he was totally at rest but you still got a sense of how very large he was how physically imposing the girl was slender and shorter than i was i hoped she was his daughter but doubted it he stood and a wave of energy moved off of him in a curling almost visible roil of power it was suddenly hard to breathe and it wasnt the cigarette smoke rolling like a low fog through the room id come in expecting to meet a necromancer i had not expected a werewolf i couldnt be a hundred percent sure of the type of animal but call it a hunch los lobos had to be werewolves i looked out over that room full of people and felt their power raise like invisible hackles bernardo put his right hand on my shoulder and drew me towards the bar slowly it took almost all the restraint i had not to reach for one of the guns they had not offered us violence they probably always did this show to unwanted tourists almost anyone would get the message and leave leaving actually sounded like a really good idea unfortunately we had business and a really good threat display was not reason enough to stop us pity because they would not like the fact that we didnt leave what if this afternoons little display wasnt the norm what if they were trying to chase us away because something illegal was going down worse and worse the long wooden bar had cleared out as we moved towards it fine with me i didnt want to be outflanked the bartender was a woman surprise and a dwarf ah little person i couldnt see over the bar but she had to have something she was standing on she had short thick hair dark shot through with strands of white her face was the typical rough square but her eyes were as hard as any ive ever seen her face was heavily lined not with age but with wear and tear one eyebrow was bisected by a heavy white scar all she needed was a sign above her head that said ive had a hard life what do you want she asked her tone matched the rest of her harsh i half expected bernardo to answer but his attention was all for the room and the growing air of hostility were looking for nicky baco i said her eyes never flickered never heard of him i shook my head her answer had been automatic she didnt even have to think about it i could have asked to see anyone in the room and the answer would have been the same i lowered my voice though i knew most of the things in the room would hear even the barest whisper im a necromancer i heard that baco is one too ive met a lot of zombie raisers but never another necromancer she shook her head dont know what youre talking about she started to rub the top of the bar with a stained rag she wasnt even looking at me now as if id become something totally without interest theyd stall for a while then theyd get impatient and try to kick us out unless we were willing to start shooting people theyll succeed when in doubt tell the truth not my usual ploy but hey ill try anything once im anita blake and that was all i got out before her gaze snapped upward and she really looked at me for the first time prove it she said i started to reach inside the jacket for my id i heard the gun click underneath the bar as she pulled the hammer back just from the sound id say it was an old fashioned shotgun sawedoff or it wouldnt have fit under the bar slowly she said i caught bernardos movement out of the corner of my eye turning towards us maybe going for a gun its okay bernardo its under control i dont think he believed me i said please i didnt say please often bernardo hesitated but finally turned back to watch the gathering werewolves he hissed hurry up i did what the lady with the shotgun pointed at my chest said i moved very very slowly and handed her my id lay it on the bar i laid it on the bar hands flat on the bar lean into it the bar top was sticky but i kept my hands on it and leaned into it in a sort of pushup position she could have just asked me to assume the position it was a leg width away from it him too she said bernardo had heard her no he said something passed through her eyes that would have made edward proud i knew shed do it either do what she says or get the fuck out of here i said he moved so he could watch the room at large and see me and the lady behind the bar he was beside the outer door one quick move and he could be out in the afternoon sunlight he didnt go for the door he looked at me his eyes flicked to the woman behind the bar i think he saw in her face what id seen because he sighed enough that his shoulders slumped he shook his head but he moved towards the long bar he moved stiffly as if each small movement pained him his posture his face all screamed that he didnt like doing this but he leaned beside me against the bar legs further apart she said lean into it like you want to see that pretty face in the polish i heard bernardo take a hissing breath but he spread his legs and leaned close enough to see the varnish on the scarred bar can i just say now that this is a bad idea he said shut up i said the woman opened the id on the bar top one hand still hidden under the bar they had the shotgun attached underneath the bar somehow i wondered what other surprises they had why do you want to see nicky she asked she hadnt told me to stop leaning so i didnt i told the truth i want to talk to another necromancer why didnt you tell me who you were up front i work with the cops sometimes i thought it might make you nervous i had to roll my eyes up to see her face i was rewarded with a smile it looked almost awkward on her harsh features but it was a start why do you want to talk to another necromancer i let the truth spill out of my mouth without concentrating on the fact that i planned to stop before id told all of it i mean nicky baco was a necromancer and if necromancy was involved in the killings so only part of the truth until i knew whether he was a bad guy ive got a little problem that involves the dead i wanted a second opinion she laughed then a harsh sound like the caw of a crow i jumped and i swear i could feel the werewolves behind me flinch if i hadnt known better id have said they were just a little afraid of this small woman i know i was nickyll love that the famous anita blake coming to consult him oh he will just fucking love this she motioned with her head whos he this is bernardo hes a friend her eyes hardened how good a friend close very close i said she leaned across the bar putting her face next to mine her hand still under the bar on the shotgun i should kill you i can feel it youll hurt nicky i looked into her eyes from inches away i expected to see anger or even hatred but there was nothing it was the very emptiness that clued me in if she pulled the trigger on me it wouldnt be the first time my pulse was suddenly thudding in my throat blown away by a psychotic dwarf bartender how ironic i kept my voice low and even the way you talk to jumpers on ledges and people with guns pointed at you i dont plan to hurt nicky i honestly just want to consult with him one necromancer to another she just kept looking at me not even blinking she raised up slowly if you move ill kill you if he moves ill kill you the way she said it promised that whatever was about to happen was something we werent going to like she turned her gaze to bernardo and leaned down so that her head was sideways looking at him her ear almost pressed to the bar did you hear me boyfriend i heard you he said and his voice was low and calm too hed seen it too she wanted an excuse to kill me id never met her before so it couldnt be personal but personal or not id be just as dead we dont let outsiders bring guns into our house no disrespect intended i said i always go armed nothing personal she leaned back down next to bernardos face how bout you you always go armed yes he said he frowned then went back to staring at the bar lucky hed worn a hair barrette today or his lovely hair would have been covered in sticky gunk my hands felt like they were becoming permanently glued to the wood not in here you dont she said it was the big man in front who searched us somehow id known it would be his power beat against my back like a nearly solid wall of power shit he patted me down like hed done it before he found the knives at my wrist and back as well as the guns he also found the cell phone but placed it on the bar in front of me instead of taking it you could see the effort it took for bernardo to let the man touch him pat him down take his gun he also took a knife out of one of bernardos boots anything was an improvement over the last crime scene but the day really wasnt going well can we stand up now i asked not yet she said bernardo gave me a look that said plainly if he died he was coming back to haunt me because it was all my fault i kept my voice calm tried to make sense you know im anita blake you know why im here what else do you want harpo check the mans wallet find out who he is she said harpo the big man the vibrating mountain of mystical energy was named harpo i said none of this out loud i really am getting smarter harpo took out bernardos wallet hed stuffed bernardos ten mil down the side of his pants and my browning on the other side i didnt see the firestar or the knives maybe hed stuffed them in his pockets the drivers license says bernardo spottedhorse but there aint no credit cards no pictures no nothing the womans eyes had gone back to pitiless you say hes a close friend yes i said i was beginning to get scared again he your lover she asked if she hadnt had a shotgun pointed at me id have told her to go to hell but she did so i answered yeah i was trusting that ramirez knew what he was talking about that i needed to belong to a man i hoped the lie was the right answer prove it she said i raised eyebrows at her excuse me excuse me she mimicked and that brought low rumbling laughter from the rest of the room is he circumcised she asked i hesitated i couldnt help it the question caught me too far off guard i swallowed and said yes i had a fiftyfifty chance and being american and under forty i had a better than even chance she smiled but it left her eyes like empty glass you can stand up now i fought the urge to wipe my hands on my pants didnt want to insult her cleanliness but i also wanted desperately to wash my hands i moved closer to bernardo as if i wanted a hug i even put my left arm around his waist though i wondered if i was getting his nice white shirt dirty his arm slid over my shoulders but id really just wanted out of the line of fire of the damned shotgun i was betting it was on a stationary mount and not a swiveling one i hoped i was right her hands were back in plain sight a good sign drop your pants bernardo she said i felt him tense beside me we both looked at her i started to say excuse me again but bernardo said why id have asked her to repeat it just to make sure id understood her he just asked why as if this had happened to him before so we can see if youre circumcised i moved my hand out from behind bernardos back standing close together but not entangled in each others arms we might be in for a fight after all i said he was isnt that enough no you see youre right you do work with the cops a lot you alone might have been okay to see nicky but him we dont know anything about him if hes your lover then fine but if hes not then maybe hes a cop bernardo laughed and the sound startled all of us i think now that is a new one me being mistaken for a cop what are you if youre not a cop she asked sometimes im a bodyguard sometimes im someone you need to guard the body against depends on whos paying better his voice sounded very sure of itself very matter of fact maybe you are and maybe youre not drop the pants and well see he started unbuckling his belt i moved away from him though not too far didnt want to get back in front of the shotgun again whats wrong youve seen him without his pants before she said i was beginning to think she didnt believe me not in a crowd i havent i said i let the righteous indignation blaze in my voice it got more laughter from the crowd the women were starting to chant take it off take it all off and worse the girl that had been hanging on harpo was just behind him watching the show with glittering excited eyes bernardo didnt complain or blush he just undid his pants and pushed them to about mid thigh and stood there my look away was automatic the women screamed and whistled one voice yelled big daddy yes the men joined in the men were congratulating him and speculating on how we did it without hurting me i had to look i just couldnt help myself i had to know if id guessed right find frankly i just had to look embarrassing but true it took me a few seconds to register that he was circumcised because what i saw first was sheer size he was well well endowed i was blushing and i couldnt help that but i knew if i just stood there and gaped that the lies would all be for nothing i tried to act as if it were richard or jeanclaude standing there what would i have done id have covered them up i moved to stand in front of him though was careful not to touch i admit though that i couldnt seem to look anywhere else richard was impressive bernardo had passed impressive and gone over to scary i shielded him from view with my body putting my hands on either side of his waist to steady myself i was blushing so hard i was dizzy i looked at her still shielding him from the room good enough i asked even my voice sounded strangled with discomfort give him a kiss she said i looked at her let him put his pants up and i will she shook her head i didnt say kiss his lips if i blushed any harder my head was going to explode i turned around so i couldnt see him anymore we are so not doing this i think youll do anything we want she said i dont know what i would have said to that because a mans voice sounded enough games paulina give them back their weapons and let them go we all turned coming from the dim back of the room was another dwarf little person he was maybe half a head taller than the bartender paulina and he was more obviously hispanic and younger his hair was a rich black his skin tanned and unlined he looked twentysomething but the aura of power that spread outward from him like an overwhelming perfume felt older i am nicandro baco nicky to my friends the crowd parted for him like a curtain being drawn back he held his hand out to me and i took it but he didnt shake hands he raised my hand to his lips and kissed it but he kept his eyes rolled up to see my face as he did it and something about the way his eyes looked his mouth on my skin reminded me of much more intimate places for a mans mouth to be i took my hand back as soon as i could and still be polite mr baco thank you for seeing me it sounded so businesslike as if bernardo wasnt standing behind us with his pants around his thighs get dressed he said he barely glanced at bernardo but i heard him pulling up his pants struggling to get everything back in place though frankly i was surprised his jeans could fit over everything why are you here ms blake i really did want to talk to another necromancer it sounds like youve changed your mind he said he watched me minutely studying my face when i moved a hand to touch my hair his eyes tracked it the grandstanding has taken up all my time ive got an appointment with the police that i cant really miss id added the police part on purpose because i had a feeling that baco had known exactly what was happening out here they hadnt really hurt us just embarrassed us or me he came in just in the nick of time yeah right like the two policemen that are waiting outside for you i felt the knowledge flinch across my face not much of a reaction but it was enough do you blame us for backup are you saying you are afraid of us that brought a low rumble through the room as if they had all drawn a breath together i would be a fool if i wasnt i said he cocked his head to one side in an almost birdlike movement and you are not a fool are you anita i try not to be he motioned to the woman still standing behind the bar paulina does not like you do you know why it was my turn to shake my head nope shes my wife i must have still looked blank sorry i dont understand she knows i have a weakness for women with power i frowned at him she doesnt have to worry im sort of taken he smiled no more lies anita you and he are not lovers he took my hand again and gazed up at me with those black eyes i realized for the first time that he considered himself a ladies man and that his wife had reason to worry not about me but about other women it was there in his eyes the way he stroked my hand i drew my hand away from him and moved back to stand with bernardo i actually reached out my hand and he took it both our hands were sticky from the bar but i clutched at him baco was half a bodylength shorter than i was but he made me nervous part of it was the push of his magic like a thick curtain filling the room but part of it was the way any man can make you nervous i didnt like how blatant he was with us unarmed i glanced at paulina and her harsh face was stricken was it a game he played with her tormenting her who knew but i wanted out of here i need to be somewhere before dark if you dont want to talk to me fine well go i started moving backwards using my body to push bernardo behind me towards the door without your weapons baco made it a question his voice lilting upward bernardo and i froze we were close enough to the door that we could have made a rush for it probably made it but our weapons would be nice i said all you had to do was ask baco said i said may we have our weapons back he nodded harpo give them back harpo never questioned it just gave us back the guns the knives then he stepped back to join the rest of the silent watchers the guns and wrist knives were easy to slide into place the knife in its spine sheath was another matter i had to use my left hand to feel for the sheath then feel the blades tip at the mouth of the sheath id gotten in the habit of closing my eyes so that all i concentrated on was touch it actually took only a few seconds now to put it away the real trick was not chopping off a hunk of my hair as the blade slid home when i opened my eyes baco was looking at me so nice to see a woman who doesnt rely exclusively on sight touch is such an important sense for intimate occasions maybe being armed again made me brave or maybe i was just tired of the tension level men who turn everything into a sexual come on are such bores distaste anger filled his face turning his charming eyes to black mirrors like the eyes of a doll too good to fuck a dwarf i shook my head its not your height thats the problem baco where i come from you dont do shit like this in front of your wife he laughed then and it sparkled through his eyes his face the sacrament of marriage youre offended for my wifes sake you are a funny girl yeah me and barbara streisand the humor faded a little from his face i dont think he got the joke strangely it was the young girl in her shortshorts that met my eyes i think she got the joke if she liked early streisand movies maybe she wasnt a completely lost soul bernardo touched my shoulder and i jumped were leaving now anita i nodded im with you you never asked your questions baco said have you felt it i asked his face was suddenly serious there is something new here it is like us it deals in death i have felt it where i asked between santa fe and albuquerque though it began closer to santa fe its moving closer to albuquerque to you i said for the first time he looked uncertain not quite afraid but not happy either it knows that i am here i have felt that too he stared up at me and now there was no teasing in his eyes it knows that you are here too anita it knows you are here too i nodded we might be able to help each other nicky ive seen the bodies ive seen what this thing does trust me nicky you dont want to go out that way what do you propose he asked that we pool our resources and see if we can stop this thing before it gets here to you and that we stop playing games no more teasing no more power plays just business between us he said i nodded we dont have time for anything else baco come back later tonight and i will do what i can to help you though the police will not want you to share information with me i am a very bad man you know i smiled youre a bad man nicky but not a stupid one you need me as you need me anita he said two necromancers are better than one i said he nodded face solemn come back tonight when you are finished with your police business i will be waiting it may be late i said it is already later than you think anita pray if you are the praying sort that it is not too late anita bernardo said were going i let bernardo back us out the door his hand on my shoulder guiding me backwards i got to watch the room trusting him to make sure nothing was coming up behind us through the door the werewolves just watched us not happy but willing to take orders baco had to be their vargamor their resident witch id just never met a pack that feared its vargamor before it was paulinas face that stayed with me she was staring at baco and the hatred on her face was raw i knew in that instant that once she had loved him really loved him because only true love could twist to such hatred id looked into paulinas eyes across the barrel of a gun i think nicky baco had more problems than just monsters in the desert if i were him id be sleeping with a gun we arrived at the hospital with the world wrapped in a heavy blue dusk a twilight so solid it was like cloth something you could wrap around your hands or wear like a dress id called ahead using ramirez cell phone how do you prove that someone is really dead id seen the survivors they drew breath i assumed they had a heart beat or the doctors would have mentioned it their eyes looked at you and seemed to be aware they reacted to pain they were alive but what if they werent what if they were only vessels for a power that made nicky baco and i look like backstreet charlatans there might have been a spell to prove it but you couldnt take the results of a spell to court and get permission to burn the bodies and that was what i wanted i finally came up with brain waves i was betting that the higher functions of the brain werent working it was the only thing i could think of that might show that something was wrong with the survivors other than not having skin and missing body parts unfortunately doctor evans and company had done monitored brain wave activity long ago they all had higher brain functions so much for my brilliant idea doctor evans had wanted to talk in the doctors lounge but id insisted we talk closer to the survivors room than that we talked in low tones in the hallway he wouldnt let me talk in front of the survivors about the fact that they might be dead because if i was wrong it might cause them distress he had a point but i didnt think i was wrong the survivors already at the hospital had become agitated and violent snapping at the hospital staff like dogs on chains no one had been hurt but the timing coincided with the last murders why had the skinned ones been more violent was it the spell used to banish whatever it was from the home had that upped the ante somehow maybe frightened the creature that we were on to it i didnt know i just didnt know all i did know was that i could feel the darkness pressing like a hand about to crush us all it was a heaviness in the air like before a thunderstorm but worse closer harder to breathe through something bad was coming and it was tied to the darkness i wasnt able to convince doctor evans that his patients were dead but my urgency must have been persuasive because he did give permission for the two officers that were already at the hospital to guard inside the room instead of out the only proof i had that there were cops inside the room was a hat lying on one of the chairs outside the door i wanted to go into the room myself but by the time i got suited up in gown and mask it would be full dark it was that close like a trembling line so i stood in the hall and pretended that i was okay with it because there was nothing else i could do since officer rigby and bernardo were new they got the standard lecture about not shooting inside an oxygen atmosphere it would be bad though it wouldnt explode which is what i thought it would have done it would be the flash fire to end all flash fires turning the room into a lower circle of hell for the few moments it took to use up all the oxygen or fuel in the room but it wouldnt explode in a shower of glass and plaster nothing too dramatic just deadly rigby asked and if they try to eat us what are we supposed to do spit on them i dont know evans said all i can tell you is what you shouldnt do and you shouldnt fire a gun into a room full of oxygen bernardo drew a knife from somewhere he hadnt bent down near his boot which meant it was a different knife and one the werewolf in the bar had missed he held the blade up to the light letting it gleam you cut them darkness fell like a lead curtain almost clanging in my head like the roll of thunder i waited for the door to the room to open i waited for the screaming to start because thats what i was expecting nothing happened then pressure that had been building for hours vanished it was as if something swallowed it up i was just suddenly standing in the hallway feeling light empty better i didnt understand the change and i dont like what i dont understand we all waited for a few tense heartbeats then i couldnt stand it i spilled a knife into my own hand and reached for the door the door swung outward i jumped back the male nurse that id been introduced to earlier paused the door staring at the naked blade in my hand he never took his eyes off me but he talked to evans doctor the patients are quiet quieter than theyve been all day the police officers are wanting know if they can step out of the room for a while the survivors are quieter than theyve been all day i asked ben the nurse nodded yes maam i took two steps back from the door and let out the tension in my body in a long breath well ms blake evans asked can the officers come out i shrugged and looked at ramirez ask him hes ranking officer on sit but truthfully i guess so whatever ive been feeling seemed to fade when darkness fell i dont understand it i slid the knife back into its sheath i guess theres not going to be a fight you sound disappointed bernardo said his knife had vanished to wherever hed gotten it from i shook my head not disappointed just confused i felt a great deal of power building for hours and it just vanished that much power doesnt just vanish it went somewhere apparently not into the survivors but its off somewhere tonight doing something any ideas what its doing and where ramirez asked i shook my head not really he turned to the doctor tell the men they can come outside ben the nurse looked to doctor evans for confirmation evans nodded the nurse ducked back inside the door closing slowly behind him evans turned to me well ms blake looks like you hurried over here for nothing i shrugged i thought wed be ass deep in maneating corpses by now i smiled its nice to be wrong once in a while we all smiled at each other the tension spilled out of all of us bernardo gave that nervous laugh you sometimes give when the emergency is over or the bullet passed you by im very glad you were wrong this time ms blake evans said me too i said me three bernardo said im happy too ramirez said but it is disappointing to find out youre not perfect if you dont know im not perfect after fortyeight hours of working with me on a police investigation then you are not paying attention im paying attention ramirez said close attention there was a weight to his gaze an intensity to his words that made me want to squirm in trying not to squirm i caught bernardos eyes he was smiling at me enjoying my discomfort glad someone was if you were wrong about this you may be wrong about them being dead evans said i nodded maybe you admit you may be wrong just like that evans seemed surprised this is magic not math doctor evans there are very few hard and fast rules there are even fewer rules the way i do it sometimes i think two and two is going to add up to five and im right sometimes all you get is four if it lowers the body count i dont mind being wrong the door opened and two men came out dressed in albuquerque uniforms theyd headed for the door as soon as ben the nurse told them they could go i didnt blame them one bit their eyes looked haunted the tallest one was blond and built all of squares broad shoulders thick waist heavy legs not fat just solid strong his partner was shorter and almost completely bald except for a ring of brown curls low on his head apparently it was his hat sitting in the chair by the door doctor evans said excuse me he moved past them into the room the short one said he can have it the blond looked at me eyes narrowing not friendly well if it isnt the wicked witch of the midwest i hear we have you to thank for us sitting in there for the last hour i didnt recognize him but apparently he knew me on sight i suggested it yes the blond moved closer using his size to intimidate me or he tried size just isnt as impressive as most men think it is maybe marks was right about you ah hah he must have been one of the officers on site when marks kicked me out i felt ramirez start to move up probably to step between us i put my hand on his shoulder its all right ramirez didnt move back the step hed taken but at least he didnt move forward it was probably the best i would get out of him but it meant that i was sandwiched between the two men the blonds eyes flicked to ramirez behind me the look on his face was enough he wanted a fight and didnt really care who it was with he was glaring at ramirez now and i could almost feel the testosterone rising on every side enough testosterone to get the officer in trouble maybe suspended when all he needed was to blow off some steam he was trying to cleanse himself of the horrors in that room both his partner and bernardo were staying back i didnt know what the partner was doing but bernardo was enjoying the show you must have been one of the officers that helped marks throw me out i said i was looking way up at the man and he was looking over me at ramirez it took him a second to blink and look at me he frowned at me and it was a good frown i bet it made a lot of bad guys run like hell his partner came up behind him yeah jarman and i were both there the partner sounded calm and i think worried about his partner good partners look after more than just your physical health and you are i asked i asked it like his partner jarman wasnt about to pick a fight with everyone in the hallway he introduced himself like everything was normal too jakes jarman and jakes i made it a question he nodded smiling j and j at your service i felt the tension easing in the big man in front of me hard to stay pissed when youre being ignored and everyone else is behaving themselves i pressed my back into ramirez trying to urge him to back off he took the hint stepping back a little officer rigby came bounding down the hallway hed gone to the car to get something less explosive than his gun what he was carrying was a tazer gun it would send a charge of to volts through a suspect theoretically it could put someone down for the count without the danger of killing him unless you get very unlucky like the perp has a pacemaker ramirez was shaking his head what the hell is that for rigby looked at the tazer i cant use my gun so ill use this rigby jarman said a tazer makes a spark rigby looked puzzled so if the spark when we fire a gun will set off the oxygen in the room so will the spark from a tazer ramirez said go back to the car and find something else jarman said jakes and i had moved to one side watching ramirez and jarman ream the rookie no one was mad anymore derisive condescending but not mad when rigby had disappeared through the doors at the far end of the hall jarman turned to ramirez is rigby all marks gave you for backup ramirez nodded then shrugged hell learn and get someone killed doing it jarman said jakes held his hand out low palm up he was smiling i gave him a low five i was smiling too but not because his partner hadnt belted a detective i was just happy that id been wrong id had my fill of corpses for the day hell for the year bernardo was leaning against the opposite wall he seemed puzzled by my interaction with the cops i doubt it ever occurred to bernardo to make friends with them the two uniforms had batons stuck in their utility belts ramirez looked unarmed except for his gun wheres your baton hernando oooh hernando jakes said yeah hernando jarman said rolling the name off his tongue wheres your baton that they were willing to give ramirez shit meant that under normal conditions he and jarman got along there is a different flavor to teasing when its hostile rigbys teasing was close to hostile not quite as if they werent sure if he were really one of them yet ramirez took a short metal rod out of his hip pocket he made a small movement with his wrist and the rod telescoped into a solid piece of metal about two feet long an asp i said i didnt notice you carrying one when we met im usually pretty aware of weapons he flicked the rod back into its compact size an asp is pretty small when its put away how do you know i wasnt carrying one i opened my mouth then closed it and looked at him he was grinning at me i debated on whether to rise to the bait or let it pass hell this was the most fun id had all day are you implying that i was staring at your butt how else would you know i didnt have something about the size of a pen in my back pocket his eyes were sparkling like dark jewels shiny with humor i shrugged just checking for weapons thats what they all say jarman said wanna check me for weapons i looked at him i can see your weapon from here jarman he puffed his chest out a little managing to strut without moving his feet an inch when youre my size its hard to miss i looked at every man in turn and had to really fight the urge to linger on bernardo i was willing to bet that his weapon was the biggest in the hallway oh i dont know jarman you know what they say its not size that matters its talent again i had to fight the urge to stare at bernardo jarman smiled happily trust me baby ive got the talent and the size easy to brag when you know youll never have to prove it i said and yes i was baiting him jarman swept his hat off and gave me a look i think it was supposed to be a come hither look his scary frown was better than his sexy look but hey i bet he got a lot more opportunity to practice scary than sexy lets find some privacy babe and i will prove it i shook my head smiling and what would your wife say about you taking me out for a test drive nice wedding band by the way he laughed a goodnatured rumble jakes answered for him his wife would feed him his dick on a stick jarman nodded still chuckling yeah my bren has a temper that she does he said it like it was a good thing a thing he valued he looked at me my bren would have kicked marks in the balls not kissed him i thought about it i said why didnt you hit him ramirez asked the humor still sparkled in his eyes but his face was more serious i think he wanted a real answer not a joke he was expecting me to hit him maybe even wanted me to hit him he could have pressed assault charges gotten me behind bars for awhile i expected one of the three men to say marks wouldnt do that but no one did i looked from one suddenly serious face to another no one going to defend the lieutenants honor protest that he wouldnt do such a dastardly thing jarman said nope jakes said dastardly you talk real pretty for a devilworshipping assassin i blinked at him pass that by me again slowly jakes nodded according to the lieutenant youre suspected in the disappearances of several citizens as well as dancing naked in the moonlight with the devil himself marks didnt say that last part jakes grinned cant blame a man for wishful thinking he wiggled his eyebrows at me i laughed they laughed a good time being had by all except bernardo who leaned against the wall apart from the general goodwill he was watching me as if hed never really seen me before id surprised him in some way marks tried to get you arrested for magical malfeasance so the rumor mill says jarman said i stared at him magical malfeasance could carry a death sentence i stared at ramirez did you know he was trying to do that ramirez touched my arm we moved down the hallway to the distant rumble of masculine laughter the two officers were probably still giving each other goodnatured shit from the caliber of the laughter if it was about me it was probably something i didnt want to hear there is always a line to the teasing that must be carefully avoided i wanted to be a female one of the guys not get a reputation for being a slut a thin line to walk sometimes probably best to be out of earshot but i didnt want to be alone with ramirez right now it bothered me that he hadnt told me what marks had said about me he was a virtual stranger he didnt owe me anything but it made me think less of him an africanamerican nurse walked past us and went into the room since all id seen were her eyes the first time i couldnt be sure if she was the same nurse id glimpsed earlier in the room she was small about the right size but in full surgical scrubs who knew the men had fallen silent as she walked past as soon as the door closed safely behind her the laughter sounded again ramirez looked at me with that honest face a line of concern between his eyebrows like a tiny wrinkle of discontent he looked even younger when he frowned doesnt that bother you he asked what i asked he glanced back at the two officers they were still smiling jakes and jarman you mean the teasing he nodded when i kissed marks in front of all of them i sort of invited a little teasing besides i sort of started it or rather you did i shrugged it blows off steam and we all need that right now most women dont see it that way ramirez said im not most women but frankly one reason a lot of women dont stand for any teasing is that some men dont know when teasing crosses the line to harassment if i had to work day in and day out with them i might be more careful but i dont so i can afford to push the line a little what is your line anita he was standing just a little too close for comfort ill let everyone know when theyve reached it dont worry i stepped back from him giving myself the distance i wanted youre mad at me he sounded surprised i half smiled believe me detective when im mad at you youll know detective not even ramirez now i know youre upset what did i do i looked at him studying that open honest fact why didnt you tell me what marks said about me what he was telling the other cops about me it would carry a death sentence no way was marks going to push that through anita you still should have told me he looked puzzled for a moment then shrugged i didnt know i was supposed to i frowned i guess not but i wasnt happy with his answer he touched my arm again every so lightly i didnt believe that marks could get you arrested i was right isnt that enough no i said he let his hand fall away from me what good would it have done to tell you youd have worried for nothing i dont need my feelings protected i need to feel that i can trust you you dont trust me because i didnt tell you everything that marks said not as much as i trusted you before the first hint of anger hardened his eyes and you told me everything that happened in los duendos you didnt hold anything back about your interview with nicky baco his eyes werent kind now they were cool and searching cop eyes i looked down once then fought to maintain eye contact when what i desperately wanted to do was duck my head and say aw shucks you caught me push me into a corner and i usually get angry but somehow looking into his deep brown eyes i couldnt pull up much moral indignation maybe it was having no moral high ground to stand on yeah that might be it i didnt kill anybody if thats what youre implying it was one of my usual comments with less than my usual force thats not what im implying and you know it anita there was something familiar almost intimate about the conversation wed known each other for two days and yet we interacted as if wed known each other much longer it was unnerving i didnt usually bond this quickly with people or monsters but if it had been my longtime police friend sergeant rudolph storr himself standing in front of me id have lied if nicky baco got a whiff of cops hed back off and hed never trust me again people like baco dont give second chances when it comes to the police baco knew you and rigby were outside the bar hernando he has the entire area wired with magical i waffled my hand back and forth seeking the right word wards spells he knows what happens in his streets if i go back in with police as backup no matter how distant he wont help us are you so sure he can help ramirez asked he may just be stringing you along trying to find out what you know hes scared hernando baco is scared call it a feeling but i dont think much frightens him youve just told me youre withholding information from an ongoing murder investigation if you wire me up or insist on sending someone under cover with me well lose baco you know im right on this we may lose baco but youre not right he said and the anger was back a frustrated anger that id seen before in other men that id known longer and in more intimate ways that anger that i cant just be a good girl and play by their rules and be what they want me to be it made me tired to hear that thread in ramirezs voice after only two days the most important thing to me right this second is stopping these murders that is my goal that is my only goal i thought about what id said and added and staying alive but other than that i dont have any other agenda stop the bad guys stay alive it makes things simple hernando you told me earlier that you wanted your life to change to be more than blood and horror if you want that to change you are going to have to complicate your life anita and you are going to have to start trusting people really trusting them again i shook my head thanks for using my moment of weakness against me now i remember why i dont confide in strangers i was finally angry myself it felt good it felt familiar if i could just stay angry i could stop being so damned confused he grabbed my arm and the grip wasnt gentle this time it didnt hurt but i could feel the press of his fingers in my flesh for the first time since id met him he let me see the hardness underneath that core of harshness that you either have or acquire if you stay with the cops without that core to protect yourself you may stay on the job but you wont thrive i smiled what next rubber hoses and bright lights it was meant to be a joke but my voice wasnt light when i said it we were both angry now underneath all those smiles and mild manners was a temper wed see whose was worse his or mine he spoke low and carefully the way i do sometimes when to do anything else will start me yelling i could just tell marks about the meeting tell him youre holding out on us fine i said do it marks will probably have him arrested search his bar he might even find enough magical paraphernalia to get him jailed on suspicion of magical malfeasance and what will that get us detective baco in jail and a few days from now more people dead more bodies gutted i leaned into his angry face and whispered how will your dreams be then hernando he let me go so abruptly that i stumbled you really are a bitch arent you i nodded if the situation warrants it you bet he shook his head rubbing his hands up and down his arms if i hold out on this and it goes wrong it could be my career just say you didnt know he shook his head too many people know i was your police escort he managed to make the last two words heavy with irony youve got another meeting planned with him havent you i tried to keep the surprise off my face but a blank face was just as bad it was like when you were asked if you were sleeping with someone and you refused to answer not answering was as good as a yes he stalked from one side of the hallway to the other dammit anita i cant sit on this i realized he meant it i stood in his path so he had to stop pacing and look at me you cant tell marks hell screw it up if he thinks im dancing with the devil hell have hysterics when he meets nicky baco the anger was beginning to leak from his eyes whens the meeting i shook my head promise first that you wont tell marks hes in charge of the investigation if i dont tell him and he finds out i might as well hand in my badge he doesnt seem very popular around here i said hes still my superior hes your boss i said he is in no way your superior that earned me a smile flattery will get you nowhere with me its not flattery hernando its the truth he was finally quiet standing there looking at me his expression was almost his normal one or what i thought was normal for him for all i knew he dissected puppies in his spare time all right i didnt believe that but i didnt really know him we were strangers and i was having to remind myself of that i kept wanting to treat him like a friend or better what was the matter with me when is the meeting anita if i wont tell you then what a shadow of that hardness seeped into his eyes then i tell marks youre withholding evidence and if i tell you then ill go with you i shook my head no way i promise not to show up looking like a cop i looked at him from shined shoes to short clean hair in what alternate reality would you not look like a cop i heard the door open behind us but neither of us turned we were too busy making major eye contact jarman yelled ramirez there was a tone in that one word that whirled us both around doctor evans was leaning against the wall holding his wrist upright blood gleamed like a scarlet bracelet around his arm ramirez and i started running at the same time down that short space of hallway as if we had farther to go and less time to get there jarman and jakes were disappearing through the door bernardo hesitated at the door holding it open long enough for the screams to cut through the hospital silence low and wordless and panicked and i knew without knowing that it was a man screaming i was almost at the door almost to bernardo ramirez pacing me like a shadow bernardo said this is a bad idea but he went through the door a heartbeat before we reached it god i hated being right all the time the white sterile room had been a quiet corner of hell now it was a loud chaotic corner of hell a skinless hand snatched at me i slashed at it with the big blade that id pulled from the spine sheath the hand bled and jerked back they could feel pain they bled good i had the blade raised for a neck blow as the corpse came at me again ramirez blocked my arms theyre civilians i looked at him then back at that raw thing that was held to the bed only by one last wrist restraint it launched at me again slashing the air with its bloody hand screaming wordlessly butchered tongue flopping like a worm in the lipless ruin of its mouth just stay out of reach he said and pulled me past it i had time to say theyre corpses ramirez just corpses he held up the asp dont kill them he moved into the fight though it wasnt a fight yet most of the corpses were still restrained to the beds they struggled screaming wailing jerking their ruined flesh to bloodier ruin against the restraints bodies bucking as they thrashed to free themselves ben the nurse was beating at the head of one patient it had sunk teeth into his arm so deeply that he couldnt free himself jarman was with him beating the things head with his baton from far back like youd hit a baseball you could hear the soft melonlike thunk even over the screaming jakes and bernardo were at the last bed near the windows the africanamerican nurse was held in the embrace of a corpse that still had one hand and one ankle attached to the bed its head was buried into her chest blood plastered her gown to her body like someone had spilled a can of red paint down her where the thing was gnawing shouldnt have been a killing spot but there was too much blood it had reached something vital jakes was beating at the things head so hard that he was rising on tiptoe his body almost leaving the ground with each blow the corpses head was bleeding cracking but it wasnt letting go its head was buried into her chest like a monstrous child feeding bernardo was stabbing the corpse in the back over and over the blade came free in a spray of blood but it didnt matter the one by the door had reacted to pain but once they started feeding they were just meat you couldnt hurt meat and you sure as hell couldnt kill it i walked between the beds with the corpses screaming bodies writhing and all the eyes looked the same it was as if there was only one personality looking out of every pair of eyes their master whatever that was watched me walk between the beds watching me go to the far bed away from ramirez and his cautions he still didnt understand what was about to happen when they all freed themselves we had to be out of this room before that happened i moved in beside bernardo moving him back a step i wiggled the blade underneath the things jaw i took a deep breath centered myself the way you do in martial arts class just before you break something big and permanentlooking i pictured the blade coming out the top of the skull and thats what i tried for i tried to shove it through its head the blade went through the soft tissue under the jaw with a sharp wet movement then the tip hit the bone at the roof of the mouth and kept going the blade didnt come out of the top of its head but i felt it shove into the strange emptiness of the sinus cavities it reared back from the woman its jaws trying to open around the gleam of the blade it clawed at its mouth with the one free hand letting the nurse fall back onto the bed we got our first glimpse of the wound there was a hole in the middle of her chest broken ribs jutted outward like the broken sides of a frame the hole was just the size for a human face to shove deep i stared down into that dark wet hole and half her heart was gone eaten away oh god jakes said the thing in the bed had freed its other hand it was tugging at the hilt of the blade trying to pull it free jakes bernardo and i exchanged a look between us one look no words and we turned towards the rest of the room with one goal in mind get to the door any way we could there was nothing human in this room but us i looked up and found ramirez and jarman at the far door with the male nurse sagging between them great i yelled run we tried i sensed movement and turned in time for the corpse to hit me full on and send us both crashing to the floor i stabbed for the jaw trying to pin its teeth like i had the other one but it moved and i only got the throat blood splashed across my face in a hot liquid rush it blinded me for a second i could feel it moving over my body legs straddling my waist i kept my hand pushed into raw shoulder holding it back while it strained over me i wiped the blood out of my eyes with the back of my hand that held the knife it snapped at me like a dog and i screamed i cut its cheek so deep the blade scraped on teeth it screamed and sank its teeth into my hand i screamed as it shook its head like a dog with a bone my hand opened and the knife fell it came at me mouth open pale blue eyes so impossibly wide it went for my throat there was no time to try for the last knife i went for its eyes i plunged my thumbs into its eyes and its own momentum pushed them deeper than i could have gotten them i felt the eyeballs rupture exploding in warm fluid and thicker things it screamed whipping its head back and forth hands clawing at its face bernardo was suddenly there pulling it backwards throwing it onearmed across the room to skid into the wall amazing what you can do when youre terrified i was on my knees drawing the last knife bernardo dragged me to my feet and we were almost to the door rigby was there with an ax hacking at the corpses hands and less identifiable bits littered the ground around him ramirez shoved his asp into ones mouth so hard the dull tip showed through the back of its throat jakes was dragging jarman by his wrists leaving a thick red trail behind him jarmans body was wedged in the door rigbys ax had chopped two of the corpses into enough pieces that they were down two of the corpses were still held to the bed with one last restraint ramirez was wrestling with the one that was trying to swallow his asp a corpse threw itself at rigby and the ax sliced air i heard the scrambling behind me before bernardo yelled behind i was on the way down to the floor with the thing riding my back before i heard bernardo yell you i tucked my head trying to protect my neck teeth bit through my shirt drawing blood but having trouble gnawing through the strap of the shoulder holster and spine sheath it dug its teeth into my flesh but the leather strap acted like a sort of armor i drove the knife back into its thigh once twice it didnt care suddenly there was a wash of air and a heavy blow blood spilled across my hair shoulders and back in a scalding wash i scrambled out from under the corpse and found it was headless rigby stood over it with the bloody ax and a wild look in his eyes go get out ill cover your back his voice was highpitched fear dripping from it but he stood his ground and started moving us all towards the door one of the corpses was on bernardos back but it wasnt trying to eat him it pounded his head twice into the floor hard it looked up at me there was something in its eyes that hadnt been in any of the others it was afraid afraid of us afraid of being stopped afraid just maybe of dying it scrambled through the open glass doors and brushed past jakes as if it had somewhere to go and something else to do and i knew it had to be stopped knew if it escaped that it would be very bad but i put a hand under bernardos arm and started dragging him for the door ramirez took his other arm and it was suddenly easy to drag him through that glass door there was a sudden rush in the room behind us rigby stumbled back against the button that closed the door it slid closed with ramirez beating on it i saw rigby swing the ax then a corpse came in from both sides ramirez reached for the button to open the door but either rigbys weight had jammed it or something else had ramirez screamed rigby there was a gigantic whoosh of air as if a giant had drawn a breath and the room filled with fire flames licked the glass like orangegold water through the glass of an aquarium i could feel the heat beating against the glass fire alarms went off with a highpitched scream i threw myself to the floor on top of bernardo covering my face waiting for that tremendous heat to crack the glass and spill over all of us but it wasnt heat that spilled over me it was coolness water i raised my head to the sprinklers that were filling the room the glass was blackened and smoke and steam curled against the glass like fog as the water killed the fire ramirez reached for the button and the doors opened in a sound of rushing water the alarm was louder now and i realized that it was two different alarms now mixing together in one nervejangling screech ramirez stepped into the room and i heard his voice over the maddening noise madre de dios i stood with the water pounding me soaking my hair clothing i didnt follow him into the room rigby was beyond any help i could give him we still had one more corpse on the run i laid my fingertips on bernardos neck just under the jaw the screech of the fire alarms seemed to make it hard to feel his pulse but it was there strong and sure he was down for the count but he was alive jakes was kneeling beside jarman tears streaming down his face he was trying to stop a wound in jarmans neck with his bare hands the pool of blood that had spilled to either side of jarmans head was being washed away by the sprinklers his eyes were fixed and staring unblinking as the water poured down on him shit i should have grabbed jakes and said hes dead jarman is dead but i couldnt do it i got to my feet ramirez he was still staring into the room at whatever was left of rigby ramirez i yelled it and he turned but his eyes were unfocused as if he wasnt really seeing me weve got one more corpse to catch we cant let it get away he stared at me with dull eyes i needed some help here i took those few steps to stand in the doorway by him and i slapped him hard enough that my hand stung with the blow harder than id meant to hit him his head whipped back and i braced for him to hit me back but he didnt he stood there hands in tight fists shaking with the urge eyes blazing with a rage that was just looking for someone to rain all over it wasnt me hitting him it was everything when he didnt slap me back i said the bad thing went that way i pointed at the door we need to go after it he started to talk very rapidly in spanish i couldnt understand the majority of it but the anger came through just fine i caught one word that i did know he called me a bruja it meant witch fuck this i opened the door having to edge around jarmans body the sprinklers were on in the hallway too evans was still sitting with his back to the wall hed pulled his mask down as if he couldnt get enough air where did it go i asked down the fire stairs end of the hall he had to raise his voice over the sound of fire alarms but his voice was dull distant maybe later if i was good i could go into shock too i didnt hear the door open behind me but ramirez yelled anita i halfturned as i ran for the door im taking the stairs you take the elevators he yelled anita i turned and he tossed one of the cell phones to me i caught it onehanded awkwardly against my chest if i get to ground and havent found it ill call he said i nodded jamming the phone into my back pocket running for the door i found it i had the browning out now there was no oxygenfilled room now wed see if bullets worked as well as knives i pushed the heavy fire door with my whole body until it was flat against the wall and i knew the thing wasnt behind the door then i hesitated on the concrete landing the sprinklers were going in here too like waterfalls down the concrete steps the fire alarms filled the space with highpitched echoes i looked up at the rising stairs then down i had no idea which way it had gone it could have gotten off on any floor above or below me dammit i needed to find this thing i wasnt sure why it felt so urgent that it not get away but id been right about the coming dark and the corpses id trust my judgment they were just animated corpses just a kind id never seen before but they were dead and i was a necromancer technically i could control any form of the walking dead i could sometimes sense a vampire when it was near i took a breath and centered myself in a solid line drew my power in flung it out searching my back to the door the water pouring down on me the scream of the fire alarms so piercing it was hard to think i sent that magic outward up the stairs down the stairs like an invisible line of fog i jerked upright id felt something like a pull on the end of a fishing line down it had gone down if i was wrong there was nothing i could do about it but i didnt think i was wrong i started running down the wet cement steps one hand on the banister to catch myself when i slipped the other with the gun pointed upward there was a woman crumpled outside the next landing lying across the door motionless but breathing i turned her face to the side so she wouldnt be drowned in the sprinklers and kept going down it was going down and it wasnt taking time to feed it was running running away from us running away from me i got to my feet sliding on the wet steps only my death grip on the slippery metal banister catching me before i fell i lost my connection to the creature when i slipped i just couldnt hold the concentration and do everything else the sprinklers stopped abruptly but the fire alarms went on and on more piercing without the water to muffle it i pushed to my feet and started running again very distant far down below there was a scream i vaulted the next turn of banister sliding down the wet metal almost going head first over the next turn of railing i was going as fast as i could faster than was safe i ran and slid and stumbled down the stairs and all the time the growing sense that i was going to be too late that no matter how fast i ran i wouldnt get there in time i couldnt regain the link with the thing without stopping and concentrating i made the decision to keep chasing and hoped i didnt miss it as i ran past the doors besides on the th floor there was a huddled group of watersoaked patients with a nurse they all pointed wordlessly down at there was a man with a bouquet of flowers with a bloody lip that babbled at me and pointed down the door opened on and nurse in a pink smock rushed out and ran into me she screamed jerking back against the wall staring at me with huge eyes she had a baby in each arm in those little blankets one even had its little pink knit hat still in place both babies were screaming their high catlike wails competing with the fire alarm the nurse just stared at me unable to speak or afraid to maybe it was the gun or maybe not all the blood had washed away in the sprinklers i raised my voice above the noise is it on this floor she just nodded she was mumbling something over and over i had to lean into her to understand it its in the nursery its in the nursery its in the nursery i didnt think my adrenaline could get any higher i was wrong i could suddenly feel the blood rushing through my body feel my heart like a painful thing in my chest i opened the door scanning the hallway with the browning nothing moved the corridor stretched long and empty with too many closed doors for comfort the fire alarm was still screaming making my skin tight with the noise but even over the screech of the alarm i could hear the babies crying screaming i slipped the phone out of my pocket hit the button hed told me to hit earlier and started jogging down the hallway towards the sounds ramirez answered it in the middle of the first ring anita im on maternity its the th floor a nurse says the thing is in the nursery i was at the first corner i threw myself against the far wall but didnt really stop im usually more cautious around corners but the crying was getting closer more piteous im on my way ramirez said i hit the button that cut us off but still had it in my hand when i came around the next corner there was a body pushed through a pane of wired safety glass i could tell it was a man but that was about all the face looked like hamburger i stepped on a stethoscope on the floor below him doctor or nurse i didnt check for a pulse if he was alive i didnt know how to help him if he was dead it didnt matter one last door then a long expanse of window but i didnt need to see the long window to know it was the nursery i could hear the babies crying even over the fire alarm the sound of those panicked cries made my heart flutter made me want to run and help them a hard wiring response that i hadnt even known i had made me reach for the door i still had the phone in my left and made one attempt to shove it in my pocket the bite on my left hand made me awkward the phone slipped and i let it fall to the floor the handle turned but the door stopped just inches open i put my shoulder into it and realized it was a body an adult body i backed off and hit it again moving it by painful inches there was a woman screaming not just the babies i couldnt open the door dammit then the window crashed outward in a spray of glass and a body a woman hit the ground and lay there sprawled and bleeding i left the wedged door and went for the window there were shards of glass like small swords on the bottom of the break but id taken falls in judo higher than this id practiced falling for years i glanced in to check one thing the herd of little plastic cribs was pushed to either side i had room i took a running leap at it and threw myself over the broken glass rolling as i fell i only had one free hand to slap the floor with and take the impact of the fall but i wanted the gun in my hand ready to fire i hit the floor and the force of my blow the jump whatever was still there still rolling me i used it to come to my feet before i even knew what was in the room i didnt so much see what was happening as take pictures of isolated things i registered the overturned cribs a tiny tiny baby lying on the floor like a broken doll the center of its body eaten away like the center sucked out of a piece of candy cribs still standing upright splattered with blood some with tiny twisted bodies inside some empty except for the blood then in the far corner was the monster it held a tiny blanketwrapped bundle tiny fists waving in the air i couldnt hear it crying i couldnt hear anything there was nothing but sight and that skinless face bending over the baby my first bullet took it through the forehead the second through the face as its head was thrown back by the impact of the first shot it raised the struggling baby up in front of its face and our eyes locked over the tiny form it looked at me the bullet holes in its face filled in like soft clay i fired into its stomach because thats what i could hit without endangering the baby it jerked back but it threw itself to the floor it didnt fall i hadnt really hurt it it took cover behind a row of tiny cribs they were all on thinlegged wheels i dropped to a crouch and sighted through that forest of thin metal legs and saw it crouching bringing the baby to its mouth there was no clear shot i fired anyway shooting into the wall beside it it flinched scuttling away but didnt drop the baby i fired through the legs of the wheeled cribs keeping it moving where was ramirez it stood and ran straight at me i fired into its body it shuddered but kept coming the baby was naked except for a little diaper now but it was alive the thing threw the baby at me it wasnt even a decision i just caught cradling it to my chest both hands compromised the monster smashed into me the momentum took us all back through the window id come through we landed with the monster on bottom as if wed flipped in midair my gun barrel was pressed into its stomach and i started pulling the trigger with my right hand before i even started cradling the baby tight with my left the creature jerked like a brokenbacked snake i got to my knees beside it firing until the gun clicked empty i dropped the browning and went for the firestar i had it almost pointed when it hit me with the back of one hand and the blow sent me crashing into the wall id tried to protect the baby from the impact and had taken more of it than was good for me i was stunned for a second and it grabbed me by the hair turning me towards it i fired into its chest and stomach each bullet made the body jerk and somewhere around the sixth or seventh shot it let go of my hair a bullet later and the firestar clicked empty it stood over me and that lipless mouth smiled the fire alarm stopped the sudden silence was almost frightening i could hear my heart pounding in my head the baby in my arms was suddenly piercingly loud more frantic sounding the thing tensed and i knew a second before it came that it was going to rush me i used that second to try and put the baby on a clear piece of floor i was halfturned when it picked me up and flung me into the opposite wall i didnt have the baby to worry about anymore i slapped my hands and arms into the wall taking as much of the impact as i could when it closed the distance i wasnt stunned it grabbed one upper arm and i struggled to keep it from grabbing the other i knew how to grapple but not with something that was slick and skinless there was nothing to grab onto it picked me up by my shirt the other hand under my thigh and dead lifted me like a barbell i hit the wall as though it had tried to throw me through it i tried to protect myself but i slid to the floor stunned unable to breathe or think for a space of heartbeats it knelt beside me tearing my shirt out of my pants baring my stomach and my bra it put a hand under my back and lifted me almost gently bowing my back raising me up and lowering its face towards my bare flesh as if it meant to kiss me i heard a voice in my head it whispered i hunger everything seemed distant dreamlike and i knew that i was close to passing out i raised my hand and almost didnt feel like it was mine but i moved it i caressed that slick fleshless face and it rolled those strange lidless eyes up at me as it lowered its mouth to feed my thumb slid along the flesh feeling feeling for the eye it didnt stop me it bit into my upper stomach as my thumb slid into its eye we both screamed it reared back dropping me to the floor it was a short fall and i was on my knees edging away from it when the first bullet whirled it around ramirez came down the hallway from the direction of the fire stairs firing in a twohanded stance as he advanced down the hall the body jerked but the wounds were closing faster and faster as if the more we shot it the better the flesh was at healing the damage i expected the thing to attack ramirez or me or escape but it didnt it leaped into the broken window of the nursery and i knew what it meant to do it wasnt trying to escape it was trying to take as many lives as it could before we destroyed it its master was feeding off the deaths ramirez went to the door that id tried earlier i left him banging against it with his shoulder i pulled myself up to the window it was tearing the blanket off of another baby like unwrapping a present i didnt know where my guns were i had nothing left to throw at it it turned in silhouette and the baby was grabbing for the air with tiny matchstick arms the monsters mouth widened showing a mouth already red with blood ramirez had gotten the door open enough to slip inside he shot at its legs and lower body afraid to try a head shot so close to the baby the monster ignored him and everything slowed down to a crystalline crawl the face lowered mouth wide to take that tiny heart i screamed and i put all my rage all my helplessness into that shout i pulled that power that let me raise the dead i pulled it around me like a shining thing and flung it outward i could actually see it in my mind like a thin white rope of fog i threw my aura my essence around the thing i was a necromancer and all this fucking thing was was a corpse i screamed stop it froze in midmotion the baby almost at its mouth i felt the power that animated it i felt it inside that dead shell its masters power was like a dark flame inside it i had a hand outstretched as if i needed it to point my power i opened my hand and flared that white rope over the corpse i covered it in my aura like growing a new body i closed my aura like a fist around the thing and severed it from the power that made it move the corpse shuddered then collapsed instantly like a puppet whose strings had been cut i felt its master i felt him like a cold wind across my skin i felt him coming for me following the line of my own aura towards me like a string through a maze i tried to pull it back tried to fold it into myself again but id never tried anything like this before and i wasnt fast enough your aura is your magical shield your armor when i lashed out at the corpse id opened myself to anything and everything i thought id understood the risks but i was wrong the masters power lashed out at me like fire following a trail of gasoline and when it hit there was a moment where i threw back my head and i couldnt breathe i felt my heart flutter and stop i felt my body fall to the floor but it didnt hurt as if i were already numb my vision went gray then black and there was a voice in the blackness i have many servants that you stopped this one is nothing to me i will feed through others you die in vain i tried to form words to answer that voice and found that i could fuck you i felt his anger his outrage that i could defy him i tried to laugh at him at his impotence but there wasnt enough left of me to laugh the darkness became something thicker i passed beyond the masters voice beyond my own then there was nothing the first hint i had that i wasnt dead was pain the second was light my chest was burning i jerked back to consciousness gasping for air trying to pull the burning things off of me i blinked up into a burning white light then voices hold her down weight on my arms and legs hands holding me down i tried to struggle but couldnt feel my body enough to be sure i was moving at all bp sixty over eighty and dropping fast i saw shapes blurred with light moving around me a sharp jab in my arm a needle a mans face swam into view blond wireframed glasses his face slid back out of sight into a whiterimmed fog gray spots slid like greasy streamers across my vision and i felt myself sinking backwards downwards outwards a mans voice were losing her darkness rolled over me taking the pain and the light a womans voice floated through the dark let me try then silence in the dark there was no alien voice this time there was nothing but the floating dark and me then there was just the dark i woke up smelling sage incense sage for cleansing and ridding you of negativity or so my teacher marianne was fond of telling me when i complained about the smell sage incense always gave me a headache was i in tennessee with marianne i didnt remember going there i opened my eyes to see where i was and it was a hospital room if you wake up in enough of them you recognize the signs i lay there blinking into the light happy to be awake happy to be alive a woman came to stand by the bed she was smiling she had shoulderlength black hair cut blunt around a strong face her eyes seemed too small for the rest of her face but those eyes stared down at me like she knew things i didnt and they were good things or at least important ones she was wearing something long and flowing violet with a hint of red in the pattern i tried to talk cleared my throat the woman got a glass from the small bedside table her many necklaces clinking as she moved she bent the straw so i could drink one of the necklaces was a pentagram not a nurse i said my voice still sounded rough she offered the water again and i took it i tried again and this time my voice sounded more like me youre not a nurse she smiled and the smile turned an ordinary face into something lovely just as the burning intelligence in her eyes made her striking what was your first clue she had a soft rolling accent that i couldnt place mexican spanish but not youre too well dressed for one thing and the pentagram i tried to point at the necklace but my arm was taped to a board with an iv running into my skin the hand was bandaged and i remembered the corpse biting me i finished the gesture with my right hand which seemed unharmed my left arm seemed to have a sign over it that said cut here bite here whatever here i moved the fingers of my left hand to see if i could i could it didnt even really hurt just tight as if the skin needed to stretch a little the woman was watching me with those eyes of hers i am leonora evans i believe youve met my husband youre doctor evans wife she nodded he mentioned you were a witch she nodded again i arrived at the hospital in the how do you say nick of time for you her accent thickened when she said how do you say what do you mean i asked she sat down in the chair beside the bed and i wondered how long shed been sitting there watching me they restarted your heart but they couldnt keep life in your body i shook my head and the beginnings of a headache was starting behind my eyes can you put out the incense sage always gives me a headache she didnt question it just got up and moved to one of those little folding tables on wheels that they have in hospitals there was incense stuck in a small brazier a long wooden wand a small knife and two candles burning it was an altar her altar or a portable version of it dont take this wrong but why are you here and a nurse isnt she spoke with her back to me as she quenched the incense because if the creature that attacked you tried to kill you a second time the nurse would probably not even notice it was happening until it was too late she came and sat back down by the bed i stared at her i think the nurse would notice if a flesheating corpse came into the room she smiled and it was patient even condescending you and i both know that as horrible as its servants are the true danger is in the master my eyes widened i couldnt help it fear thudded in my throat how did you know that i touched his power when i helped cast him out of you i heard his voice felt his presence he was willing you to die anita draining you of life i swallowed my pulse still too fast id like a nurse now please youre afraid of me she smiled when she said it i started to say no but then yeah but its not personal lets just say after my brush with death im not sure who to trust magically speaking are you saying i saved you because this master allowed me to save you i dont know she frowned for the first time trust me on this anita it was not easy to save you i had to encircle you with protection and some of that protection was my own power my own essence if i had not been strong enough if the names i called on for aid had not been strong enough i would have died with you i looked up at her and wanted to believe her but thank you she sighed settling the skirt of her dress with fingers aglitter with rings very well i will fetch you a familiar face but then we must talk your friend ted told me of the marks that bind you to the werewolf and the vampire something must have shown on my face because she said i needed to know in order to help you id saved your life by the time he arrived here but i was trying to fix your aura and i couldnt she passed a hand just above my body and i felt that trail of warmth that was her power caressing over mine she hesitated over my chest over my heart there is a hole here as if there is a piece of yourself missing her hands slid further down my body and hesitated low on my stomach or high on my abdomen depending on how you looked at it here is another hole they are both chakra points important energy points for your body bad places to have no ability to shield from magical attack my heart was back to beating faster than it should have they are closed ive worked for the last six months to close them up leonora shook her head taking her hands gently back from me if i understand what your friend told me of this triumvirate of power you are a part of then these spaces are like electrical sockets in the wall of your aura your body the two creatures have the plugs that fit their respective sockets they arent creatures i said ted painted a very unflattering picture of them i frowned it sounded like something edward would do ted doesnt like the fact that im intimate with monsters you are lovers with both then no i mean i tried to think of a quick version i was sleeping with them at separate times i mean for a little while i was dating them both at the same time but it didnt work out why did it not work we were invading each others dreams thinking each others thoughts every time we had sex it was worse as if the sex was tying the knots tighter and tighter i stopped talking not because i was finished but because the words werent enough i started over one night the three of us were alone just talking trying to work things out a thought popped into my head and it wasnt mine or i didnt think it was mine but i didnt know whose thought it was i looked up at her trying to will her to understand the moment of sheer terror that had been for me she nodded as if she did but her next words said shed missed the point that frightened you yeah i said making the word two syllables so shed catch the sarcasm the lack of control she said yes the lack of individual privacy yes i said why did you take on these marks they would have died if i hadnt done it we might all have died so you did it to save your own life she sat there hands crossed in her lap perfectly at ease while she probed my psychic wounds i hate people who are at peace with themselves no i couldnt lose them both i might have survived losing one but not both not if i could save them the marks gave you all enough power to overcome your enemies yes if the thought of sharing your life with them is so terrifying then why did their deaths loom so large i opened my mouth closed it tried again i loved them i guess past tense loved not love i was suddenly tired i dont know anymore i just dont know if you love someone then your freedom is curtailed if you love someone you give up much of your privacy if you love someone then you are no longer merely one person but half of couple to think or behave any other way is to risk losing that love its not like having to share the bathroom or argue over which side of the bed you get to sleep on theyre trying to share my mind my soul do you really believe that last about your soul i settled into the pillow and closed my eyes i dont know i guess not but it i opened my eyes thank you for saving my life if i can ever return the favor i will but i dont owe you an explanation of my personal life youre quite right she straightened her shoulders as if pulling herself back and suddenly she seemed less intrusive more businesslike lets return to my analogy of the holes being like light sockets and the men being the plugs that fit them what you did was spackle over the holes cover them with plaster when the master attacked you his power tore off the plaster and reopened the holes you cannot close these holes with your own aura i cannot imagine the amount of effort it took to put patches over them ted said you were learning ritual from a witch i shook my head shes more psychic than witch its not a religion just natural ability leonora nodded did she approve of you closing the holes the way you did i told her i wanted to learn how to shield myself from them and she helped me do that did she tell you it was a temporary repair i frowned at her no your hostility flares every time we approach the fact that you have given these two men in effect the keys to your soul you cannot block them permanently and by trying to you weaken yourself and probably them as well well all just have to live with it i said you almost didnt live with it she had my attention now are you saying that the reason the master was able to almost kill me was the weakness in my aura he would have hurt you badly even without them but i believe the holes made you unable to resist him especially with them freshly opened as they were think of them perhaps as wounds freshly opened wounds that any preternatural infection can enter you through i thought about what she was saying i believed it what can i do the holes are meant to be filled by only one thing the auras of the men you loved your auras must now be like jigsaw puzzles with pieces missing and only the three of you together are a whole now i cant accept that she shrugged accept it or not but it is still the truth im not ready to give up the fight just yet thanks anyway she stood frowning do as you will but remember that if you come up against other preternatural powers then you will not be able to protect yourself from them ive been like this for a year i think i can manage are you that arrogant or just that determined not to talk about it any more she looked down at me as if she expected an answer i gave her the only one i had i dont want to talk about it anymore she nodded then i will get your friend and im sure the doctor will want to speak with you she turned and walked out the room was very quiet full of that hush that hospitals are so fond of i looked at her makeshift altar and wondered what shed had to do to save me of course i only had her word for that the moment i thought it i was sorry why was i so distrustful of her because she was a witch the way marks hated me because i was a necromancer or was it just that i didnt like the truth she was telling me that i couldnt shield myself from magical critters until the holes in my aura had been filled in it had taken me most of the last six months to fill up those holes six months of effort and they were raw again shit but if they were open why didnt i sense jeanclaude and richard if the marks were truly unshielded again then why wasnt there a burst of closeness i needed to call my teacher marianne i trusted her to tell me the truth shed warned me that simply blocking off the marks was only temporary but she helped me do it because she felt i needed some time to adjust to accept i wasnt sure i had another six months of meditative prayer psychic visualization and celibacy in me it had taken all that and power energy hers and mine of course marianne had taught me other things and one of those meant i could check myself i could run my hand down my own aura and see if the holes were there the trouble was i needed my left hand for that and it was wrapped in bandages strapped to a hoard with a tube in it now that i was alone and not being pestered with hard questions i began to feel my body it hurt every time i moved my back it hurt some of it was the dull ache of bruises but there were two spots that had the sharp bite of things that had bled i tried to remember how i could have cut my back the glass in the window when the corpse took us back through it that had to be it my face ached in a line from jaw to forehead i remembered the corpse hitting me backhand it had been almost casual but it had knocked me halfsenseless just once id like to meet a type of walking dead that wasnt stronger than a living person i lifted the loose neck of my hospital gown and found little round pads stuck to my chest i glanced at the heart monitor beside the bed giving that reassuring sound that said my heart was still working i had a sudden memory of the moment when my heart had stopped when the master had willed it to stop i was suddenly cold and it wasnt the overly ambitious air conditioner id come very close to dying yesterday today i didnt know what day it was only the sunshine pressing against the drawn blinds let me know it was day and not night there were red patches on the skin of my upper body like bad sunburns i touched one gently it hurt how the hell had i gotten burns i lifted the gown until it made a cave and i could see down the line of my body at least until midthigh where the weight of the covers hid me from view there was a bandage just below my rib cage i remembered the things mouth opening over my skin while he cradled me gently the moment when he bit down i pushed the memory away later much much later i checked my left shoulder but the scrape marks from teeth had already scabbed over scabbed over how long had i been out a man came into the room he seemed familiar but i knew i did not know him he was tall with blond hair and silverframed glasses im doctor cunningham and i am very glad to see you awake me too i said he smiled and started checking me over he used a penlight and made me follow the light his finger and kept staring into my eyes so long he had me worried did i have a concussion no he said why does your head hurt a little but i think its from the sage incense he looked embarrassed i am sorry about that ms blake but she seemed to think all this was very important and frankly i dont know why you almost died to begin with or why you didnt just keep on dying i let her do what she wanted i thought my heart stopped i said he tucked his stethoscope into his ears and pressed it to my chest technically yes he stopped talking listening to my heart he asked me to breathe deeply a couple of times then made some notes on the chart at the foot of my bed yes your heart did stop but i dont know why it stopped none of your injuries were that serious or for that matter that kind of injury he shook his head and came back to stand by me how did i get the burns on my chest we used the defibrillator to start your heart it can leave mild burns how long have i been here two days this is your third day with us i took a deep breath and tried not to panic id lost two days have there been any more murders the smile wilted on his face leaving his eyes even more serious than they had been you mean the mutilation murders i nodded no no new bodies i let out the breath good he was frowning now no more questions about your health just about the murders you said you dont know why i almost died or why i didnt go ahead and die i assume that means leonora evans saved me he looked even more uncomfortable all i know is that once we allowed her to lay hands on you your blood pressure started to go back up your heart rhythm steadied out he shook his head i simply dont know what happened and if you knew how hard it is for a doctor any doctor to admit ignorance youd be much more impressed with me saying that i smiled actually ive been in the hospital before i appreciate you telling me the truth and not trying to claim credit for my miraculous recovery miraculous is a good word for it he touched the one thin knife scar on my right forearm you have quite a collection of war injuries ms blake i believe you have seen a lot of hospitals yeah i said he shook his head youre what twentytwo twentythree twentysix i said you look younger he said its being short i said no he said it isnt but still to have these kinds of scars at twentysix is not a good sign ms blake i did my residency in a very bad section of a very big city we used to get a lot of gang members if they lived to see twentysix their bodies looked like yours knife scars he leaned across the bed and raised the sleeve of the gown enough to touch the healed bullet wound on my upper arm bullet wounds we even had a shapeshifter gang so ive seen the claw marks and bites too you must have been in new york i said he blinked how did you know its illegal to purposefully give lycanthropy to a minor even with their permission so the gang leaders were put under a death sentence they sent in special forces along with new yorks finest to wipe them out he nodded i left the city just before they did that id treated a lot of those kids his eyes were distant with remembering we had two of them shapechange during treatment then they wouldnt let them in the hospital anymore if you wore their colors you were left to die most of them probably lived anyway doctor cunningham if the initial wound doesnt kill them immediately they probably arent going to die are you trying to comfort me he asked maybe he looked down at me then ill tell you what i told all of them get out get out of this line of work or you will not live to see forty i was actually wondering if i was going to make it to thirty i said was that a joke i think so you know the old saying half in jest all in seriousness he asked cant say ive heard that one listen to yourself ms blake take it to heart and find something a little safer to be doing if i was a cop you wouldnt be saying this i have never treated a policeman that had this many scars the closest ive ever seen outside the gangs was a marine did you tell him to quit his job the war was over ms blake normal military duty just isnt that dangerous he looked at me all serious i looked back blankfaced giving him nothing he sighed youll do what you want to do and its none of my business anyway he turned and walked towards the door i called after him i do appreciate the concern doctor honestly i do he nodded one hand on either side of his stethoscope like it was a towel you appreciate my concern but youre going to ignore my advice actually if i live through this case im planning to take some time off its not the injury rate doctor its the erosion of the ethics thats beginning to get to me he tugged on the stethoscope are you telling me that if i think you look bad i should see the other guy i gazed down sort of taking it all in i execute people doctor cunningham there are no bodies to look at dont you mean you execute vampires he said once upon a time thats what i meant we had another long moment of looking at each other then he said are you saying you kill humans no im saying that theres not as much difference between vamps and humans as i used to tell myself a moral dilemma he said yeah i said i dont envy you the problem ms blake but try to stay out of the line of fire until you figure out the answer to it i always try and stay out of the line of fire doctor try harder he said and walked out edward came in the door before it had time to swing closed he was wearing one of those shortsleeved shirts with little pockets on the front if it had been tan id have said he looked dressed for a safari but the shirt was black so were his freshly pressed jeans the belt that encircled his narrow waist down to the blackover belt buckle so it wouldnt shine in the dark and give you away the belt buckle matched the shoulder holster and gun that outlined his chest there was a line of white undershirt at the open neck of the shirt but other than that it was unrelieved blackness it made his hair and eyes look even paler it was the first time id seen him without the cowboy hat out of doors since i arrived if youre dressed for my funeral its too casual if its just street clothes then you must be scaring the tourists youre alive good he said i gave him a look very funny i wasnt being funny we looked at each other why so serious edward i asked the doc and he said there hadnt been any more murders he shook his head and came to stand at the foot of the bed near the makeshift altar i ended up looking down the length of the bed at him and it was awkward i found the button controls with my right hand and raised the head of the bed slowly id been in enough hospital beds to know where everything was no there havent been any more murders he said then whats with the long face i was paying attention to my body while the bed raised waiting for it to hurt i ached all over which you tend to do after being thrown into walls my chest hurt and it wasnt just the burns i stopped when i was sitting up enough to see him without straining he gave a very small smile you nearly die and you ask whats wrong i raised eyebrows at him i didnt know you cared more than i should i didnt know what to say to that but i tried does this mean you wont kill me just for sport he blinked and the emotion was gone edward was standing there staring at me his usual amused blankness showing on his face you know i only kill for money bullshit i said ive seen you kill people when you werent getting a paycheck only when im with you id tried to play it tough and guylike he wasnt having any of it i tried for honesty next you look tired edward he nodded i am if there havent been any more murders why do you look so beat bernardo only got out of the hospital yesterday i raised eyebrows at him how bad was he hurt broken arm concussion hell heal good i said there was still an air to him of strangeness more than normal edward strangeness as if there was more to tell and he didnt want to tell it drop the other shoe edward his eyes narrowed what do you mean tell me whats got you all bothered i tried to see nicky baco without you or bernardo bernardo tell you about the meet i asked no your detective friend ramirez told me that surprised me last time i talked to him he was sort of insisting that he go along with me to meet baco he still wanted to come along but baco wouldnt see any of us he insisted that you and bernardo or at least you had to be there youre not upset just because nicky wouldnt dance with you i said just tell me do you really need baco anita why just answer the question i knew edward well enough to know he meant it i answered his question or he wouldnt answer mine yeah i need him hes a necromancer edward and whatever this thing is it is just a form of necromancy but youre a better necromancer than he is stronger maybe but i dont know much about ritual necromancy what i do is actually closer to voodoo than traditional necromancy he gave a dim smile shaking his head and what exactly is traditional necromancy and how are you so sure that baco practices it if he was an animator id have heard of him there just arent that many of us so he doesnt raise zombies but you and everyone else in the metaphysical community in and around santa fe say that baco works with the dead i only know his reputation anita ive never seen him do shit fine but ive met him he doesnt do vaudun voodoo ive seen that enough to know the trappings and the feel of it so if hes not a zombie raiser or a vaudun priest and people still call him a necromancer then he must do ritual necromancy which is edward said to my knowledge its raising the spirits of the dead for sort of divination purposes or to get questions answered edward shook his head whatever baco does it has to be worse than raising a few ghosts people are scared of him nice of you to mention that before i met him the first time i said he took a deep breath hands on hips not looking at me i was careless i looked at him youre a lot of things edward careless isnt one of them he nodded and looked up at me how about competitive i frowned at him but said competitive ill give you but what does that have to do with baco i knew that his bar was the hangout for the local werewolves i stared at him just stared at him when i closed my mouth i said you competitive shit you let bernardo and me walk in there unprepared you could have gotten us killed youre not even going to ask why i let you walk in blind he asked let me take a wild guess you wanted to see how id handle it cold maybe how bernardo would handle it or maybe both he nodded fuck edward this isnt a game i know that no you dont youve been keeping things from me from the moment i stepped off the plane you keep testing my nerve to see if its better than yours it is so junior high so damned i struggled to find the right word such a guy thing to do im sorry he said and his voice was soft the apology stopped me drained some of the righteous indignation ive never heard you apologize for anything edward not to anyone its been a long time since i said i was sorry to anyone does this mean the games are over and youll quit trying to see who is the biggest baddest person he nodded thats what it means i lay there and looked at him is it just being with donna or is something else starting to open you up what do you mean if you dont stop all this sentimental shit ill begin to think youre just a mere mortal like the rest of us he smiled speaking of immortals he said we werent i said im changing the subject he said okay if this monster really is an aztec boogeyman then it is a hell of a coincidence that the master of the city who just happens to be an aztec doesnt know anything about it we talked to her edward do you think a vamp even a master vamp could do all the things weve been seeing i thought about it but finally said not just from vampiric powers no but if she were some kind of aztec sorcerer in life she might retain her powers after death i just dont know that much about aztec magic it doesnt come up a lot she was different from any vampire ive ever met it could mean that she was a sorcerer in life i think you need to see her again and what ask her if shes involved in the murder and mutilation of some twenty people he grinned something like that i nodded okay when i get out of the hospital a visit to vampire central goes up to the head of my list his face went very blank what is it edward do you really need baco he said i sensed this thing the first night i arrived or first day it sensed me right back and it shielded itself i havent picked it up that strongly since and ive driven past the spot where i felt it baco can sense it too and hes afraid of it so yeah i want to talk to him you dont think hes behind it ive felt this things power baco is powerful but hes not that powerful whatever this thing is its not human he sighed fine he said it like hed made a decision baco says you have to meet him before ten this morning or dont bother coming i searched the room until i found the clock on the wall it was eight shit i said the doc says you need at least another twentyfour hours in here leonora evans that if the monster tries for you again you wont make it you have a point to make i said i almost didnt tell you i was beginning to get pissed i dont need you to protect me edward i thought you of all people knew better than that are you sure youre up to it i almost just said yes but i was so tired it was a bone weariness that had nothing to do with lack of sleep i was hurt and it went beyond the bruises and cuts that i could feel no i said he blinked you must feel like shit to admit that ive felt better but somethings scaring baco if he says meet before ten this morning we meet maybe the great bad thing is coming to get him at eleven today cant miss that can we ive got a bag of fresh clothes out in the hall for you they cut your shoulder holster off of you in the emergency room and the spine sheath shit i said that spine sheath was a custom job he shrugged you can order a new one he went to the door stepped out a moment then came back in with a small overnight bag he came around to the side of the bed that leonoras chair was on the other side of the bed was a little too crowded with equipment for visitors to stand he opened it and started laying out the clothes his buttondown black shirt didnt fit perfectly smoothly around his ribs he laid out the clothes in neat piles black jeans black polo shirt black socks even the underwear and bra matched the theme whats with the funerary color scheme the dark blue polo shirt and jeans were trashed all you had left was black red and purple for shirts we need something dark today authoritative why are you in black then i was watching the way the shirt lay when he moved it wasnt a gun i didnt think it was knives what was under his shirt white shows blood whats under your shirt edward he smiled and unbuttoned the middle buttons he had what looked like a modified belly band holster strapped across his upper body but it wasnt a gun it was metal pieces too big to be ammo and too oddly shaped on the end i could see they looked like teenytiny metal darts are those some sort of ittybitty throwing knife he nodded bernardo said that if you took out an eye the flayed ones didnt like it i poked out eyes on them twice and each time it seemed to hurt and disorient them truthfully i didnt think bernardo noticed what i was doing he smiled and started buttoning his shirt up you shouldnt underestimate him could you really hit an eye throwing one of those things he slipped one out of its little holster and threw it into the wall in one flick of his hand he pierced one of the tiny designs on the wallpaper across the room i cant hit shit with something like that he retrieved it from the wall and replaced it on his chest and walked back to me you can even have your very own flamethrower if you want it gee and it isnt even christmas he smiled not christmas more like easter i frowned up at him i dont get the easter reference you came back from the dead or didnt anyone tell you i shook my head tell me what your heart stopped three times ramirez kept it going with cpr until the doctors got to you but they lost you twice you were going down for the third time when leonora evans convinced them to let her try and save you with some of that good old time religion my heart was suddenly beating too hard and i could have sworn that the inside of my ribs hurt with each beat are you trying to scare me no just explaining the easter reference you know christ rose from the dead i get it i get it i was suddenly scared and angry i am rarely one without being the other if you still believe in it id light a candle or two he said ill think about it i said and my voice sounded defensive even to me he was smiling again and i was beginning to distrust his smile almost as much as the rest of him or maybe you should talk to leonora and ask her who she asked for help to get you back maybe its not a church candle you need to light maybe you need to slaughter a few chickens wiccans do not kill things to raise power he shrugged sorry they dont teach comparative religion or metaphysics in assassin school youve scared me reminded me how hurt i am and now youre yanking my chain teasing me do you want me to get up out of this bed and meet baco or not his face was all serious the last of the humor draining away like ice melting down a hot plate i want you to do whatever you need to do anita i thought i wanted to get this son of a bitch at any price he touched my right hand where it lay on the sheet he didnt hold it just touched it then pulled away i was wrong some things im not willing to pay before i could think of anything to say he turned and left i wasnt sure which was confusing me more this case or the new and more emotional edward i caught sight of the clock shit i had an hour and forty minutes to get dressed check out of the hospital against doctors orders and drive to los duendos i was betting arguing with doctor cunningham was going to take longer than either of the other two i pressed the button to slowly raise the bed the closer i got to a sitting position the more i hurt my chest ached as if the muscles around my ribs had been overused the cuts on my back did not like sitting up and would probably like walking even less there was a certain tightness to the skin like a shoe laced too tightly that said i had stitches on my back they would be a pain all their own when i insisted on moving nothing feels quite like stitches i wondered how many i had in my back it felt like a lot when i was in a sitting position i waited for a few seconds listening to my body complain i usually dont get this hurt until the end of a case i hadnt even met the greatbadthing face to face yet it had nearly killed me from a nice supposedly safe distance i let myself think about that for a few minutes id almost died seems like i should get a few days of grace before having to crawl back into the trenches but crime and tide wait for no woman or something like that ill admit i thought about just staying put just letting someone else be heroic for a change but the moment i seriously thought it i flashed on the nursery and those redsplashed cribs i couldnt just lie here and trust that everyone would muddle through without me i just couldnt do it i had my gown halfway down my arms when i realized i couldnt just yank the sticky pads that connected me to the heart monitor just yanking them off would give the hospital staff just a little too much excitement i finally pressed the nurse call button i had to get unplugged from all the drips and machines the nurse came almost immediately which either meant the hospital had more nurses on staff than most hospitals could afford these days or i was really hurt and they were paying extra attention to me i was hoping for a surplus of nurses but wasnt betting on it the nurse was shorter than i am very petite with blond hair cut short and sort of bouncy her professional smile wilted when she saw me sitting up with the gown obviously coming off what are you doing ms blake getting dressed i said she shook her head i dont think so look id prefer help getting all the tubes and wires off me but it is all coming off because im checking out ill get doctor cunningham she turned and walked out you do that i said to the empty room i got a death grip on the little wires that attached to the sticky pads and pulled it felt like id pulled a foot worth of skin off with them a sharp grinding ache like it would hurt to touch the skin the high pitched scream of the machine let people know my heart was no longer going pittypat on the other end of the wires the sound reminded me uncomfortably of the fire alarm though it was much less obnoxious the pads had left large circular welts on my skin but they were not nearly as big as they felt the fact that the welts hurt enough to rise above all the other aches and pains lets you know how raw my skin felt doctor cunningham came through the door while i was still working on the tape that bound my hand to the iv board he turned the screaming heart monitor off what do you think youre doing he asked getting dressed like hell you are i looked up at his enraged face and just didnt have any anger to throw back at him i was too tired and too hurt to waste energy on anything but the process of getting up and getting out of this bed i have to go doctor i kept picking at the tape and wasnt making much progress i needed a knife where are my weapons he ignored the question and asked one of his own where could you possibly need to go badly enough to climb out of this bed i need to get back to work the police can handle things for a few days ms blake there are people who will talk to me that wont talk to the police id gotten an edge of tape up then your friends in the hallway can talk to them doctor cunningham got points for realizing that edward and company were the kind of men that people who avoided the police might talk to this particular person wont talk to anyone but me i finally stopped picking at the tape can you please get this off of me he took a breath to argue i think but what he said was ill help you check out if you let me show you something first i must have looked as suspicious as i felt but i nodded ill be right back and he left the room everyone seemed to be doing that today he was gone long enough that edward came in to see what the hold up was i lifted the taped arm and he produced a switchblade from his pocket the blade cut through the tape like paper edward always did take good care of his tools i was still left with having to peel the tape off my arm and the iv itself had to come out mustnt forget that if you want it fast ill do it edward said i nodded and he ripped the tape off my arm along with the iv ow he smiled sissy sociopath doctor cunningham came in carrying a large hand mirror his gaze flicked to edward and my now free arm it was not a friendly look if youll step back for a moment mr forrester youre the doctor edward said moving back to the foot of the bed nice of you to remember that doctor cunningham said he held the mirror in front of my face i looked startled eyes too wide and so dark they looked black im naturally pale but my skin was ghostwhite ethereal like flexible ivory it was what made my eyes look even darker than normal or maybe it was the bruise id known my face hurt and id even known why being hit hard enough to slam into a wall should leave a mark the bruise went up to the edge of my cheek just under the eye and cattycorner down to my jaw line just under the ear my skin was a rainbow of purpleblack with a core of red skin with darker red scattered across it it was one of those really deep bruises that probably hadnt even shown much of a mark for the first day but it would go through all the color changes once it started i had shades of green yellow and brown to look forward to if i hadnt had three vampire marks on me id have had at least a broken jaw or maybe a broken neck there were moments when id give almost anything to be free of the marks but staring at the bruise knowing that i healed faster than normal for a human and it still looked this bad was not one of them i was grateful to be alive i said a brief silent prayer while i stared at my face thank you dear god for me not being dead aloud i said nasty and handed the mirror to the doctor he frowned obviously it wasnt the reaction hed wanted youve got over forty stitches in your back my eyes went wide before i could stop them gee thats a record even for me this isnt a joke ms blake it might as well be funny doctor if you start moving around youre going to rip the stitches open right now if youre careful the scars wont be bad but if you start moving around youll scar i sighed itll have plenty of company doctor he stood there shaking his head slowly face set in harsh lines nothing i can say is going to make any difference is it no i said youre a fool he said if i stay in here until im healed what am i going to say to myself when im staring down at the next round of bodies saving the world is not your job ms blake im not that ambitious i said im just trying to save a few lives and you truly believe that only you can solve this case no but i know that i am the only one that this man will talk to id almost said nicky baco but i didnt want doctor cunningham calling the police and telling them where we were going not that he would do that but better safe than sorry i told you that id check you out if you looked at your injuries i keep my word i appreciate that in a person doctor cunningham thank you dont thank me ms blake dont thank me he moved towards the door giving both the makeshift altar and edward a mediumwide berth as if both made him uncomfortable at the door he turned ill send a nurse in to help you dress because you will need the help he walked out before i could say thank you again probably just as well edward stayed until the nurse arrived it was a different nurse tall light brunette if that wasnt an oxymoron her gaze stayed on my bruised face longer than was politic and when she helped me slip out of the gown she gave a low hiss at my back it was unprofessional and sort of unnurselike they were usually blankly cheerful to the point of nausea when you were hurt or blunt anything to cover that what had happened to you bothered them youll never be able to wear a bra over the stitches in your back she said i sighed i hated to go without a bra it always made me feel underdressed no matter what else i was wearing lets just get the shirt on she held it and helped me slip it over my head putting my arms up to go through the sleeves made the pain in my back sharp and immediate as if the skin would pull apart if i moved too quickly i wondered if that would have been the analogy that id chosen if doctor cunningham hadnt warned me about the stitches pulling apart id have shrugged if i hadnt been sure it would hurt i normally work in the nursery the nurse said as she helped me straighten the shirt buttoning the first two buttons i looked up at her not sure what to say but i didnt need to worry she knew exactly what to say they called me in after you destroyed the monster for the cleanup she helped me sit on the edge of the bed i sat there for a few seconds with my legs dangling off the edge letting my body adjust to the fact that we were getting dressed we were going to stand in just a second im sorry you had to see it i said because i had to say something i wasnt even comfortable with her saying id destroyed the monster it made it sound entirely too heroic and what it had felt like was desperate desperation is the true mother of invention at least for me she started to help me into the black panties but i took them from her hands if i couldnt even put on my own underwear i was in serious trouble and if i was truly that hurt i needed to know it it would cut down on my urge to be heroic i started to simply bend at the waist but it just wasnt that easy i lowered myself downward a little bit at a time and i was still nowhere near low enough let me start them up your legs so you dont have to bend all the way down the nurse said i finally let her and even pulling them only part way up my body turned my back into one great big hurt i leaned against the bed when they were on and didnt even argue when she bent down to put on my socks she never argued that i was too hurt to be leaving it was too obvious to argue about it id worked with vicki for two years it was megs first job her eyes were dry wide and i noticed the dark circles under them like purplish smudges as if she hadnt slept much in the last three days i remembered the body that had blocked the door into the nursery and the nurse that had been thrown through the window vicki and meg though id probably never know which had been which not that it mattered they were dead and didnt care and the nurse helping me slip into a pair of black jeans looked too fragile for questions my job was to listen and make encouraging noises where needed i slipped the jeans over my butt without help buttoned them and zipped them all by myself things were looking up id tried tucking the shirt into my pants out of habit but that required more back movement than i thought besides untucked my braless state would be a little less noticeable i was really too well endowed to go without but my modesty wasnt worth the pain not today every time i close my eyes i see the babies she was kneeling with one of my shoes in her hands when she looked up i keep thinking i should be dreaming about my friends but i only see the babies their little bodies and they cry every time i close my eyes i hear the babies screaming i wasnt there and i hear them every night the tears were finally there sliding soundlessly down her face as if she didnt know she was crying she slid the shoe on my foot and looked down paying attention to what she was doing see a councilor or a priest or whoever you trust i said youll need help she got my other shoe off the bed and gazed up at me the tears drying in tracks down her pale cheeks i heard that theres some sort of witch making these corpses causing them to attack people not a witch i said whats behind all this isnt human she slipped the shoe on me frowning is it immortal like a vampire i didnt do my usual lecture about how vamps arent immortal only hard to kill she didnt need that particular lecture i dont know yet she laced my shoe solid but not too tight as if she did this regularly she looked up at me with those strange empty eyes of hers tear tracks still visible on her face if its not immortal kill it her face held that absolute trust that is usually reserved for small children or people that are not quite all there there was no questioning in her shocked eyes no doubt in that pale face i answered that trust reality could wait until she was ready for it i said what she needed to hear if it can die ill kill it i said it because she needed to hear it i said it because after what id seen it do that was the plan maybe it had been the plan all along knowing edward it probably had been he said solve the case when what he usually meant was kill them kill them all as a plan id heard worse as a way of life it lacked a certain romance as a way to stay alive it was just about perfect as a way to keep your soul intact it sucked but i was willing to trade a piece of my soul to stop this thing and that was perhaps my biggest problem i was always willing to compromise my soul if it would take out the great evil but there always seemed to be another great evil coming down the road no matter how many times i saved the day and took out the monster there was always another monster and there always would be the monster supply was unlimited i was not the parts of myself that i was using up to slay the monsters was finite and once i used it all up there would be no going back id be edward in drag i could save the world and lose myself and staring down into the womans face watching that perfect faith fill her lost eyes i wasnt sure the bargain was a good one but i was sure of one thing i couldnt say no i couldnt let the monsters win not even if it meant becoming one of them god forgive me if it was arrogance god protect me if it wasnt i got up out of bed and went in search of monsters i was buckled into the front seat of edwards hummer holding myself stiff and careful glad the ride was smooth bernardo and olaf were in the back seat dressed in someones idea of assassin chic bernardo was in a leather vest his cast looked very white and awkward right arm at a fortyfive degree angle a white strap going from arm to around his neck his long hair was done in a vaguely oriental style with one large deceptively loose knot held back with what looked like two long gold chopsticks it held back the sides of his hair but left most of the length swinging free down his back black jeans of a looser cut with holes worn through across his knees and the black boots id seen him wear since i arrived but who was i to complain i had three pairs of black nikes and i had brought all three with me there was a swollen bump to the side of his forehead and bruises like a pattern of modern art tattoos down one side of his face his right eye was still puffy around one edge but he managed not to look pale or ill like i did in fact if you could ignore the cast and bruises he looked dandy i hoped he felt as good as he looked because i looked like shit and felt worse who did your hair i asked because with only one good arm i knew he hadnt olaf he said and that one word was very bland very empty i widened my eye and looked over at olaf he sat beside bernardo on the side behind edward as far from me as he could get and still be in the car he hadnt spoken a word to me since i walked out of the hospital room and the four of us walked to the car it hadnt bothered me at the time because id been too busy trying to walk without making small pain noises under my breath whimpering while you walked was always a bad sign but now i was sitting down and as comfortable as i was likely to get for a while i was also in a momentously bad mood because i was scared i felt physically weak and not up to a fight psychically my hardwon shields were crap again full of holes and if the master tried for me again i was in very deep shit leonora evans had given me a woven silk cord with a little drawstring bag on it the little bag was lumpy packed full with small hard objects that felt like rocks and dry crumbling things that were probably herbs shed told me not to open the bag because that would let all the goodness out she was the witch so i did what she told me the bag was a charm of protection and it would work without my believing in its power which was good since except for my cross i didnt believe in very much leonora had been making the charm for three days since she saved me in the emergency room she had not intended it to be a cure all for the holes in my defenses but it was all she had to give me on such short notice she was almost as angry with me as doctor cunningham had been for leaving the hospital early she had taken one of her own necklaces and placed it over my head it was a large piece of polished semiprecious stone a strange dark gold color citrine for protection and to absorb negativity and magical attacks directed at me to say that i wasnt a big believer in crystals and the new age was an understatement but i took it mainly because she was so angry and so sincerely worried about me out in the world with my aura hanging open for the bad guys to munch on i knew i had holes in my aura i could feel them but it was all just a little too hocuspocus for me so i turned in my seat feeling the stitches in my back tighten adding a little push to the pain i was already feeling and stared at olaf he was staring out the window as if there was something fascinating in the rows of small houses on that side of the car olaf i said he never moved just watched the passing scenery olaf it was almost a yell in the small confines of the car his shoulders twitched but that was all it was like i was some kind of insect buzzing around him you might wave a hand at it but you wouldnt talk to it it pissed me off now i understand why you dont like women you should have just said you were homosexual and my feelings wouldnt have been so hurt edward said softly jesus anita olaf turned very slowly almost in slow motion as if each muscle in his neck were pulling him around in small jerks what did you say each word was ragefilled hot with hatred you did a great job on bernardos hair you made him look very pretty i didnt believe that particular sexual stereotype but i was betting that olaf did i was also betting that he was homophobic a lot of ultramasculine men are he undid his seatbelt with a noticeable click and eased forward i pulled the firestar out of the holster that was sitting in my lap the pants that edward had brought to the hospital were a little too tight for my innerpants holster i watched olafs hand vanish underneath the black leather jacket maybe he hadnt understood the movement when id unholstered the gun maybe he expected me to raise the gun and sight along the back of the car i pointed the gun between the small space between the seats it wasnt a perfect angle but i had my gun pointed first and that counted in a gun fight hed pulled his gun out from under the jacket but it wasnt pointed yet if id meant to kill him id have won edward slammed on the brakes olaf slammed into the back of the seat gun at a bad angle driving his wrist backwards it wasnt being thrown into the seatbelt and nearly the dashboard that hurt it was the being flung backwards into the seat my breath went out in a sharp gasp olafs face ended up very close to the space between the seats and he saw the gun barrel pointed now at his chest i was hurting so bad that my skin twitched with the need to writhe but i kept my hand tight around the gun using my free hand to brace myself and make sure i didnt move i had the drop on him and i was keeping it the hummer skidded to a stop against the curb edward had his seatbelt off and was whirling around in his seat i caught the flash of a gun in his hand and had a heartbeat to decide whether to try and take the gun off olaf and try for edward or keep the gun where it was i kept the gun on olaf i didnt think edward would shoot me and olaf might edward shoved the barrel of his gun against the back of olafs bald head the tension level in the car skyrocketed edward went to his knees gun never moving from olafs head i could see olafs eyes rolled up we looked at each other and i saw that he was afraid he believed that edward would do it so did i though i didnt know why and with edward there was always a why even if it was only money i had a sense of bernardo sitting very stiff on his side of the seat trying to pull back from the mess that was about to spill all over the car do you want me to kill him edward asked his voice was quiet and empty as if hed asked did i want him to pass the salt i could do an empty uninterested voice but not like edward i could never be that dispassionate not yet anyway i said no automatically then added not like this something passed through olafs eyes it wasnt fear it was more like surprise surprise that i hadnt said yeah shoot him or surprise about something else i couldnt fathom who knew edward took the gun from olafs hand then clicked the safety off on his own gun and leaned back still on his knees in the drivers seat then stop baiting him anita olaf sat back in his seat slowly almost stiffly as if afraid to move too quickly nothing like having a gun to your head to teach you caution he smoothed his hands down the leather jacket which still looked like way too much to wear in the heat i will not owe my life to any woman his voice was sort of subdued but it was clear i eased the firestar back out from between the seats and said consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds olaf he frowned at me maybe he didnt get the quote edward looked at both of us shaking his head youre both scared and that makes you both stupid im not scared olaf said ditto i said he frowned at me you just crawled out of a hospital bed of course youre scared wondering if the next time you meet the monster will be your last i looked back at him and it was not a friendly look so you picked a fight with olaf because youd rather fight him than be scared just like a woman to be so irrational olaf said edward turned to the big man and you olaf youre afraid that anita is tougher than you are i am not youve been quiet ever since we saw the mess at the hospital ever since you heard what anita did how much damage she took and survived youre wondering just how good is she is she as good as you are is she better she is a woman olaf said and his voice was thick with some dark emotion as if he was choking on it she cannot be as good as i am she cannot be better than i am that is not possible dont make this a competition edward i said because you will lose olaf said im not going to arm wrestle you olaf but i will stop picking on you im sorry olaf blinked at me as if he couldnt quite follow the conversation i didnt think id overstepped his english more like his logic circuits were overloading i do not need your pity i moved up from being she or a woman to a neuter pronoun it was a start its not pity i acted badly edwards right im scared and fighting with you is a nice diversion he shook his head i dont understand if its any consolation you confuse me too edward smiled his ted smile now kiss and make up we both frowned at him and said simultaneously dont push it and i do not think so good edward said he looked at olafs gun in his hand for a second then handed it back with a lot of heavyduty eye contact i need you to be my backup olaf can you do that he nodded once and took the gun slowly from edwards hand i am your backup until this creature is dead then we will talk edward nodded i look forward to it i glanced at bernardo but his face told me nothing nothing except that it had gone blank and empty and confirmed what i was thinking olaf had just warned edward that when the case was over he would try and kill him edward had agreed to it just like that just one big happy family i said into the thick silence that had filled the car edward turned around in his seat and buckled back in he gave me sparkling ted eyes and just like family well fight among ourselves but were much more likely to kill an outsider actually i said the vast majority of murders are done by your nearest and dearest blood relatives or spouse dont forget the spouse edward said and put the car in gear pulling carefully out into the sparse traffic like i said your nearest and dearest but you said blood relative and theres no blood between husband and wife sharing one body fluid or another doesnt seem to matter we kill those were closest to we are not close olaf said no we are not close i said but i hate you all the same he said i spoke without turning around right back at you and i thought the two of you would never agree on anything bernardo said his voice was cheerful joking no one laughed the blackpainted front of the bar looked tired in the morning sunlight you could see where the paint was cracked and beginning to peel the front of the bar looked almost as neglected as the rest of the street maybe nicky baco hadnt tried to run the other businesses off maybe it had been an accident standing there in the soft heat of morning i felt something i hadnt felt at night it was as if the street had been used up in a mystical sense id felt very strongly when id been here last time that baco had drained the street of vitality caused this to happen but if that were true then it hadnt been enough energy to sustain him or maybe all that negativity was finally coming home to roost most systems of magic or mysticism have rules of conduct things you do and things you do not you break the rules at your peril the wiccans call it the threefold law what you do to others comes back to you threefold buddhists call it karma christians call it answering for your sins i call it what goes around comes around it really does you know i had the firestar tucked into the front of my pants minus the innerpants holster because the gun could ride higher and not dig in as much edward had loaned me a paddle holster for the browning and i had ended up with it in front so that i looked like one of those wild west gunslingers with two guns crossed over my hips though actually the black polo shirt came down low enough to hide both guns untucked most shirts are too long on me it looked sloppy but it did hide the guns if you werent looking too close the polo shirt was a little too close to the body not to show telltale lumps though edward had been thoughtful enough to bring my black suit jacket which helped camouflage the lumps last time id been here with guns id had the police backing me but now we were taking guns into a bar very illegal in new mexico strangely it wasnt a big worry but i did hope the cops didnt choose today for a raid i still had the wrist sheaths plus knives on my wrists ramirez had collected all my knives from the inferno and given them to edward who had scrubbed cleaned oiled and sharpened them to an inch of their lives id had to leave the big blade in the car because i couldnt figure out how to carry it concealed and carrying what amounted to a small sword barehanded seemed a little too aggressive edward had even given me an incendiary grenade for my jacket pocket it helped balance out the derringer in my right hand pocket so that the jacket didnt swing too funny as i walked the derringer had been his idea too though i had brought it with me from st louis i wasnt sure i really needed it today but id learned never to argue with edward when he gave me a weapon if he thought i might need it i almost certainly would scary thought on the grenade isnt it at some unknown signal olaf moved up and tried the bar door it was locked he knocked twice hard enough to rattle the door he also stood right in front of the door after staring down a sawedoff shotgun the last time i came to the bar i might not have stood facing front at that black door either olaf hadnt heard about the shotgun or he didnt care maybe he was trying to be muy macho for my benefit or maybe for his own benefit if hed been more secure in himself then he wouldnt have been so easy to piss off even standing off to one side the sound of the locks being drawn back was loud good solid locks just from the sound of it the door pushed open slowly showing a thick slice of darkness like a cave pressing against the sunlight the door continued to push slowly open as if on its own power only at the very last did a large beefy arm come into view spoiling the illusion harpo stood in the doorway peering out at us eyes hidden behind the same small black sunglasses hed been wearing the first time i saw him he had changed clothes though he was wearing a jean vest open over a very hairy chest and stomach he looked more like a bear than a werewolf he looked like a great big sleepy bear that had rolled out of bed pulled on some clothes and rumbled out to the door even his otherworldly energy seemed dimmer than last time but he blocked the door with his bulk and growled out anita but not the others i moved around olaf and he actually moved back so i could face harpo either olaf was being nicer or he figured better me than him in the door nicky said i could bring some friends harpo peered down at me looks like you need better friends i didnt touch the bruise it wouldnt help lets just say i was relying on police backup and they were late which was true and i still wanted to know where the hell ramirez had been while id been playing lone ranger i like policemen but i knew the comment would please harpo it did he smiled a quick baring of teeth that flashed wolf fangs in the thickness of his beard he had definitely been spending too much time in wolf form there was a low murmuring voice male harpo turned to look over one massive shoulder towards the voice then he turned back to me the smile was gone boss says you were invited but not the others i gave a very small shake of my head because a big one would have hurt look nicky invited me here he said i could bring friends i brought them im here before ten in the fucking morning i came down here to talk about our common problem not to be dicked around at the door this aint dicking around harpo said hand cupping his groin i can show you dicking around i held up a hand fine my mistake for using the wrong word i didnt come down here to be stopped at the door he was still rubbing himself getting into it or trying to piss me off hed succeeded on the last i was so not standing here with fortyplus stitches in my back watching some werewolf ape jack off before id even had coffee i am too tired for this shit i said he started to get a little body language into it smiling at me i raised my voice so it would carry into the open door of the bar i am not going anywhere today without my friends here if youre waiting for me to give in on that point then were wasting each others time there was no answer from inside the bar harpo had gotten a little hip action into his show id had enough when the monster sucks your life out nicky dont worry it doesnt really hurt have a nice day i turned to my friends theyre not going to let us see nicky edward nodded then lets go he made a small motion and bernardo and olaf moved off down the sidewalk edward lagged a little behind with me i think we were both hoping that harpo would call my bluff except it was only partially a bluff we could have forced our way in there with weapons but nicky wouldnt talk at the end of a gun i needed a dialogue not an interrogation i started walking away edward fell into step behind me but kept an eye on our backs i wasnt flexible enough to do much back trailing without turning my entire body around which was awkward besides i trusted edward to watch our backs i admit there was a tension between my shoulder blades waiting for harpo to come running out and say come back lets talk but he didnt so i kept walking olaf and bernardo were beside the hummer waiting for edward to unlock the doors we were actually getting in the car when harpo appeared on the sidewalk and started to walk towards us he looked unarmed but not happy i sat in the seat and closed the door start the engine i said edward did what i told him harpo started jogging towards us waving those big arms some shapeshifters run like their animal counterparts all grace and godgiven motion harpo was not one of those he ran awkwardly as if he hadnt done it in a while at least not in human form it made me smile you just wanted to see him run edward said petty yeah its petty fun though i said he put the car in gear and harpo put on a burst of awkward speed he got to the car as edward was starting to pull away he actually slammed a big meaty hand on the hood edward stopped my window glide down and i looked up at harpo there was sweat beading on his naked chest his breath came harsh and too quick fuck he said did you want something i asked boss says that you can all come inside he was leaning his hands against the hummer while he got his breath back okay i said edward pulled the car back into the curb while harpo moved so there was room we all got back out of the car harpo was still not breathing right aerobic exercise is the key to good cardiovascular health i said sweetly as we waited for him to start walking back to the bar fuck you i thought about getting back in the hummer but id played the game as far as i was willing to go i wanted to talk to baco but only with backup harpo had said i could do both id achieved my goal anything else was pure childishness i was feeling petty but not that petty when he recovered he was once again the sunglasswearing muscle man face impassive he strode back hands in loose fists doing his best impression of a moving mountain of flesh his otherworldly energy prickled along my skin just a whisper of power as if it were leaking out without him meaning for it to which probably meant he was pissed strong emotions made it harder to hold all that vibrating energy inside none of us spoke on the short walk back men are usually not good at useless small talk or dont see a need for it and i was just too busy concentrating on walking normally without giving away just how much it hurt to chitchat harpo held the door for us i glanced at edward he gave me blank eyes back fine i walked inside and the others followed three days ago id have been nervous stepping into that dark with the vibrating energy of werewolves rising like an invisible tide but that was three days ago and there just wasnt that much fear left in me my body hurt but the rest of me was oddly numb maybe id finally crossed that line that edward seemed to live behind maybe id never really feel anything again when even that thought didnt scare me i knew i was in trouble it took a second for my eyes to adjust to the dark interior but it wasnt my eyes that told me something was wrong it was the skin on the back of my neck i didnt argue with it i had my hand on the browning underneath the shirt and didnt care if it gave away the fact that i was carrying a gun theyd be fools to think wed come in here unarmed los lobos biker club might have a lot of faults but being that kind of fool wasnt one of them nicky baco was lying on the bar with his hands tied to his ankles so that the ropes formed a sort of handle like he was some kind of carryon bag his face was bloody and bruised and the injuries were a lot fresher than mine i had the browning out and i felt rather than saw the other three fan out until we were the corners of a box and each corner held a gun each corner watched its section of the room and whether we liked each other or not i trusted all of us to take care of our sections of the room even olaf it was good to be sure my part of the room included the bar with nicky on it a tall man with a beard and a curl of waistlength pony tail over one shoulder two wolves the size of ponies and a mans body staring sightless at the room his throat cut like a second mouth red and screaming i had a peripheral sense of the how full the room was of crowding bodies the energy was thick enough to choke on i heard a noise to the right and did three things almost simultaneously i pointed the browning at the noise drew the firestar lefthanded to point at the man with the ponytail and let my eyes flick to the side to see what id heard good that id been practicing lefthanded firing drills the heavy slithering sound came again from behind the bar the bar was in my section of the room it was my ball so to speak i felt the others surging forward like a trembling tide about to swallow us all we could shoot a lot of them but there had to be over a hundred in this room and we were dead if they all came at once fear tightened my stomach jerking my pulse into my throat just like that the numbness was gone chased away by adrenaline and the musky scent of wolves there were more wolves than just the two in front of me out in that packed darkened room i could smell them my stomach jerked again but not from fear the mark that tied me to richard tied me to his pack was alive again it flared in my body like a tiny flame reborn waiting to be fed so it could grow great just great i had to worry about it later my concentration was all used up the ponytailed man just stood there smiling he was handsome in a rough around the edges tattooed prison sort of way even in the dimness his eyes flashed wolf amber not human i also knew what or would that be who i was looking at this was their ulfric their wolf king he stood in a space of emptiness with most of the pack huddled further back into the room and yet his power made up for theirs his power filled the nearly empty side of the room with a fleshcreeping energy like thunder just before it strikes the tension was thick enough that i had to swallow some of it before i could speak greetings ulfric of the los lobos clan whats shaking he threw his head back and laughed a big hearty goodnatured sound that ended with a howl that crawled out of his human throat and down my spine nice effect i said but this is an official police investigation into the mutilation murders im sure youve heard about them he turned those startling pale eyes to me ive heard then you know that we arent investigating your pack he laid a casual hand on nicky who whimpered even though i dont think it really hurt nicky is my vargamor if the police wish to speak with him then they must ask me first he smiled and i was close enough to notice that his teeth were human no fangs for the ulfric sorry the only other pack ive ever met that had a vargamor doesnt make you talk to the ulfric first my apologies on the oversight i hoped whatever we were doing was going to be over soon because i couldnt keep up the gun in each hand stance for long id practiced lefthanded but it was still my weak hand and the bite in it was already starting a faint tremble in the muscles i had to be able to lower my hand soon or it would begin to shake if you were the police then i would accept your apologies we are always ready to help the police that last brought a wave of snickers from the packed house but i dont see any police in this room im anita blake im a vampire executioner he cut me off i know who you are i know what you are i didnt like that last made me nervous and just what am i you are the lupa of the thronnos roke clan and you have come to my clan for help but you have not honored me or my lupa you enter my lands without permission you contact my vargamor without talking to me first and you give us no tribute his power grew with every sentence until it was like standing in warm water up to your chin knowing that if it got much deeper youd drown but i understood the rules now id insulted him and he had to wipe out that insult id try sweet reason but i didnt have much hope for it besides my left arm was getting tired hell so was my right whatever was behind the bar moved in a huge roll of motion that you could feel and hear it sounded bigger than a werewolf i flew down here on police business i did not enter your lands as lupa of the thronnos roke clan i came down here as anita blake the executioner thats all but you contacted my vargamor he slapped nickys thigh and that did seem to hurt because he closed his eyes and writhed at the touch straining through his gag to scream i didnt know nicky was your vargamor until after id talked to him no one told me that this bar was your lair youre ulfric you can smell that im not lying he gave a small nod you tell the truth he looked at the small man on the bar running his hand over his body the way youd stroke a dog though the dog doesnt usually wince and try to pull back but he knew that he was my vargamor nicky knew that you were a lupa of another clan it was the hot topic for a while a human lupa lupas often just another word for the ulfrics girlfriend i said he turned those golden eyes to me more gold because of the heavy black eyebrows that framed them nicky agreed to help you without asking me later or even telling me about your visit he gave a low growl that refreshed the fading goosebumps on my skin i am ulfric i lead here he slapped nicky and fresh blood trickled from his nose i badly wanted to put a stop to the abuse just out of principle but i didnt want it badly enough to die for it so i waited and watched nicky baco bleed i didnt like it but i let it happen my left hand was beginning to cramp i needed to either start shooting people or put my guns up even holding my arms out for this long was putting a strain on my back and chest anita edward said and just the tone of my own name was enough he was quietly telling me to hurry it up look ulfric i didnt mean to walk into some inner pack squabble im just trying to do my job trying to keep more innocent people from being killed humans are fun he said sex and a meal and you never have to leave your car butyoudonotmakethemyourqueen his voice rose until with the last word he was screaming howls echoed him from the mob that was pressing close and closer anita edward said and this time there was more of a warning to his voice im working on it edward work faster he said youre a racist ulfric i said he stared at me what im human so im good enough to fuck good enough to kill but not good enough to be your equal just because im human youre a racist chauvinistic big bad wolf you come into my lands ask aid of my pack give no tribute to me or my lupa and now youre calling me names i dont know if he made some kind of psychic signal or his anger was enough but the two giant wolves at his feet began to stalk forward on stiff legs my left hand was beginning to shake visibly whatever was behind the bar thrashed sounding large and bestial my left hand was threatening to give out completely and i needed both hands you die first ulfric i said what and he sort of laughed when he said it the first thing that jumps any of us and i shoot you no matter what else happens today youll be dead your two pony wolves better stop right where they are your hand is shaking so badly i dont think youve got it in you to kill anyone it was my turn to laugh you think my hand is shaking because i feel remorse about the thought of shooting you boy have you got the wrong girl look at my right hand ulfric its not shaking a walking corpse took a bite out of my left hand a couple of days ago so im a little shaky with my left but trust me i hit what i aim at this is usually when i give my victim full eye contact and let them know im not bluffing but i was divided between the ulfric and his entourage and the bar how many of your wolves are you willing to sacrifice for your wounded pride if we fight anita you and your friends will die and youll die and some of your best people so wouldnt it be nice to avoid the carnage and have you tell me what the hell you want from me you know im telling the truth i didnt know that i was stepping on your toes if nicky is making some kind of power play behind your back i didnt know it so tell me what you want to make this social gaffe okay between us tell me before my left hand starts spasming so badly that i start shooting things just because i have to he was watching me very narrowly and i saw intelligence behind all the bragging and pride there might be somebody home to bargain with if there wasnt then we were going to die we were going to die not because of the case but because i had been at one time richards girlfriend it was a stupid reason to die tribute i want the lupa of the thronnos roke clan to give me tribute you mean a gift i said he nodded if its the right kind of gift yeah if id been coming to albuquerque with richard on personal business id have expected to make a gift to the local pack the gift was usually a freshly killed animal jewelry for the lupa or something mystical death jewelry or magic i didnt have any jewelry on me except leonoras necklace and i wasnt exactly sure what it would do for someone other than me for all i knew it might be harmful if it was just handed out i didnt have enough information the charm was so not leaving my body i lowered my left hand one it was twitching so badly i wasnt a hundred percent sure i could hit anything with it two i couldnt keep pointing guns if we werent going to kill people three my hand was hurting your word that if i give you a suitable gift we all leave here in safety youd take the word of an excon drug dealing biker gang leader no but ill take the word of the ulfric of the broken spear clan that ill take there were rules and if he broke his word as ulfric he lost brownie points he had to be on shaky ground anyway for a human no matter how magically powerful vargamor to have challenged his authority he wouldnt give his word and break it not in front of his pack i am ulfric of the broken spear clan and i give my word that you will all go in safety if your gift is worthy i didnt like the wording on that last i didnt have time to stop at tiffanys and pick up something for the little lady didnt get to hunt on the way here from the hospital cops frown on you shooting animals in town the mystical shit is beyond me today then you have nothing worthy he said but he looked puzzled as though he was sure i had a gift of some kind let me see whats behind the bar and ill put up my guns and make tribute id tried to put up the firestar but my left hand was shaking so badly that i couldnt raise the shirt and slide it inside my pants i needed two hands for it which meant i needed to be able to holster the browning done he said monstruo rise greet our guest it rose above the bar in a thin line of pale flesh like the rising of a crescent moon then a face came into view it was a womans face with one eye gone stiff and dry like some kind of mummy face after face rose brown and withered like a string of monstrous beads strung together with pieces of body arms legs and thick black thread like gigantic stitches holding it all together holding the magic inside it rose up and up until it towered against the ceiling curving like a giant snake to stare down at me i estimated forty heads more before i lost count or lost heart to count anymore the werewolves had moved back further into the room like the tide retreating backwards they feared the thing i didnt blame them i heard bernardo say fuck olaf said something in german which meant he wasnt watching his part of the room only edward remained silent and on the job ever vigilant i have to admit that if the werewolves had wanted to jump me while that thing rose above me like some demented snake i would have been slow it was too much horror to leave room for anything else id only seen something like it once before that monster had been made by the most powerful vaudun priestess id ever met but hers had been formed of fresh zombies and pulled seamlessly together into one monstrous ball of flesh pure magic this had been stitched together like frankensteins monster and the bodies being dead like that dried deliberately mummified or an after effect of the spell i dragged my gaze from the thing to the nicky baco still lying on the bar gagged and bound and bloody i heard my voice like a distant thing why nicky you bad bad boy id made a joke when what i wanted to do was put a gun to his head and blow him away some things you did not do some things you simply did not do you see why hes still alive the ulfric said too powerful to get rid of i said voice still oddly detached as if i wasnt really concentrating on what i was saying i used him as my threat he would lay his magic on a wolf that was misbehaving and they would be turned into what you see and he would stitch them into the monstruo but my wolves fear him now more than they fear me i was nodding over and over because i couldnt think of a good thing to say alive they were alive when nicky did his magic i had a truly awful thought somehow it seemed wrong to be putting away the guns but i needed my hands for other things i raised the shirt and slid the browning home though it wasnt as smooth as it would have been if the holster had been familiar but my left hand was pretty much gone i had to raise the shirt with my right and very carefully tuck the firestar into the front of my pants even after the hand was empty it continued to twitch uncontrollably there was nothing i could do but wait for it to calm down on its own i cradled the hand against my body and walked towards the monster i stood on the other side of the bar from it looking at one of those dried faces the mouth had been sewn shut on this one i didnt know why i took a few deep cleansing breaths and there was an odor of herbs to it but mostly just a dry smell like tanned leather and dust i reached out with my left hand even with the bandages and the muscle cramps this was still my power hand the hand to sense magic with most people have a hand that is better for sensing stuff usually the opposite hand from the one you write with i have no idea what ambidextrous people do there was an amazing amount of power pushing out from the thing but the bar was wide and i was hurt so my concentration wasnt good and i still couldnt answer the one question i needed answered i used my right hand to sort of jumpsit on the bar then got onto my knees there was a face at eye level with me and this one had eyes a mans face i think with pale grey wolf eyes trapped in a dried mummy face those eyes stared out at me and there was someone home the walking dead dont show fear i knew what id feel before i stretched my hand out toward the face there was nickys power like a warm blanket of worms squirming over my skin it was some of the most uncomfortable magic id ever felt unclean as if the power itself would eat your flesh if you stayed too close to it for too long this was where nickys energy had gone and this was why no matter how much energy he gathered it would never be enough magic this negative this evil is like a drug it takes more and more energy to get the same result with worse and worse effect on the spellcaster i sent my own magic into that mess not to empower but seeking i felt the cool brush of a soul and before i could pull back my power ran up that column of trapped flesh and the souls glowed behind my eyelids with cool white light none of them had been dead when he did this to them i wasnt a hundred percent sure they were dead now i opened my eye and pulled my hand back from the thing his power sucked at my hand like invisible mud i pulled free with an almost audible pop the mans face moved its withered mouth and made a long dry sound twice help it said help i swallowed a wave of nausea and was very glad id missed breakfast i crawled on one arm and my knees to nicky i bent over him and whispered would burning it free their souls he shook his head can you free their souls he nodded i think if hed said yes to the first question id have put the browning to his head and killed him but i needed him to free them and i added that to my list of things to do before i left town but there was nothing i could do for them today except stay alive and strangely keep nicky baco alive one of lifes little ironies that last i sat on the bar with my legs dangling over the edge hand cradled to my chest dazed with the sheer evil of it id seen my share but this was near the top this was near the top after what id seen in the hospital at least the corpses were just eating bodies not souls you look like youve seen a ghost the ulfric said youre closer than you know i said where is our gift he said wheres your lupa he stroked the head of one of the wolves by his legs this is my lupa i cant share the gift with anyone in animal form i said he frowned and it was very close to being angry you must honor us i plan to i rolled the sleeve of my jacket back over my left arm the wrist sheath had to go i undid the straps propping the blade sheath and all between my legs the monster hovered behind me peering curiously it was distracting me i couldnt save them today and didnt want to see it anymore until i could fix it can you order it to leave the room he looked at me scared i can feel the souls crying out for help its sort of distracting he looked at me and i watched the color drain from his face you mean that i smiled but not like it was funny you didnt know that hes trapping their souls in that thing he said he was his voice had gone softer you didnt believe him i said the ulfric was gazing up at the thing as if hed never seen it before you wouldnt believe something like that would you i would i shrugged wished i hadnt and said but then this is my line of work can you please send it away he nodded and spoke rapidly in spanish the thing folded down on itself and crept away on arms and legs and bodies like a broken centipede sitting on the bar i could see it go down a trap door behind the bar when the last segment of it had slithered out of sight i turned back to the ulfric he still looked pale baco is the only one who can free their souls dont kill him until hes done that i didnt plan to kill him the man said that was before you knew i dont know you well enough to know if when i leave youll get all selfrighteous and try to end this evil dont please or you condemn them all to an eternity of that he swallowed like he was having a little trouble keeping down his own breakfast i wont kill him good i drew the knife from between my knees righthanded now gather round boys and girls because im only going to do this trick once there was a general movement as the wolves moved forward i spared a glance for the boys id come in with they hadnt put their guns up but they had them pointed at the floor or the ceiling edward was watching the wolves bernardo was watching the wolves too though he looked pale olaf was watching me i really really didnt like him i give honor to the ulfric and lupa of the broken spear clan i give the most precious of gifts to the ulfric but not being true lukoi i cannot share this gift with the lupa in her present form for that i apologize most sincerely if i come back this way ill shop better i sat the blade on the bar and leaned over the edge until i could reach a clean glass one of those thick chunky ones that people are so fond of putting scotch in it was a strain to get back into a sitting position on the bar but i managed it with the glass in one hand i put the glass beside me on the bar and picked the knife up i laid the blade against my left arm just above the wrist and stared at the whole pale unscarred flesh there were scars just above it where a shapeshifted witch had clawed me and the crossshaped burn scar that was now a little crooked from the claw marks but this one patch was still pure i hoped it didnt scar but what was one more i took in a deep breath and sliced the blade down my skin a sigh ran through the watching werewolves and whimpers from a few of the furrier throats i ignored them id known it would get a crowd reaction i kept looking at my flesh and the damage id just done to it the wound didnt bleed immediately it was just a thin red line then the first drop spilled from the wound and the rest of the wound spilled in crimson rivulets down my arm deeper than id wanted it but probably about what was needed i held the wound over the glass some of it splashed around the edges trailing down the sides but i managed to get it going into the cup i didnt even need to squeeze the wound much to encourage the flow deeper than i wanted it oh yeah the ulfric had moved closer close enough that he was standing with his body touching my legs the wolf that hed introduced as his lupa moved up to nuzzle at my knee and he hit her he backhanded her the way youd hit a dog you didnt like much where was womens lib when you needed it she went to her belly crying in doggy fashion telling him she hadnt meant any harm with her tail tight curled to her rump no one else tried to move forward if the lupa couldnt share the rest of them knew better than to try the ulfric stayed pressed against my legs let me take it out of your arm he stared at my bleeding arm like id stripped for him something beyond sex beyond hunger and yet a little of both i raised the arm so the blood trickled down it in fast little streams of red splashing down into the glass his gaze followed the movement like a dog after a piece of food the truth was that letting people lick a wound directly tended to distract me through the marks i was bound to a werewolf and a vampire both of which found blood exciting the thoughts that filled me when i shared blood with anyone were too primitive too overwhelming especially now with my shields in ruins i couldnt risk it is the gift worthy i asked you know it is and his voice had that peculiar hoarseness that men get when sex is in the air then drink ulfric drink dont waste it i held the bloody glass out to him he took it reverently in both hands he drank and i watched his throat convulse as he swallowed my blood it should have bothered me more i guess but it didnt the numbness was back a distant almost comfortable feeling i fished under the bar until i found a stack of clean napkins and pressed them to my arm the napkins soaked crimson in moments the ulfric had waded into the pack with my blood in his hands they surrounded him touching him caressing begging for him to share he dipped his lingers in the nearly empty cup and held them down for the wolves to lick edward came to stand near me he said nothing just helped me put pressure on the wound got more napkins from under the bar and a clean cloth to tie it tight our eyes met and he just shook his head the faintest of smiles playing on his face most people pay money for information money doesnt interest most of the people i deal with the ulfric called back to me through the reaching werewolves his mouth was bloodstained his neat beard and mustache thick with my blood he stared at me with his golden eyes and said if you want to talk to nicky help yourself thank you ulfric i said i hopped down off the bar and edward had to catch me or id have fallen fresh blood loss on top of everything else was not what i had needed i waved him away and he didnt argue edward undid nickys gag and took a step back the werewolves had pulled back giving us the illusion of privacy though i knew that every werewolf in the room would hear us even if we whispered hi nicky i said he had to try twice before he said anita i was here before ten i put my hands on the bar and propped my chin on them so he wouldnt have to strain the movement hurt my back but somehow i wanted to be on eye level with him the bulky makeshift bandage seemed to be in the way but i wanted to keep the arm elevated nicky looked even worse up close one eye was completely closed blackened and bloodfilled his nose looked broken blood bubbling from it when he breathed he came back into town early i figured as much youve been a very bad boy nicky pissing off your ulfric power play behind his back when youre just human not even a werewolf and that thing thats not voodoo how the hell did you do that older magic than voodoo he said what kind of magic i asked i thought you wanted to talk about the monster thats killing innocent citizens his voice was strained painfilled normally im against torture but i just couldnt find much pity in my heart for nicky id seen his creation and i felt the torment of its parts nope i just couldnt spare much sympathy for nicky hed never take enough damage to make up for what hed done not at least while he was alive hell might be a very nasty place for nicky baco i trusted the divine to have a better sense of justice and irony than i did okay what do you really know about the thing thats out there i asked he lay there on the bar wrists and ankles bound together blood trickling from his mouth and talked as if he were sitting behind a desk except for the little pain sounds he made every once in a while which spoiled some of the effect i felt it years ago maybe ten i felt it wake what do you mean wake have you had it in your mind yet he asked and this time i heard the fear in his voice yeah i said it was sluggish at first as if it had been asleep or imprisoned dormant for a very long time it grew stronger every year why didnt you tell the police ten years ago the police didnt have any psychics or witches working for them and i already had a criminal record he coughed and spat blood and a tooth out on the bar it made me raise my head up which forced nicky to roll his head a little what was i going to tell them that there was this thing out there somewhere this voice in my head and it was getting stronger i didnt know what it could do at first i didnt know what it was what is it its a god i raised eyebrows at him it was worshipped as a god once it wants to be worshipped again it says that gods need tribute to survive you got all this from just a voice in your head ive had ten years with the thing whispering in my head what have you learned in less than that many days i thought about that i knew it was killing to feed not just for sport though it enjoyed the slaughter that id felt too i knew it both feared me and wanted me it feared another death worker on the opposite side but it wanted to drink my powers and would have if leonora hadnt stopped it why has it just started to kill people now why after a decade i dont know he said why does it slaughter some and skin others i dont know what is it doing with the body parts that it takes away from the scenes which was a detail that the police would not like me sharing with someone outside the investigation but i wanted answers more than i wanted to be cautious i dont know he coughed again but didnt spit out anything good if hed continued to spit blood id have worried about internal injuries i didnt want to have to persuade the pack to take him to the hospital i didnt think id have much luck where is it ive never been there but understand that whats been killing people is not the god hes still trapped wherever he started his servants have done all the murders not him what are you saying im saying that if you think youve got trouble now you aint seen nothing yet i can feel him in the dark lying like some kind of bloated thing filling up with power when hes full enough hell rise and itll be hell to pay why didnt you tell me all this before you had the police with you the first time if you turn me over to them im dead youve seen what i do there wouldnt even need to be a jury he had a point when this is over you have to dismantle it you have to free their souls agreed when i can walk again agreed i glanced at his legs and saw that there was a lump under his pants leg it was the bone of the leg a compound fracture jesus some days there are so many stones to throw in so many different directions that i dont even know where to start does this god have a name he calls himself the red womans husband that cant be an original english phrase i think he knows what his victims know by the time he came to me he spoke in english so you think hes been here a long time i think hes always been here what do you mean always like eternity or a really really long time i dont know how long hes been here nicky closed his good eye as if he were tired okay nicky okay i turned to the ulfric is he telling the truth the man nodded he didnt lie great thank you for your hospitality and please dont kill him we may need him in the next few days to help kill this thing not to mention freeing the souls of your pack mates ill lay off on the beating it was the closest thing i was going to get to a yes we are going to let him go and make sure he isnt hurt anymore great ill be in touch edward stayed near me as we walked to the door he didnt offer me his arm but he stayed close enough that if i stumbled hed be there bernardo already had the door open olaf just watched us walk towards them i stumbled a little up the two steps to the door and olaf caught my arm i looked up into his eyes and it wasnt pride or honor or respect that i saw it was hunger a desire so great it was a physical need a hunger i pulled away from him and left a smear of blood on his hand edward was at my back helping me towards the door olaf raised his hand to his mouth and pressed it to his mouth like a kiss but he was doing the same thing that the wolves did he was tasting my blood and liked it there are all kinds of monsters most of them crave blood some for food some for pleasure but youre dead either way everyone was quiet in the car olaf consumed by his own thoughts which i wanted no details about bernardo had finally said where to my house edward said i dont think anitas up to anything else today for once i didnt argue i was so tired i was nauseated if i could have found a comfortable position i think i could have slept we drove out of albuquerque and headed towards the distant mountains bright and cheerful in the morning light i wished for a pair of sunglasses because i suddenly was neither cheerful nor bright did you learn anything worth getting out of the hospital early edward asked i learned that the thing has a name the red womans husband it is hiding some place that it cant move from which means if we can track it we can kill it i added because just in case they needed to know nicky says it was worshipped as a god once and that it still thinks it is one it cant be a god bernardo said not a real one im the wrong person to ask i said im a monotheist edward bernardo made a question of his name ive never met anything that was truly immortal its just a matter of figuring out how to kill it i actually had met a few things that seemed immortal maybe edward was right but id seen things that i still couldnt figure out how to kill lucky me the naga had been a crime victim and not a bad guy and the lamia had been converted to our side but as far as i knew they were both immortal of course id never shoved an incendiary grenade down their pants or tried to set them on fire maybe i just hadnt been trying hard enough for all our sakes i hoped edward was right we pulled onto the long road that led as far as i could tell just to edwards house it had a steeper drop off than id noticed at night enough of a drop off that being an all terrain vehicle didnt mean anything unless you could fly a white truck pulled in behind us and started following us do you know them olaf asked no edward said i managed to turn in the seat far enough to watch the truck it didnt try and overtake us or anything there was nothing wrong with the truck except for the fact that it was on the road to edwards house and he didnt recognize it add to that that all four of us were paranoid by profession and it made for tension edward pulled into the turnaround in front of his house everybody into the house until we find out who it is everyone was quicker out of the car than i was but then id just managed to get the bleeding on my arm stopped lucky for me edward had a heavy duty first aid kit in the back seat i had a nice big bandage taped to my arm and the wrist sheath shoved in my pocket edward was at the door unlocking it olaf was behind him bernardo had actually waited for me as if he would have liked to offer to help me out of the car but was afraid to i was actually feeling rough enough that i didnt mind the babysitting which told you how truly bad i felt there was a small sharp sound a bolt being drawn back on a rifle and everything happened at once edward had his gun out and pointed at the sound olafs gun was out but not pointed bernardo had his gun pointed using the door as a brace i have to admit my gun was in my hand but not pointed i just wasnt used to the new holster and having to lift the shirt with a wounded left hand damn i was slow harold of the scarred face was leaning at the far end of edwards house with a highpowered rifle pointed at edward he had most of his body hidden behind the house and held the rifle like he knew what he was doing if hed wanted to drop edward he could have done it before edward got the drop on him that harold hadnt shot anyone yet meant they had come for more than just killing probably harold said nobody panics nobody gets hurt harold edward said when did you guys make bail he was still staring down the barrel of his beretta at harold i could almost guarantee he was sighting on the top of the other mans head his best killing target from what little he had to shoot at edward did not shoot to wound only russell got arrested harold said rifle settled comfortably against his shoulder speak of the devil russell came around the corner behind harold his nose was packed with white cotton and covered in a hard bandage id broken his nose great i thought terrorizing women and children carried more time than this i said i kept the gun behind the open door i didnt want to give anyone an excuse to start shooting the tall silent newt came around the other side of the house with a large shiny revolver in his hands he held it twohanded and moved in a crossfoot glide that said he knew what he was doing there was a woman beside him moving like a smooth oiled shadow she was six foot if she was an inch and the tank top she was wearing showed off shoulders and arms that made most of the men look puny only her breasts pressed against the shirt showed her braless and very much a girl olaf pointed his gun at them bernardo moved up with his gun and the woman turned to him olaf turned as newt moved across in front of him like a long distance dance the woman and bernardo were more practical they just stood a little bit apart and stared at each other over their guns only russell kept walking and didnt pull a gun i tried pulling mine and pointing it at him he did stop but his smile got wider and the look in his eyes got worse as if he had plans for me and they were all about to come true you shoot me and they shoot your friends youre the only one our boss wants russell said but were not here to kill anyone harold said very quickly as if he wanted to be clear on that if i were staring down a gun barrel that edward was holding id want to be clear too russell started walking towards me even though i had the browning pointed at his chest our boss just wants to talk to you thats all harold said i promise he just wants to talk to the girl i was backing up with the gun held out russell was still walking forward very confident unless i was willing to shoot him he wasnt stopping i did not want to be the one who fired the first shot people were going to die and i couldnt control which people that would be i could hear the truck now crunching over the gravel i did the only thing i could think of i turned and ran i heard a surprised hey from behind me but i was over the edge of the slope and down the other side i suddenly wasnt worried about tearing my stitches up or how tired i was my heart was in my throat and i found that not only could i walk without falling down i could run my mind seemed to be working fast and faster i saw a dry wash at the base of the slope and a clump of trees to one side i slid into the wash in a rush of small stones i landed on all fours heavy and was scrambling to my feet before i felt the first trickle of blood down my back i was behind the trees as i heard russell slither down the slope behind me i couldnt shoot him but there were other options i was aiming for the clump of trees but say what you liked about russell he could run because i could hear him doing it he wasnt going to give me enough time to hide i ran past the trees and knew that i couldnt outrun him the adrenaline was already beginning to fade and the heat folded around me like a hand i just wasnt up to a long chase today i had to end it soon i slowed just a little one to save energy and one to let russell catch up sooner i took a big breath and prepared i knew what i wanted to do but my body had to do it i couldnt hesitate because my back or my arm or anything else hurt i risked a glance back and russell was almost there almost on me i kicked him full out straight in the balls i did it without hesitating almost without setting up for it letting his own momentum carry him into me the shock sent me hopping backward and i did what i still wasnt smooth at in class i did a reverse roundhouse kick to where i thought his face would be and it was hed crumbled clutching himself and he went to his knees with the kick he stayed on all fours shaking his head but he didnt go down dammit a voice yelled from up the slope i dont see them there was a long piece of bleached wood on the floor of the wash i picked it up and hit him twice hard he finally slumped on the ground and didnt move i didnt have time to check for a pulse the wash stretched straight for about a hundred yards before brush filled the end of it there was a place in the bank that had washed away more than the rest it was like a shallow cave i had a split second to decide which way to go i took the knife sheath out of my back pocket and threw it knife and all as far as i could towards the brush i went for the cave scrambling on feet and hands like a monkey keeping low i was in the cooler shade of the depression when i heard the men coming down the slope i dont see them the first man said they went this way a womans voice could there be two female bad guys i didnt think so did that mean that there was one less gun up with edward and the others i let the thought go i had my own problems rocks cascaded down over the overhang like a dry waterfall at least one of them was coming down directly on top of me would the ceiling of the little cave hold the weight i was already regretting hiding but the wash stretched open and straight for too far id have never made it to the place where it emptied and there was brush i just wasnt that fast today if they thought id gone that way and didnt see me then it would be a good plan if they turned and spotted me it was a bad plan i heard them coming but the mans voice was right above me it made me jump he had to be standing just to the right of the roof jesus theres russell he jumped into the wash and started running towards the fallen man the woman was more cautious sliding down into the wash searching up and down the wash she was so close i could have reached out and touched the leg of her jeans my heart was thundering in my throat but id stopped breathing i was holding my breath willing her to go to the men to walk away and not look back hes alive the man said then he was up and moving towards the sheath id thrown she went this way he went for the brush the woman walked towards him he was already at the brush pushing into it maury dammit dont go in there she had to jog to have any chance of catching him she didnt look back to see me crouched in the hole when her broad back vanished into the brush and i heard the man curse i crawled out of the hole and started up the slope on all fours if the woman and maury came out now i would be caught like a black speck on a white sheet of paper but they didnt come and i made the top of the slope down from where id first entered crawling on my belly to lie under the sage bushes that edged edwards front yard something slithered off to my right and it wasnt human a snake a snake had slithered away deeper into the bushes shit thank you dear god that it left one more problem and i was out of solutions of course now every noise seemed to be reptilian and crawling on my belly through the thick bushes the smell of sage thick in the hot air was a little slice of nightmare i kept waiting to hear that dry rattle that would tell me id used up all my luck every twig that brushed my leg seemed to have scales the only thing that kept me from screaming was the knowledge that someone would probably shoot me before they knew it was me by the time i crawled to the very edge of the bushes one painful inch at a time i was sweating and it was only partially from heat the sweat stung on my back and i knew that some of the thicker trickles were blood and not sweat i could see the yard through the last screen of sage things had not improved the woman and the new man maury had left the yard but three others had taken their places they had the men on their knees olaf had his hands laced on his bald head bernardo had his one good hand on his head and his cast raised as high as he could edward was the closest to me newt was so close i could have put the knife into his foot harold was talking into a cell phone he was waving one hand and had the rifle slung over one arm he put the phone away from his mouth and said he says search the house what for one of the new men said he had dark hair and a revolver for an artifact something the girl used against the monster what kind of artifact the dark man asked just do it harold said dark hair grumbled but he motioned and the two men left to go into the open door of the house edward must have unlocked it for them what the hell had been happening while i was crawling through the bushes the three men went into the house harold was still talking on the phone that left just newt with his and he wasnt even pointing it at anyones head it would never get better than this any second now the others would come back up the wash or out of the house id have liked to have at least gotten to my knees and plunged the knife into a vital area but the bushes were too thick id never push to my knees without making all kinds of noise if i fired a gun id alert all the others shit i had two knives i had one idea i slipped the blade out of my right arm sheath making sure my left hand had a good grip newts foot was still so temptingly close i took the invitation i stabbed the righthand knife into the foot opposite from his gun i felt the blade sink into the ground underneath his shoe as he screamed i was on my knees behind him as he tried to twist and bring the gun on me but he had the gun pointed for someone standing on his left side and i wasnt there i plunged the other knife up into his pants into the front of his pants my hand between his legs and i missed i didnt hit flesh fuck i twitched the blade to the side and felt him but he wasnt cut but he was very very still i hissed dont move he didnt move he stayed like some kind of awkward statue harold started walking towards us whats wrong newt newt swallowed and said n nothing thought i saw a snake i whispered good boy newt if you want to keep the family jewels intact very quietly hand me your gun he let the fall into my hand i was close enough to whisper to edward what do you want me to do call harold over you heard him newt i said the man never argued hey harold can you come over here a second harold sighed snapping the cell phone shut what is it now newt he was almost even with edward when he noticed that newts gun was gone i was still hidden behind the larger mans body even the blade was hidden in the cloth of his pants what the hell bernardo pulled one of the gold chopsticks out of his hair and it was a blade that ended in harolds arm edward hit him in the gut doubled him over and disarmed him he stood over him with the rifle olaf and bernardo were on their feet i dont know what the plan would have been next because we heard the sirens police sirens did you call the cops harold edward asked dont be an ass harold said anita edward said i didnt call them ive still got a pointed at you newt dont get cute but i withdrew the blade very carefully and stood up i kept his gun pointed at his back but i was beginning to doubt id have to shoot anybody the sirens were almost here the three guys came out of the house with their guns in plain sight they looked to harold saw him on the ground and edward had the rifle to his shoulder and was sighting down the barrel at them their eyes flicked to the cops coming at a fast pace and back to edward they threw their guns down and laced their fingers on their heads without being told i doubted it was the first time theyd had to do it it was an unmarked car with a marked car following it they skidded to a stop on opposite sides of the black truck and four cops spilled out lieutenant marks detective ramirez and two uniforms i didnt know they had guns pointed but looked a little unsure who the bad guys were couldnt blame them we had all the guns detective ramirez i said thank god whats going on marks said before ramirez could answer me edward told them that harold and his men had jumped us and were trying to question us about the mutilation murders marks found that fascinating edward had known he would yes ted forrester would press assault charges any good citizen would there were enough handcuffs to go around barely there are two more out there somewhere edward said in his best helpful voice theres one unconscious in the wash that way i said everyone looked at me i didnt have to pretend to be uncomfortable he was chasing me i thought they were going to kill the others i shrugged and winced hes alive it sounded like an excuse even to me they called for more men to search the area they called for an ambulance for harold newt and russell when they found him id sat down on the ground waiting for everyone to do their jobs i was using both hands to prop myself up now that the emergency seemed to be over i wasnt feeling so good marks was yelling at me you left the hospital against doctors orders i dont give a damn but i want a statement i want to know exactly what happened at that hospital i looked up at him and he seemed to be taller than he was further away somehow are you saying that all the lights and sirens were because you were mad at me for not giving a statement before i left the hospital a flush spread up his face and i knew that that was exactly it one of the uniforms called lieutenant i want that statement today he turned and walked away i hoped he stayed there ramirez knelt beside me he was wearing his usual shirtsleeves rolled back a striped tie at halfmast around an open collar you all right no i said i went to the hospital today and you were already gone that night the elevator had been turned off because of the fire alarms i had to double back and get the stairs and come up behind you thats why i was late thats why i wasnt there for you for it to be almost the first thing out of his mouth it must have been bugging him i liked that i managed something close to a smile thanks for telling me i was so hot the yard seemed to be swimming in heat as if i were looking at the world through rippling glass he touched my back i think to help me up he drew his hand away from my shirt his hand was bloody he went on all fours using one hand to raise my shirt it was so bloodsoaked that he had to peel it away from my skin jesus and joseph what the hell have you done to yourself it doesnt even hurt anymore i heard myself saying it from a long way away then i was sliding over into his arms his lap i heard someone call my name and i finally passed out i woke up in the hospital doctor cunningham was bending over me i thought we have to stop meeting like this but didnt even try to say it out loud youve lost blood and had your stitches redone do you think you can stay in here long enough for me to actually release you this time i think i smiled yes doctor just in case you got any funny ideas about leaving ive doped you up with enough pain killers to make you feel really good so sleep and ill see you in the morning my eyes fluttered shut once then opened edward was there he bent over me and whispered crawling through bushes on your belly threatening to cut off a mans balls such a hard ass my voice came faintly even to me had to save your ass he bent over me and kissed on my forehead or maybe i dreamed that part some time during the second day in the hospital they lowered the meds and i started having the dreams i was wandering in a maze made up of high green hedges i was wearing a long heavy dress made of white silk there were heavy things under it weighting it down i could feel the tightness of a corset under the dress and i knew it wasnt my dream i would never dream of clothing that i had never worn i stopped running through the green maze looked up into a flawless blue sky and shouted jeanclaude his voice came rich seductive he could do things with his voice that most men couldnt do with their hands where are you ma petite where you you promised to stay out of my dreams we felt you dying we felt the marks open we worried i knew who we was richard isnt invading my dreams just you i have come to warn you if you had picked up a phone to call us this would not be necessary i turned and there was a mirror in the middle of the grass and the hedges it was a fulllength mirror with a gilt edged frame very antique very louis xiv my reflection was startling it wasnt just the clothes my hair was in some kind of complicated mound with thick curls hanging down here and there there was also more of it and i knew at least some of it was a wig or at least hairpieces there was even one of those beauty marks on my cheek i expected to look ridiculous but i didnt i looked delicate like a china doll but it wasnt ridiculous my reflection wavered then grew taller and it was jeanclaude in the mirror and my reflection had vanished he was tall slender dressed head to foot in white satin in a suit that matched my dress gold brocade glittered down his sleeves the seams of the pants white boots rode over his knees tied with huge white and gold ribbons it was a foppish outfit sissy to use a modern word but he didnt look foppish he looked elegant and at ease like a man whod pulled off his tie and slipped into something more comfortable his hair fell in long black banana curls only the delicate masculinity of his face and his midnight blue eyes looked normal familiar i shook my head and the weight of the hair made it awkward i am so out of here and i started to reach out to shred the dream wait please ma petite truly i have a warning for you he looked up as if seeing the mirror as a sort of prison this is to let you know that i will not touch you i come only to talk then talk was it the master of albuquerque who harmed you it seemed an odd question no itzpapalotl didnt hurt me he winced at her name do not use her name aloud within this dream okay but she didnt hurt me but you have seen her he asked yes he looked puzzled and he lifted a white hat and slapped it against his leg like it was a habitual gesture though id never seen him do it before but then id only seen him in clothes like this once before and wed been fighting for our lives so there really hadnt been time to notice the small stuff albuquerque is taboo the high council has declared the city off limits to all vampires and their minions why because the master of the city has slain every vampire or minion that has entered her city in the last fifty years i stared at him youre joking no ma petite i do not joke he looked worried no scared she didnt try anything hostile jeanclaude honest then there was a reason for it were the police with you no he shook his head slapping the hat against his leg again then she wants something from you what could she want from me i do not know he slapped the hat against his leg again and stared out at me through the glass wall has she really killed any vampire that just happened to be passing through oui why hasnt the council sent someone to kick her ass he looked down then up and the fear was in his eyes again the council fears her i believe having met three of the council members personally that raised my eyebrows as far as they would go why i mean i know shes powerful but shes not that powerful i do not know ma petite but i do know they decreed her territory taboo rather than fight her that was just plain scary it would have been nice to know that before i got here i know you value your privacy ma petite i have not contacted you in all these long months i have respected your decision but it is not merely our romance or lack of it that is important between us you are my human servant whether you will or no it means that you cannot simply enter another vampires territory without some diplomacy im here on police business i thought i could enter anyones territory as long as it was police business im here as anita blake preternatural expert not as your human servant normally that is true but the master whose lands you are in does not obey council decrees she is a law unto herself what does that mean for me here and now perhaps she fears human law perhaps she will not harm you for fear of the humans destroying her your authorities can be very effective at times or she simply wants something from you youve met her what do you think he said it came to my lips before i thought about it power shes attracted to power you are a necromancer i shook my head and again the hairpieces made it awkward i closed my eyes in the dream and when i opened them my hair just hung around my shoulders like normal the hair was heavy it could be he said i am happy that you left the dress i cannot tell you how long i have wished to see you in something like it dont push it jeanclaude my apologies and he did a sweeping bow using the hat in the gesture so that it swept across his chest i think its more than the necromancy she figured out that i was part of a triumvirate the first moment she met me i felt her sift through the three of us like unwinding a string she knew i think thats what she wants she wants to figure out how it works could she repeat it he asked shes got a human servant and jaguars are her animal to call theoretically i guess she could though can you make it a threeway when youve already got marks on a human and no animal if the marks are recent perhaps no not recent theyve been a couple a long time then no her humans marks will be too entrenched to stretch for a third so she may be interested in me for a power she cant have if she finds out that i cant be of help to her i said it would perhaps be best if she did not learn that ma petite you think shed kill me she has killed all that crossed her path for half a century i do not see why she should change her ways now i was standing very close to the mirror now close enough that i could see the gold buttons on his jacket and the rise and fall of his chest as he drew breath this was the closest id been to him in months it was just a dream but we both knew it wasnt just a dream hed put the mirror barrier between us because once wed used our dreams to enter each others fantasies hed come like a demon lover in my dreams in my sleep wed done the real thing too but the dreams had been sweet sometimes a prelude to the real thing sometimes an end in themselves the glass grew thinner as if the glass were wearing away it was like a thin pane of spun sugar he touched fingertips to it and the glass moved like clear plastic giving at his touch my fingertips touched his and the thin barrier vanished our fingers touched and it was startling electric his fingers slid over mine entwining our palms touching and even that one chaste touch sent my breath racing i stepped back but didnt let go of his hand so the movement drew him out of the mirror he stepped out of the golden frame and was suddenly standing in front of me our hands still raised in front of us i could feel his heart beating through his palm feel the rise and pulse of his body through my hand as if all of him were contained in that one pale hand where it lay pressed against mine he leaned down towards me as if to kiss me and i started to pull away afraid but the dream shattered and i was suddenly awake staring up at the hospital ceiling a nurse was in the room checking my vitals shed woken me i wasnt sure whether i was glad or sad the marks had been open for less than a week and jeanclaude was already pushing me okay okay i needed the warning but oh hell my teacher marianne had told me that i couldnt just ignore the boys that that would be dangerous i thought she meant ignoring the power that bound us but maybe she meant more than that i was jeanclaudes human servant and that made things complicated when i traveled each vampires territory was like a foreign country sometimes you had diplomatic treaties between them sometimes you didnt occasionally you just had a couple of master vamps that were enemies pure and simple so if you belonged to one you stayed the hell out of the other ones lands by refusing to contact jeanclaude i could screw up get myself killed or held hostage but id thought i was safe as long as i was on police business or animating zombies that was work it had nothing to do with jeanclaude and vampire politics but i could always be wrong like now why you may ask did i believe jeanclaude and his warning because it gained him nothing to lie about it id also felt his fear one of the things about the marks you could usually tell what the other person was feeling sometimes that bugged me sometimes it was helpful the nurse shoved a thermometer with a little plastic sheath on it under my tongue she took my pulse while we waited for the thermometer to beep what really bugged me about the dream was how attracted to him i was when i had the marks closed off id have never touched him in the dream of course i hadnt let him enter my dreams when i had the marks blocked off with the barriers up id policed my dreams kept him and richard out i could still keep them out but it took more work to do it i was out of practice i was going to have to get back into practice fast the thermometer beeped the nurse read the little monitor on her belt gave me an empty smile that could have meant anything and made a note i hear youre getting out of here today i looked up at her i am great doctor cunningham will be in to see you before you leave she smiled again he seems to want to oversee your release personally im one of his favorite patients i said the nurses smile slipped just a touch i think she knew exactly what doctor cunningham thought of me he should be in to see you soon but i am definitely getting out of here today i asked thats what i hear can i call a friend to come pick me up i can call them for you if im getting out today cant i have a phone the good doctor had made sure there was no phone in my room because he didnt want me trying to do work any work not even business phone calls when id promised not to use the phone if hed just give me one hed just looked at me made some kind of note in his file and left i dont think he trusted me if the doctor says you can have a phone ill bring you one but just in case give me the number and ill contact your friend i gave her edwards number she wrote it down smiled and left there was a knock on the door i expected doctor cunningham but it was detective ramirez his shirt today was a pale tan the halfmast tie was deep brown with a small white and yellow design on it but hed also kept a brown suit jacket that matched his pants it was the first time id seen him with an entire suit on at once i wondered if the sleeves were rolled up underneath the jacket sleeves he had a bouquet of shiny mylar balloons with cartoon characters on them the balloons said things like get well soon and oh bother that was the winnie the pooh balloon i had to smile you already sent flowers there was a small but nice arrangement running long to daisies and miniature carnations on the bedside table i wanted to bring something in person im sorry i wasnt here sooner my smile wilted around the edges this level of apology is usually reserved for boyfriends or lovers detective why are you feeling so guilty i keep having to remind you to call me hernando i keep forgetting no you dont you keep trying to distance yourself i just looked at him it was probably true maybe if i was your lover id have followed you to the hospital and been by your side every minute he said even with a murder investigation going on i asked he had the grace to shrug and look sheepish id have tried to be here every minute whats been happening while ive been in here my doctor has made sure i havent found out anything ramirez put the balloons beside the flowers the balloons had one of those little weights on them to keep them from drifting away the last time i tried to see you your doctor made me promise not to talk about the case i didnt know you were here before you were pretty out of it was i awake he shook his head great i wondered how many other people had paraded through here while i was passed out cold im getting out today so i think its safe to talk about the case he looked at me and the expression was enough he didnt believe me doesnt anyone trust me youre like most of the cops i know you never really get off work i raised my hand in the boy scouts salute honest the nurse told me im being released today he smiled i saw your back remember even if youre being let out you wont be going back on the case not in person anyway what im going to look at pictures and listen to the clues that other people find he nodded something like that do i look like nero wolfe i am not a staying at home out of the firing line kind of girl he laughed and it was still a good laugh a nice normal laugh it had none of jeanclaudes touchable sex appeal but in some ways i liked it better for its very normalcy but but as nice and warm as ramirez was i had the memory of jeanclaudes dream in my head i could feel the touch of his hand on mine a touch that lingered on my skin the way an expensive perfume will linger in a room long after the woman who wears it is gone maybe it was love but whatever it was it was hard to find a man who could compete with it no matter how much i wanted to find one it was as if when he was with me all other men just faded into the background except richard was that what it meant to be in love was it i wish i knew what are you thinking about ramirez asked nothing whatever that nothing is it makes you look very serious almost sad hed moved very close to the bed fingers touching the edge of the sheet his face was gentle questioning very open i realized in a way that ramirez had my ticket he knew what punched my buttons partly just coincidence partly he read me well he read what i liked and what i hated in a man better than jeanclaude had for years i liked honesty openness and a sort of little boy charm there were other things that led to lust but for my heart that was the way jeanclaude was almost never open about anything he always had a dozen different motives for everything he did honesty was not his best thing and his little boy charm nope jeanclaude had gotten there first and for better or worse that was the way things were maybe a little honesty would work here too im wondering how different my life would be if id met you or someone like you first first that implies that youve already met someone i told you i had two guys back home you also said you couldnt decide between them my grandmother always said that the only reason a woman hesitates between two men is that she hasnt met the right one your grandmother didnt say that he nodded yes she did she was being courted by two men sort of halfway engaged to both then she met my grandfather and she knew why shed been hesitating she didnt love either of the two men i sighed dont tell me ive got caught up in some family folklore you never said you were taken tell me im wasting my time and ill stop i looked up at him really looked at him let my eye follow the smiling line of his face the shining humor in his eyes youre wasting your time i am sorry but i think you are think i shook my head stop it hernando im taken okay youre not taken until you make a final choice but thats okay im not the one if i were youd know it when you meet him you wont have any doubts dont tell me you believe in true love soul mate kind of stuff he shrugged fingers running up and down the edge of the sheet what can i say i was raised on stories about love at first sight my grandmother both my parents even my greatgrandfather said the same thing they met that special person and no one else existed after that youre descended from a family of romantics i said he nodded happily my greatgrandfather poppy talked about my greatgrandmother like they were still school kids right up until he died it sounds nice really but i dont believe in true love hernando i dont believe that theres only one special person for your whole lifes happiness you dont want to believe it he said i shook my head this is about to go from cute to irritating hernando at least youre using my first name maybe because i dont see you as a threat anymore a threat just because i like you just because i asked you out he frowned when he said it it was my turn to shrug whatever i mean hernando just cut the juice it aint going nowhere whatever i decide its between the two guys i have waiting for me back home it sounds like you werent sure of that until just now i thought about that for a heartbeat or two you know i think youre right i think ive been looking around for someone else anyone else but its no good you dont sound happy about that love should make you happy anita i smiled and knew it was wistful if you think love makes you happy hernando youve either never been in love or never been in love long enough to have to start compromising youre not old enough to be this cynical its not cynicism its reality his face was soft and sad youve lost your sense of romance i never had a sense of romance trust me the guys at home will back me on it then im even sorrier dont take this wrong but hearing you go on about true love and romance makes me sorry for you you are setting yourself up for the big fall hernando not if it works out he said i smiled and shook my head isnt it against the rules for homicide detectives to be naive you think its naive he asked i know it is but its sweet i wish you luck finding your ms right the door opened and it was doctor cunningham ramirez asked does she really get out today doctor yes she does why doesnt anyone believe me i asked they both looked at me funny how quickly people caught onto certain aspects of my personality i want to do one more check on your back then youre free to go you got a ride out of here ramirez asked i asked the nurse to call ted but i dont know if she did or if hes home ill wait around to give you a ride before i could say anything he added what are friends for thanks and this means you can fill me in on the case on the way out you never give up do you not about a case i said ramirez walked out shaking his head giving the doctor and me some privacy dr cunningham poked and prodded and finally just ran his hands over my back it was nearly healed its just impressive ive treated lycanthropes before ms blake and youre healing almost that fast i flexed my left hand stretching the skin where the bite mark still showed where the flayed one had bitten me the bite was pale pink settling into a nice ordinary scar only weeks ahead of schedule i wondered if the scar would eventually disappear or if it would be another permanent one ive done blood work up on you i even snuck some of your blood down to the genetics department and had them look for something not human genetic work takes weeks or months i said ive got a friend in the department some friend i said he smiled and it was warmer than it should have been she is so im free to go you are his face got all serious again but id still like to know what the hell you are you wouldnt believe human fortyeight hours after your second injury we had to remove the stitches from your back because the skin was starting to grow over them no i wont believe human its too long a story doc if it was something i could teach you to use on other people id tell but its not that kind of thing you might call the healing a bonus for some other less pleasant shit that i put up with unless the other shit is really awful the healing makes up for it youd never have survived the original injuries if youd been human maybe no maybe he said im glad to be alive im glad to be nearly healed im glad it didnt take months to recover what more do you want me to say he draped his stethoscope over his shoulders holding onto the ends frowning at me nothing ill tell detective ramirez that he can tell you about the case now and that you are getting out today he glanced at the flowers and the balloons youve been here what five days something like that he touched a balloon making them bounce on their strings you work fast i dont think its me that works fast he gave the balloons one more whack so they bobbed and weaved like some underwater creature whatever enjoy your stay in albuquerque try to stay healthy with that he left and ramirez came back in doctor says i can talk the case with you again yep youre not going to like it he looked all serious whats happened theres been another murder and not only are you not invited to the scene neither am i what are you talking about marks is in charge of the case he has the right to use his resources as he sees fit stop talking political rhetoric and tell me what the little shithead has done now he smiled okay the men assigned to the case are one of those resources he decided that i was best used at the police property room going over the items that weve confiscated from the victims homes and matching them to the pictures and video we have of some of the houses before the murders pictures and videos for what i asked insurance purposes a lot of the houses hit had enough rare and antique pieces that they insured them and that meant they needed proof that they had the pieces to begin with what pieces did you find in the last scene i was at the one on the ranch the smile didnt change but the eyes did they went from pleasant to shrewd its not just that youre cute i like the way you think just tell me there were a lot of similar pieces since most of the people had collected things from this area or the southwest in general but nothing out of the ordinary except for this he reached behind his back underneath the suit jacket and pulled a manila envelope out that must have been inside his belt underneath the jacket i knew you had to be wearing the suit jacket for some reason he laughed he unfolded the envelope and spilled out pictures into my lap half of them were semiprofessional shots of a small carved piece of turquoise a glance and i wanted to say mayan aztec something like that i still couldnt tell the difference at a glance the second set were a few better shots of the object in the study of the man that had been killed the one that had used salt to interrupt the critter then a series of polaroids taken from every angle you took the polaroids i asked he nodded this afternoon after he decided my best use was not at the murder site i lifted one of the first series of pictures these are sitting on a wooden surface much better light natural i think insurance pictures he nodded who did it belong to the first house you saw the bromwells i said he lifted another picture this one was from the carsons and thats it either no one else owned one or they didnt think to get it insured did the people who didnt try to get it insured try to insure their other pieces yes shit i said i dont know much about this stuff but i know that its valuable why wouldnt they try to insure it if they owned one what if they thought it was hot illegal why would they think that i asked maybe because of the two houses we can prove had it their history of the piece where they got it and when isnt real what do you mean something like this doesnt just show up it has to have a history if you want it insured they gave their papers what theyd been given to the insurance company and just a little investigation showed that the people that were supposed to have unearthed the piece sold the piece had never heard of it they refused to insure it i said yes there was something in his face a suppressed excitement like a kid with a secret youre holding something back what is it you know what riker is hes a pot hunter an illegal dealer in artifacts why would he be so interested in you and this case i have no idea i looked at the pictures in my lap youre saying that he sold these to the victims not him personally but thad bromwell the teenage son he was with his mother when she purchased it it was a present for mr bromwells birthday they bought it from a shop that is a known associate of riker it takes pieces and makes them look legit have you talked to the shop owners unless youve got a ouija board were not going to be talking to him hes the newest victim i said ramirez nodded smiling you got it i shook my head okay riker is unusually interested in the case he wanted to see me specifically about it at least two of the victims are people who bought one of his pieces the shop owner that sold it is dead now too i looked up at him is it enough for a warrant we already searched his house rikers men are suspected in the killing of two local cops it wasnt hard to find a judge that would give us a warrant on the crap they pulled out at teds house what the hell did the warrant give you permission to search for they didnt mention stolen artifacts at teds house they just pointed guns at us and said riker wanted to talk about the case the warrant was to search for weapons i shook my head so even if you found stolen artifacts you wouldnt be able to use them in court it was just an excuse to search the house anita you know how that goes did you find anything a few guns two without license but the warrant didnt allow us to knock down walls or destroy things we couldnt pull up carpet or pull down shelves riker has a secret cache of artifacts but we didnt find it was ted with you on the search yes he was he was frowning now whats wrong ted wanted to take a sledge hammer to some of the walls he seemed pretty certain there was a hidden room in the lower areas but we couldnt find a way to open it and the warrant didnt allow you to tear up things i said no what did riker think of all the fun he had his lawyer screaming about harassment ted got up in his face not yelling but in his face speaking real quiet the lawyer said he threatened riker but riker wouldnt back it up he wouldnt say what ted had said to him you think he threatened him oh yeah it wasnt like edward to threaten anyone especially in front of the police the case really was getting to him so what the hell are these little figures no one knows according to experts they are aztec but very late period like after the conquest wait a minute you mean these were carved after the spanish came and kicked the aztecs butts not after but right about the same time who was your expert he mentioned a name i wasnt familiar with at the university does it matter who it was i thought you were using professor dallas marks thinks shes spending too much time with the unholy demons if he means obsidian butterfly then i agree marks and i agreeing on anything jeez thats almost scary so you think shes a contaminated source too i think dallas thinks the sun shines out of itzpapalotls butt so yeah have you shown any of these pictures to dallas he nodded the ones from the bromwells what did she say that it was a fake i raised eyebrows at him whats the other expert think that he understands why someone would think it was a fake just from pictures the figure has rubies for eyes and the aztecs didnt have access to rubies so just from pictures you might assume it was a fake i hear a but coming i said doctor martinez got to hold it in his hand look at it up close and he thinks its authentic something made after the spaniards arrived i didnt think anything was made after the spaniards arrived didnt they destroy everything if these are authentic then apparently not doctor martinez says that hell need more tests to he a hundred percent sure cautious man most academics are i shrugged some were some werent so lets say for arguments sake that riker found these things and he sold them to some people who knew they were hot or suspected they were and sold some to shops that passed them off as legit now something is killing off the customers and following the trail back to riker is that what hes afraid of sounds reasonable ramirez said i started looking through the polaroids they were back and front shots not great pics but from every angle it looked like the figure was wearing armor sort of its hands held long thick strings of things what did martinez say this figures holding he wasnt sure there were people curled around its feet but they were thin and sticklike not fat and square like the figure itself the eyes were rubies the mouth open and full of teeth there was a long tongue coming out of the mouth and what looked like blood pouring from the mouth nasty looking yeah he picked up one of the pictures from the sheet staring at it as he spoke do you think this thing is out there killing people i looked at him an aztec god as in the real deal out there slaughtering people he nodded still staring at the picture if you mean a real god with a capital g then im a monotheist so no if you mean some kind of preternatural nasty associated with this particular god then why not he looked up then why not i shrugged you were expecting a definitive yes or no i dont know much about aztec pantheon stuff except that most of the deities are big and bad and required sacrifice usually human they dont have much in their pantheon that isnt a major god something big and bad enough that you dont fight it you just try and stop it with magic or sacrifice or you die and whatever this thing is thats been doing the killings its not that bad i remembered what nicky baco had said that the voice in his head was still trapped that what had been doing the killings was just a minion not the real deal youre all serious again what did you just think of ramirez asked i looked up at him and tried to decide how much of a cop he was and how much of a player he would be i could never have told dolph hed have used the info for strict cop stuff i have information from an informant that i dont want to name right now but i think you need to know what was said his own face was solemn now did you obtain this information legally i did nothing illegal to obtain this information not exactly a no he said do you want it or not he took a deep breath and blew it out slow yeah i want it i told him what nicky had said about the voice and the thing being trapped i finished with i dont believe in a real god but i do believe there are things out there so terrible that once upon a time they were worshipped as gods are you saying that we havent seen the worst of it if what is doing the killings is just a minion and the master isnt up and around yet then yeah im saying the worst is yet to come id really like to talk to this informant you would be dandy but marks would have this informant up on charges so fast wed never find out what this person knew once you slap an automatic death sentence on someone they tend not to cooperate we looked at each other theres only one person youve talked to that has a rep to get himself an automatic death sentence thats nicky baco i didnt even blink it wasnt like i hadnt known hed figure it out i was ready for it and id gotten much better at lying you have no idea who ive talked to since i arrived ive talked to at least three people that could be put up on charges with a death sentence attached three he made it a question i nodded at least either you are a better liar than i thought you were or youre telling the truth i just looked up at him giving him blank but earnest face even my eyes were quiet and able to meet his gaze no flinching there had been a time not long ago when i couldnt have pulled it off but that was then and i wasnt the same person anymore all right if there is some sort of aztec god out there what do we do about it there was only one answer itzpapalotl should know what this is we questioned her about the killings so did i he looked at me long and hard you went without police backup and you didnt share what you found i didnt find anything about the murders she told me about what she told you nothing but when i talked to her she stressed that no deity she knew of would flay people and keep them alive later i figured out that they were dead she stressed that only through death could the sacrifice be a suitable messenger to the gods she repeated almost word for word that she didnt know a being or god that would flay people and keep them alive maybe we should go back and ask her if she knows of any deity or creature that would flay people and not keep them alive oh youre inviting the police now im inviting you i said he started picking up the pictures and shoving them back in the envelope i took the pictures out of the property room but i signed for them i brought doctor martinez in to see the statue but it was official i havent done anything wrong yet marks is going to be so pissed that you found out important stuff when he meant to just get you out of the way ramirez smiled but it wasnt exactly a pleased smile ive got better than that marks will take credit for the brilliant idea of putting one of his senior detectives on special detail to investigate the relics youre kidding me he did send me to the property room to look at what we took from the victims houses but he did it to humiliate you and get you out of the way but thats not what he said out loud out loud its going to make him seem inspired hes done shit like this before i take it ramirez nodded hes a very good politician and when hes not on his rightwing high horse hes a good detective fine you mentioned that i wasnt allowed on the murder scene either what gives there well we all thought you were still out of the game but he got ted and company excluded by getting the powers that be to agree that ted hadnt been a big help on the case and that without you his newest expert ted wasnt necessary on the murder scene oh i bet teds going to love that ramirez nodded he was very unprofessional or unlike himself when we searched rikers place ive never seen ted so ramirez shook his head i dont know he just seemed different close to the edge edward had let a little of his real self peek out where the police could see he had to be under immense pressure to be screwing up like that or he thought that it was necessary either way things were bad when ted started losing focus and edwards real self came through accident or on purpose the door opened no knock it was edward speak of the devil i said his edward face had been on and i watched it move like liquid into ted smiling but still weary around the eyes detective ramirez i didnt know you were here they shook hands i was just filling anita in on some of the things shes missed you tell her about the search at rikers ramirez nodded edward hefted a gym bag clothes you didnt have time to drive from your house to here since the nurse called i packed the bag the night you went in the hospital ive been riding around with it in my hummer ever since we looked at each other and there was a weight of things unsaid and unsayable in front of company maybe it showed or maybe ramirez just felt it ill leave you two alone you probably have things to talk about mystery informants and things like that he went for the door i called after him dont go far hernando when im dressed well go see obsidian butterfly only if its official anita i go in and we call for uniform backup it was our turn for solid eye contact and the weight of wills i blinked first fine we go in with the cops like good little boys and girls he flashed that warm smile that he could draw from his bag anytime he wanted or maybe it was real and my cynical nature was showing good ill wait outside he hesitated then walked back and handed the envelope edward he looked at me one more time then walked out edward opened the envelope and looked inside what is this the link i think i explained what ramirez and i had been discussing about riker and why he might be interested in the case on a very personal level that would mean that obsidian butterfly lied to us he said no she never lied she said she knew of no deity or creature that would flay people and keep them alive they arent alive theyre dead technically it wasnt a lie edward smiled that is cutting it very thin shes a nine hundred nearly a thousand year old vampire they tend to cut the truth pretty thin i hope you like what i picked out for you to wear the way he said it made me start pulling things out of the gym bag black jeans black scoopneck tshirt black jogging socks black nikes a black leather belt my black suit jacket the worse for being folded for two days black bra black satin panties jeanclaude had been a bad influence on my clothing and under it all was the browning the firestar all the knives an extra clip for the browning two boxes of ammo and a new shoulder rig it was one of the lightweight nylon ones with the holster itself angled for the front carry downward draw that i favored i always needed one with a very sharp downward angle to avoid scraping my breast every time i drew the gun id found that the millisecond i lost from the angle was made up for from the second i lost every time i went past my breast and had the flinch reaction concealed carry is the art of compromise i know you like leather but most of those would have to be tailored down for you the straps on the nylon ones can be adjusted down smaller edward said thanks edward i was missing my rig i looked at him trying to read past the neutral baby blues why this much ammo better to not need and have it he said i frowned at him are we going some place where ill need this much ammo if i thought that id have packed the miniuzi and the sawedoff shotgun this is just the normal stuff you carry i drew the big blade that would have normally rode down my back when they cut off the shoulder holster they cut through the rig for this too was it a specialty item i nodded i thought it must be because i asked around and no one had a sheath for concealment of something that large for the back especially not when you throw in how damn narrow you are through the shoulders it was a custom job i laid the big knife back in the bag almost sadly theres no way to conceal this thing without a rig for it did the best i could i smiled at him no its great i mean it why are we taking the police in with us to obsidian butterfly i told him what jeanclaude had told me though not how the message had i gotten through with the police at our backs shell know its not vampire politics and well probably be able to walk out without a fight he was leaning against the wall arms crossed the white shirt didnt quite lay smooth over the front of him his gun was showing but only if you knew what you were looking for a paddle holster or a clip holster because the gun was riding outside the pants it explained why the white shirt wasnt tucked in and the fact that he was wearing a tshirt under the shirt probably meant that he had something on him that would chafe without cloth between it and his skin you still carrying that band of throwing darts i asked you cant see it not with the shirt untucked he didnt even try to deny it why should he because youre wearing an undershirt and because the shirt is untucked i know its partially to hide the gun but you never wear an undershirt so youve got to be wearing something under the shirt that would chafe without the undershirt he smiled and it was a pleased smile almost proud as if id done something smart im carrying two more guns a knife and a garrote tell me where they are and ill give you a prize my eyes had gone wide a garrote even for you thats a little psychosrus give up no is there a time limit he shook his head weve got all night if i guess wrong is there a penalty he shook his head whats the prize if i figure out where everything is he smiled that close secretive smile that said he knew things that i didnt its a surprise prize get out so i can get dressed he touched the belt where it lay on the bed this buckle didnt come black who painted it i did why he knew the answer so that if im out after dark the buckle doesnt catch the light and give me away i lifted the tail of his white shirt exposing the large ornate silver belt buckle this is like a freaking target after dark he looked down at me making no move to lower the shirt it just clips on over the real buckle i let the shirt slide back the buckle underneath its blacked he said we smiled at each other it went all the way to our eyes we did like each other we were friends sometimes i think i dont want to be you when i grow up edward sometimes i think its too late im already there the smile faded leaving his eyes the color of winter skies and just as pitiless only you decide how far gone you are anita only you can decide how far youll go i looked at the weapons and the black clothing like funeral clothes even down to the things that touched my skin maybe it would be a start if i bought something pink pink edward said yeah you know pink like easter bunny grass like cotton candy he said or almost everything women give each other at baby showers when were you at a baby shower i asked donnas taken me to two of them its the new thing couples baby showers i looked at him eyes wide you at a couples baby shower edward you in something the color of childrens candy and baby doll clothes he shook his head anita you are one of the least pink women ive ever met when i was a little girl id have given a small body part to have a pink canopy bed and ballerina wallpaper would have been perfect he gave me wide surprised eyes you in a pink canopy bed with ballerina wallpaper he shook his head just trying to imagine you in a room like that gives me a headache i looked at the things spread on the bed i was pink once edward most of us start off soft he said but you cant stay that way not and survive theres got to be someplace i wont go something i wont do some line i wont cross edward why that one word held more curiosity than he usually allowed himself because if i dont have any lines limits then what kind of person does that make me i asked he shook his head moving the cowboy hat low on his head youre having a crisis of conscience i nodded yeah i guess i am dont go soft anita not on my dime i need you to do what you do best and what you do best isnt soft or gentle or kind what you do best is what i do best and what is that what is it that we do best i asked and i knew the anger came through in my voice i was getting angry with edward we do what it takes whatever it takes to get the job done theres got to be more to life than the ultimate practicality edward if it makes you feel any better we have different motives i do what i do because i love it its not just what i do its who i am you do the job to save lives to keep the damage down he looked at me with eyes gone as empty and bottomless as any vampires but you love it too anita you love it and that bothers you violence is one of my top three responses now edward maybe my number one and its kept you alive at what price he shook his head and now the blankness was replaced by anger he was just suddenly moving forward i caught his hand going under the shirt and i was rolling off the bed with the browning in my hand i had a round in the chamber and was falling back onto the floor with the gun pointed up eyes searching for movement he was gone my heart was thudding so loudly that i could barely hear and i was straining to hear a movement something he had to be on the bed it was the only place he could have gone from my angle i couldnt see anything on top of the bed just the corner of the mattress and the trail of sheet knowing edward the ammo in the browning was probably his homemade brew which meant that it would pierce the bottom of the bed and go up into whatever lay on top of the bed i felt the last of the air in my body slide outward and i sighted on the underneath of the bed the first bullet would either hit him or make him move then id have a better idea of where he was dont shoot anita his voice made me move the gun barrel just a touch more right it would take him midbody because he was crouched up there not lying down i knew that without seeing it it was a test anita if i wanted to come against you id warn you first you know that i did know that but i heard the bed creak dont move edward i mean it you think you can just decide to turn all this off you cant the genie is out of the bottle for you anita just like it is for me you cant unmake yourself think of all the effort all the pain that went into making you who you are do you really want to throw all that away i was lying flat on my back gun pointed twohanded the floor was cold where the gown had gaped at my back no i said finally if your heart starts bleeding for all the bad things you do it wont be the last thing that bleeds you really did this to test me you son of a bitch can i move now i took my finger off the trigger and sat up on the floor yeah you can move he eased back off the other side of the bed as i stood up on this one did you see how fast you went for the gun you knew where it was you had the safety off and a round chambered and you were looking for cover and trying to target me again there was that pride like a teacher with a favorite student i looked across at him dont ever do anything like that again edward a threat he asked i shook my head no threat just instinct i came so close to putting a bullet through the bed and into you and while you were doing it your conscience wasnt bothering you you werent thinking its edward im about to shoot my friend no i said i wasnt thinking anything but how to get the best shot possible before you had time to shoot me it didnt make me happy to say it it felt like id been mourning dead pieces of myself and edwards little demonstration had confirmed the deaths it made me sad and a little depressed and not happy with edward i knew a man once who was as good as you are edward said he started secondguessing himself worrying about whether he was a bad person it got him killed i dont want to see you dead because you hesitated if i have to bury you then i want it to be because someone was just that good or that lucky i want to be cremated i said not buried good little christian fallen catholic practicing episcopalian and you want to be cremated i dont want anyone trying to raise me from the dead or stealing body parts for spells just burn it all thanks cremated ill remember how about you edward where do you want the body shipped it doesnt matter he said ill be dead and i wont care no family just donna and the kids they are not your family edward maybe they will be i put the safety on the browning we dont have time to discuss your love life and my moral crisis get out so i can get dressed he had his hand on the door when he turned speaking of love life richard zeeman called that got my attention what do you mean richard called he seemed to know that something bad had happened to you he was worried when did he call earlier tonight did he say anything else that hed finally called ronnie and had her track down ted forresters unlisted number he seemed to think that you leaving a forwarding number with him would be a good idea his face was utterly blank empty only his eyes held a faint hint of amusement so both the boys had finally grown frustrated at my silence richard had turned to my good friend ronnie who happened to be a private investigator jeanclaude had taken a more direct route but theyd both finally gotten hold of me on the same night would they compare notes what did you tell richard i laid the gun on the bed with the rest that you were all right edward was looking around the room doctor cunningham still not allowing you a phone in here nope i said i had managed to untie the back of the gown then how did jeanclaude contact you i stopped in midmotion the gown slid off one shoulder and i had to catch it with my hand it caught me off guard and im never as good a liar on the spur of the moment i never said it was a phone call then what was it i shook my head just go edward the nights not getting any younger he just stood there looking at me his face had gone all cold and suspicious i got the bra in one hand and turned my back on him i let the gown slide to my waist leaned back against the bed to hold it in place and slipped the bra on there was no sound from behind me i got the panties and slipped them on underneath the gown i had the jeans hallway up my legs under the cover of the gown when i heard the door hush open and close i turned and found the doorway empty i finished dressing i had my toiletries in the bathroom already so i threw them in the gym bag along with the big knife and the boxes of ammo the new shoulder holster felt odd i was used to a leather one which fit tight and secure i guess nylon was secure but it was almost too comfortable as if it seemed less substantial than my leather one had but it beat the heck out of sticking it down my jeans the knives went in the wrist sheaths i checked to see what kind of ammo the firestar had in it edwards homemade stuff i checked the browning and it was his stuff too the backup clip for the browning was the hornady xtp silveredge i changed the clip we were going into the obsidian butterfly as cops which meant if i had to shoot someone id have to explain it to the authorities later which meant i didnt want to go in there with some possibly illegal homemade shit in my gun besides id seen what the hornady silveredge could do to a vampire it was enough the firestar went into an uncle mikes inner pants holster though truthfully the jeans were too tight for an inner pants holster maybe i wasnt spending enough time in the gym i had been on the road more than id been home the kenpo was neat stuff but it wasnt the same thing as a full workout with weights and running another thing to pay more attention to when i got back to st louis id been letting a lot of things slide i finally transferred the firestar to the small of my back and hated it but it dug in something fierce in front i have a slight sway to my back so theres always more room for a gun there but it wasnt a quick place to draw from something about a womans hip structure makes a gun at the small of the hack not the best idea that i kept the gun at the small of my back tells you just how tight the jeans were definitely going to have to get back into a regular gym schedule the first five pounds are easy to get rid of the second five are harder and it gets even harder from there id been chunky in junior high close to fat so i knew what i was talking about so that no teenager out there will get the wrong idea and go all anorexic on me i was a size thirteen in jeans and that was at five foot nothing see i really was chunky i hate women who complain about being fat when theyre like a size five anything under size five isnt a woman its a boy with breasts i stared at the black jacket two days folded in a gym bag and it desperately needed to go to the dry cleaners i decided to carry it folded over one arm on the theory it would unwrinkle a little i didnt really need to hide the weapons until we got to the club the knives were illegal if id been a cop or a civvie but i was a vampire executioner and we got to carry knives gerald mallory the grandfather of our business had testified before a senate subcommittee or something like that at how many times knives had saved his life mallory was well liked in washington it was his home base so the law got changed to let us carry knives even really big ones if someone challenged me all i had to do was whip out my executioners license and i was legal of course that was predicated on them knowing the loophole in the law not every cop on the beat is going to know but my heart is pure because im legal edward and ramirez were waiting for me in the hallway they both smiled and the smiles were so close to identical it was unnerving will the real good guys please stand up but edwards smile never faltered ramirezs did his gaze hesitated on the wrist sheath the jacket hid the other one i walked up to them smiling and my eyes were shiny too i put a hand around edwards waist and brushed my arm along the gun id thought was there at the small of his back ive called for backup ramirez said edward had given me a quick ted hug and let me go though he knew id found the gun great its been a long time since i visited a master of the city with the police how do you usually do it ramirez asked carefully i said edward turned his head away and coughed i think he was trying not to laugh but you can never tell with edward maybe he just had a tickle in his throat i watched him walk and wondered where in the world he was hiding the third gun one of the things i liked about working with the police was that when you went into a business and asked to speak with the manager or owner no one argued ramirez flashed his badge and asked to speak with the owner itzpapalotl also known as obsidian butterfly the hostess the same darkly elegant woman that had shown edward and me to a table last time took ramirezs business card showed us all to a table and left us the only difference was this time we didnt get any menus the two uniforms stayed at the door but kept us in sight id put the wrinkled jacket on to cover the guns and knives but i was glad the club was dark because the jacket had seen better days ramirez leaned over and asked how long do you think shell keep us waiting funny how he didnt ask if she would keep us waiting not sure but a while shes a goddess and youve just ordered her to appear before you her ego wont let her be quick edward was leaning in on the other side half hour at least a waitress came ramirez and i ordered cokes edward got water the lights on the stage dimmed then came up brighter we settled back for the show cesar had probably healed by now but not by much so it would either be a different wereanimal or a different show altogether there was what looked like a stone coffin propped up on the stage sitting on its end with the carved lid staring out at the audience our table wasnt as good as last time i spotted professor dallas at her usual table alone this time she didnt seem to mind the stone lid was carved in a crouching jaguar with a necklace of human skulls the high priest pinotl came onto the stage he was dressed only in that skirt thing a maxtlatl that left the legs and most of the hips bare id asked dallas what the skirt was his face was painted black with a stripe of white across the eyes and nose his long black hair had been formed into individual strands curling at the ends he wore a white crown and it took me a second to realize it was made of bones the stage lights flickered over the white bones making them shimmer and almost bleed white color when he moved his head finger bones had been restrung and formed a fan above the main band reminiscent of the feathers id seen him wearing the first time his ear spools of gold had been replaced by bones he looked totally different from the first time and yet the moment he stepped out on stage i knew it was him no one else had had that aura of command i leaned into ramirez you wearing a cross yes why his voice can be a little overwhelming without a little help hes human isnt he hes her human servant ramirez turned his face full into mine and we were too close i had to move back to keep from bumping noses what did he really not know what a human servant was for a vampire i didnt have time to give him a preternatural lesson and this wasnt the place anyway far too many listening ears i shook my head ill explain later two very azteclooking bouncers came on stage and lifted the lid of the coffin off they moved to one side with it and the way they shuffled muscles in their arms and back working it looked heavy there was a clothdraped body in the coffin i didnt know for certain that it was a body but it was shaped like a body there just arent that many things that are bodyshaped pinotl began to speak those of you who have been with us before know what it is to make sacrifice to the gods you have shared in that glory taken the offering into yourselves but only the bravest the most virtuous are fit sacrifices there are those that are not fit to feed the gods with their lives but they too may serve he drew the cloth off in one large movement sending the black and sequined draped cloth spreading wide like a fishermans net as that glittering cloth fell to the stage the contents of the coffin were revealed gasps screams spread through the audience like ripples in a pool there was a body in the coffin it was dried and wizened as if the body had been buried in the desert and had mummified naturally no artificial preservatives the spotlight on the coffin seemed very bright harsh it showed every line in the dried skin the skeletal shadow of bones underneath was painfully clear we were only three rows back close enough to see more detail than i cared to see at least this time they wouldnt be cutting anyone up i really wasnt in the mood to see inside anyones chest tonight i was searching the crowd trying to see if she was coming or if we were about to be surrounded by werejaguars i turned and looked the dead mummys eyes were open i looked at edward he answered the question without me having to say it its eyes just opened nobody touched it i stared at that skull trapped under dry parchment skin the eyes were full of something dry and brown there was no life to the eyes but they were open the mouth began to open slowly as if the mouth were on a stiff hinge as the mouth opened a sound came out of it a sigh that grew into a scream a scream that echoed through the room reverberated off the ceiling the walls the inside of my head its a trick right ramirez said i just shook my head it wasnt a trick dear god it wasnt a trick i looked at edward and he just shook his head hed never seen this particular act either the scream died and there was a silence so thick you could have dropped a pin and heard it bounce i think everyone was holding their breath straining to hear to hear what i didnt know but i was doing it too i think i was trying to hear it breathe i studied that skeletal chest but it didnt rise and fall it didnt move i said a silent prayer of thanks this ones energy went to feed our dark goddess but she is merciful what was taken shall be given back this is micapetlacalli the box of death i am nextepeua in legend i was the husband of micapetlacalli and i am still married to death death runs through my veins my blood tastes of death only the blood of one consecrated to death will free this one of torment i realized that pinotls voice was just a voice a good voice like a good stage actor but nothing more either he wasnt trying to bespell the audience or i wasnt as susceptible tonight the only change that i knew for certain was the marks they were wide open now id been told by my teacher and by leonora evans that the marks made me more vulnerable to psychic attack but maybe on some things having a direct link to the boys helped me whatever it was his voice didnt move me tonight great pinotl drew an obsidian blade from behind his back hed probably been carrying it the way edward and i were carrying guns at the small of his back he held his arm over the open coffin over that gaping mouth he drew the blade across his skin it wasnt clear to the audience what hed done it would have been much better theater for pinotl to slash his arm where the audience could see that first crimson slash for him to hide it there had to be some ritual significance some importance to those first drops of blood going into the corpses mouth he dripped blood on the top of the things skull dabbed it in the middle of that skull forehead touched it to the throat the chest the stomach the abdomen he went down the line of chakras energy points of the body id never believed in chakras until this year when id found they were real and they seemed to work i hated all this new age stuff i hated it worse when it worked of course this wasnt new age stuff this was very old stuff with each touch of blood to that dried thing i felt magic each drop of blood made it grow until the air hummed with it and my skin crept in waves of goose bumps edward sat unmoved but ramirez was rubbing his arms chasing goosebumps whats happening he was at the very least a sensitive i guess i couldnt possibly be attracted to a totally normal human being i whispered magic he looked at me eyes showing too much white what kind i shook my head that i didnt know i had a few clues but i really had never seen anything like it not exactly pinotl walked around the coffin in a counterclockwise motion bleeding arm and bloody knife held apart palm up while he chanted the power built and built in the air like close thunder until my throat closed with it and i was having trouble breathing pinotl came back to the front of the coffin where hed begun he made some kind of sign with his hands then flung a spray of blood onto the body and began to back slowly away the lights dimmed until the only light was the harsh white light on the thing in the coffin the power had built to a screaming pitch my skin was trying to crawl off my body and hide the air was too thick to breathe as if it had grown more solid thick with magic something was happening to the body the power broke like a cloud bursting with rain and that invisible rain broke over the body over the room over us all but the focus was that dried thing the skin began to move to twitch it filled out as if water flowed beneath it something liquid moved under that dry wasted skin and where it flowed the skin began to stretch it was like watching one of those blow up dolls fill up flesh flesh was flowing under the skin it plumped like some obscene kind of dough the body the man began to thrash and twist against the sides of the coffin the chest finally rose drawing in a great draught of air as if he were struggling back from the dead it was like the opposite of that death rattle where the breath flows away for the last time of course that was exactly what it was life returning the last breath being drawn back in when he had air to breathe he began to scream one long ragged shriek after another as fast as his healing chest could bring in the air he screamed the dry hair on his head turned curly brown and soft his skin was tanned and young smooth and flawless hed been under thirty when he went into the coffin who knew how long hed been in there even after he looked human again he kept shrieking as if he had been waiting a very long time to scream a woman near the front screamed and took off running for the door the vampires had moved up quietly through the tables i hadnt sensed them over the suffocating flow of magic and the sheer horror of the show careless of me a vampire caught the running woman held her and she grew instantly still he led her quietly back to her table to the man that was standing wondering what he should do the vampires moved through the crowd touching someone here stroking a hand there soothing soothing telling the great lie it was safe it was peaceful it was good ramirez watched the vampires he turned to me what are they doing soothing the crowd so they dont all bolt for the exits they arent allowed to use one on one hypnosis i dont think its personal more like crowd hypnosis i looked back to the stage and found the man had collapsed onto the stage pushing his way out of the coffin as soon as he got the strength he was trying to crawl away pinotl appeared in the growing circle of light the man screamed and held his hands up in front of his face as if to ward off a blow pinotl spoke and he didnt yell so he must have been using a microphone of some kind have you learned humility he asked the man whimpered and hid his face have you learned obedience the man nodded his head over and over still hiding his face he started to cry great sobs that made his shoulders shake three rows out and i could hear him sobbing pinotl motioned and the two bouncers that had opened the coffin walked on stage they lifted the weeping man up carrying him between them his legs didnt seem to move yet so they carried him with an arm on either of their shoulders his feet dangling off the floor he wasnt a small man and again you got that sense of how strong the two men were they were human too not wereanything two werejaguars walked on stage in their spotted skin clothes and between them they held another man no not a man a wereanimal it was seth hed been stripped down to a gstring that left very little to the imagination his long yellow hair was unbound streaked with light and color he didnt struggle as they brought him up on stage the jaguar men had him kneel in from of pinotl do you acknowledge our dark goddess as your one and true mistress seth nodded i do his voice didnt have the resonance of the other mans and i doubted that the people in the back could hear him she has given you life seth and it is right that she should ask you give that life back to her yes seth said then i will be her hand and take that which is hers he cradled seths face between his hands it was gentle the two jaguar men let go of seth and backed away but they stayed close almost as if afraid that he might run but his face was turned upward with a near beatific expression on it as if this were wonderful hed been so afraid of being tortured by itzpapalotls four sisters weird and yet now he seemed at peace with what they were about to do i thought i knew and i hoped i was wrong just once when i expect something truly hideous is about to happen id like to be wrong it would be a nice change it wasnt flashy there was no fire or light or even a shimmer of heat lines appeared on seths twentysomething skin the muscles under his skin began to shrink as though he had a wasting disease but what should have taken months was happening in seconds no matter how willing the sacrifice it can still hurt seth started screaming as fast as he could draw breath his lungs were working better than the other mans and he drew breath so fast it was like one continuous shriek the skin darkened as it drew in and in like something were sucking him dry it was like watching a balloon shrivel except there was muscle and when the muscle vanished there was bone and finally there was nothing but dried skin over bones and still he screamed ive become something of a connoisseur of screams over the years and ive heard some good ones some of them have even been mine but id never heard anything like this the sound stopped being human and became like the highpitched sound of some wounded animal but underneath it all you knew knew at a level that you couldnt even explain that it was a person finally there was no more air for screaming but that dry empty mouth kept opening and closing opening and closing long after the screaming stopped that skeletal thing was still writhing still flinging its head from side to side pinotl kept his hands pressed to seths face he held him and it looked gentle the whole time but he had to be gripping with all the strength he had because he never lost his grip while the flesh of that handsome face shriveled and died between his hands pinotl never moved and through it all seth never once raised his hands up to save himself he struggled because he couldnt not struggle it hurt that much but he never raised his hands against the other man a willing sacrifice a fit sacrifice my throat was tight and something burned behind my eyes i just wanted it over now i just wanted it to stop but it didnt stop the skeletal thing that had been seth kept twitching opening and closing its mouth as if trying to scream pinotl looked up breaking eye contact with seth for a heartbeat the two jaguar men that had escorted him onto the stage came into the light one of them held a silver needle with black thread on it the other held a pale green ball tiny the size of a marble maybe if id been sitting much further out id have never known what it was jade i think a jade ball they placed it in that gaping mouth and the mouth closed the other jaguar began to sew his mouth shut driving the silver needle through the dry lipless flesh tugging it tight i looked at the table too resting my forehead on the cool stone of the table i would not faint i never fainted but i had a sudden flash of the creature that nicky baco had created out of the werewolves some of them had had their mouths sewn shut id never seen a power like this it was too big a coincidence that two people in one town could do it and not be connected ramirez touched my shoulder i raised my head and shook it im all right i looked up and they were putting seth in the coffin i knew without trying to sense it that he was still in there still aware he could not have understood what he was letting them do to him he couldnt have could he pinotl turned to the audience and his eyes glowed with black fire the way a vampires do when their power is high black flames licked around his eye sockets and his skin seemed to glow with the power the thing that seth had become was covered with the same black glittering cloth that had covered the last body the jaguar assistants closed the coffin securing the heavy lid a collective sigh ran through the audience as if they were all relieved that it was covered i wasnt the only one that didnt want to see it anymore itzpapalotl glided on stage she was wearing the same crimson cloak as before pinotl went to one knee in front of her extending his hands she put her delicate hands on his strong ones and i felt the rush of power like the brush of birds wings pinotl stood holding her hand and they turned to the audience and now both of them had eyes of black flame spreading over their faces like a mask soft spotlights filled the darkness of the tables like giant soft fireflies each light found one of the vampires they were pale and wan hungry fasted maybe because i wasnt the only one that could tell they hadnt fed you heard the exclamations through the audience how pale how frightening oh my god no she wanted everyone to see them for what they truly were she and pinotl stared off into that softlit dark and again i felt the rush of power like a chittering flight of birds brushing across my face my skin as if i had no clothes and the swift passing of feathered things caressed my body i felt it almost like a series of physical blows as the power hit each vampire and their eyes filled with black fire they became shining things with skin of alabaster bronze copper all glowing all beautiful with eyes filled with the light of black stars then they fell into line and began to sing a song of praise to her their dark goddess diego the vampire wed seen whipped senseless passed by our table with a leash in his hand on the end of that leash was a tall paleskinned man with curly yellow hair was it cristobal one of the starved ones there were no starved ones in line all of them were glowing and well fed and filled to bursting with a dark sweet power like overripe berries before they fall to the ground when they are poised between the sweetest of ripeness and rotting life is often like that the best balancing on a knife edge with the worst the vampires left the stage still singing her praises pinotl and she walked hand and hand down the steps and i knew where they were coming and i didnt want them near me i could still feel the power as though i were standing in the middle of a cloud of butterflies and they were beating at my skin with soft wings beating at me trying to come inside they came and stood in front of our table her face was smiling soft as she gazed down at me the black flames had quieted but her eyes were still an empty blackness with a flicker of light in their depths pinotls eyes echoed hers like a mirror but it wasnt black flame it was the blackness of endless night and there were stars in her eyes an endless fall of stars edward had my arm he had turned me to face him we were both standing though i didnt remember getting up anita are you okay i had to swallow twice to find my voice im okay i think yeah im okay but the power was still beating against me like frantic wings birds crying that theyve been shut out in the dark and they want inside to the light and the warmth how could i leave them crying in the dark when all i had to do was open and they would be safe stop it i said i turned to face them they were still smiling still welcoming she held her hand out to me the other still holding pinotls hand i knew if i took that hand that all this power would flow into me that i could share it with them it was an offering to share but at what price because there was always a price what do you want i asked i wasnt even sure who i was asking i want the knowledge of how your triad of power was achieved i can tell you that you dont need to do this you know that i cannot tell truth from lie it is not one of my powers touch me and i will gain the knowledge from you the wings were flowing over my skin as if the flying things had found a current of air just above my body what do i gain think of one question and if i have the answer you will draw it from my mind ramirez was standing he motioned and i knew without looking that the uniforms were coming this way i dont know whats happening but were not doing it answer one question first i said if i can she said who is the red womans husband her face showed nothing but her voice was puzzled the red woman was another term for blood among the mexicanas among the azteca i truly do not know who the red womans husband would be id half reached out to her i didnt really mean to three things happened almost together ramirez and edward both grabbed me to pull me back and itzpapalotl grabbed my hand the wings erupted into a torrent of birds my body opened though i knew i didnt and the winged things only halfglimpsed spilled into that opening the power flowed into me through me and out again i was part of some great circuit and i felt the connection with every vampire shed touched it was as if i flowed through them and they through me like water coming together to form something larger then i was floating in the soothing dark and there were stars distant and glittering a voice her voice came ask one question and it shall be yours i asked though my mouth never moved still i heard the words how did nicky baco learn to do what pinotl did to seth with the words came the image of nickys creature so clear i could smell the dryness of it and hear that voice whispering help me images then and they had force to them like things slamming into my body i saw itzpapalotl standing on the top of a pyramid temple surrounded by trees jungle i could smell the rich greenness of it and hear the night call of a monkey the scream of a jaguar pinotl knelt and fed from the bloody wound on her chest he became her servant and he gained power many powers and one of them was this and i understood how hed taken seths essence more than that i understood how it was done and how it was undone i knew how to unmake nickys creature though what hed done to them might mean that to bring them back to flesh would kill them we didnt need nicky to undo the spell i could do it pinotl could do it she didnt ask if i understood she knew when i had it all now for my question and before i could say or think wait she was inside my head she drew the memories from me images pieces and i couldnt stop her she saw jeanclaude mark me and she saw richard and she saw the three of us calling power on purpose for the first time she saw that last night when id taken the second and third mark to save our lives all our lives i was suddenly back in my own skin standing on one side of the table still holding her hand i was gasping fast and faster and i knew if i didnt get control i was going to hyperventilate she released my hand and all i could do was concentrate on my own breathing ramirez was yelling at me was i all right edward had his gun out pointed at her she and pinotl just stood there peaceful i could see everything as though i were looking through crystal the colors seemed darker more vivid things stood out in bold relief and it wasnt the things i would normally have noticed the way the band in edwards hat had a small ridge in it and i knew where the garrote was when i could finally talk i said its all right its all right im not hurt i touched edwards hand lowering the gun to point at the table chill okay im all right she said it would harm you if we forced you to let go early edward said it might have i said id expected to feel badly drained tired but i didnt i felt energized exhilarated i feel great you dont look great edward said and there was something in his voice that made me look at him he grabbed my hand and started leading me through the tables towards the door i tried to slow down and he jerked me with him pulling me along youre hurting my wrist i said he pushed through the doors with the gun still naked in his hand my wrist gripped in his other hand he hit the lobby doors with his shoulders i remembered it being darker in the lobby but it wasnt dark now it wasnt exactly light it just wasnt dark he pushed one of the wall hangings apart and there was the mens room door he pushed it open before i could say anything the urinals stretched empty and i was grateful the lights were bright made me squint edward whirled me around to face the mirrors my eyes were a solid shining black there was no pupil no white nothing i looked blind yet i could see everything every crack in the wall the smallest dint on the edge of the mirror i walked forward and he let me go i reached out until i could touch my reflection i jumped when my fingers met the cool glass as if id expected my hand to keep on going i stared at my hand and i could almost see the bones under my skin the muscles working as i moved my fingers underneath that i could see the flow of blood under my skin i turned and looked at edward i looked at him slowly and i could see the slight difference in the pants leg where the hilt of the knife was sticking out of his boot there was the faintest line where the second knife was strapped to his thigh and he could reach through his pants pocket and touch the hilt there was a bulge in his other pocket small but i knew it was a gun a derringer probably but that last bit of knowledge was my knowledge the rest was this extraordinary vision it was like some fantasy spell of true seeing if this was how all vampires saw the world then i should just stop trying to hide weapons but id fooled vampires before masterlevel vampires so this was how she saw the world but not necessarily how they all saw the world say something anita i wish you could see what im seeing i dont want to he said the garrote is in the band of your hat youve got a knife in a sheath in your right boot and a knife on your left thigh you reach the hilt through your pants pocket theres a derringer in your right pants pocket he paled and i saw it i saw the pulse in his throat beat faster i could see the small changes in his body as the fear rushed through it no wonder shed been able to read me so easily but it should have worked like a lie detector for her thats what other vamps and wereanimals pick up on the minute changes we all make when we lie even the smell changes so richard said so why couldnt she tell if someone were lying the answer came in a wave of clarity that you usually have to meditate to have she couldnt read things she didnt have inside herself she wasnt a goddess she was a vampire not like any vampire id ever known before but that was what she was yet she believed she was itzpapalotl the living personification of the sacrificial knife the obsidian blade she was lying to herself and thus she couldnt see a lie in someone else she didnt understand what truth was so she couldnt recognize that either she was fooling herself on a cosmic scale and it weakened her but i wasnt going to march out there and point out the error of her ways she was just a vampire and not a goddess but id had a taste of her power and i did not want to be on her dirty list with her power flowing through me like a rising wind warm and smelling of flowers that i did not recognize i didnt even want to burst her bubble i hadnt felt this good in days i turned back to the mirror and my eyes were still that spreading blackness i should have been scared or screaming but i wasnt scared and all i could think was cool shouldnt your eyes go back to normal he asked and again i felt that tightness of fear in him eventually but if we really want answers to our questions we need to go back and ask her he gave one quick nod after you and i realized that edward didnt trust me at his back he thought that she had possessed me i didnt argue with him i just walked through the door first and went back to talk to itzpapalotl i hoped ramirez hadnt tried to put handcuffs on her she wouldnt like that and what she didnt like her followers didnt like and there were a hundred and two vampires i had no idea how many werejaguars she had this was a feeding not meant for them but it was a small army and ramirez hadnt brought that much backup ramirez hadnt put cuffs on anyone but he had called for more backup there were four more uniforms in the room and about twenty werejaguars the audience was watching it all as if it were part of the show i guess if they could sit through what had been done to seth they could sit through a little police action i was ahead of edward as we came into the room he fell a step behind me the way we often did when one of us was going to be in charge of the next few minutes maybe my eyes were glowing black pits but edward still trusted me to calm the situation good to know the werejaguars were moving through the tables trying to flank the cops the uniforms had their hands on their guns the holsters were unbuckled it wasnt going to take much to get a gun drawn and the shit to hit the fan be a shame to push this big a button when the vampires werent trying to hurt anybody one of the jaguars was moving again trying to close the circle around the police i touched his arm his power trembled over my hand and it was more than just my own power or the marks that flared and answered that rush he looked down at me and saw the eyes or felt her power whatever it was when i said back up go stand with the others he did it progress now if only the police would be as reasonable i turned to the police and started walking towards them one of the new uniforms said shit hand on gun other hand out like a traffic stop dont come any closer ramirez i said and made sure my voice carried its okay shes with us he said but her eyes the uniform said shes with us let her through now ramirezs voice was low but the anger carried the uniforms parted like a curtain very careful not to touch me as i went past i guess i couldnt blame them though i wanted to i was finally at the table with edward behind me and the nervous uniforms beyond him i faced itzpapalotl across the table pinotl was at her side but they were no longer holding hands his eyes were still as black as mine but hers were normal strangely with the hood pushed back to show that delicate face and those normal seeming eyes she looked the most human of the three of us ramirez had laid some of the pictures on the table tell me what this is it sounded like a question hed asked before she looked at me do you know what it is i asked no i truly do not it does look like one of our artisans could have made it but the eyes are stones that came with the spaniards i do not recognize all the elements of the symbolism but you recognize some of them i said yes what do you recognize the bodies around the base could be the ones you drink you mean like you did with seth tonight she nodded what is it holding in its hands it could be many things but i think it is the lesser things of the body the heart is spoken for as are the bones and many other parts but no god feeds on the she frowned searching for the word intestines and other viscera that makes sense i said i felt ramirez shift beside me as if he badly wanted to say it does but he kept quiet because he was a good cop and she was talking to me did it really matter why not right that second it didnt you saw the creature that it was my turn to hesitate if the police knew what nicky had done it was an automatic death sentence but frankly he deserved it the werewolves that he had sucked dry hadnt been willing sacrifices and hed cut them up knowing they were still alive hed cut them up and sewn them into that monster behind the bar it was one of the worst things id come across and that was saying a lot i made my decision and knew that it would eventually cost nicky his life you saw the creature that nicky baco made she nodded i saw it is a corruption of a great gift does his master gain power through it just like you do yes and nicky baco gains power through it much as pinotl does as you have can he pass that power to others like maybe a werewolf pack she seemed to think about that head to one side then finally nodded it would be possible to share with wereanimals if you had some bond with them of a mystical nature hes vargamor for the local pack i said i am not familiar with the word vargamor it was a wolf term its their witch their brujo and they are bound to the pack then certainly he could share the power with them nicky said he didnt know where this god lay he lies she said you do not gain this power without the touch of your gods hand id gotten that from the images that had filled me but i wanted it confirmed then nicky should be able to take us to the place where the god is hiding she nodded he knows do you have a problem with us hunting down and killing a god from your pantheon a look crossed her face that i didnt understand if it is a god then you cannot kill it and if you can kill it then it is not a god i do not mourn the death of false gods it was kind of funny coming from her but i let it go it wasnt my job to convince her what she was or what she wasnt thank you for your help itzpapalotl she gave me a long look and i knew what she wanted but you are indeed a goddess but i cannot serve two masters i said his power is lust and you deny him his power i felt the heat rush up my face and wondered what a blush looked like with glowing black eyes it wasnt what shed said it was me knowing what shed seen in my head she knew more intimate details than my best friend just as id shared what she and pinotl considered a very private and intimate moment of their sharing fair is fair but somehow i didnt think itzpapalotl blushed i thought i was just denying him sex she looked at me the way youd look a child that was deliberately misunderstanding a point tell me anita what is the base of my power the question surprised me but i answered it the time for lying between us was past power you feed off of pure power regardless of the source she smiled and that thread of power in me smiled with her made me feel glowy all over now what is your masters base of power id been running from this particular truth for a very long time not all master vampires had a secondary power base another way to draw energy other than blood or human servants or animals to call but some did and jeanclaude was one of them anita she said as if reminding me that i was supposed to be saying something sex his base of power is sex i said again she smiled happily at me and i felt that warm answering glow it was good to be truthful it was good to be smart it was good to please her and that of course was one of her dangers if you stayed near her long enough it might become an end in itself to please her even thinking it i couldnt be afraid of her good that i didnt live in albuquerque by denying him and your wolf you cripple not just the triad of power but him you have crippled him anita you have crippled your master i heard myself say im sorry it is not me that you must be sorry to it is him go home and beg his forgiveness lay yourself at his feet and feed his power i closed my eyes because what i really wanted to do was nod and just agree i was pretty sure the spell would wear off before i got home to st louis but putting this woman and jeanclaude together as a team would have been my undoing even now i was glad he was hundreds of miles away because i nodded eyes still closed she took the nod as assent good very good if your master is grateful for my aid in this matter let him contact me i know that we can come to an understanding and for the first time since shed zapped me i felt a thrill of fear i looked at her through a veil of her power and was afraid of her she read it in me you should always be afraid of gods anita if you are not afraid then you are a fool and you are not a fool she looked past me to ramirez i believe that i have helped you all that i can detective ramirez he said anita i nodded yeah its time to go see nicky baco if nicky lied to us then so did his pack leader edward said because he said nicky was telling the truth about not knowing where the monster was if nicky can share this kind of power with the werewolves then i know why the pack lied the werewolves will fight to protect nicky edward said we looked at each other itll be a blood bath if the police go in force i shook my head but what choice do we have nicky isnt at the bar ramirez said we turned to him said in unison where is he in the hospital someone beat the shit out of him edward and i exchanged glances and we both smiled back to the hospital then i said he nodded back to the hospital i looked at ramirez if thats all right with you can you prove what youve been saying about baco he asked yes i said then its a death sentence hell know that ive seen baco in an interrogation hes tough and he knows that he has nothing to gain and everything to lose by telling us the truth then well have to find something that hes more afraid of than being executed i couldnt help it i turned and looked at itzpapalotl i met her eyes and there was no pull to them now her own power protected me from her no stars no endless night just a dark knowledge of what i was thinking and her approval of the plan we cant do anything illegal ramirez said of course not i said i mean it anita i looked at him and watched him flinch when he met my eyes would i do that to you he searched my face as if trying to decipher it it was the way i looked at edward sometimes or jeanclaude finally he said i dont know what youd do and that for better or worse was the truth edward got his sunglasses out of the glove compartment and handed them to me before we went inside the hospital my eyes hadnt changed back though i knew the effect was beginning to wear off because the fact that my eyes were still black and glowy was beginning to worry me it was a good sign nicky baco was not in a private room the police had his roommate moved to a different room nicky was in traction and wasnt going anywhere he lay in the bed and looked smaller than i knew he was the leg that had been badly broken was in a cast from toe to thigh little pulleys and cords held his leg up at an odd angle that must have been hell on the back ramirez had been questioning nicky for about thirty minutes and was getting nowhere edward and i leaned against the wall and watched the show but nicky had done exactly what wed feared hed do hed grasped his situation and his options right away he was going to die so why should he help us we know where the monster you made is nicky we know what you did help us stop this thing before it kills again and what nicky said i know the law theres no life in prison for a witch that uses magic to kill its an automatic death sentence you got nothing to offer me ramirez i pushed away from the wall and touched ramirezs arm he looked at me and the frustration was already showing hed been informed that lieutenant marks was on the way he wanted to crack baco before marks arrived so he would get credit and not his lieutenant political but the reality in most police work can i ask a few questions detective he took a breath let it out slow sure he stepped back to let me stand beside the bed i looked down at nicky someone had handcuffed one of his wrists to the bed rail i wasnt sure it was necessary with the traction but it made a nice point what would the red womans husband do if he knew you gave away his secret hideout he stared up at me and even through the sunglasses i could see the hate in his eyes i could also see the fast rise and fall of his chest the thud of the pulse in his neck he was scared answer me nicky hed kill me how that made him frown what do you mean how i mean what method of death would he use how would he kill you nicky shifted in the bed trying to find a comfortable spot the leg pulled tight and he jerked on the handcuffed wrist making it rattle up and down the bar there was no comfortable position for nicky tonight hed probably send his monster after me itd cut me up and gut me like its done to the others his minion slaughtered all the witches or psychics and skinned the mundanes thats it isnt it if youre so smart you dont need to ask me you have all the answers not all of them i said i touched the bed rail that he was cuffed to wrapped my hands around it on either side of the cuff so he couldnt slide it without hitting one of my hands ive seen the bodies nicky its a bad way to go but there are worse things he gave a harsh laugh being gutted alive doesnt get much worse than that he said i took the sunglasses off and let him see the eyes he stopped breathing for a heartbeat he just stared up at me eyes growing wide breath trapped in his throat i touched his hand and he screamed dont touch me dont you fucking touch me he was jerking on the handcuff frantically over and over as if that would help ramirez came to stand on the other side of the bed across from me he looked a question at me i didnt hurt him hernando get her the fuck away from me tell us where the monster is and ill send her out of the room nicky looked from one to the other of us and the fear showed on his face now you didnt have to have vampire vision to see it you cant do this to me youre the cops were not doing anything to you ramirez said nickys eyes flicked back to me youre the cops you can execute me but you cant torture me thats the law youre right nicky the police arent allowed to torture prisoners i leaned in close and whispered but im not the police he started tugging on the chain again rattling it up and down the bar get her away from me now i want a lawyer i want a fucking lawyer ramirez turned to the two uniformed cops waiting by the door go call mr baco a lawyer the two cops looked at each other both of us one asked ramirez nodded yeah both of you they exchanged another look and went for the door the taller one asked how long you think this phone call should take a while and knock before you come back in the uniforms left and it was just edward ramirez nicky and me nicky was staring up at ramirez youre a good cop ramirez ive never heard any dirt on you you wont let her hurt me youre a good guy you wont let her hurt me his voice was high and frantic but each time he said it he seemed more sure of himself more certain that ramirezs goodness would be his shield he was probably right on one thing ramirez wouldnt let me hurt him but i was willing to bet that ramirez would let me scare him i reached out like id stroke nickys face he jerked back out of reach ramirez shit please dont let her touch me ill be over there if you need me anita he walked away from the bed and went to sit in a chair at the end of the room near edward nicky screamed after him ramirez please please i touched his mouth with fingertips and he froze under that gentle touch his eyes moved slowly so slowly until he was looking up into mine shhh i said and lowered my face towards his as if id kiss his forehead he opened his mouth drew a breath and shrieked i grabbed his face between my hands the way id seen pinotl do but i knew that it didnt have to be the hands i could suck him dry with a kiss shut up nicky shut up he started to cry please oh god please dont did the werewolves beg like this i asked did they nicky i pressed my hands into his face until the skin puckered yes he said voice squeezed by how tight i was holding his face i had to force myself to release his face or i was going to leave red marks couldnt mark him up couldnt give marks a reason to punish ramirez i leaned my arms on the bed rail that he was chained to he pulled his hand to the length of the chain but didnt struggle he watched me the way mice watch cats when they know theres no way out i leaned towards him it was a very casual movement but it put my face close to his not close enough to touch but close enough that he got an up close look at the eyes you see nicky there are worse things you need me to bring the others back you do me and i cant give them back their lives you see nicky i dont need you anymore i know how to bring them back all by myself i leaned over balancing on tiptoe and my arms on the rail leaning in as if to whisper in his ear your services are no longer needed please he whispered i spoke with my mouth so close to his face that i could feel my breath coming back from his skin in a warm pulse the doctors will certify you dead nicky theyll bury you in a box somewhere and youll hear every shovel full of dirt as it hits the coffin lid youll lie there in the dark and scream in your head and no one will hear you maybe well have to put a jade bead in your mouth and sew it shut to make you lie still tears trailed from his eyes but his face was blank as if he didnt know he was crying tell them where your master is nicky or i swear i will do worse than kill you i kissed him on the forehead very gently he whimpered i kissed the tip of his nose the way you do with children i hovered over his mouth tell them nicky i lowered my mouth over his our lips brushed and he turned his head ill tell you ill tell you anything you want to know i moved away from the bed and let ramirez move up to take his turn a phone rang and edward pulled his cell phone from his back pocket he opened the door and went into the hall to take the call ramirezs voice was not happy what do you mean you cant tell me how to get there he had his notebook open his pen poised and nothing written down i started to walk back toward the bed nicky held his hands up as if to ward me off i swear to you that i can take you to it but i cant give you directions and be sure youll find it i dont want to send you out into the dark and have you not find it youd blame me and it wouldnt be my fault ramirez looked at me i nodded he was too scared to lie and it was too stupid a story to be made up i can take you to it if im there i can take you to it of course if youre there you can warn your master i said i wouldnt do that but i saw the change in his skin color the rise in breathing the flick of his eyes liar i said all right but id be a fool not to try and get away theyre going to kill me anita why shouldnt i try to get away i guess i couldnt blame him on that one call leonora evans shes a witch have her ward him make sure that he cant contact his master by anything other than yelling and the yelling ramirez said gag him when the time comes i said you trust leonora evans to do this she saved my life so i guess i do ramirez nodded okay ill call her in he looked at the traction ropes the doctors arent going to want him going anywhere tonight talk to them hernando explain whats at stake besides what good does it do to heal him if youre just going to turn around and execute him ramirez looked at me that was harsh yeah it was but its still true edward knocked and came in the door just far enough to say i need you out here i glanced at ramirez i think we can take it from here thank you he said my pleasure i slipped the sunglasses back on as i followed edward out into the hall the moment i looked at edwards face i knew something bad had happened he didnt show it the way a normal person would but it was there the tightness around his eyes the way he held himself carefully as if he were afraid to move too suddenly or hed break i dont think id have seen it without the vampire vision whats wrong i stepped in close because something told me this was not for police consumption with edward it so seldom was he took me by the arm down the hallway further away from the uniforms that were staring our way riker has donnas kids his grip tightened and i didnt tell him it hurt he has peter and becca hes going to kill them if i dont bring you to him now he knows were at the hospital hes given me an hour to make the drive then he starts torturing them if im not there in two hours hell kill them if i bring the police in hell kill them i touched his arm if it had been almost any other friend id have hugged him is donna okay he seemed to realize he was digging into my arm and let me go this is donnas night at her group i dont know if the babysitters still alive but donna wont even be home for two maybe three hours she doesnt know lets go i said we turned and started walking down the hallway ramirez yelled behind us where are you two going i thought youd want to be in on it personal emergency edward said and kept walking i turned around walking backwards trying to talk at the same time in two hours call teds house the call will be forwarded to his cell phone well join you on the monster hunt why two hours he asked the emergency will be taken care of by then i said i had to touch edwards arm to keep walking backwards and not fall everything could be over two hours from now ramirez said im sorry edward was at the doors that led into the next section of hallway he pulled me through the doors shut behind us he was already punching numbers on the cell phone ill have olaf and bernardo meet us at the turnoff to rikers place i dont know which of them answered but he gave a long list of things to bring and he made them write it down we were out of the hospital through the parking lot and getting into his hummer before he clicked the telephone off edward drove and all i had to do was think not a good thing i was remembering last may when some bad guys kidnapped richards mother and younger brother theyd sent us a box with a lock of his brothers hair and his mothers finger in it everyone that had touched them was dead everyone that had hurt them would never hurt anyone again i only had two regrets one that i hadnt gotten there in time to save them from being tortured two that the bad guys hadnt suffered enough before they died if riker hurt peter and becca i wasnt sure i wanted to see what edward would do to him i prayed as we rode through the darkness please god dont let them be hurt let them be safe riker could be lying they could already be dead but i didnt think so maybe because i needed them to be alive i remembered becca in her sunflower dress with that sprig of lilacs in her hair laughing in edwards arms i saw peters sullen resentment when edward and his mother touched i remembered the way peter had stood up to russell in the restaurant when he threatened becca he was a brave kid i tried not to think about what could be happening to them right this second edward had gone very very quiet when i looked at him the dark crystal vision showed me further into him than id ever seen before i didnt have to guess whether he cared for the children i could see it he loved them as much as he was capable of it he loved them if someone hurt them his vengeance was going to be a thing of great and awesome terror i wouldnt be able to stop him no matter what he wanted to do to them all i would be able to do was stand and watch and try not to get too much blood on my shoes it was a dark night it didnt seem to be cloudy just dark as if something besides clouds was blocking the moon or maybe that was just my frame of mind the one thing id wanted to avoid while i was doing my favor for edward was dealing with edward at his most illegal wed picked up olaf and bernardo at a crossroads in the middle of nowhere with those empty rolling hills stretching out and out into the darkness there had been no cover except some scrub bushes and when edward stopped the car and cut the engine i thought wed have a wait ahead of us get out well need to suit up hed gotten out without waiting to see if i was getting out or not i got out the silence seemed as big as the sky overhead an immense emptiness a man stood up not five feet in front of me i had the browning pointed before the man held a flashlight under his face and i realized it was bernardo olaf had magically appeared on the other side of the road there was no ditch on either side of the road there was nothing on the side of the road what was even more impressive was that they began lifting large black bags of equipment out of that same nowhere if wed had the time id have asked how they did it though i doubt id have understood the answer training probably training i didnt have though it might be nice to get it of course most of the things i hid from could have heard bernardos and olafs heartbeat no matter how well hidden they were it was almost a relief to be up against mere humans it meant you could at least hide in the dark twenty minutes later we were on the road again and edward hadnt been joking on the suiting up part id had to strip to my bra and put on a kevlar vest it was my size which meant it had to be a special purchase because kevlar doesnt come in my size off the rack its your prize for spotting all the weapons edward said he always knows just what to buy me i needed to adjust the shoulder holster after putting on the vest but i was told to do it in the car i didnt argue we had less than ten minutes to get to rikers place my tshirt didnt quite fit over the body armor i mean it did fit but not well bernardo handed me a black longsleeved mans shirt put it on over the tshirt button it up part way after youve got your holsters adjusted the shoulder holster was just a matter of readjusting straps the inner pants holster just didnt work once the vest was on i put the firestar down the front of my jeans and angled it until i was as happy as i was going to get with the way it fit it still dug into my stomach but i wanted it where i could get it fast i could live with bruises tomorrow i practiced drawing the browning through the half open shirt a few times though its hard to practice drawing from a sitting position but we didnt have time for me to get out and practice standing you guys are making me nervous putting me in kevlar you didnt argue bernardo said we dont have time to argue tell me what to do ill do it but why the kevlar olaf edward said riker employs twenty men ten are just hired muscle weve met half of them already but hes got ten that he keeps close to him three exseals two exarmy rangers one expolice and four guys who have black files which means whatever they do or did its top secret and maybe rogue i remembered what fbi agent bradford had said about olaf that he had a black file isnt this a little too commando raidish for a pot hunter olaf continued like i hadnt said anything bernardo started showing me the contents of a large leather purse at the same time i listened to olaf and watched bernardo riker has connections in south america that supply him with contraband suspicions are that hes running more than just artifacts maybe drugs the locals have no idea how big a bad guy theyve got here when did you find all this out after they came to the house edward said how did you find all this out i asked if we told you wed have to kill you olaf said i started to smile thinking it was a joke but i caught a glimpse of his face as the only car wed seen passed by flashing lights over us as it passed he didnt look like he was joking bernardo said this looks like a can of hair spray you can even squirt out a small amount of cresol he demonstrated but lift here he did and revealed a second layer of metal this is the pin this is the depressor its an incendiary grenade you pull the pin let up on the depressor and you have three seconds to get a minimum of fifty feet away from it its got white phosphorus in it this shit burns under water if you get a tiny piece on your sleeve it will eat through the cloth your skin bone all the way to the other side he clicked the secret compartment shut and handed it to me damned heavy for hairspray i said yeah but how many exnavy whatevers are going to notice he had a point next was a small thing of breath freshener that was really heavyduty mace a key ring that when you hit the button on it a fourinch blade popped out there was a heavy ink pen that actually wrote that if you pressed the little switch a sixinch blade came out the end there was real perfume with a higher than normal alcohol content go for the eyes was the advice a disposable lighter because you never know when you might need some fire and a package of cigarettes to explain the lighter there was a transmitter in the collar of the black shirt that would allow them to find me inside the buildings or at least find the shirt i was beginning to feel like id been shanghaied into a james bond movie i lifted out a hairbrush with a heavier than normal handle whats this its a hairbrush bernardo said oh i looked at edward the only thing hed changed was putting a white kevlar vest under his undershirt and white shirt he was even still wearing his cowboy hat olaf and bernardo were both dressed in commando black and backpacks that looked full they were bristling with weapons blacked so they didnt show up at night but not hidden i take it that the guys here arent going in the front door with us i said no edward said he hit the brakes and olaf and bernardo slipped out of the car and into the darkness because i knew what i was looking for i could see them in a running crouch going over the hill but if you hadnt been looking youd have missed them youre scaring me edward im not like a commando raid james bond kind of girl where the hell did you get a hairspray grenade a lot of female secret service now its a prototype nice to know where my tax dollars are going we were going down a long gravel driveway there was a big house sitting up on a hill lights blazed out of the windows as if someone had gone through and hit every light as if they were scared of the dark if riker really thought the monsters were coming the analogy was accurate edward outlined his plan as we drove the last few yards i was to pretend to do a spell of protection for riker while i delayed olaf and bernardo would try to find the kids if they couldnt find them or couldnt get them out olaf was supposed to find a man and kill him as messily as possible in a short space of time leave the body where it would be found and hope to make riker think the monsters had already gotten inside they might take us to the point where the monster kill had been found to get my expert advice which would put us and whoever was with us hopefully riker near where olaf and bernardo could help us kill them if that failed bernardo would start blowing things up which would create panic and hopefully allow us to find the kids unless bernardo decided the structure wasnt sturdy enough to blow up and not cave in around us then wed need another plan edward stopped the car at a gravel turnaround near the crest of the hill men armed with automatic submachine guns walked towards the car none of them were harold or russell they moved like olaf and edward moved like predators you dont believe theyre going to give back the kids do you do you he asked hed put his hands on the steering wheel at ten and two in plain sight i raised my hands in the air where they could be seen no i said if the kids are okay well do as little killing as possible but if the kids arent okay its zero survivors the police are going to find out about this one edward you will blow your ted good ol boy forrester image all to hell if the kids dont make it out i dont give a damn how will olaf and bernardo know whether to kill or not theres a wire worked into my vest theyve both got ear pieces so theyll be able to hear youre going to tell them to kill i said if i have to the machineguntoting men were at either side of the car they made motions for us to get out we did what they wanted being sure to keep our hands in sight we wouldnt want any misunderstandings the machine gun guy on my side wasnt that tall five foot eight or maybe shorter but his arms were corded with so much muscle that veins stood out against his skin like snakes some people vein up if they lift even a little but most of the time you dont get that much popping up without some major effort it was as if he was trying to make up for the lack of height by being obscenely strong most musclebound guys are slow and rarely know how to fight they rely on sheer strength and just being a bully but this one moved smoothly almost gliding on his feet sort of sideways which hinted at some martial art training he moved well and his bicep was bigger than my neck he was also pointing a very modern looking submachine gun at me muscle bound trained fighter and better armed than me werent there rules against that lean on the hood assume the position he said i put my hands on the hood and leaned the engine was still warm not hot but warm muscle man kicked my legs further apart i did what he asked i looked across the hood and met edwards eyes he was getting the same treatment on his side from a taller slender man who wore silver frame glasses edwards eyes were at their empty pitiless best but somehow i knew he wasnt pleased when i realized that i realized i still had the sunglasses on and my vision was still good through dark lenses at night funny how neither olaf nor bernardo had asked in the car there hadnt been time for many questions the vampire vision had toned down but it was still there or id have been night blind with the glasses on wondered what muscle man would think of the eyes he kicked my right leg again hard enough that it hurt i said lean he had that drill sergeant voice going if i lean any further ill be lying down i felt him move behind me and had my head turned to the side when he slapped me in the back of the head hard enough that my cheek hit the hood it would have hurt if it had been the front nose mouth hed meant it to hurt do what youre told and you wont get hurt i was beginning not to believe him but i leaned cheek pressed to the hood arms out flat like i was being nailed down feet spread so far that one good foot sweep would have dumped me to the ground but it was nice and unsteady the way he wanted it apparently in a way it was flattering he was treating me as a dangerous person a lot of bad guys dont usually they live to regret it but not always if muscle man died tonight it wasnt going to be because of carelessness he searched me top to bottom even running his fingers through my hair hed have found bernardos stiletto hairpins that the others had missed at the house he took the sunglasses off and looked at them as if looking for things that i would never have thought to find in a pair of sunglasses he didnt really look at my face didnt catch the eyes or maybe they werent glowing black anymore muscle man found everything but the transmitter that was sewn somewhere in the shirt and the contents of the purse he did dump it out on the ground and shine a flashlight on every item he made sure the ink pen wrote that the hairspray sprayed and took the breath freshener mace as if he recognized it on sight but that was all he took out of the purse though once it was empty he kneaded it with his left hand the right still holding the submachine gun this wouldnt be one of those with a compartment for a gun would it id raised my head enough to watch him empty the purse so we could look at each other while he held the gun on me and glanced down at things no it wouldnt be i was betting it would be he said nope i said he finished by standing on the purse and stomping it flat glad it wasnt really my purse i guess theres no gun he said told ya he took three big steps back out of reach he was treating me like i was dangerous darn i sometimes counted on passing for harmless but i guess id been packing too much hardware to pass for anything but dangerous you can stand up i stood up he tossed the sunglasses to me i caught them my eyes were in the light from the house now but he never flinched apparently the glowy stuff had faded he motioned with the gun for me to pick up the contents of the purse i put everything back inside and almost put the sunglasses in but decided to put them back on two reasons one when the night got too dark to wear them id know the vampire stuff had left me completely two knowing edward they were probably expensive and i didnt want to get them scratched up he motioned with the gun and said just walk slow straight to the house and itll be all right why dont i believe you i asked he looked at me with eyes as dead and empty as a dolls i dont like smart mouths youll have to wait until i do the spell before you can shoot me i said so they tell me get moving the slender guy with glasses who had edward at gunpoint was waiting for muscle man to get me moving when i started walking glasses moved edward forward they kept us walking side by side telling us to stay together they kept us together so that if they had to start shooting they could kill us both with one spray of bullets true professionals i hoped olaf and bernardo were as good as they were supposed to be if they werent we were in deep trouble the house was one of those nouveau architect homes that people with more money than taste are always hiring people to build it looked like a giant had dumped white concrete in a free form slide putting windows and doors here and there like raisins in an oatmeal cookie a nice surprise but never where you expect to find them the mismatched windows made the house look deformed the door was off center but round like a wide open mouth the windows were not only round and mismatched but the number of windows didnt seem to match the floor plan as if some of the windows looked into blank walls where no room could possibly be white steps led up to the round door like one of those cartoon tongues that spill out of mouths and go tumbling downstairs the steps werent wide enough for us to walk side by side so edward moved a couple of steps ahead neither of the men behind us protested so we kept moving it had been so long since i carried a purse instead of a fanny pack that it felt awkward on my shoulder i had to keep a hand on it to keep it from swinging around id put it on the left shoulder leaving my right hand uncompromised out of habit not that i had anything left to draw or pull or whatever but it was always good to have your strong hand empty just in case so edward and dolph had always told me at the top of the porch in a spill of bright yellow light they told us to stop we stopped they moved up to flank us and move a little back to either side i didnt understand what they were doing at first until the door opened and another man pointed the same kind of submachine gun at us muscle man and glasses had moved out of his line of fire and moved so they wouldnt catch him in their fire line it is not easy to use three submachine guns in that small a space without crossing your own men but they made it look easy very smooth the other men had carried an extra clip for the sub guns in a thigh holster but this one had two clips at his waist the man in the door was african american and tall like olafs height very six foot plus he was also completely bald just like olaf if they ever met theyd look like light and dark versions of each other what took so long he asked his voice matched the body deep they were carrying a lot of hardware muscle man said the new guy was smirking at me from the way russell talked i expected you to look like amanda youre just a little bitch amanda the amazon that came to teds house i asked he nodded i shrugged i wouldnt believe much that russell said he said you broke his nose kicked him in the balls and beat his head in with a piece of wood everything but the last bit if id beaten his head in hed be dead whats the hold up simon muscle man asked deuce is having some trouble locating the wand deuce would have trouble keeping track of his head if it wasnt attached muscle man said true but we still wait he was looking at both of us the gun held easily in his big hands whats with the sunglasses bitch i let the name calling go they had all the guns they look cool i said he laughed then a warm growly sound a nice laugh if he hadnt been armed what about you ted i hear you are a bad dude edward transformed into ted like a magician deciding he was going to have to perform after all im a bounty hunter i kill monsters simon looked at him and there was something about the way he did it that said the ted act wasnt fooling him van cleef recognized your picture undertaker undertaker ted smiled and shook his head i dont know anybody named van cleef simon just looked at glasses edward had time to turn his head so he took the blow on his shoulder he moved a step but didnt fall simon gave another look glasses hit his knee and edward collapsed onto one knee we only need the girl up and running simon said so ill ask you this just once do you know van cleef i stood there not sure what to do we were so totally covered by the guns and the priority had to be getting the children out so no heroics until they were safe if we died i wasnt a hundred percent sure that bernardo and olaf would risk their lives to get them out so i stood there and looked at edward kneeling on the porch waiting for him to give me some kind of sign what i was supposed to do edward looked up at simon yes yes what asshole yes i know van cleef simon smiled broadly obviously happy with himself boys this is the undertaker the man that still has the highest body count of anyone van cleef ever trained i felt rather than saw the two men twitch the information not only made sense to them but it scared them it made them afraid of edward who the hell was van cleef and when had he trained edward and for what i wanted to know the answers but not badly enough to ask later if we survived id ask edward maybe hed even tell me i dont know you edward said i came in just after you left simon said simon edward made the name a question and the big man seemed to understand what was being asked as in whatever the fuck simon says you damn well better do how colorful i thought but didnt say out loud can i get up now edward asked if you can stand then help yourself edward got to his feet if it hurt it didnt show his face was empty eyes like bits of pale blue ice id seen him kill with that face simons smile faltered around the edges youre supposed to be one mean son of a bitch van cleef never said i was mean he sounded very sure of that simons smile disappeared altogether no he didnt he said you were dangerous what would van cleef say about you edward asked same thing simon said i doubt that edward said they looked at each other and there was a weight and a testing like something nearly visible in the air between them muscle mans nerve broke first where the hell is deuce with the wand simon blinked and switched very cold brown eyes to the man behind me shut up mickey mickey it didnt have quite the ring to it that the other nicknames did of course simon hadnt sounded too tough until it was explained van cleef didnt recognize her picture no reason he should edward said the newspapers call her the executioner thats what the vampires call her why do they call her that why do you think simon looked at me how many vampire kills you got bitch if i had a chance tonight i was going to teach simon some manners but not right now i dont know exactly guess i thought about it i stopped keeping track around thirty simon laughed hell every man on this porch has more kills than that more kills than thirty who the hell were these guys i shrugged i didnt know it was a competition did you count the human kills edward asked i shook my head he asked about vampire kills not human add those in he said that was harder eleven twelve maybe fortythree simon said you got mickey beat but not rooster apparently rooster was glasses add in the shapeshifters edward said it had turned into a competition i wasnt really sure that i wanted to seem as dangerous as i really was but i trusted edwards judgment oh hell edward i dont know i started counting in my head finally i said seven so fifty he said just hearing it out loud made me want to cringe it sounded so psychosrus ive still got you beat bitch simon said he was beginning to get on my nerves the fifty only counts the people i did personally with a weapon you mean it doesnt count the ones you killed barehanded he smiled when he said it like he didnt believe it no i counted those the smile got positively condescending then what didnt you count little bitch witches necromancers things like that why not count them this from mickey i shrugged because using magic to kill is an automatic death sentence edward said i frowned at him i never said anything about magic we arent friends simon said but you can be honest tonight bitch we wont tell the cops will we boys he laughed and they laughed with him with that same sort of nervous mirth that itzpapalotls vampires had had like they were afraid not to laugh i shrugged most of the fifty are sanctioned kills the cops already know about them you ever been on trial this from the until now silent rooster no fifty legal kills simon said give or take i said simon looked at edward they had another one of those weighted staring contests would van cleef like her yes but she wouldnt like him why not shes not big on orders and listening to people just because theyve got an extra stripe on their shoulder not disciplined simon said shes disciplined you just got to have more than rank to get her to listen to you she listens to you simon said she didnt want to talk about her kills but she took your lead his saying that meant simon was very observant too observant for comfort actually id underestimated him stupid of me no not stupid careless another man came up with the identical gun in his hands he was just shy of six foot but seemed smaller delicate somehow the hair was a deep brown cut short curly the face was pretty in a girlish kind of way his skin was that dark tan that isnt really tan at all he had a set of small headphones around his neck with wires connecting them to a metal box and a small flat wand attached with a cord to the box it had to be deuce and the wand i didnt know what it was but edward went very still he knew what it was and he didnt like it not a good sign where the fuck have you been mickey said mickey simon said and he said mickey the way that edward could say olaf and get perfect obedience there was no more comment from the backup players simon looked at deuce do it deuce slipped the headphones on hit a switch and some knobs on the box and a light went on on the box he got a distracted inward look on his face as if he were listening to things we couldnt hear he started at edwards hat and worked down hesitated over the chest area then continued the sweep he knelt on the ground beside edward and waved the wand up the backside of edward he was careful to stay out of the line of fire of all three guns his own gun was on a sling that he pushed far behind his back keeping it out of the way with a wellplaced elbow as he moved he stood slipped the headphones off and unplugged them from the box listen to this he waved the wand over edwards chest it beeped frantically take off the shirt simon said edward didnt argue he unbuttoned the shirt and handed it to deuce who waved the wand over it the thing stayed silent deuce waved the wand over edwards chest again and the wand beeped he ran the wand over the shirt in his hand no noise deuce shook his head the undershirt simon said edward had to take his hat off he handed it to me then lifted the undershirt over his head the kevlar looked very artificial and white he handed the undershirt to deuce and we went through the same routine again take the vest off simon said tell me one thing first edward asked are the kids all right why the fuck do you care about some bitchs kids edward just looked at him but there was something in that look that made simon take a step back he noticed what hed done and took the step back pointing the gun very solidly at edwards chest take off the damn vest its too hot for body armor anyway edward said it seemed an odd thing to say for edward man of few words but you had to know edward to know it was odd i had the feeling that edward had just put the word out for zero survivors he undid the velcro slipped it over his head and handed it to deuce edward stood there naked from the waist up he looked fragile beside the musclebound mickey or the very tall simon but they saw in him what i saw in him because unarmed and halfnaked they were still scared of him it was there in the way simon reacted to him the way the others except deuce kept their distance deuce didnt seem to be working on the same instincts as the rest though he never once crossed the fire line he made edward stretch out his hand or he knelt under the direct line of fire none of them were careless it wasnt a good sign he ran the wand over the vest when the wand beeped he handed it to simon then he ran the wand over edwards bare chest silence good because i think simon would have said skin in the same voice hed said shirt undershirt vest just because edward made him nervous didnt mean he wasnt scary all of his own in the body armor thats good simon said most people even if they have you strip dont check the armor edward just looked at him her next deuce duckwalked in front of us just in case someone started shooting he was safe no one shot anyone of course the night was young he stood on the other side of me he didnt bother to put the earphones back on just ran the wand over me it beeped hand the hat back to him please please refreshing after hearing myself called bitch about a dozen times my pleasure i said and handed edwards hat back to him deuce had looked up when i spoke as if he wasnt used to politeness in others either the wand ran over me and it beeped at chest level take the shirt off bitch simon said i untucked the shirt and started unbuttoning it my names anita not bitch like i give a fuck he said fine id tried being nice i handed the shirt to deuce and his magic wand it beeped but when he ran it back over me nothing he laid the box gently on the ground the wand on top of it and started looking at the shirt in less than a minute hed found a small wire with a slightly thicker head sewn into the collar of the shirt looks like a transmitter maybe a homing beacon simon tossed the vest to deuce cut it open find out whats inside deuce pulled a gravity knife from his back pocket did one of those quick wrist movements that spilled the blade open he went over the vest with his hands first eyes closed then he started cutting it was a longer wire with a little box attached its a receiver someone out there is hearing everything we say destroy the homer deuce crushed mine under his heel when it was a little metallic and plastic slimy place on the porch he smiled up at us as if hed done a good thing deuce was a few bricks shy of a load funny how many people that edward introduced me to were whos out there undertaker simon asked edward had put his hat back on it looked funny with the shirt gone but he seemed perfectly at ease if he was nervous you couldnt tell it i am going to ask you this one more time nice then it wont be so nice he seemed to square his shoulders as if he were the one about to take a beating who was on the other end of this wire whos out there edward shook his head simon nodded rooster hit him in the back and it must have been hard because it drove him to his knees something on the butt of the gun broke the skin in two small cuts he stayed on all fours for a few seconds as if it had stunned him then he got up on his feet and faced simon answer the question undertaker edward shook his head again he was ready for the next blow it staggered him but he didnt go down there was a third small cut the cuts werent anything but they showed how much force was being used he was going to be bruised all to hell come morning maybe she knows mickey said i dont know who they are i said and the lie fell smoothly off my tongue edward said we needed backup he found some youd come into a situation like this with unknown people at your back you dont seem that stupid simon said edward vouched for them i said and you trust him i nodded you trust him with your life yes i said simon looked at me then back to edward she your squeeze edward blinked and i knew that was him trying to buy time to think what answer would be the least painful no im not sure i believe you either of you but if we start beating up the bitch and she gets too hurt to do the spell rikerd be pissed why dont you have undertaker ask the backup to come in deuce said everyone sort of froze then looked at him simon said what did you say if they can hear us why not have him ask them to come up hands up that sort of thing simon nodded then turned hack to edward tell them to come up to the house hands where we can see them they wont come edward said theyll come or well blow your fucking head off simon put the shortbutted gun to his shoulder and put the barrel against edwards forehead ask them to come into the house hands up throw their guns down it was funny how simon had never once thought it might be the police out there as if he didnt believe the undertaker would bring the police to the party edward stared down the barrel of that gun looked past it into simons eyes and the look was his usual look his eyes were cold and empty as winter skies there was no fear there was no anything it was like he wasnt there at all edward may have been calm but i wasnt id seen enough bad men to know that simon meant it more than that he wanted to do it hed feel safer if edward were dead i was out of ideas but i couldnt just stand here and watch it happen tell them undertaker or i will blow your head all over this porch even if i asked they wouldnt come simon pressed the barrel in so that edward had to brace his feet against it to keep from being pushed backwards you better hope they come we dont need you alive just her i need him alive i said simons eyes flicked to me then settled back on edward lying bitch are you a witch simon i asked though i knew the answer id have spotted it if he had been a practitioner what the fuck does that matter then you dont know what i need to do this spell do you your boss would be pissed if you blew away someone i needed to keep him safe from the monsters why do you need him deuce asked i swallowed and tried to think nothing good was coming i tried for truth when im out of other options it still works riker said he wouldnt hurt the kids he said he wouldnt hurt us he said he just wanted me to save him from the monster if you blow teds brains into the next county then im not going to believe any of rikers other promises the second i think that riker is going to kill the kids and us once i do the job then i dont have any incentive to help him simons eyes flicked to me again we can give you incentive i didnt see him nod but i felt mickey moving behind me ive never been good at taking a blow i moved without thinking and he missed my shoulder but id been right he knew how to fight i was turning towards him to do what im not sure when the butt of the gun caught me on the chin i think id made him mad by ducking because he hit me hard the next thing i knew i was on the ground looking up deuce was kneeling by me stroking my face i had the impression hed been petting me for awhile as if id passed out i didnt remember passing out the sunglasses were gone i didnt know if deuce took them off or if they flew off when my head went back shes awake deuce said voice sort of dreamy he gave me a gentle smile and kept stroking my face simon knelt by me blocking out the light whats your name anita anita blake how many fingers i watched his hand move back and forth following it with my eyes two can you sit up it was a good question with help maybe deuce put his arm behind my back and lifted me i let him take a lot of the weight not because it was necessary but because them thinking i was more hurt than i was might make them think i was less of a threat we needed some sort of edge i rested against deuces shoulder he was humming something tuneless under his breath his hand cupping my face stroking the skin over and over i was finally able to see everything edward was on his knees with his hands clasped on top of his cowboy hat rooster had a gun touching his head edward didnt look hurt more like theyd done it to keep him from doing anything heroic mickey had a bloody lip he was carefully not making eye contact with anyone can you stand simon asked with help yeah deuce deuce helped me to my feet and the world wavered i clung to deuce hands digging in as the world tried to slide out my ear maybe i wasnt pretending to be hurt shit simon said can you walk if deuce helps you i started to nod and that made me nauseated i had to breathe through it before i could answer him i think so good lets go he backed into the house eyes watching the darkness beyond though with all the lights his night vision was probably shit deuce and i went next he had edwards wire hung around his neck like a doctors stethoscope edward was next hands still firmly on top of his head rooster then mickey bringing up the rear they staggered us so that if someone started shooting there was room to maneuver simon started up a flight of stairs i looked up the long flight and the world swam deuce called simon im not sure shes up to stairs mickey the man in question moved up to the foot of the stairs carry her i dont want him touching me i said i didnt ask you either of you simon said mickey gave his gun to simon then took my arm he pulled me too fast and i was suddenly airborne on his shoulder my head hanging down i couldnt breathe the world was spinning and i was going to be sick im going to throw up he dumped me unceremoniously back to my feet and i fell it was simon who caught me are you too hurt to do the spell i knew the answer to that one no because if riker thought i couldnt help him he would kill us all i can do it if mickey here doesnt dangle me over his shoulder with my head hanging down i need to stay upright or its not going to get any better carry her in your arms not over your shoulders simon said all those muscles got to be good for something mickey picked me up in his arms like youd carry a small child he stood there like i weighed nothing he was strong but carrying like this is harder than it looks wed see how he did if there was more than one floor to climb heres hoping he didnt drop me i put my arm around his shoulders id have clasped hands around his neck to be more secure but i couldnt reach around his deltoids without straining how much do you bench press threeninety im impressed i said he preened a little mickey was dangerous but if i could keep him from hitting me he was the weak one rooster followed orders too well simon was simon deuce seemed harmless but there was something in those dreamy eyes that was a little scary maybe i was wrong but id try mickey before i tried deuce for trickery anyway arm wrestling id take deuce mickey walked up the stairs with me in his arms effortlessly i could feel the muscles in his legs pushing working again i had the sense of immense physical potential and quickness whats mickey mean i asked nothing simon explained his nickname im just wanting to know what yours means deuce answered its for mickey mouse shut up deuce hes got a tattoo of mickey on his butt deuce said as if mickey hadnt spoken mickeys face darkened and he turned to glare at the other man i just fought to keep my face blank what kind of moron would have mickey mouse tattooed on his butt but not out loud not with those tree trunk arms wrapped around my tender body if i hadnt had the marks on me hed have probably killed me with that one blow no i didnt want mickey angry with me there was a landing and a second flight of stairs mickey didnt even hesitate on the landing he just went for the next set of stairs his legs moved as easily up the second set as the first he never paused to catch his breath in fact his breathing barely sped up whatever you could complain about mickey being out of shape wasnt part of it i told him so how far you jog a day five miles every other day howd you know a lot of body builders would be having trouble by now they neglect the aerobic stuff but you move like some kind of welloiled machine youre not even breathing hard there was something very intimate about being carried in someones arms like this a reminder of childhood and your parents arms maybe mickeys hands tightened on me the one on my thigh began to massage my leg i didnt tell him not to its been my experience that if a man is interested in having sex with you they hesitate to kill you before theyve had the sex this rule is not always true but more often than not the trick is to get the man thinking more about sex than violence so hes a little confused we needed a little confusion among our enemies right now we were in a wide white hallway that ran the length of the top of the house there were white doors with silver knobs nothing differentiated one door from the other simon went to the furthest door and mickey followed with me in tow i could see deuce following and edward just topping the last stairs with rooster behind him walking well back out of arms or legs length these guys were good id gotten to where i counted on the bad guys not being this good even if they were vampires and werewolves theyd be unprofessional but id never been around professional bad guys that were this professional it cut our options from bad to worse simon opened the door we were here we were still alive the night still had possibilities mickey sat me down near the middle of a very nice persian rug he kept an arm around my shoulder as if it had been his idea to carry me i gave his arm a squeeze before i stepped away from him didnt want to be slutty but wanted him hopeful in case it was useful the room looked like the study of a prosperous academic there were antique maps framed on the walls shelves lined almost every extra space of wall a lot of books that looked well read and well used there were books open on the big leathertopped desk with bookmarks in them and sticky notes covered in writing as if wed interrupted someones research a man sat behind the desk he was a big man both tall and wide not fat exactly but headed that way he rose from his chair with a smile and walked towards us hand outstretched he moved with a confident easy stride like an exathlete going soft with normal living his dark hair was cut very short and mostly bald on top his hands were big and the new weight showed in the hands where a college ring was beginning to cut into his flesh he had calluses on his hands like he wasnt afraid to do the real work himself but the calluses were losing that hard edge softening smoothing back into his skin hed probably done some of his dirty work once but no more he gripped my hand with both of his when one of his hands could have swallowed both of mine so glad youre here ms blake he said it like id been invited instead of blackmailed im glad one of us is glad im here i said the smile widened and he let my hand go i am sorry for our little theatrics simon called up and he thought mickey had broken your neck so happy that he exaggerated not by much mr riker are you feeling well enough to do the spell we could have some tea first let you rest i managed a smile i am grateful that were being all civilized and coffee would be great but where are the children his eyes flicked past me to edward he still had his hands clasped on top of his hat but at least they hadnt made him kneel again ah yes the children i didnt like the way he said it like it was going to be bad news where are they edward asked and rooster hit him in the back with the gun again it staggered him and he had to wait for it to pass before he straightened up his hands never left his head as if he knew they were looking for an excuse to hurt him again you promised us that they wouldnt be harmed i said you were late riker said no edward said dont i said as rooster raised his arm back for another blow he did it anyway fuck i turned back to riker every cruel thing you do helps convince me that you have no intention of any of us getting out of here alive i assure you ms blake that i intend to let you go what about the others he gave a small shrug and walked back behind his desk unfortunately my men think that mr forrester is too dangerous to be allowed to live i do regret that he sat down at his nice swivel chair elbows on the chair arms thick fingers steepled but he will serve a useful purpose before he dies if you are reluctant we will take it out on mr forrester since we intend to kill him anyway we can do anything we want to him and it doesnt really matter my stomach was a hard knot my pulse beating in my throat hard enough that i had to try twice to talk what about the kids do you really care im asking arent i he reached behind the desk and pressed something the rear walls of the room slid open revealing enough equipment to make nasa proud there were four blank tv screens but somehow i didnt think this was rikers new digital television system what the hell is all that for i asked that is not really your concern i have signaled for additional men to be brought up when they arrive then i will show you the children why the additional men i asked youll see he said we didnt have long to wait four men came through the door two i recognized harold of the scarred face and newt who id nearly made a soprano harold had a shotgun and newt his big nickelplated but it was the two men behind them that were the problem one was tall and planed down to nothing but muscle and dark burnished skin he didnt have mickeys bulk but he didnt need it he entered the room surrounded by a cloud of his own violent potential he set my lizard sense screaming as if it knew here was someone to avoid he had the same gun the other pros were carrying but hed added knives at his forearms his upper arms both hips and even hilts sticking up from behind his shoulders it was very primitive somehow and very effective if hed walked into a cell you might have dropped to your knees and begged for mercy the other one was just medium height medium brown hair cut short not too dark not too light not too anything he had a face that you wouldnt remember two seconds after you saw it because he was not handsome enough or ugly enough to stand out he was one of the most unmemorable people id ever seen and yet when his brown eyes swept over me met mine for a second i felt a jolt all the way down to my feet one flash and i knew that of the two men he would kill you quicker he had the same submachine gun the others had but paired with what looked like a mil automatic i didnt recognize the brand my hands arent big enough for a mil so i dont pay that much attention simon i want two men on both of our guests make it four on him simon said i bow to your expertise rooster made edward get on his knees simon made mickey go to edward i guess he didnt want to risk the muscle man hitting me again if they killed edward early they still had the kids to blackmail with simon sent the medium man to edward and simon himself took up a post by edward they thought he was a very dangerous man and they were right the nausea had been fading but all the preparations were making me nervous i was afraid of what we were going to see if they hadnt been afraid to show us they wouldnt have had four men on edward i was left with deuce and the knife guy harold and newt stayed near the door harold seemed nervous deuce touched my arm tracing the mound of scar tissue at my elbow what did it vampire he raised his shirt up and his stomach was a mass of white scars mortar round i wasnt sure what i was supposed to say but i was saved from the decision because the knife guy grabbed my arm and turned me to look at riker he kept his hand on my arm and since his hand completely encircled my upper arm it wasnt going to be easy to get away show time riker said he hit another switch and two of the monitors flickered to life black and white film of cells at first all i saw was russells back in one room and the amazon amandas back in the other room then my eyes saw legs sticking out from around the woman legs in jeans and jogging shoes ankles tied together too big for becca had to be peter shed stripped down to the waist and that broad muscular back made everyone in this room look frail except for mickey it was only the length of her hair that made me guess her she leaned forward revealing more of peters body shed pulled his jeans and underwear down to his knees she was playing with him i looked at the floor then back up she tried to kiss him and when he turned his head away she slapped him twice hard first one cheek then the other there was already blood on his mouth as if it wasnt the first time shed hit him she leaned back in for the kiss revealing small tight breasts to the camera she kissed him and this time he let her her hand never stopped working on his body i turned slowly to look at the other monitor please god please dont let russell be doing the same thing to becca he wasnt and i was grateful hed turned with her on his lap as if he knew he had an audience to play to now he cradled her like youd hold any small child but hed pinned one small arm and two of the fingers on the tiny hand were at a bad angle he broke a third finger while we watched and her mouth opened in a soundless scream shall we have sound riker asked becca was screaming high and piteous russell cradled her and murmured soothing things he stroked her hair and looked directly at the camera his nose was still packed and bandaged he knew we were there peters voice came high hed never sounded more like a little boy please dont please stop his arms were tied behind his back but he was still struggling she slapped him itll feel good i promise i looked at edward simon had the gun against his head the hat was on the ground the mediumlooking man had conjured a knife from somewhere and had it pressed to edwards throat a trickle of blood slid down his skin i met his eyes and i knew that everyone in this room everyone in this house was dead they just didnt know it yet edward started to say something but simon said no no talking from you or shooter will slit your throat the medium guy must be shooter the name didnt suit him he looked more like a tom dick or harry they wouldnt let edward talk so it was my play but we both knew where the game would end sudden death get them out of there riker the children he gave a questioning lilt to his voice order them to leave the kids alone now and if i dont i smiled then the monster is going to come in here and gut you his eyes flinched that bothered him good knowing what is happening to them should speed up the spell of protection i think if you dont stop it riker there wont be anything left to salvage i dont know i think the boy is enjoying himself from the sound of things id been trying not to hear but peters breath was coming faster and faster frantic but it wasnt the sound of pain he screamed dont please dont i looked and i wished i hadnt some sights cut through your mind leaving a scar behind that never really heals watching peter writhe caught between his first pleasure and the horror of it all was one of those sights i pride myself on never flinching if someone is being tortured i dont look away to look away only saves me pain not them if i cant save them the pain then i watch as a kind of respect and as a punishment for myself to remind me what happens to people when i fail them but i failed peter twice because i looked away just before a wordless scream tore form his mouth it wasnt the sound of pain i turned away and maybe i moved too fast for the head injury or maybe it was something else because the room swam in streamers of color i tried to go to my knees and the knife man jerked my arm kept me on my feet fine i threw up on him he jerked back actually let go of my arm i fell to my knees grateful to be low to the ground throwing up had brought a roaring headache rikers voice came through the next wave of nausea amanda russell be so good as to leave the children alone our ms blake is too squeamish to do her work while she fears for their safety i looked up at the monitors to make sure they actually left the rooms russell kissed becca on the head then left her huddled in the corner crying for her mommy amanda blindfolded peter while he begged her not to she whispered something in his ear that caused him to curl into a ball she left his pants down picked up her shirt from the floor and walked out i huddled into my own version of a ball on the floor i stayed on my knees while i tried to decide whether i was going to throw up again or not nausea like this is usually a sign of a concussion the headache was another but i think sheer nerves had pushed me over the edge i used to throw up at crime scenes quite a bit apparently there were still things i couldnt handle like child abuse dear god please give us some help here help us get them out of here safe there was a beeping and riker hit another button on his desk what is it weve got two dead down here they were fucking butchered riker went pale the monster knives some kind of fucking big knife youre sure of that riker asked you are positive yes sir it seems we have intruders he looked at simon what are you going to do about our company simon kill them sir then do it shooter rooster stay with him and kill him as soon as riker gives the word mickey youre with me he looked across at the two men by me you stay with her make sure no one else hits her harold newt come with me then they were gone and we were down to two bad guys a piece and riker it would never get better than this is there a bathroom i asked are you going to be ill again its a thought the two of you take her and deuce if you can come up with something creative that wont leave a mark or physically harm ms blake in any way but will convince her that the children and mr forrester are not the only ones that can be hurt do so perhaps you can show her your namesake youve got thirty minutes there arent a lot of things you can do to a person that fulfilled rikers requirements the ones i could think of were mostly sexual usually the talk of my impending rape upsets me but all i could think of now was that i had thirty minutes with two men who might want to fuck me more than kill me all i wanted to do was kill them it made my options easier but i said is there a reason for torturing me too or is it just a hobby he smiled pleasant confident i thought you would be worthy of my men but i find you weak ms blake weakness should be punished but it must be done carefully so you can still do the spell because i do want that isnt the line these things must be done delicately or you injure the spell deuce laughed riker frowned at me its from the wizard of oz deuce said the wicked witch of the west says it to dorothy take her away deuce he wrinkled his nose and clean yourself up blade youre welcome to help in the punishment but deuce is in charge i dont want her damaged deuce grabbed my arm almost gently and helped me to my feet the guy id thrown up on blade followed us by a few steps evidently he was taking no chances at the door a man appeared he was darkly hispanic with longish hair a shoulder holster complete with millimeter automatic he looked like local hired muscle but he wasnt he vibrated with power a shimmering energy flowed off of him psychic or maybe more ms blake meet our resident expert on the supernatural alario he was in charge of the protection spells on all my establishments his art failed him recently at one of my shops and my workers are dead you will succeed where he has failed alario watched me with cool dark eyes his power flared over mine as deuce led me past him we recognized each other as powers but there wasnt time for anything else but there would be later which was what i was afraid of alario was the real deal a practitioner of the arts hed figure out pretty quickly that i didnt know shit about spells of protection at least not the kind riker wanted deuce led me down the white hall with blade trailing us we were out of time i couldnt go back into that room and fake a spell olaf had failed to make his kills horrendous enough to fool the bad guys the only good thing hed done was divide their forces and i had to take advantage of that while it lasted which meant that if at all possible only one person was coming back from the bathroom hopefully it would be me it was one of those bathrooms with a double sink separate from the rest of the bathroom deuce led me into the little bathroom area complete with shower i managed to do some dry heaving but that was the best i could do and even that made my head ache it hurt so much i closed my eyes trying to keep my brains from leaking out through them if it wasnt a concussion it was a hell of an imitation deuce wet a washcloth and gave it to me thanks i put it over my face and tried to think so far deuce hadnt touched me blade was trying to clean up in the sink area but hed want the shower soon i loved the look on blades face when you puked on him it was priceless i put the wash rag to the back of my neck i was thinking furiously about what was in the purse and what options i had but my voice was calm point for me blade as in the comic book character he nodded yeah the vampire killer they both carry knives and theyre both african american i said yeah i looked into his face wash cloth that hed so kindly given me still on my neck i tried to read behind those pleasant slightly dreamy brown eyes but it was like trying to read edward i just couldnt read between the lines i think that blade actually used wooden knives and like a crossbow in the comic books i said deuce shrugged youre either very brave or you dont think ill hurt you i believe youll hurt me if you want to then youre brave he said he was leaning against the wall fingers playing lightly with the gun on its sling at his shoulder it was my turn to shrug yeah but its not really bravery thats keeping me calm he looked interested for the first time what is after what i saw being done to becca and peter i just cant get too excited about myself blade banged on the door we dont have all night and i want a shower deuce and i both jumped when he banged on the door we shared one of those embarrassed smiles then he opened the door and ushered me through blade had tried to scrub at his clothes in the sink but it hadnt helped he tried to go through the door and deuce stepped in his way riker wont like you taking a shower he told me to get cleaned up simon told us to keep two people on her we cant do that if youre in the shower blade looked at me i think simon overestimated her anyone that throws up after seeing mild torture like that im not afraid of now get out of my way deuce deuce moved to one side moving just ahead and to one side of him blade brushed past us without a word his anger trailing behind him like a loose coat he slammed the door behind him i went to the sink and rewet the wash cloth he was watching me in the mirror now his eyes were still pleasant but something else had crept in something that promised pain the way the wind can bring the smell of rain against your skin just before it starts to pour i started fishing in the purse ive got some breath stuff in here somewhere i could lock you in the room with blade he strips real pretty and hes not very happy with you right now my hand closed on the pen with its hidden blade you really think he could control himself enough to just rape me and not do other damage like you said hes not very happy with me you never asked about my nickname he said the conversation was moving too fast for me i assumed it was some kind of cardplaying thing he shook his head while i watched him in the mirror then he started unzipping his pants he was too far away to touch me or for me to fight back all i could do was wait for him to come to me he slipped inside his open fly and lifted himself out in a smooth practiced movement he was huge impressive even limp and soft if i hadnt seen bernardo earlier id have been more impressed of course you could never be a hundred percent sure how big a man got when he was erect some barely changed size some grew a lot maybe hed been very impressive then i realized he had a tattoo on it i had to turn and look rather than trust to the mirror am i supposed to run screaming or ask to touch it i wasnt even scared it was too bizarre which do you want to do i admit i was having a hard time looking at his face and not his penis because it was growing and i could see the tattoo more clearly cant rape the willing hey he smiled as if this approach had worked before with women it was certainly something a girl didnt get offered everyday i wont tell if you dont is that the two of hearts on your penis his smile widened didnt that hurt not as much as its going to deuce said he moved slowly towards me so i could get a good look he had a flair for theatrics did deuce i didnt want him using his flair or anything else on me i turned and stumbled on purpose he caught me as hed caught me all the other times i put the pen against his chest just under the sternum angled upward i was a vampire hunter if there was one thing i knew how to do it was to find the heart with the first blow i pressed the button the second i touched him there was no upward movement no feel of shoving the blade because the blade did its own work his eyes went wide mouth opened but no sound came out i twisted the blade left then right making sure hed never draw breath to warn the man in the other room deuce started to slide down the cabinets i caught him and lowered him gently to the floor glad he was one of the smaller men id have had trouble wrestling mickeys body around the water was still running in the shower blade probably wouldnt have heard the sound of the body hitting the ground over the shower but better safe than sorry deuce lay there on the floor the blade sticking out of his chest his pants still unzipped his namesake naked to the world he looked very sad lying there dead if i had time before i left id zip him up but first blade i got the gun off deuces shoulder and put the sling around my shoulder i checked to make sure i knew where the safety was and that it was off the switch on the side had three settings not just two like the uzi i put the setting on high logic said it would make the most bullets come out in the shortest space of time i got dueces extra clip for the subgun a clip only holds twenty rounds normally that sounded like a lot but not tonight there wasnt enough ammo in the world to make me feel safe tonight i put the extra clips for both subguns and the hand guns in the purse and crossed the purse straps across my chest deuces backup was a mm glock personally i find glocks awkward to shoot though i know people that swear by them once the learning curve was over at the firing range but i was happy to see this one the guns were great but they would make a lot of noise if i shot blade it would bring the rest of the bad guys down on me and worse yet they might kill edward before coming after me they had three hostages they only needed one i needed something quiet trouble was i didnt think i could take blade with a blade hand to hand forget it that left me with the contents of the purse i pulled the blade out of deuces chest blood welled up darker than most like heart blood is supposed to be i cleaned the blade automatically on a sleeve of his shirt and slipped it into my front pocket one of his hands was lying against the cabinet doors far under the sink maybe i did have more than just what was in the purse i moved his arm and looked its amazing how much lethal stuff people keep in their bathroom cabinets almost everything has hazardous warning labels yelling poison caustic agent if accidental contact with eyes flush with water immediately but there was a pile of big fluffy towels and i had deuces handgun homemade silencer but i was going to have to hold the gun at about waist level close into my body to keep the towels tight enough to act as a muffler holding the gun that way meant id want to get in close before i fired if blade were as good as the rest of them hed have his gun close id only get one shot and it had to count how do you get that close to a wellarmed man answer take off some clothes i took off the tshirt and the vest it wouldnt stop a knife and the idea was that he wouldnt get a shot off right besides i was trying for romance or at least lust kevlar just lacks that certain something i kept the bra my nerves werent that good besides if he demanded i take some clothes off it left me something besides my pants it was like playing strip poker more clothes give you more to work with the shower went off shit my time had just run out my heart was suddenly in my throat but i had to get in there before he came out here if he saw the body it wasnt rape i had to worry about i tucked the gun down the front of my pants towels clutched to my chest and stomach and opened the door i closed the door with me leaning against it blade looked up his dark skin was beaded with water and deuce had been right blade stripped real pretty under other circumstances it would have been a pleasure to see him now i was so scared i was having trouble breathing he reached for the gun that had been propped against the tub his knife sheaths were draped across the back towel rack like youd hang a wash rag to keep them dry but handy he stopped in midmotion fingers trailing on the gun what do you want deuce said to bring you towels i let the fear slide into my voice making it breathy howd he get you to strip down i looked down an embarrassed head bob he gave me a choice of him or you blade laughed and it was a purely masculine sound he show his deuce i nodded i didnt have to pretend to be embarrassed i just didnt try and hide it take off the bra he straightened up hand going further away from the big gun but still too close to the knives and his handgun on the towel rack i slid out of the straps and pressed the towels to my chest reached back and undid the snaps i lifted the towels away from my body just enough to pull the bra out and let it fall to the floor i kept the towels tight against me for modestys sake and to hide the gun in my waistband he stepped out of the tub and started to take those three steps that would close the distance i turned my body sort of sideways getting the gun out still held behind the towels he was right in front of me three steps away from all his weapons he curled his fingers over the top of the towel and pushed them lower exposing my breasts an inch at a time he was less than ten inches away from me his hand stroked the upper mound of my breast and i fired his body jerked and i think he said fuck i kept pulling the trigger until he collapsed to his knees eyes rolled back his stomach and lower chest were a red ruin the towels were shredded and covered in black powder stains the shots had been muffled but not silenced i waited there in the small room the shots seeming to echo in the walls i waited for cries of alarm nothing i picked up my bra but didnt take time to put it on before i opened the connecting door and listened silence great i got dressed and took all the weapons blades handgun was a heckler and koch nice gun i tucked it in the front of my pants where the firestar would have normally gone i put both the big guns over the same shoulder and the knife sheaths i draped over the other shoulder i brought the subgun around clicked the safety off and i was as ready as i was going to be the last time id seen edward hed been on his knees his two guards had been standing if i was careful and the gun didnt kick too much i could take them out over edwards head my plan was to spray the room as plans went it was crude and secrecy would be very lost if we were within hearing of anyone but once i knew the noise wasnt going to get edward killed i didnt care as much theyd have killed edward because he was a threat and theyd want to take out the threat at their back before turning to face a new threat the kids werent a threat if riker was dead and couldnt give the order to hurt them then theyd be okay until we reached them that was the theory and it was the best one i had bristling with weapons i listened at the outer door nothing i opened it just a little the hallway was empty better i locked the door behind me so that when i shut it people might assume it was occupied by more than dead people the knives moved too much slung over my shoulder so i set them down in a pile against the wall being as quiet as i could the corridor that had seemed so long now seemed short because this was one of those plans that was either going to work really well or be a total disaster in less than two minutes id be at the door and wed see the gun had a short stock but i braced it against my shoulder and my arms were short enough that it was probably easier for me than the men i took them off i was only steps from the open study door voices came out into the hallway what do you mean that antonio and bandit are missing that was riker i thought your men were good simon shit was simon back in the room it didnt matter it didnt change the plan but id have preferred that simon be elsewhere at least until edward was safe and armed but simons voice came tinny and staticy it was the intercom system shit i didnt want them to hear the shots the best i could do was wait until i didnt hear him using it the longer i lurked in the hallway the less chance the plan had someone was going to come up the stairs or out of the room or out of the study if i lost surprise it was over i was scared really scared not about killing or being killed but about accidentally shooting edward i had an unfamiliar submachine gun in my hands id never even seen one like this used if you aim too high with a machine gun more the full machine guns but the subs too you can actually miss if i fired into that room and missed everyone i guess i deserved to get shot i took the last deep breach and eased around the door frame i know people always stand in the middle of the freaking door in the movies but thats a good way to get killed use cover when you have it i had a split second to see the room rooster and shooter had edward covered still on his knees alario the witch had moved beside rikers desk i started firing almost before id finished looking the sound was enormous but the gun had almost no recoil i had to adjust my aim because id been expecting to have to fight the gun but it was smooth for a sub gun shooter actually got a burst off but it was angled wrong and took out the ceiling above me rooster turned but that was it seconds for both of them to go down seconds to move the gun in a continuous spray that took out the control panels and monitors and riker sitting behind his desk alario was the furthest away and he had time to dive to the floor i went for the floor too hitting on my stomach as i aimed for him i was angled away from edward i didnt have to be careful i kept the trigger down and hit alario before he could get a shot off his body danced with the slap of bullets there was something fascinating about the way the bullets shredded him or maybe i just couldnt let go of the trigger i caught movement out of the corner of my eye and rolled on one shoulder gun pointed i let off the trigger just in time edward was kneeling with a gun in his hand by the bodies of his guards he had a hand out as if to ward off the bullets as if he hadnt been sure id remember in time we stayed that way for a frozen second me on my side the subgun pointed at him finger still on the trigger but not pressing down him with his hand out the automatic pistol in his hand but pointed down his mouth moved but i couldnt hear him part shock adrenaline and part firing a submachine gun without ear protection in a closed room i eased to a kneeling position and stopped pointing the gun at him he seemed to realize i was having trouble hearing because he held up two fingers and did thumbs down rooster and shooter were dead hurrah i knew alario was dead id gone way overboard on him i looked across the room at riker he was sitting in his chair mouth gaping open and closed like a landed fish the front of his nice white shirt and suit jacket were stained red in a row across the entire front of his body including his arms he was sitting so that i could see his hands clearly i dont know if the force of the shots had pushed the wheeled chair back or hed started that way edward pointed at riker and i heard one word of the sentence guard he wanted me to guard riker not kill him of course we needed to know where the children were being held i hoped he didnt die before he told us my hearing came back in stages i could hear riker saying please dont it was what peter had been saying on the monitor it pleased me that riker was begging edward came back from checking the hallway he had one of the subguns in his hands hed closed the door so that if we had company wed get a little warning by the time he started asking riker questions i could hear but there was a ringing echo in my head that didnt seem to want to go away tell me where to find peter and becca edward said he was leaning on the back of rikers chair face very close to his riker rolled his eyes to look at him there was bloody foam at his lips id pierced at least one lung if it had been both he was dying if only one then maybe he could survive if he got to the hospital soon enough please he managed to say again tell me where the children are being kept and ill let anita call an ambulance promise he said in a voice thick with things that should never be in a throat i promise just like you promised me edward said either riker didnt get the double entendre or he didnt want to people will believe a lot of things when theyre afraid theyre dying he believed wed call an ambulance because he gave directions in that thick wet voice he told us where they were being held thank you edward said call now riker said edward put his face almost next to rikers you want to be safe from the monster riker swallowed coughed blood and nodded ill keep you safe from the monster ill keep you safe from everything and he shot riker in the head with the beretta mil hed reclaimed from roosters body my guns were still on mickey somewhere out there edward felt for rikers pulse and didnt find it he looked at me across the mans body id always thought edward killed with coldness but his baby blues held a fine heated rage like a forest fire barely under control he was still in control of himself but for the first time i wondered if there would come a point tonight where hed lose it you can only stay cool and collected when things dont matter and peter and becca mattered to edward they mattered more than id have ever thought anyone would matter to him them and donna his family he told me to reload the sub gun i did what he asked if edward said id nearly emptied an entire clip in just a few seconds i believed him i added the extra clip from the dead man to the purse edward went for the door and i followed him id thought that nothing could be scarier than edward at his most cold i was wrong edward the family man was downright terrifying hours later though my watch said thirty minutes i was plastered to a wall crouched as low as i could get trying not to get shot i knew that i originally started out to rescue the kids and i still planned to do that but my immediate plan was just to avoid catching a bullet that had been the plan for about five minutes id heard the expression a hail of bullets but id really never understood what it meant it was as if the very air had turned into a moving spattering thing where tiny fastmoving objects peppered the air around you bit into the solid rock wall beyond and left holes there were two submachine guns down the hall pinning us in cross fire id never been shot at by fully automatic machine guns before i was so impressed i hadnt done anything in the last five minutes except hug the wall and keep my head down the secret panel had been exactly where riker said it would be edward had killed the guard on the other side with a knife quick efficient wed killed two more men before simon and his crew or what was left of it found us and started fighting back id thought i was good at killing people id thought i was good in a gunfight i was wrong if what was happening to me now was a gunfight then id never been in one before id shot people and been shot but that had been one on one with semiauto pistols the bullets whined by me in a near constant stream of noise and percussion i was so not putting my face out there it was pure luck that i hadnt been shot before we got this far the only thing id been doing right that had helped my chances was using every freaking bit of cover offered the one comfort to my newfound cowardice was that edward was crouched with me though he kept peeking around the corner and firing short bursts at the shooters that had us pinned he reached around me firing i could feel the vibration of the gun against my body the tremble of his arms as he held it he darted back behind the wall and a fresh burst of bullets thundered down at us edward held his hand out and i handed him another clip from the purse i felt like a surgical nurse i leaned close to edwards ear and whisperscreamed you want the vest im not using it ive got a vest on deuce had kindly left edwards vest in the study you could put mine on your head i said he actually smiled at me as if id been joking he motioned for me to scoot over an acknowledgment from both of us that i wasnt doing much he took up my post at the corner of the wall and i flattened my back where hed been he went to his belly firing around the corner it only took seconds for him to peek around the corner fire and come back but while he was staring down the corridor i saw the tiniest corner of a head peek round the bend of the stairs just above us the head ducked back out of sight i started to touch edward to let him know we had company when something came sailing through the air something small and roundish i dont remember thinking about it i was just on my knees letting the subgun dangle i caught the object in my hands and threw it back up the stairs before my brain even had time to form the word grenade i threw myself back to the floor touching edwards leg and then there was an explosion the world shuddered and the stairway collapsed in a shower of rock and dust rock rained down on my arms where id curled them over my head i thought that if the bad guys came running down the hall now i wouldnt be much help which made me raise my head enough to see the corner and edward he had his head covered by one arm but was looking round the corner gun in one hand of course nothing would make edward forget the bad guys certainly not a little thing like an explosion and the ceiling about to come down on us the silence came gradually full of creaks and groans from the stones around us the dust lay like a thin mist in the air i started to cough and edwards hand was just suddenly on my mouth how had he known he gave a small shake of his head i got the idea that he wanted me to be quiet but i didnt know why of course i didnt need to know we lay quiet and the silence seemed to build finally i heard the first scrape of a footstep coming down the hall i tensed and edwards hand pressed on my shoulder easy he was saying easy i swallowed as quietly as i could and tried to relax quiet i could do relaxed was not happening the movements were stealthy very quiet someone was creeping down the hallway towards us wondering if wed gotten blown up we were pretending that we had but once the man got down here the jig would be up we could kill him but there was another man at the end of the hall if he didnt run out of ammo he could hold the hall against us he didnt want to come to us and we needed to go down that hall becca and peter were in cells in the hall the bad guys had the upper hand because we needed to move forward and all they needed to do was hold position of course one of them was coming to us edward pantomimed for me to go forward and lie down i knew he wanted me to play dead but that far out from the wall was kill zone if they started firing even flat on the ground i might be hit but i crawled forward through the debris being very very careful not to scrape any weapons or the purse against the floor or make the rocks roll i was further out than i wanted to be when i looked back and edward gave one nod i lay down on the floor quietly i lay face down because my acting abilities arent up to playing dead my hair flung across my face and i left it there the better to peek through i kept the subgun in my hand but edward shook his head i let the gun go moved my hand minutely away from it and played dead if edward were wrong i wouldnt be playing for long id never get to the gun in time once the man cleared the corner it was over i lay there and strained to hear movement mostly what i heard was the thudding of my heart whoever it was was being even quieter than before maybe hed chickened out maybe he wasnt coming at all and theyd start shooting again i had to fight to keep still not to move not to breathe too much i willed myself to relax into the floor and id almost succeeded when i caught movement in the hallway i was far enough out from edward that i had a better view at the end of the hall would he see the shine of my eyes through my hair i took in a deep breath closed my eyes and held it either edward would kill him or hed kill me i trusted edward i trusted edward i trusted edward noises soft slithering noises the brush of cloth then a sharp exhale of breath nothing youd hear from the other end of the hallway silence so thick it was frightening but if edward hadnt won there would have been gunfire i opened my eyes a slit then wider because edward was kneeling over mickeys body searching it i must not have been the only one who thought the silence was a long one because a mans voice sounded mickey you okay edward answered and it didnt sound like his voice it wasnt a perfect imitation but it was good all clear whats the roger the man asked i didnt recognize the voice one of simons men we had yet to meet face to face edward looked at me and shook his head i didnt know what a roger was but apparently we couldnt fake it though edward tried get the fuck down here and help me search the bodies the answer to that was gunfire i was already as low as i could get to the ground but i tried to get lower the bullets sprayed over me into the wall beyond and the only thing that kept me from screaming was pride edward gave one abrupt motion i thought i knew what he wanted when the shots ended i belly crawled back towards the wall i was actually almost there when he fired again i froze in place face to the ground the firing ended and i put my back to the wall on the other side of mickeys body from edward mickey was still carrying my guns i took them back edward had a canister in his hand that looked suspiciously like the incendiary grenade theyd put in my purse minus the camouflaging hairspray can my eyes widened he shook his head as if reading my mind and mouthed smoke okay he leaned over the body and i leaned into him he whispered cover me while i throw it belly crawl down the hall when you see anyone through the smoke shoot them then he leaned back pulled the pin on the smoke grenade and stood with the wall still hiding him i crawled to him hugging the wall and his legs subgun clutched tight my heart was inside my head pounding away i had time to think gee the headaches gone then edward said softly now i peeked around the corner my finger on the trigger spraying down the hallway edward threw the smoke grenade he jerked back around the corner and so did i thick white smoke filled the hallway i dropped to my belly behind the wall waiting for the smoke to find me edward motioned that hed take the other side but he pointed forward for me he combat crawled and was almost immediately lost to the thick smoke the smoke was bitter like burning cotton soaked in something bad i crawled with the wall on my left the subgun held out in front of me i had two guns shoved down the front of my jeans now and it wasnt comfortable for crawling but nothing could have persuaded me to stop and adjust them the purse stayed solid against my back like a bulky backpack the world had narrowed down to soft rolling smoke the feel of the floor under my arms and legs the brush of the wall against my left elbow when i moved too close to it there was nothing but me moving down the hall eyes trying to see anything in the white mass of clouds nothing moved but me then bullets ripped through the smoke and i was close enough to see the flash of the gun through the smoke i was almost on top of him and he was firing chest high into the smoke i was about ankle high and looking up at him i could actually see him like a shadowy figure above me when i pressed the trigger and watched that shadow jerk i rolled onto my side to sweep my fire line up his body still afraid to stand or even kneel until i knew he wasnt firing back he collapsed to his knees face suddenly looming out of the smoke i fired nearly point blank into his chest and he fell backwards half vanishing in the fading smoke like hed fallen into clouds i stayed low and realized i could see his feet the smoke was almost gone at floor level which was one of many reasons that edward had had us crawl its me edward said before he crawled out of the smoke he was wise to have warned me my finger was still on the trigger and i was beginning to appreciate how you could accidentally shoot your friends in a combat situation unless you were very careful he moved a little way and the smoke was thinning enough that i could see him check the mans pulse stay here and he was gone into the dying smoke it pissed me off but i stayed on the floor by the man id killed and waited i might have been pissed off but we were in a kind of fighting that i knew almost nothing about id somehow fallen into edwards other life and he was better at surviving here than i was i was going to do what i was told it was pretty much my only hope for getting out alive edward came back walking instead of crawling probably a good sign the areas clear but it wont be for long he held the keys wed taken from riker lets do it he unlocked the cell that was supposed to be peters and went across the hall to beccas before he did more than push the door open i guess i was getting peter i dropped to one knee and pushed the door open until it was flat against the wall see no one hiding behind it if there had been someone in the room theyd have probably shot over my head kneeling i was a lot shorter than most people but a glance showed the room was empty except for the narrow bed with peter on it i stood debated for a second whether to shut the door and risk someone locking it behind me or leave it open and risk someone coming up behind me with a gun i left it open not because it was the best option but because i just didnt want the door shut on me in the cell part claustrophobia part just having been locked in too many places waiting for things to eat me sometimes i think that last part contributes to the claustrophobia it had been bad on the black and white monitor but it was worse in person peter was curled into the tightest ball he could manage his hands tied behind his back tied ankles tucked up tight to his bare butt his clothes were still bunched around his knees and the expanse of pale flesh looked incredibly vulnerable shed meant to humiliate him leaving him like this the blindfold was still in place cutting a bright patch of color across his dark hair his mouth was stained with drying blood his lower lip already swollen bruises beginning to spread across his face like ugly lipstick from an overzealous kiss i didnt try to be quiet i tried to hurry he heard me coming because he started talking through the gag i could understand him please dont please dont he kept saying it over and over in a progressively more frantic voice until his voice broke not from adolescence but from fear its me peter i said he didnt seem to hear me just kept begging over and over i touched his shoulder and he screamed peter its anita i think he stopped breathing for a heart beat then he said anita yeah im here to get you out he started to cry thin shoulders shaking i drew one of blades blades and fitted it carefully between his wrists jerking upward the cord sliced clean under the sharp sharp blade i tried to lift the blindfold off of him but it was too tight im going to have to cut the blindfold off peter dont move his breathing slowed and he held still while i slid the blade between the cloth and the side of his head it was harder to cut than the rope because it was tighter to his skin and just a bad angle but the blade finally sliced through it and the cloth fell away i had an impression of red marks in his skin where the blindfold had marked him then he flung himself on me hugging me i hugged him back knife in one hand he whispered she said she was going to cut it off when she came back he didnt start crying again he just held on i rubbed his back with my free hand i wanted to give him comfort but we had to get out of here she wont hurt you anymore peter i promise that but weve got to get out of here i pulled back from his desperate arms until i could see his face and he could see mine i held his face in my hands the knife carefully pointed up i looked into his eyes they were wide and shocky but there wasnt much i could do about it now peter we have to go teds getting becca and were leaving maybe it was his sisters name but he blinked and gave a small nod im okay he said which was the best lie id heard all night but i accepted it and said good i had to stand to reach the ropes at his ankles he was just that tall or i was that short the hug had put him facing forward and he seemed suddenly aware that he was exposed he started grabbing at his underwear and pants while i tried to cut his ankles free i had to pull the knife back if you dont hold still youre going to end up cut i want my clothes on he said i stood at the foot of the bed and said get dressed dont look he said im not looking but youre looking at me he said but im not looking at you but i couldnt explain it to him so i turned and looked at the door while he struggled into his pants you can look now he had everything zipped and buttoned and just that had taken some of the raw terror out of his eyes i cut his ankles free sheathed the knife and helped him to his feet he jerked away from me then almost fell because the ankles had been tied too tight for too long and he didnt have all the feeling back only my hand on his arm kept him upright you need to walk a little with help before you can run i said he let me help him to the door but he wouldnt look at me his first reaction had been that of a child grateful to be saved wanting to hold on to someone but his second reaction was older he was embarrassed now embarrassed at what had happened and probably at me seeing him nearly naked he was fourteen a trembling age between child and adult somehow i think hed been younger when he went into the cell than when he came out edward met us in the hallway with becca held in his arms she looked pale and sick bruises had already started blooming on her face but it was her hand that made me want to cry that tiny hand that id held only days ago while edward and i swung her in the air three of the fingers looked crippled at unnatural angles they were swelling the skin discolored it was early for that which meant they were bad breaks and wouldnt heal easily she said anita you came to save me too her voice was high and thin it made my throat tight yeah sweetie i came to save you too peter and edward stood staring at each other it was edward that reached out first just his hand because the arm was underneath beccas legs peter took that hand and hugged them both his fingers hovered over beccas hand and fresh tears fell down his face but there was no sobbing now just tears so quiet you wouldnt have known he was crying if you hadnt seen them shell be all right edward said peter looked up at him as if he wasnt sure he believed but he wanted to but he stepped away from them rubbed the tears from his face with his hands can i have a gun i opened my mouth to say no but edward spoke first give him your firestar anita youre kidding i said ive seen him shoot he can handle it id been following edwards orders for a while he was usually right but if we go down i want him armed edward looked at me and the weight in his eyes was enough he didnt want peter and becca taken again if he put a gun in peters hand theyd kill him not torture him if the worst happened edward had decided how the boy would go out and god help me i agreed i pulled the gun out of the band of my jeans why the firestar smallest grip i handed it to peter feeling vaguely like a child molester myself or maybe a corrupter it holds nine if you carry one in the chamber its only holding eight safetys here he took the gun and popped the clip out to check it then looked vaguely embarrassed ted says to always check if somethings loaded he popped the clip back in put a round in the chamber so it was ready to fire try not to shoot any of us i said he clicked the safety on i wont looking into his eyes i believed him i want to go home becca said were going home honey edward said edward led the way around the corner still carrying becca peter went next and i brought up the rear i didnt burst anyones bubble but i knew we were a long way from safe we had simon and the rest of his men to get through not to mention harold and newt and the local guys where were russell and amanda i was really hoping to see them before we left id promised peter that she would never hurt him again i always keep my promises the hallway spilled out into a large open space edward stopped and peter and i did too becca was still being carried so she didnt have much choice i kept an eye on our back trail and waited for edward to decide what to do i couldnt see how big the open space was so i figured it was big enough for edward to worry about us being out in that much open he finally moved slowly forward hugging the lefthand wall when i could see the room clearly i realized why hed hesitated it wasnt just this huge open space there were three tunnels leading off to the right dark mouths where anything might lurk like simon and the rest of his men but there was a fourth opening with stairs leading up up was what we needed i walked with my back to the solid wall behind me trying to keep an eye on the hall wed come out of and the three tunnels to the right i left the stairs to edward the stairway was narrow barely broad enough for two slender people to walk abreast it wound upward and had a sharp angle at the top a blind corner i kept watching behind us because i knew that if shooters came up behind us and in front of us at the same time we were dead it was a perfect place for an ambush peter seemed to feel the tension because he moved closer to edward almost touching him as they moved up the stairs we were about three fourths of the way up to that first blind corner when edward hesitated staring down at the steps peter took one extra step edward hit him with his shoulder knocking him back he dropped becca to the steps still holding her good arm trying to save her from the full fall i think if hed just dropped becca he might have gotten them all out of harms way but that last effort cost him the second he needed i saw a blur of movement and there was a wooden stake sticking out of edwards back i started to go to him but he said up the stairs now shoot them i didnt ask questions i went up the last few steps as fast as i could go and threw myself around the corner on my side and was shooting down the hallway before i saw what i was shooting at harold russell newt and amanda were running down another level of stairs i fired up into them fighting the angle to make the spray pattern hit them the three men went down but amanda turned and darted back around the corner theyd come from i made sure the men werent getting up firing into their down bodies then i got to my feet and ran up the stairs after her i crouched at the corner but the stairs were empty fuck i didnt dare pursue her and leave the kids and edward alone i went back down the steps and slipped on blood so that i ended up sitting down hard on the steps my elbow hit harolds body and the body grunted i put the barrel of the gun against his chest as his eyes fluttered open didnt make the ambush site in time simons going to be pissed he said and the tone of his voice said he was hurting i dont think you have to worry about simon anymore harold youre not going to be around to answer to him never approved of hurting kids he said but you didnt stop it i said he took a breath and that seemed to hurt too simon called someone on the radio said hed failed said they needed to clean up the mess i think theyre coming to kill us all whos coming he opened his mouth and i think hed have told me but his breath ran out in a long sigh i felt for the pulse in his neck but it wasnt there id known he was dead but still you check i checked russell and newt just to be sure but they were dead i actually left everyones guns because i just couldnt carry anymore i heard voices as i neared the bend that would take me back to edward fuck then i recognized one of the voices it was olaf i came around the corner and found olaf and bernardo kneeling by edward peter was sitting on the steps holding becca she was crying he wasnt he was staring at edward face white with shock bernardo spotted me first are they dead i nodded russell newt and harold amanda got away peters eyes flicked to me and they were huge and dark in his pale pale face the bruised mouth stood out against his skin like it was makeup too bright to be real edward made a small sound and peter turned back to him im sorry ted he said im sorry its all right pete just next time follow my lead better his voice was strained but peter seemed to take heart from talk of a next time i wasnt so sure olaf and bernardo had turned him so that you could see the sharpened end of the stake that had pierced his chest it was upper chest close to the left shoulder it had missed the heart or hed be dead but it could have pierced the sack around the heart and blood could be spilling into that sack as we watched or it could have missed it entirely it was high enough up that it had probably missed the lungs probably howd you know that they were coming i asked heard them and his voice reminded me of harolds pain stressed i was suddenly cold and it wasnt the temperature i started to kneel by them all but edward said watch our backs so i stood up put my back to the wall and let my peripheral vision try to keep track of both up and down the stairs but my eyes kept going back to him was he dying please god not like this it wasnt just edward it was the look on peters face if edward died peter would blame himself the boy was having a bad enough night that kind of guilt he did not need give me your tshirt olaf said i looked at him we need to pack the wound and keep the stake from moving around we cant remove it here its too close to his heart he will need a hospital i agreed with that someone else watch for bad guys while i undress bernardo stood up and took my place at the wall i noticed there was a blade sticking out of his cast like a spearhead the blade was stained black with blood i pulled off my tshirt and handed it to olaf hed already stripped down to his black kevlar vest shoving his own shirt around the wound do you need mine peter asked yes olaf said peter moved becca forward on his lap and took off his shirt his upper body was thin and pale he was tall but the rest of him hadnt caught up olaf used pieces of bernardos shirt to hold the makeshift bandage in place the wound looked terrible but it wasnt bleeding much i didnt know if that was a good sign or a bad one we caught the other half of your ambush on its way to the stairs bernardo said i wondered why there werent more i said i remembered what harold had said before harold died he said that simon called someone told them hed failed and they needed to clean up the mess does that mean what i think it means edward looked up at me as olaf used more shirt strips to bind his left arm tight so he wouldnt move it and risk jarring the stake into something vital theyll kill everything they find his voice was almost normal only slightly breathy a touch tight theyll burn the place to ash maybe they even salt the earth i think that last was the wound talking but you never know with edward olaf lifted edward to his feet but the height difference was too much edward couldnt keep his arm over the big mans shoulders bernardo will have to help you no anita can do it olaf opened his mouth to argue i think but edward said bernardo only has one good arm he needs that to shoot olaf closed his mouth into a tight line but he handed edward over to me edwards arm went around my shoulders i put my left arm around his waist we tried a couple of steps and it worked okay olaf led the way i came next with edward then peter carrying becca wrapped around his body like a sad little monkey bernardo brought up the rear olaf looked at the bodies of the dead men as he passed he spoke without looking back at me you did this yeah id have usually come up with something sarcastic like you see anyone else but i was too worried about edward to waste the effort sweat had popped out on his face as if it was taking a lot to keep going trouble was a firemans carry would disturb the stake and if any of us could carry him just in his arms it was olaf but it would mean not being able to shoot we needed the gun you okay edward i asked he swallowed before he said fine i didnt believe him but i didnt ask again this was probably as good as it was going to get for awhile edward tried to turn and say something to the kids but it hurt and i had to turn for him moving us both to face backwards cover beccas eyes peter peter had becca bury her face against his shoulder and kept his hand pressed to the back of her head he didnt have the firestar in his hands i wondered where it was but not enough to ask i turned edward back around and we started up the stairs again olaf was almost at the next bend in the stairs when he stopped he was looking down at the steps i froze and said no one move is it a trap edward asked no olaf said i saw it then thin rivulets of blood sliding down the steps towards us it snaked around olafs feet and dripped its way toward edward and me peter wasnt that far behind us he asked what is that blood olaf said please tell me that this is your handiwork olaf i said no he said i watched the blood flow around my nikes and knew that our problems had just gotten worse i leaned edward up against the wall he wanted me free to shoot if olaf told me to olaf got to scout ahead and see what the problem was he vanished around that corner and i pressed myself to the wall and gave the briefest of looks ahead the stairs ended just up ahead the electric lights showed a cave i think the lights glistened on blood and bodies olaf backed up and came down to us again i can see the exit what are the bodies rikers men what killed them i think it is our murderous beast but there is no other way out the other entrance has been blocked by an explosion we must go out this way i figured if the murderous beast was up there waiting for us olaf would have been more excited so i went back to edward his skin was the color of bad paste his eyes were closed they opened when i touched him but they were brighter than they should have been were almost out i said he didnt say anything just let me settle his arm over my shoulder he was still holding on to me but every step we took my arm around his waist was taking more and more of his weight hold on edward just a little further his head jerked as if hed just heard me but his feet kept moving with me we were going to make it all of us the blood got thicker the farther up we walked edward slipped in it and i had to catch him and barely managed to keep us both standing but it was a sudden movement and he let out a small sound of pain shit watch your step peter i said its slippery olaf was waiting for us at the bodies there were only three of them one was a man i didnt recognize but i recognized the gun near his body he was one of simons men simon was lying in a pool of blood and darker fluids the entire lower chest stomach abdomen were open his intestines trailed out onto the cave floor but his eyes were still blinking upward still alive the third body was amanda and she was still moving too but olaf had her covered so i kept my attention on simon he smiled up at us at least i killed the undertaker hes not nearly as dead as you are i said youre all dead bitch we know you invited company i said his eyes looked uncertain fuck you his hand inched towards his gun that was still lying beside him gutted dying in more pain than i could imagine and he tried to go for his gun i stepped on his hand pinning it to the earth harder to do than normal with edward hanging on me but i managed peter you and becca go up with bernardo to the front of the cave peter didnt argue he just carried becca past us bernardo trailing behind i pointed the gun barrel at simons head i couldnt leave him behind because i didnt trust him at my back even this wounded i wasnt willing to take the chance i hope the monster guts you bitch thats ms bitch to you i said and pulled the trigger a short burst but more shots echoed mine i whirled gun up and found peter standing over amandas body he emptied the firestar into her body while i watched olaf was just watching him do it i looked for bernardo and found him holding becca near the cave mouth edward started to slide to his knees i knelt with him trying to keep him upright he whispered the kids out get them out and he fainted olaf was there without me asking he lifted edward in his arms like a child if the monster came now we all had our hands full shit peter had run out of bullets but he was still squeezing the trigger over and over and over i went to him peter peter shes dead you killed her ease down he didnt seem to hear me i touched his hands tried to lift the gun from him he jerked away violently eyes wild he kept dry firing into the womans body i shoved him back against the rock wall hard one arm across his throat the other pinning his hands still wrapped around the firestar his eyes were wide and frightened but he looked at me peter shes dead you cant kill her any more dead than she already is his voice shook when he said i wanted her to hurt she did hurt being torn apart is a bad way to die he shook his head its not enough no i said it isnt enough but you killed her peter thats as good as revenge gets once you kill them there isnt any more i took the firestar out of his hands and he let me i tried to hug him but he pushed me away then walked away the time for that kind of comfort was past but there were other kinds of comfort some of them came from the barrel of a gun there is some comfort in killing that which has hurt you but it is cold comfort itll destroy things inside of you that the original pain wouldnt have harmed sometimes its not a question of whether a piece of your soul is going to go missing only which piece its going to be peter carried becca olaf carried edward bernardo and i took the lead we searched the spring darkness with our guns back and forth back and forth nothing moved there was just the sound of wind in the tall line of sage bushes that bordered the back of the cave the air felt so good against my face and i realized that id not really expected to get out not alive pessimism it wasnt like me bernardo led the way back to circle the house wed try for edwards car but we wanted to make sure no one or no thing was waiting to eat us when we went for the car olaf went second carrying a very still edward i was praying hard that hed be okay though strangely it felt odd to pray to god for edward as if i were praying in the wrong direction peter and becca were just ahead of me he stumbled as we headed into the thicker brush he had to be tired but i couldnt afford to carry becca i needed to have my hands free to fight i felt the prickling brush of magic i called guys somethings out here everyone stopped and started searching the darkness what did you see olaf asked nothing but something out here is doing magic olaf made a noise in his throat like he didnt believe me then the first wave of fear washed over us so much fear that it closed the throat sent the heart thundering made the palms of your hand sweat becca started struggling violently in peters arms i took two steps to help peter control her but she struggled free fell to the ground and ran like a rabbit into the brush peter yelled becca and went after her peter becca oh shit i ran into the brush after them what else could i do i heard them just up ahead crashing through the brush peter calling beccas name i had a sense of movement to my right and i saw something it was bigger than a man and even by moonlight you could see it was different colors i fired into it as it opened a huge razored mouth but the claw kept coming towards me as if the bullets were nothing the closed claw slammed into my head it knocked me off my feet and i hit the ground hard darkness swirled across my vision and when i could see again the thing was right above me i kept my finger on the trigger until it clicked empty the monster never hesitated it filled my vision with a face that was almost birdlike and i had a moment to think it was pretty before it hit me again and there was nothing but darkness i woke instantly my skin jumping with a rush of magic that left me gasping my body strained writhing as the power rode over and through my body in a burning surge that just kept growing my hands and legs strained against the chains that held me down chains i turned and stared at my wrists head still thrashing my body jerking as the power roared through me my arms and legs jerked not because i was struggling against the chains but as a reaction to the power the magic began to fade leaving my breath coming in pants one thing i knew if didnt get my breathing under control i was going to hyperventilate passing out again would be bad heaven knew what id wake up to a second time i concentrated on my breathing forcing myself to be calm and take deep even normal breaths its hard to be totally panicstricken when youre doing breathing exercises it poured a false calm over my body and my mind but it let me think which was good i was lying on my back chained to a smooth stone surface there was a curve of cave wall beside me and a ceiling lost to sight in the darkness above id have loved to believe that bernardo and olaf had rescued me and we were back in the cave entrance but the chains sort of ruined that pleasant thought this cave was much taller and without looking it just felt bigger firelight bounced in orange shadows along the cave like being in a ball of darkness and gold light i finally turned my head to the right and let myself see what was there at first i thought it was pinotl itzpapalotls human servant i had a few seconds of cursing myself for believing her when she said she didnt know about the monster then i realized it wasnt him it looked like him same square chiseled face dark rich skin and the black hair cut long and oddly square but this man was narrow through the shoulders thin and there was no air of command to him he was also wearing a pair of loosefitting shorts instead of the nifty clothes that pinotl wore there was a smooth rounded stone like the one at the obsidian butterfly there was a body draped over that stone foreshortened legs and arms short dark hair and for a moment i thought it was nicky baco then i saw the naked chest more clearly and it was paulina nickys wife there was a hole under her ribs like a great gaping mouth theyd torn out her heart the unknown man stood there holding the heart in his hands above his head like an offering his eyes looked black in the uncertain light he lowered his arms walking towards me with the heart cupped in his hands his hands were so thick with blood that it looked like he was wearing red gloves there were four men standing at attention around the altar they were wearing some sort of soft leather on their bodies hoods up and covering them from head to foot almost there was something wrong with what they were wearing but my eyes couldnt make sense of it and i had other more immediate problems than what people were wearing i was still wearing the kevlar vest and all the rest of my clothes if they meant to take my heart theyd have taken the clothes it was a very comforting thought as the man the priest walked towards me with the heart in his hands he held the heart over my chest and began to chant in a language that sounded like spanish but wasnt blood dripped from the heart splatted on the vest it made me jump the calm of the breathing exercises was wearing off i did not want him to touch me with that thing it wasnt even logic fear of some spell or magic it was pure revulsion i did not want to be touched by a heart that had just been torn out of someones body ive put my share of stakes through hearts ive even cut a few out for burning but somehow this was different maybe it was being chained and helpless or maybe it was paulinas body lying limp over the altar looking like a broken doll the only time id met her shed been so strong threatening me with a gun but lots of people had done that edward used to do that all the time starting out a relationship on the end of a gun didnt mean you couldnt be friends down the road unless one of you died no friendship now no nothing for paulina the man ended the chant and began to lower the heart towards me i strained against the chains though i knew it was useless and i said dont touch me with that it sounded sure and strong but if he understood english i couldnt tell it because he just kept lowering his bloody hands closer and closer he laid the heart on my chest and i was almost as grateful that the kevlar kept me from feeling that thing next to my skin as id been for the extra protection from bullets earlier the heart lay on my chest like so much meat there was no magic to it it was just dead then the heart took a breath or thats what it looked like the skin rose and fell it sat on my chest naked and attached to nothing and pulsed i was suddenly aware of my own heartbeat the moment i noticed my heartbeat paulinas heart stuttered then began to beat in time with mine and the moment the rhythms were shared i could hear a second heart beat except that paulinas heart had no blood to pump no chest to resonate in it should have been a pale sound compared to the real thing but it was a solid pulsing beat it was as if the sound reached through the vest through my skin my ribs and pierced my heart the pain was sharp and immediate stealing my breath bowing my spine hold her the man yelled the men whod been standing by the altar ran to me strong hands pressing on my legs pinning my shoulders my spine tried to bow with the pain and a third set of hands pressed down on my thighs three of them pinning me to the stone forcing me to ride the pain and not struggle paulinas heart was beating faster and faster speeding speeding towards some grand climax my heart thundered against my ribs as if it were trying to tear loose of the tissue it was as if a fist were beating on the inside of my chest trying to smash its way out i couldnt breathe as if all of my chest was caught up in the frantic race and there was no time for anything else the pain was centered in my chest but it spread down my arms my legs filled my head until i thought that it might not be my heart that exploded it might be the top of my head i could feel the two hearts like lovers separated by a wall tearing it down between them until they would be able to touch there was a moment when i felt them touch felt the thick wet sides of the two organs slide into each other maybe it was just the pain then the heart stopped like a person caught in midmotion and my heart stopped with it for a breathless moment my heart sat in my body and did nothing as if waiting then it gave one beat then another and i drew air into my lungs in a frantic rush and as soon as i had air i screamed then i lay there still listening to my heart beat feeling the pain begin to fade like the memory of a nightmare minutes later the pain was gone my body didnt even hurt in fact i felt energized wonderful the heart on my chest had shriveled into a gray used up piece of flesh it wasnt recognizable as a heart just a dry ball smaller than my palm i blinked up and saw the face of the man holding my shoulders down im sure hed been looking down at me for a while but i hadnt seen him or hadnt understood what i was seeing he wore a mask over his face only his lips eyes and ears showed through the thin covering his neck was bare then a ragged bow neck of the same material of the mask covered him i think part of me knew what i was looking at before the rest of me would accept it it wasnt until i turned my head as far as i could to one side and saw the hands that i knew what he was wearing the empty hands bunched at his wrists like limp fleshly lace it was human skin id finally found out what had happened to some of the skin the flayed ones had lost the eyes that stared out of that horrible thing were brown and very human i looked down the line of my body and found that the other two men holding my legs wore the same thing but the skins werent all the same colors one dark two light the chests had thick cord sewn across it where the breasts and nipples would have been so there was no clue to whether the skin had been male or female the first man id seen stepped forward how do you feel his english was heavily accented but clear i just looked at him for a second he had to be kidding how am i supposed to feel i just woke up in a cave where you just performed a human sacrifice i glanced at the men still holding me down im being held down by men wearing flayed human skin suits how the hell i am i supposed to feel i am asking after your bodily health nothing more he said i started to say something else sarcastic but stopped and really thought about his question how did i feel actually i felt good i remembered that rush of energy and wellbeing that had spread over me when the spell finished it was still there i felt better than id felt in days if it hadnt required human sacrifice it would have been a great medical treatment i feel okay no pain in the head no good he said he motioned and the skin guys moved away from me they moved back to stand against the wall by the fourth man who hadnt been needed to hold me down they stood there like good soldiers waiting for their next orders i turned back to look at the other guy everyone in the room was scary but at least he wasnt wearing someone elses skin what did you do to me we have saved your life our masters creature was overzealous there was bleeding in your head we needed you alive i thought about that you used paulinas life force to heal me yes im glad to be alive honest i looked past him at paulinas body lying broken and forgotten but she didnt volunteer to trade her life for mine did she nicky baco began to suspect what price he would have to pay for our masters blessing she was a hostage to make sure he came to this our last meeting the man said let me guess he didnt show i said he no longer answers our masters call apparently ramirez had taken my advice of having leonora evans do some sort of magical barrier around nicky so he couldnt contact his master good to know it was working but you try to do the right thing and it ends up getting someone else killed why is that always the way it works but i admit that i was happier for me than sorry for paulina not about her trading her life for mine but if nicky was being protected by magic then he and the police were on their way all i had to do was stall and keep them from doing whatever it was they had planned for me so when nicky didnt show up you didnt need to keep her alive my voice sounded calm but better than that i was calm not normal calm but the cool distant calm that you either learn to do during the really bad stuff or you run screaming id done all the screaming i planned on doing tonight her life did not matter yours does im glad to be alive and dont take this wrong but why do you give a damn if i live or die we need you a male voice said from behind me i had to arch my neck and crane my head backward to see the owner of that second voice i didnt see the man at first because he was surrounded by the flayed ones id known that edward was worried that theyd missed some bodies he had no idea there must have been twentyfive thirtyfive animated corpses standing behind me theyd been standing so quietly i hadnt heard them or sensed them they stood there now like robots with the switch turned off waiting for life to return zombies never got that still never went that empty at the end when they started to rot and you had to put them back in the grave before they melted into little puddles they were more alive than this i realized in that instant that the bodies were raised but the person inside that body wasnt raised the master ate that which made them individuals he ate that which made them more than so much muscle and skin he didnt eat the souls because id seen one of them in a house where two flayed ones had been made but he took something out of their bodies some memory or remnant that i left in when i raised the dead they stood like rocks carved of flesh utterly empty at least the ones in the hospital had pretended to still be alive there was no pretense here my eyes finally found the man he wore a steel helmet and breastplate like the history books are always showing the conquistadors wearing but the rest of the outfit was straight out of a nightmare he wore a necklace of tongues and they were all still fresh and pink as if theyd just been cut out seconds ago he wore a skirt of intestines that writhed and twisted like snakes as if each thick glistening strand had an independent life of its own his arms were bare strong and muscled and covered in the missing eyelids of the victims as he moved close the eyelids opened and closed he came to stand beside me next to the first man the eyelids blinked at me and there were eye shaped holes underneath every lid that i saw the holes held darkness and the cold light of stars i turned away because i was remembering itzpapalotls starry eyes i didnt want to fall into these eyes at that second if you had given me a choice id have taken the vampire in town to the thing that was standing in front of me after what id seen at the murder scene i expected to feel evil emanating from him but there was no evil there was power like being next to a battery the size of the chrysler building the energy hummed along my skin but it was neutral energy neither good nor bad in and of itself the way a gun is neither good nor bad but can be turned to evil purposes i stared up the line of his body and the tongues were moving as if still trying to scream he took off the helmet and showed a slender handsome face that reminded me of bernardos not the pure aztec ethnicity id been expecting he had turquoise ear spools in his lobes and they matched the blue green of his eyes he smiled down at me looking like a freshfaced twentysomething i could feel the weight of the ages in his gaze like some vast weight pressing down on me as if just being this close made it hard to breathe he reached out to touch my face and i jerked back from him that one movement seemed to break his hold over me i could move i could breathe i could think id been on the receiving end of enough magical glamour to know it when i felt it youre either a god or youre not he was not and it wasnt just my monotheism showing id felt the magic of monsters and preternatural beasties of all sorts and i knew one when i saw one power doesnt make you a deity i dont know exactly what does but power aint it some spark of the divine was missing from the being that gazed down upon me if he was just another monster maybe we could deal who are you and i was happy that my voice was confident normal i am the red womans husband he gazed down at me with eyes so patient so kind you think angels must have eyes like that the red woman is the aztec phrase for blood what does it mean that youre bloods husband i am the body and she is the life he said it like it answered my question it didnt something wet and slimy touched my hand i jerked back but the chain didnt let me go far the length of animated intestine followed my hand nuzzling it like some obscene worm i swallowed a scream but i couldnt keep my pulse from speeding up he laughed at me it was a very ordinary laugh for a wouldbe god but it was nicely condescending and maybe thats how wouldbe gods laughed but it was a peculiarly masculine condescension long gone out of style the laugh says silly little girl dont you know im the big strong man and you know nothing and i know everything or maybe im just too sensitive why intestines i asked the smile faded around the edges his handsome face looked puzzled are you making fun of me the intestine dropped away from my hand like a date that id rebuffed fine with me no i just wondered why intestines you can obviously animate any body part you can keep detached parts from decaying like the skins your men are wearing with all that to choose from why peoples guts and not something else people love to talk about themselves the bigger the ego the more they enjoy it i was hoping that the red womans husband was the same as everyone else at least in this one thing i wear the roots of their bodies so that all that see me will know that my enemies are empty shells and i have all that was theirs ask a silly question why the tongues so that the lies of my enemies will not be believed eyelids i will open the eyes of my enemies so that they may never again close their eyes to the truth he was answering questions so nicely that i decided to try for more how did you skin the people without using a tool of some kind tlaloci my priest called the skin from their bodies how i asked my power he said dont you mean tlalocis power he frowned again all his power derives from me sure i said i am his master he owes all to me sounds like you owe him you do not know what you are saying he was getting angry probably not what i wanted i tried another more polite question why take the breasts and penises to feed my minion he did nothing but suddenly i felt the air in the cavern move and it was as if the shadows themselves drew apart like a curtain revealing a tunnel about thirty feet from the foot of where i lay something crawled out of that tunnel the first impression was of a brilliant iridescent green the scales changed color at every turn of the light first green then blue then blue and green all at once then a pearl white glitter that i thought i must have imagined until it turned its head and flashed a white underbelly the green scales went closer to true blue as the color moved up towards the head until the square snout was a clear pure blue the color of sky there was a fringe of delicate feathers in a rainbow of colors around that face it turned and stared at me fanning the feathers around its scaled head into a display that would have been the envy of any peacock its eyes were round and huge taking up most of its face like the eyes of a bird of prey a pair of slender wings was folded along its back rainbow colors of the fringe but i knew without seeing that the underside of the wings would be white it pushed forward on four legs counting the wings it was a sixlimbed animal it was a quetzalcoatl draconus giganticus or at least that was the last latin classification i was aware of sometimes they were classed as a subspecies of dragons sometimes as a subspecies of gargoyles and sometimes they had their own group all to themselves whatever classification the giganticus was the biggest and supposedly extinct the spaniards had killed a lot of them to dishearten the natives to whom they were sacred and because it was just the european thing to do see a dragon kill it it was not a complex philosophy id only seen black and white photos and the stuffed one in the chicago field museum the photos hadnt come close to doing it justice and the stuffed one well maybe it was a bad taxidermy job it glided into the room in a shimmering roll of color and muscle it was literally one of the most beautiful things id ever seen it was also probably what had been gutting people it opened that skyblue snout and yawned showing rows of sawlike teeth the sound of its claws clattered over the stone floor like some nightmarish dog red womans husband lay his spanish helmet on the stone by my legs and went to greet the creature it lowered its head to be petted very like a dog he stroked it just above the eye ridges and it made a low rolling sound eyes closing to slits it was purring he sent it away with a playful push against one muscular shoulder i watched it vanish back through the tunnel like it wasnt real i thought they were extinct my minion helped bring us to this place then it slept a magic sleep waiting for me to awake i didnt know quetzalcoatls could hibernate he frowned at me again and came to stand by my head i know what your word hibernate means but it was a magic sleep done by the last of my warrior priests the priest sacrificed himself putting all of us in an enchanted sleep knowing that there was no one to aid him and that he would die alone in this alien place long before i rose enchanted sleep sounded like sleeping beauty thats true loyalty sacrifice yourself for the better good im so glad you agree it will make what has to happen much easier didnt like the sound of that maybe flattery wasnt the way to go id try something more normal for me sarcasm and see if that led us away from the topic of my impending doom i dont owe you any loyalty i am not one of your followers only because you do not understand he said and those smiling eyes gazed down at me with a look of almost perfect peace thats what jim jones said just before he gave every one the koolaid i do not know this name jim jones then he turned his head to one side and it reminded me of itzpapalotl when she listened to voices i could not hear now i realized that it might just be a way to access other peoples memories ah i know who he is now he looked down at me with those calm beatific eyes but i am no madman i am a god he was getting distracted as if it mattered to him for me to believe he was a god if he had to convince me that he was divine before he killed me then i was safe he could kill me but hed never convince me he was a god he frowned you do not believe me he sounded surprised again and i realized that for all his power he seemed young the ages raged through the eyes on his arms as though you could see back through to the beginning of creation but he himself seemed young or maybe he just wasnt used to people who didnt drop down and worship him if thats all youd known in your entire existence then anyone not worshipping might be a shock i am a god he repeated and his voice had that condescending tone again whatever you say but i made sure my doubt showed in my voice the frown deepened and again i was reminded forcibly of a pouting child a spoiled pouting child you must believe that i am a god i am the red womans husband i am the body that will be revenged on those that destroyed my people you mean the spanish conquistadors yes he said there arent a lot of conquistadors in new mexico i said their blood still runs in the veins of their childrens childrens children no offense but you didnt get those turquoise blue eyes from anyone local he frowned again and little lines formed between his eyes if he kept talking to me he was going to get frown lines i am a god created by my peoples tears i am the power that is left of the aztecs and i am the spaniards magic made flesh we will use their own power to destroy them isnt it a little late to destroy them about five hundred years too late gods do not reckon time as men do i believed that he believed what he was saying but i also thought he was rationalizing hed have kicked the spaniards butts five hundred years ago if hed been able to do it maybe it showed on my face because he said i was a new god then and i did not have the strength to defeat our enemies so the quetzalcoatl brought me here to wait until i grew strong enough for our purpose i am ready to lead my army forward now so youre saying that it took five hundred years for you to go from being a wee little god to a big bad god the way soup needs to simmer for a really long time before its soup he laughed you think very strangely i am sad that you will be dead soon i would make you the first of my concubines and the mother of gods for children born of you would be great sorcerers but sadly i have need of your life we were back to killing me and i didnt want to be there his ego seemed pretty fragile for a deity id see how fragile the offer doesnt sound very appealing no offense he smiled down at me fingers trailing along my arm that we will take your life is not an offer it is a fact i gave him my best innocent eyes i thought you were offering to make me your concubine the mother of gods he frowned at me harder i did not offer you a chance to be my concubine oh i said sorry i misunderstood you his fingers were still touching my arm but they were still now as if hed forgotten he was touching me you would refuse my bed he sounded truly perplexed great yeah i said is it your virtue you are protecting no its just your particular offer doesnt appeal to me he was really having trouble with the concept that i didnt find him attractive he ran his fingers down my bare arm in a tickling brush i just lay there and looked at him i was giving him some of the best eye contact id given anyone this trip because if i looked anywhere else i kept seeing severed body parts wiggling on their own hard to be tough as nails when you wanted to start screaming he touched my face and i let him this time his fingers traced my face delicately gently his eyes no longer looked peaceful no definitely disturbed he leaned into me as if hed kiss me and the eye lashes on his arms fluttered in butterfly kisses along my body i gave a little shriek he drew back what is wrong oh i dont know severed eyelids fluttering against my skin intestines that writhe like snakes around your waist the necklace of tongues trying to lick me pick one but that should not matter he said you should see me as beautiful desirable i did the best shrug i could with my hands chained higher than my shoulders sorry but i just cant get past what youre wearing tlaloci he said the man in shorts came forward and dropped to one knee before him yes my lord why does she not see me as wonderful apparently the aura of your godhood does not work on her why not and there was anger now in his voice in that once peaceful face i do not know my lord you said she could replace nicky baco you said she was a nauhuli as he was you said she had been touched by my magic and it was the scent of my magic that drew the quetzalcoatl to her but she lies under the touch of my hands and does not feel for me that is not possible if my magic clings to her i thought what if its not his magic but i didnt say it out loud what if it was itzpapalotls the being standing in front of me had nearly killed me from a distance hed roared over my mind and taken me and i hadnt been able to stop him now he was touching me and evidently trying things on me and it wasnt working the only thing that had changed was itzpapalotls power filling me for awhile had that made the difference tlaloci stood head still bowed there must be powerful magic at work here my lord first nicky baco is lost to us and now this one is closed to your vision she must be open to my power or she cannot be the perfect sacrifice red womans husband said i know my lord you are the magician tlaloci how can i undo this magic the magician put some serious thought into it several minutes passed while he thought i just lay there trying not to draw their attention back to me finally tlaloci looked up to believe in your vision she must believe in you how do i convince her to believe that i am a god if she cannot feel my power it was a good question and i waited patiently for tlaloci to answer it the longer he thought about it the more delay time i was getting ramirez was coming i had to believe that because my options were limited unless i could figure out a way to get them to untie me i could feel the pen still in my pocket with its hidden blade i was armed if i could get my hands free and if steel could hurt him of course there were the four helpers and tlaloci and a small army of flayed ones so even if the god could die id have to do something about everyone else theyd probably be pissed if i killed their god i just wasnt sure how to get out of this one if ramirez didnt arrive with the cavalry i was in deep shit edward wasnt out there looking for me this time for the first time since i came to i wondered was edward alive please god let him be alive but alive or not edward was out of the rescuing game for tonight i admitted i needed help on this one and the only hope i could count on was ramirez and the police hed been late in the hospital if he were late tonight i probably wouldnt be around to complain tlaloci motioned for his god to follow him a little away from me i think they were whispering things they didnt want me to know why did it matter if i overheard them or not what could they possibly be talking about that they needed to hide from me theyd cheerfully told me they were going to kill me it wasnt like they were trying to protect my feelings so what was going on the red womans husband unfastened the necklace of tongues and handed it to the priest he took off the steel breastplate and one of the skin guys came and took it from him kneeling in front of him he took off the skirt of intestines and another skin guy hurried forward to take it the god never asked them to help him just sort of assumed that someone would be there to help he was almost perfectly arrogant but his ego was fragile an arrogance that had never been tested in the outer world he was like one of those fairy tale princesses that had been raised in an ivory tower with only people who told them how beautiful they were how smart how good until the witch comes and lays her curse maybe i could be the witch though truthfully i wouldnt have known a curse if it bit me on the butt maybe i could be the prince that comes and takes him away at this point i wasnt picky the god was wearing a maxilatl like everyone at the obsidian butterfly had worn but this one was black with a heavy fringe of golden thread hanging in front he wore black sandals set with turquoise which strangely i hadnt noticed when he was wearing all the severed body parts funny how you dont concentrate on the small details when youre scared he walked towards me confidence showing in every step the maxilatl left his lower body bare on the sides from waist to sandals it was a nice length of thigh but you know what they say pretty is as pretty does is this better he asked his voice light almost teasing his eyes back to that peaceful contentment as if things had always gone his way and he didnt see why now should be different itzpapalotl had been arrogant but not peaceful much better i said i thought about remarking on how much i liked seeing nearly naked men but didnt want to take it to such an obviously sexual tone unless i ran out of other options he came to stand beside me again the eyelids were still on his arms blinking at me like the winking lights of fireflies random and alien its a big improvement i said you cant do anything about the eyes on your arms can you he frowned again they are part of me i see that i said but they are nothing to fear if you say so i want you to know me anita it was the first time hed used my name i hadnt thought he knew it until then of course paulina had known who i was the red womans husband reached down to my right wrist and he undid that little piece of metal that held the manacle closed the skinned man who was still standing on the other side of the stone took a step forward hand on the knife at his belt i froze not sure if i was really going to be allowed to have my hand free the god lifted my hand free of the chain and laid his lips on the back of my hand touch them see that they are nothing to fear it took me a second to figure out that them meant the eyes on his arms i was relieved to realize he didnt mean anything below his waist and so not happy that he meant all those eyes i did not want to touch them i wanted nothing to do with anything that had been carved off of a dead body especially while that person had still been alive he held my wrist and tried to bring my hand over his arm but i kept a tight fist touch them anita gently they will not harm you he began to pry my fingers open and i couldnt fight him i could have fought harder maybe make him break a finger or two to persuade me but in the end i was going to lose this wrestling match so i just let him spread my hand open i didnt want anything broken if i could avoid it he guided my hand just above his arm and the eyelids fluttered under my touch i jumped every time one of them blinked but the eyelids moving against my skin in a line of butterfly kisses wasnt as scary the lids felt full as if there was an eye behind them and there wasnt id seen that whats inside them i asked everything he said which told me nothing explore them anita he pressed one of my fingertips to the edge of an eye then he urged me to put the finger inside the eye i pushed my finger into that empty seeming eye and there was a resistance like pushing against something thin and fleshy then my finger was through and i could touch what was inside warm a warmth that flowed through my hand up my arm and spread like a blanket over my body i felt safe warm i stared up at him and wondered why i hadnt seen it before he was so handsome so kind so my finger was cold so cold that it hurt it had that stinging pain that you get just before you lose all feeling in the limb and frostbite settles in and spills over your body and you fall into that last gentle sleep never to wake i jerked my hand back and blinked awake with a gasp what is wrong he asked and leaned over me touching my face i jerked away from him cradling my hand against my chest staring up at him afraid youre cold inside he took a step back from me and the surprise showed on his face you should feel safe warm he leaned over me trying to get me to gaze into his bluegreen eyes i shook my head feeling was coming back into my finger in a stinging rush the way circulation comes back after frostbite the throbbing ache helped me think helped me avoid his gaze im not safe i said and im not warm i looked away from him which put me gazing at the skinclad guy but truthfully even that was better than staring at the god itzpapalotls touch was helping me but it had limits if i fell into his eyes wherever they might be theyd just kill me and i might go willingly eagerly into that last dark you are making this difficult anita i kept my gaze on the far wall sorry that im ruining your night he stroked the curve of my face i flinched as if hed hurt me id thought what i was trying to delay was my death now i realized that i was trying to delay falling into his power theyd kill me after that but id be gone before the knife fell had paulina gone like that willingly eager to please the god i hoped so for her sake for mine i wasnt so sure i want you to believe that your death will be for a great purpose sorry not buying swampland today i could almost feel his puzzlement like a play of energy along my skin id felt anger lust fear dance along my skin from vampires and wereanimals but id never felt puzzlement before i hadnt felt his emotions before i touched that damned eye he was sucking me down a piece at a time he grabbed my hand no i said it through gritted teeth he could break my fingers this time but i wasnt just opening up and touching him again i couldnt just cooperate with him anymore not even to buy time i had to start fighting him now or thered be nothing left of me id had vampires roll my mind before but id never felt anything like him once he got a really good hold on my mind i wasnt a hundred percent sure id come back there are a lot of ways to die being killed is only one of the more obvious ones if he rolled my mind and there was nothing left of who i was then i was dead or would wish i was i flexed my arm hugging it to my chest straining my muscles to keep it there he lifted the wrist and my whole upper body with it but i held the arm fingers closed into a fist do not make me hurt you anita im not making you do anything whatever you do its your choice to do it not mine he laid me back down gently i could crush your hand it sounded like a threat but his voice was still gentle i wont touch you again not like that not voluntarily but lay your hand upon my chest above my heart that is not a hard thing anita no you are a very stubborn woman youre not the first one to say it i said i will not force you the skinned man moved forward until he was directly against the stone mirroring his god he drew an obsidian blade and bent over me i tensed but i didnt say anything i could not touch him again and promise id come out the other side if i was going to die anyway id die whole not possessed by some wouldbe god but he didnt stab me he slipped the tip of the blade under the shoulder of the kevlar vest kevlar isnt meant to stop a stabbing motion but its not an easy thing to cut through especially with a stone knife the empty skin hand that decorated his wrist wobbled back and forth back and forth as he sawed i stared past him at the far wall but my peripheral vision just couldnt get rid of that flopping hand i finally had to stare up at the ceiling but it was just darkness its hard to stare into the dark when there are other things to look at but i tried i almost asked them if they knew what velcro was but didnt it would take them awhile to cut the vest off with an obsidian blade hell i might not have to do anything else to delay them itd be morning by the time the obsidian cut through the material unfortunately i wasnt the only one who figured that out the skin man put the blade back in his sheath and pulled a second knife out from a sheath behind his back the way youd carry a backup gun when he raised it into the firelight it glimmered silver steel with or without high silver content it would still cut through the vest a lot quicker than the obsidian he slipped the tip under the shoulder seam of the vest i finally had to say something you just planning to cut my heart out your heart will remain in your chest where it belongs the god said then why do you want the vest off i finally turned my head and looked at him though not at any of his eyes if you will not touch my chest with your hand there are other parts of your body that can feel he said it was almost enough to make me give him my hand almost i didnt trust what he might consider other parts of my body that could feel but it would take time to get the vest off and if i just gave up my hand that wouldnt take any time at all i needed the time the vest came off quicker than youd think it was not designed to stand up to a sawing blade they pulled the pieces of the vest off me tugging the last from under my back the red womans husband climbed up beside me he knelt staring down at me and he wasnt staring at my face he traced the outline of my bra with the tip of one finger trailing oh so lightly along my skin what is this he traced under the bra back and forth back and forth underwire i said he traced the black lace at the top of the bra so many new things to learn glad you like it i said he didnt get the sarcasm maybe he was immune to it he did what i thought hed do he climbed on top of me but he didnt get into a standard missionary position he scooted lower until his chest was pressed against mine with our height differences that put his groin safely below mine so it wasnt rape that we were doing maybe it was just me that worried so much about that but somehow the knowledge that it wasnt sex he was after scared me more there were worse things he could take from me than sex like my mind his chest pressed against mine smooth warm very human nothing bad happened funny that didnt slow the frantic beat of my heart or make me look him in the eyes do you feel it he asked i just kept staring at the far wall of the cave i dont know what you mean his chest pressed harder against me do you feel my heart beating it wasnt the question id been expecting so i actually thought about it i tried to feel the answering beat of his heart against me but all i could feel was my own panicked pulse sorry all i can feel is mine and that is the problem he said i actually looked up at him then getting a brief glimpse of his face leaning so close below mine the startling glimpse of his bluegreen eyes in that dark face i looked back to the wall what do you mean my heart does not beat i tried to feel his heart then tried to sense the pulse of his life through the warm flesh of his chest concentrating on it slowed my own heart you arent always aware of a mans heart beating against your body but when theyre lying chest to chest you usually feel it but his chest pressed quiet above mine i moved my free hand slowly toward him he raised up supporting himself with his hands so i could press my hand against his chest his skin was warm and smooth almost perfect but nothing beat under my hand either he had no heart or it wasnt beating i am only body the red woman does not live in me my heart is not a fit sacrifice without her touch that made me look back at him i looked into his peaceful eyes sacrifice youre going to sacrifice yourself his eyes stayed gentle and hopeful i will be a sacrifice to the creator gods they need to feed on the blood of a god as they did at the beginning of time i tried to read something in that peaceful handsome face some doubt fear anything i could understand youre going to let your priest cut you up yes but i will be reborn youre sure of that i said my heart will be strong enough to beat outside my body and when it is placed back within me the old gods will return from the exile that your white christ has cast them into his face more than his words said that he did believe it id read enough of the conquest of mexico by the spanish to doubt that christ had much to do with it no matter how many things had been done in his name dont blame jesus christ for what the spanish did to your people our god gave us free choice and that means we can choose evil i believe that thats what happened to the men who conquered your people he looked down at me and he was puzzled again you believe that i can tell you believe that with all my heart i said no pun intended he sat up sitting across my waist most of the people i have taken as offerings did not believe in much of anything the ones who did believe did not believe in your white christ he touched my face but you do yeah i said how can you believe in a god that would allow you to be brought to this place and sacrificed to a foreign god if you only believe when its easy you dont really believe i said is it not ironic that you a follower of the god that destroyed us will be what allows me to come into my power when i have taken your essence i will be strong enough to make the precious liquid and i will be free of this place at last what do you mean take my essence id stopped being afraid because wed just been talking so long or maybe i just cant sustain fear for that long eventually if you dont kill me or hurt me i stop being afraid i will but kiss you and you will become as light and dry as the aged maize you will feed me as the corn feeds men he began to lie down beside me on my right side near my free hand i was suddenly scared again i hoped i was wrong but i was pretty sure id already seen what he meant to do to me at the obsidian butterfly you mean youll suck the life out of me and ill end up looking like a dried mummy he stroked a finger down my cheek his eyes sad now regretful it will hurt a great deal and i am sorry for that but even your pain will go to strengthen me he leaned his face towards mine i had a free hand and a knife in my pocket but if i went for it too soon and failed i was out of options where the hell was ramirez youre going to torture me great i said he drew back from me just a little it is not torture it is the way all my priests waited for my waking who brought your priests back i asked i wakened tlaloci but i was weak and i had no more blood to give the others then before we could raise the others the man you call riker disturbed our place of rest he stared off into space as if he were seeing it over again he found what you called the mummies of my priests many were torn apart by his men searching for jewels inside them anger darkened his face stole the peacefulness from his eyes the quetzalcoatl was not yet awake or we would have killed them all they took things that belonged to my priests it forced me to find a different way to give them back their lives the skins i said he looked down at me yes there are ways to make them give life so you hunted down the people who desecrated your sleeping place and the people who bought the things that belonged to your people yes he said i guess from a certain point of view it was fair if you had no ability to feel mercy then it was a dandy plan you killed and took the organs from the people who were gifted i said gifted he made it a question witches brujos ah yes i did not wish to leave them alive to hunt us before i came into my power he was touching my face again stroking it i think he was getting back on track to give me his kiss what exactly does coming into your power mean i asked as long as i could keep him talking he wouldnt be killing me i could think of questions all night long i will be mortal and immortal i widened eyes at him what do you mean mortal your blood will make me mortal your essence will make me immortal i frowned at him i dont understand what you mean he cupped my face in his hands like a lover how could you possibly understand the ways of gods he held out his hand and the skinman handed him a long bone needle maybe i didnt know what he was going to do whats that for he held the needle maybe four inches long twirling it slowly between his fingers i will pierce your ear lobe and drink your blood it will be a small pain you keep saying you want me to believe in you but youre the only one who never seems to be in pain your priests the people who stole from you all the sacrifices everybody hurts but you he propped himself up on one elbow his body snug against mine if my pain will convince you of my sincerity then so be it he jabbed the needle into his finger deep deep enough to touch bone he drew the needle out slowly making it hurt as much as he could i waited for blood to come to the surface but it didnt he held the finger so i could see the hole the needle had left but the hole was empty no blood as i watched the wound closed like water smoothing perfect once more the knife wasnt going to do me any good not against him does my pain make your pain less he asked ill let you know i said he smiled so patient so kind so full of it he started moving the needle towards my left ear i could have fought him with my free hand but if all he was going to do was pierce my earlobe like id seen at the nightclub then he could do that i didnt like the idea but i wasnt going to fight him if i fought now they might chain my hand back up i wanted the free hand more than i wanted to keep him from sucking on my ear truth is i dont like needles not just doctor needles any of them i have a phobia about small pointed things in my body knives dont seem to bother me but needles do go figure it was a phobia to keep from struggling i finally had to close my eyes because otherwise id have fought i just couldnt help it the pain was sharp and immediate i gasped opening my eyes watching his face lean over me for a second i thought id blown it i thought he was going straight to the kiss then his mouth passed by my mouth he turned my face to the right gently exposing the ear and the long line of my neck it reminded me of vampires except that this mouth licked my ear one quick movement he made a small sigh as he swallowed the first blood then his mouth closed over my earlobe mouth working at the wound tongue coaxing blood from the wound he pressed his body the length of mine one hand cupping my turned head the other playing down the line of my body maybe it was just blood but i never stroked my steak while i was eating it the line of his jaw was pressed to my face i could feel his mouth moving as he swallowed id had vampires take blood without me being under their spell so it had hurt this didnt hurt nearly as much it was more like an overzealous lover with an ear fetish disturbing but not really painful his hand moved from my face to slide inside my bra that i didnt like i thought you said you werent offering sex he drew his hand out of my bra and drew back from my ear his eyes were wide and unfocused and drowning in turquoise glow like the eyes of any vampire when its bloodlust is up forgive me he said but it has been so very long since i felt life in my body i thought i understood what he meant but i was asking every question i could think of tonight anything to keep him talking what do you mean he laughed and rolled on his side to prop himself up on his elbow again he jabbed the needle into his finger again and gasped blood welled up from the wound crimson blood he laughed again your blood runs through my body and i am mortal once more with all the appetites of a mortal man you need blood to have blood pressure i said youve got your first hard on in centuries i get it he looked down at me with drowning eyes you could have it he moved so that his body was pressed against mine and i could feel him pressed against my jeans eager and ready i started to say my usual no then stopped if my choices were being raped or being killed when i thought that help was on the way i debated and i really dont know what i would have said because another of the skinmen ran in from behind us where the silent flayed ones waited i heard the mans running footsteps and turned to watch him push his way through the flayed ones he dropped to one knee in front of the red womans husband my lord armed strangers are approaching the little brujo is with them leading them this way the red womans husband looked at him kill them delay them when i have come into my power it will be too late the skinmen got weapons out of a chest and went running i turned my head to watch the flayed ones trail after them only tlaloci the priest stayed behind it was just the three of us ramirez was coming the police were coming surely i could delay a few more minutes fingers touched my face moving me to look at him you could have been the first woman in centuries for me but there is no time he began to lower his face towards me i am sorry that i must take you as an unwilling sacrifice because you have not harmed me or mine i slipped my hand into my pocket fingers closed on the pen i turned my head to the side so he couldnt kiss me but i was really looking to see where tlaloci was in the room hed moved back to the altar hed thrown paulinas body off to one side like so much garbage he was cleaning the altar preparing i think for his gods death the red womans husband stroked my face trying to turn me gently towards him he whispered breath warm against my face i will wear your heart on the necklace of tongues so that all my followers may remember your sacrifice for all eternity how romantic i said i started easing the pen out of my pocket turn to me anita do not make me hurt you his fingers closed on my chin and began to turn my face slowly towards his i felt his strength in his fingers and knew he could crush my jaw with only a flexing of his hand i couldnt keep him from turning my face up to him i couldnt stop it but i had the pen in my hand now i had my finger on the button that would release the blade i just had to make sure it was over his heart gunfire sounded from outside the cave and it sounded close as if the entrance wasnt that far away then there was a sound like a roaring and i knew what it was because id heard it before the police had brought flamethrowers or found some national guard to join the party i wondered whose idea it had been it was a good one i hoped they all burned i stared up at him his fingers keeping my face looking at him does your heart really beat for me i asked my heart beats blood runs through this body you have given me life and now you will give me immortality the red womans husband leaned over me like prince charming about to bestow the kiss that would make everything all right again his mouth hovered an inch above mine the memory of how seths body had dried died was too vivid i must have rushed to get the pen in position just above his heart he pulled back a fraction of an inch eyes questioning i hit the button and the blade took him through the heart his eyes flew wide all that turquoise fire fading leaving his eyes human looking what have you done youre just another kind of vampire i kill vampires he rolled off the stone fell to the floor he held a hand out to tlaloci the priest rushed over to him i didnt wait to see if there was a cure for the god i undid my left wrist and reached down for my ankles the red womans husband collapsed to his knees and the priest collapsed with him he was crying no no no he pressed his hands around the hilt trying to stop the blood from pouring out his god fell into convulsions on the floor he tried to hold his hands over the wound to staunch the blood i got my ankles freed and rolled off to the other side of the stone call it a hunch but i thought that tlaloci would be upset with me he rose to his feet bloodstained hands held out in front of him id never seen anyone look so horrified so desolate as if i had destroyed his world and maybe i had he never said a word just drew the obsidian blade at his waist and stalked towards me but the rock id been chained to was the size of a large dining room table and i kept it between him and me i kept the distance between us even and he couldnt catch me the gunfire was coming closer he must have heard it too because he suddenly rolled over the stone to slash at me with the knife i ran away from the stone out into the open which was what he wanted i turned and faced him he came for me in a crouch knife held loose but firm as if he knew what he was doing id left the blade in the vampire i faced him hands out from my body not sure what to do except not get cut i thought of one thing i screamed ramirez tlaloci rushed me blade slashing i turned feeling the rush of air as the blade passed there were screams from the stairs the sounds of inclose fighting tlaloci slashed at me like a madman all i could do was keep backing up trying to stay out of reach i was bleeding from both arms and one cut on my upper chest when i realized hed backed me up by the altar i tripped over paulinas body about the second i started looking for it to avoid it i went down on my side her body trapped under my legs i kicked out at him without looking to see where he was anything to keep him at a distance he grabbed my ankle pinning my leg against his body we stared at each other and i saw my death in his face he tossed the knife onehanded so that the grip changed from slashing to a downward stab he had my left leg pinned but my right leg was still on the floor i braced my upper body with my arms leaned my shoulders downward and drew back my right leg i lined up his kneecap tlaloci started the downward stroke i kicked the downward edge of his kneecap with everything i had i saw the kneecap slide sideways dislocated his leg crumbled he cried out in pain but the blade kept coming tlalocis head exploded in a shower of brains and bone the pieces rained down on me and the body fell to one side obsidian blade scrapping along the stone floor as the hand convulsed around the hilt i stared across the cave and saw olaf standing at the foot of the stone steps he was still standing in his shooting stance onehanded gun still pointed at where the priest had been standing he blinked and i watched the concentration leave his face watched something close to human spill across his face he started walking towards me gun at his side the other hand held a knife bloody to the hilt i was wiping tlalocis brains off my face when olaf came to stand in front of me i never thought id say this but damn im glad to see you he actually smiled i saved your life that made me smile i know ramirez came down the stairs with what looked like a swat team in full battle gear behind him they spilled out to either side nastylooking guns pointed at every inch of the cavern ramirez just stood there gun in hand looking for something to shoot national guardsmen in flamethrower gear came next nozzle of the flamethrower pointed up at the ceiling olaf cleaned his knife on his pants sheathed it and offered me a hand the hand was stained red but i took it his skin was sticky with blood but i squeezed his hand and let him pull me to my feet bernardo came into the room with more cops behind him his cast was red with blood the blade sticking out of it so dark with blood it looked black he said youre alive i nodded thanks to olaf he gave a small pressure to my hand then let me go i was late again ramirez said i shook my head does it matter who saves the day as long as it gets saved the other cops were starting to relax as they realized there was no one to shoot is this all one of the blackdecked cops asked i looked back at the far tunnel theres a quetzalcoatl down that tunnel a what a dragon even through the battle gear you could see them all exchange glances monster if you like the word better but its still down there they got into ranks and went past me to the tunnel at a crouched run they hesitated at the tunnel entrance then slipped through one at a time for once i let them go id done my part for one night besides they were a hell of a lot better armed than i was one of them ordered ramirez and some of the other more civvie looking policemen to escort the civilians to the surface ramirez came to stand in front of me youre bleeding he touched the cut on my arm i turned so he could see some of the other cuts pick one bernardo and the other cops that had been ordered to stay behind came to look at the two dead men wheres this red womans husband that the little creep kept talking about one of the cops asked i pointed at the body with the blade sticking out of its chest two of the cops went to stand over the body he doesnt look much like a god he was a vampire i said that got everyones attention what did you say ramirez asked lets concentrate on the important details here hoys we need to make sure that body doesnt get back up trust me he is one powerful son of a bitch we want him to stay dead a cop kicked the body which rolled limply as only the true dead move looks dead to me watching the body roll limply made me jump as if i expected him to sit up and say just kidding im not really dead the body stayed still but it hadnt done my nerves any good we need to take the head and cut out his heart then we burn them separately and scatter the ashes over different bodies of water then we burn the body to ash and scatter it over a third body of water youve got to be kidding one of the cops said the flayed ones just fell down and stopped moving ramirez said did you do that probably when i put the knife through his heart bullets hadnt worked on any of them until the flayed ones fell down then the bullets killed everything she did that the cop asked she made our bullets work yes ramirez said and probably he was right probably it had been me regardless i wasnt going to raise any doubts i wanted them to listen to me i wanted to make sure that the god stayed dead how exactly do we chop off the head the same cop asked olaf went to the chest that the men had gotten their weapons out of and lifted a large flat club with bits of obsidian embedded in it he holstered his gun and walked to the body shit thats one of those damn things they used on us the cop said nicely ironic to use it on their god dont you think bernardo asked olaf knelt beside the body hey we didnt say you could do that the cop said olaf looked at ramirez what do you say ramirez i say we do whatever anita says olaf whirled the club as if getting the feel for it it also made the cops back up he looked at me ill take the head i pulled the knife out of tlalocis hand he wasnt going to be needing it anymore ill take the heart i walked toward him blade in hand the cops kept backing away from us i stood over the vampire olaf knelt on the other side looking up at me if id let you get killed edward would have thought i failed edwards alive then yes a tightness left my shoulders that i hadnt even realized was there thank god i dont fail olaf said i believe you i said we stared at each other and there was still something in his eyes that i couldnt read or understand a step beyond whatever id become i stared into his dark eyes and knew that here was a monster not as powerful as the one that lay on the ground but just as deadly in the right circumstances and i owed him my life you take the head first why im afraid if i take the knife out while the bodys still intact that hell sit up and start breathing again olaf raised eyebrows at me you are not joking me i never joke about vampires i said he gave me another long look you would have made a good man i took the compliment because thats what it was maybe the best compliment hed ever given a woman thank you i said the swat team came back out of the far tunnel theres nothing down there its empty then it got away i said i looked at the body still lying there take the head i want out of this damn cave the swat team leader didnt like us cutting up the body he and ramirez went into a yelling match while everyone was watching the argument i nodded to olaf and he beheaded the corpse in one blow blood gushed out onto the cave floor what the fuck are you doing one of the swat cops asked bringing his gun pointed at us my job i said i put the tip of the blade under the ribs the policeman brought the gun up to his shoulder get away from the body until the captain tells you its okay to do it i kept the knife against the body olaf yes if he shoots me kill him my pleasure the big man turned his eyes to the policeman and there was something in that gaze that made the heavily armed man take a step back the captain in question said stand down reynolds shes a vamp executioner let her do her job i plunged the blade into the skin and it slid home i cut a hole just below his ribs and reached into the hole it was tight and wet and slick and it took two hands to get the heart out one to cut it free of the connecting tissue and one to hold onto it i drew it from the chest blood stained to my elbows i caught ramirez and bernardo both looking at me with nearly identical looks on their faces i didnt think either of them would be wanting a date any time soon theyd always remember watching me cut a mans heart out and that memory would stain anything else with bernardo i didnt give a shit with ramirez it hurt to see that look in his eyes a hand touched the heart i stared at that hand then looked up to meet olafs eyes he wasnt repulsed he stroked the heart hands sliding over mine i pulled away and we looked at each other over the body wed butchered no olaf wasnt repulsed the look in his eyes was that pure darkness that only fills a mans eyes in the most intimate of situations he raised the severed head up by the hair and held it almost as if hed let me kiss it then i realized he was holding it over the heart like a matched pair i had to turn away from what i saw in his face does anyone have a bag that i can carry this in someone finally found an empty equipment bag and let me spill the heart into it the policeman told me i could keep the bag he didnt want it back no one offered olaf a bag and he never asked they found my guns in the chest with the rest of the weapons though the holsters were missing i just couldnt keep a holster intact on this job but i stuffed the guns down my jeans the knives werent in the chest ramirez drove me personally to a crematorium so that i could see the heart and head burned down to ash when i had two little containers of ash it was almost dawn i fell asleep in the seat beside him or hed have had a fight about taking me to the hospital but he insisted that the doctors check me out amazingly enough none of the cuts were even deep enough for stitches i wouldnt even have any new scars miraculous one of the men had given me a jacket that said fbi on it to cover my nearly naked upper body several of the uniforms and most of the hospital staff assumed i was a federal agent i kept having to correct people and i finally realized that the emergency room doctor thought my denial meant i had a concussion and didnt know who i was the more i argued the more concerned he got he ordered a series of head xrays and i couldnt talk him out of it i was actually sitting in a wheelchair waiting to be escorted to xray when bernardo came up he touched the fbi jacket youre moving up in the world when the nurse comes back hell be taking me down to xray you okay just precautionary i said i just came back from checking on the invalids olaf said edward would live he will how are the kids peter is okay they put becca in a room shes got a cast to her elbow i stared at his cast stained a dirty brown that thing is going to start stinking with all that blood dried into it the doc wants me to get a new cast but i wanted to check on everyone first wheres olaf bernardo shrugged i dont know he disappeared once the monsters were all dead and ramirez had you in his car he said something about the job being done i guess he went back under whatever rock edward found him under i started to nod then remembered something that edward had said edward told you that you couldnt have a woman because hed forbidden olaf to have women right yeah but the jobs over babe i am headed for the first open bar i looked at him nodding maybe thats where olaf is he frowned at me olafs at a bar no hes out getting his ashes hauled his way we both looked at each other and there was a moment when horror dawned on bernardos face and he whispered oh my god hes out killing someone i shook my head if hes just out killing at random theres no way to find him but what if its not random what do you mean remember how he looked at professor dallas bernardo looked at me you dont think i mean he wouldnt oh shit i got up out of the wheelchair and said ive got to tell ramirez what were thinking you dont know hes there you dont know hes doing anything wrong do you believe he just went home i asked bernardo seemed to think about that for a second then shook his head neither do i he saved your life bernardo said i know we went to the elevator the elevator doors opened and lieutenant marks was standing there where the fuck do you think youre going marks i think that professor dallas is in danger i got into the elevator bernardo followed you think id believe anything you say witch he hit the button that kept the doors open hate me if you want but dont let her die your pet fbi agent kept me out of the big raid i didnt know what he meant but i was pretty sure who he meant whatever bradley did he did without me knowing but thats not the point i can make it the point did you hear that dallas is in danger did you hear that part i asked shes as corrupt as you are so its okay that she dies a horrible death i said he just looked at me i moved as if to go towards the buttons bernardo caught his clue he hit marks in the head with his cast the man went down and i hit the door closed button the doors hushed closed as bernardo lowered marks to the floor you want me to kill him bernardo asked no but now if i went to ramirez for help marks would think hed been in on it shit do you have edwards car yeah how did olaf drive off then bernardo looked at me if hes really doing this hell steal a car and ditch it away from the murder scene he wont chance using edwards car hell go back to edwards house for his goody bag i said the doors opened on the floor that hed parked on we got out what do you mean goody bag if hes going to cut her up then hell want the tools he normally uses serial murderers are very anal when it comes to how the victims are treated they spend a lot of time planning exactly what theyll do and how so hes at edwards how long has he been gone three hours maybe three and a half no hell be at dallass if thats where he is at all bernardo opened the car and we got in i had to take the browning out of my pants the barrels just too long for sitting down like that i ended up holding it in my lap i watched bernardo drive with his castwrapped arm you need me to drive im fine just tell me where dallas lives and ill drive us shit he put the car in park and looked at me the police would know the address when marks wakes up well be lucky to stay out of jail i said we dont even know that olafs at her house he said i got a better one how to explain that we know he was a serial murderer and didnt warn the police sooner do you have edwards cell phone i asked he didnt argue just leaned across and opened the glove compartment i got the phone out who you going to call itzpapalotl shell know the address shell eat olafs face maybe maybe not either way you better get us out of the parking area before marks wakes up and starts screaming he drove us out of the parking lot and started slowly down the street i dialed information and the operator was happy to dial the obsidian butterfly for me it was daylight i knew better than to ask for itzpapalotl herself so i asked for pinotl and told them it was an emergency and it was anita blake i think it was my name that got me through as if theyd been expecting the call pinotl came on the line with his rich voice anita my mistress said you would call i was betting that shed been wrong on the why but pinotl i need the address for professor dallass house silence on the other end of the phone shes in danger pinotl then we will take care of it im going to have to call the police in on this pinotl theyd shoot your werejaguars on sight you are worried about our people he said give me the address and ill take care of it for you pinotl silence except for his breathing tell your mistress thanks for her help pinotl i know im alive now because she helped me you are not angry that she did not tell you all she knew shes a centuries old vampire they cant help themselves sometimes she is a goddess were just arguing semantics pinotl we both know what she is please give me the address he gave it to me i read the directions to bernardo and off we went i called the police on the way i made it an anonymous call saying id heard screams i hung up without giving my name if olaf wasnt there then theyd scare the hell out of dallas and id apologize id even pay for any busted locks why didnt you tell them the truth bernardo asked what i think that some serial killer is there murdering her and how do you know this maam well officer you see its like this ive known he was a serial killer for days now but our mutual friend ted forrester had forbidden him from attacking women while he was here helping us solve the mutilation murders youve heard of the mutilation murders who is this its anita blake the vampire executioner and what does an executioner know about serial murderers more than youd think i looked at bernardo all right all right theyd still be asking questions when we arrived at the house this way theyll send an albuquerque pd car there asap theyll get there before we can even come close i didnt think you even liked dallas when we met her it doesnt matter if i like her or not yes it does he said if i dont like her then we just let olaf butcher her is that it he saved your life he saved mine we dont owe this woman anything i looked at him trying to read his face from just the profile are you saying that you wont back me on this bernardo because if youre not on my side on this then i need to know because if we go up against olaf and you hesitate then youre going to get yourself killed and maybe me if i go in ill go in ready to kill him if i said i owe him my life anita while we were at rikers we saved each others lives we counted on each other and knew the other one would be there i dont owe this dallas chick anything then stay in the car a thought occurred to me or are you saying that youre on his side really on his side i had the browning out in my hand already i clicked the safety off and he heard it i saw him stiffen well thats not fair if i take my left hand off to pull a gun then we wreck i didnt like the way the conversation was going i said all im saying anita is that if we can save dallas and let olaf get away we should let him go itd make things even between us all if dallas is unharmed ill think about it thats the best i can do but let me remind you if you plan on killing me to help olaf that edward is going to live hed hunt you both down and you know it hey i never said anything about pulling down on you just trying to test the limits of our misunderstanding bernardo because trust me you dont want me to misunderstand you theres no misunderstanding bernardo said and there was no teasing in his voice just a dry seriousness that reminded me of edward i think its shitty to turn olaf in to the cops theyll already be there bernardo if theres only two uniforms we can help him get away are you talking about killing the policemen i didnt say that dont dont go there because not only will i not follow you ill bury you there for two cops you dont even know yeah for two cops i dont even know why he said i shook my head bernardo if you have to ask that you wouldnt understand the answer he glanced at me edward said that you were one of the best shooters hed seen quick to kill he said you only had two faults you got too up close and personal with the monsters and you thought too much like an honest cop an honest cop i like that i said ive seen you anita youre as much a killer as olaf or me youre not a cop you never were whatever i am we are not killing the cops on sight if dallas is unhurt well discuss letting olaf go but if hes hurt her then he pays if you dont like the plan then give up your weapons and wait in the car ill go in alone bernardo looked at me whats to keep me from lying to you keeping my guns and shooting you in the back youre more afraid of edward than you are grateful to olaf you know that for a fact he said i know that olaf has more rules of honor than you do if youd really felt all that damn grateful youd have said something before i called the cops being protective of olaf wasnt your first thought or your second or even your third edward said you were one of the most loyal people hed ever met so why arent you protecting olaf he preys on women bernardo he preys on them not because hes paid to or owes them vengeance but because thats what he does hes like a vicious dog that keeps attacking people eventually you have to put it down youre going in there planning to kill him bernardo said no no im not remember if i kill either of you ill either owe edward another favor or ill have to draw a gun on him and finally find out which of us is better i dont think ill survive the latter and i have not had a good time honoring edwards favor i got a glimpse of his other life at rikers place i dont want to be in another firefight its not my cup of tea its not anyones cup of tea bernardo said you just get used to it you dont get used to shit like that like you dont get used to cutting out peoples hearts you did that like an old pro i shrugged practice makes perfect this is the street bernardo said the street had that just past dawn silence the cars still sat unmoved in their driveways but there were people standing in their driveways peering out at the marked police car that was sitting in front of dallass house one of the doors was open filling the quiet neighborhood with the radio squawk the lights rotated pale and underdone like a childs toy in the heavy morning light professor dallass house was a small ranch with those faux adobe walls that everyone was so fond of here in the earlier morning light it looked almost golden as if it glowed bernardo parked by the road well i asked im with you but before we could draw guns the two uniforms came out of the house with dallas in a robe we sat there staring at her smiling at the policemen while they apologized for bothering her she looked up noticed us she looked puzzled but waved at us anita look at the mailbox bernardo said our car was almost right in front of the mailbox there was a white envelope pinned to the front of the mailbox with a knife my first name was printed in block letters on the front of the envelope no one had noticed it yet but us edwards car was tall enough to hide it from the neighbors can you help me hide it from the cops my pleasure i got out of the car leaving the browning on the seat because i couldnt figure out a way to put it down my pants without the police noticing me doing it and i didnt have any id on me i might be able to fake being a fed but then again maybe not and its it a federal offense to impersonate a federal agent bernardo and i had assaulted a police officer we didnt need any more charges bernardo pulled the knife out making the movement look natural the envelope dropped into my hand and i walked up to the house hitting my thigh with the envelope as if id carried it from the car neither of the cops yelled halt thief so i kept moving i didnt know what bernardo had done with the knife it had just vanished hi dallas whats up someone made a prank phone call about screams coming from my house whod do such a dastardly thing bernardo asked i frowned at him he smiled at me pleased with himself did you get a call too she asked i got it bernardo said they called edwards cell phone said you were in danger the uniform cops made the same mistake that the hospital staff had made they introduced themselves by rank and name and shook hands i said anita blake this is bernardo spottedhorse hes not a the policeman looked uncomfortable as soon as he started to say it no im not a federal agent bernardo said there was bitterness in his voice its the hair i said theyve never seen a male agent with long hair sure it was the hair the uniforms went off leaving us at dallas doorstep in the morning light with her curious neighbors coming out in drips and drabs to see what was happening at an hour past dawn on the quiet street would you like to come inside i already started coffee sure bernardo looked at me but followed me in the kitchen was small square and neat like one that wasnt used much but it was cheerful in a blaze of morning sunlight whats really going on anita i sat down at her table and opened the envelope with my name on it it was written in block letters anita i knew that moment in the cave that you would think as i did i felt that you would know where i would go to hunt now here you are i am nearby that made me look up he says hes nearby bernardo drew his gun he stood and began to watch the windows i went back to the note i have watched you come to the good professors rescue i watched you take the envelope and i know you are reading it now i belittled edward when he spoke of soul mates i owe him an apology when i saw you take his heart so practiced i knew that you were as i am how many have you killed how many hearts have you ripped out how many heads have you taken youll argue with yourself that you are not as i am maybe you dont take trophies but you still live for the kill anita you would wither and die without the violence what trick of fate has made you physically the woman i kill over and over again and yet put inside that tiny body the other half of my soul are most of the vampires you kill men do you have your victim preference anita i would love to hunt with you at my side i would hunt your victims because i know you will not hunt mine but we would still kill together and cut the bodies up and that would be more than i ever dreamed of sharing with a woman the note wasnt signed big surprise there since i might have given it to the police you look pale dallas said what does the note say bernardo asked i handed it to him i dont think hes out there to kill us or even her who are you talking about she asked i told her and she laughed at me you know im a vampire executioner yes i killed another vamp last night one i think that itzpapalotl wanted me to kill she helped me do it thats the heart that i took bernardo read faster than i would have thought jesus anita olaf has a crush on you a crush i said a crush god theres got to be another word for it dallas asked can i read it i think you should because he didnt wait just to catch a glimpse of me he waited because if i hadnt shown up hed have come in here and butchered you she tried to laugh it off but there must have been something in my face that choked the laughter and made her reach a shaking hand out for the letter she read it and said who is this olaf i said but he was so nice bernardo made a harsh sound trust me on this dallas olaf is not nice she looked from one to the other of us youre not kidding are you hes a serial killer i just dont think hes ever killed in this country you should turn him in to the police she said i dont have any proof of what hes done besides bernardo said what if he was one of the vamps what do you mean dallas asked he means wouldnt you protect one of the vamps from the police because youd know that the vamps would take care of it i said well yes i guess and well take care of this bernardo said she looked from one to the other of us and for the first time she looked afraid will he be back for you i dont think so bernardo said he looked at me but i bet hell find a reason to come to st louis id have liked to say he was wrong but the cold tight feeling in my stomach agreed with bernardo id be seeing olaf again i just had to decide what id do when i met him he hadnt done anything wrong on this trip not only couldnt i prove he was a serial killer he hadnt done anything worse than id done this time round who was i to throw stones yet yet i hoped he stayed away from me for more reasons than i wanted to admit maybe maybe for the same reasons that id kill him if he came because maybe there was some truth to what he wrote i had over fifty kills what really separated me from people like olaf motive method if those were the only differences then olaf was right and i couldnt let him be right i just could not accept that growing up to be edward was a problem growing up to be olaf was a nightmare epilogue marks tried to press assault charges but bernardo and i said we didnt know what he was talking about doctor evans said that his injuries were inconsistent with being hit by a person it wouldnt have worked except that marks was in the doghouse about how hed handled the case he was in on the press conference where the public was assured that the danger was over but ramirez was standing up there beside him along with agent bradford and me they put ted and bernardo up there too we didnt get to answer questions but we got our picture in the papers id have rather not but i knew it would please bert my boss and they did print it in several national papers that i was anita blake of animators inc bert loved it edward caught a secondary infection from something that had been smeared on the stake he took a relapse and i stayed donna and i took turns sitting by his bed sitting by beccas bed it got to the point where the little girl cried when i left peter spent a lot of time playing games with her trying to get her to smile but his eyes had that hollow look you get when youre not sleeping well he wouldnt talk to me or donna the only thing hed admitted to her was the beating he hadnt told her about the rape i didnt betray his secret first i wasnt sure she could handle another shock second it wasnt my secret to tell donna actually rose to the occasion she was like this incredible pillar of strength for the kids for ted even though he couldnt hear her talking to him she never once turned to me in tears it was like this new person had risen from the ashes of the person id first met it saved me having to hurt her ten days after the accident edward was awake and talking out of danger i could finally go home when i told them i was finally going home donna hugged me tight and cried and said you have to tell the kids goodbye i assured her i would and she left us alone to say our goodbyes i pulled the chair up to the bedside and studied his face he was still pale but he looked like edward again that cold bleakness was back in his eyes when no one but me was looking whats wrong he asked it couldnt just be because you nearly died i said no he said i smiled but he didnt smile back bernardo came to see me but olaf never did he said i realized then what he thought id waited around to tell him you think i killed olaf and ive been waiting for you to get healthy enough to give you the same choice you gave me after harley died i laughed sweet jesus edward you didnt kill him i watched him relax against his pillow visibly relieved no i didnt kill him he managed a faint smile it wouldnt have been the same choice but if youd killed olaf you wouldnt have wanted to owe me another favor you were afraid id press the point make it the gunfight at the ok corral yes he said i thought you wanted to see which of us was better i thought i was dying on the stairs all i could think of was that peter and becca were going to die in there with me bernardo and olaf were there but youd gone up the stairs and hadnt come back when you came back around that corner i knew youd get the kids out i knew youd risk your life for theirs bernardo and olaf would have tried but the kids wouldnt have been their first priority i knew they would be yours when i passed out in the cave i wasnt worried i knew youd see it right what are you saying edward im saying if you had killed olaf id have given you a pass on it because peter and becca mean more to me than that i took olafs letter out of my back pocket and handed it to him he read it while i watched his face nothing moved but his eyes he had no reaction hes a good man at your back anita youre not suggesting i date olaf he almost laughed no fuck no stay as far away from him as you can if he comes to st louis kill him dont wait for him to deserve it just do it i thought he was your friend not friend business associate its not the same thing i agree someone needs to kill olaf but why are you so adamant all of a sudden you trusted him enough to bring him here to your town olaf has never had a girlfriend hes had whores and hes had victims maybe its true love but i think if he shows up and finds that you wont be his little serial killer pinup girl that hell turn violent you dont want to know what hes like when hes violent anita you really really dont youre scared hell come after me if he shows in town call me i nodded i will i had other questions rikers house sprang a mysterious gas leak and blew to kingdom come no survivors no bodies no evidence that we did shit or that riker and his men did shit was it van cleef not him personally edward said you know the next question i said i know he said youre not going to tell me are you i cant tell you anita one of the conditions to leaving was to never talk about it with anyone if i break that theyll come after me i wouldnt tell anyone he shook his head no anita trust me on this one ignorance is bliss that is incredibly frustrating i said he smiled i know and im sorry no youre not you love keeping secrets not this one he said there was something close to sadness in his eyes and for the first time i realized for sure that once there had been a kinder gentler version of edward he hadnt been born this way hed been made like frankensteins monster no answers huh no he said we stared at each other but neither of us seemed impatient okay i said okay what he asked i shrugged you wont answer questions about your background fine answer another one are you going to marry donna if i say yes what will you do i sighed i was willing to kill you to keep you away from them when i got here but what is love edward youre willing to give up your life for the kids youd do the same for donna shes convinced youre her dream man its a good act becca told her what you did what we did peter backed it so in a way they all three know what you are who you are donnas cool with it i stopped talking was there an answer to my question in there somewhere i wont do anything edward youre willing to die for them if thats not love its so close i cant tell the difference he nodded nice that i have your blessing you dont i said but i dont have room to throw stones at your personal life so do whatever you want i will he said peter hasnt told donna what happened to him he needs therapy for it why didnt you tell her its not my secret to tell besides youre his wouldbe stepfather and you know i trust you to do the right thing by him edward if he doesnt want donna to know youll find a way around it youre treating me like his father edward said how much did you see of what peter did to amanda enough edward said he emptied the clip into her edward he turned her face into spaghetti the look in his face i shook my head hes more your son than donnas and has been since he blew away his fathers killer when he was eight you think hes like me like us i said like us i dont know if you can rebuild someone that got that broken that early im not a psychiatrist healing peoples not my job its not mine either he said i never thought you missed the pieces of yourself that you gave up to be who and what you are but when i see you with donna and becca and peter i see regret in you you wonder what life might have been like if you hadnt met van cleef or whoever the hell was first he looked at me eyes cold it took me a long time to understand what i saw in donna how did you know i shrugged maybe the same thing i thought saw in ramirez its not too late for you anita its too late for me to have the white picket fence edward maybe i can figure out something but not that its too late for that you think ill fail with donna he said i shook my head i dont know i just know it wouldnt work for me im not the actor you are whoever im with has to know who i am warts and all or it wont work you know which monster youre going to settle down with no but i know i cant keep hiding from them hiding from them is like hiding from who i am im not going to do that anymore you think im running from myself by going with donna no i think you always embraced the monster part of you youre finding for the first time that not all of you is dead as you wanted it to be donna appeals to a part of you that you didnt know was left yes he said and what do richard and jeanclaude represent for you i dont know but its time i found out he smiled but it wasnt a happy smile good luck the same to you i said were going to need it he said id have liked to argue but he was right i did call itzpapalotl before i left for home she was disappointed that i didnt come in person but not angry i think she knew why i didnt want to shake hands again shed killed every minion of every rival vamp that crossed her path for fifty years but me she hadnt harmed a hair on my head i thought she wanted the secret to the triumvirate and that had interested her but that hadnt been what saved me shed set me up to kill the red womans husband shed given me the power to both attract him and withstand his charms id been her bait and her weapon now the other god was dead and i was leaving her territory before she decided that id outlived my usefulness she extended an invitation to my master we could have much to discuss your master and i i told her id pass along the invitation i will but theyll be ice skating in hell before i bring jeanclaude down to meet itzpapalotl shed gobble him up maybe edwards right maybe richard and i would survive jeanclaudes death but surviving his death and surviving whatever itzpapalotl would do to him are two very different things there are so many easier ways to kill jeanclaude ways that would be less risky to richard and me i know thats what edward wants me to do several of my friends are voting that way but i get presidential veto and i dont want him dead im not sure what i do want but i know i want him walking around so i can decide im going home and im going to start by seeing all the friends ive neglected for the past few months so ronnie is dating richards best friend so what she and i can still be friends catherines had two years of honeymooning time i stopped using that as an excuse not to see her i think im just uncomfortable with how terribly happy she is with a man that i found ordinary and a little boring but she glows around him i havent done much glowing lately around either of my two men im going to start seeing the werewolves in richards pack again and jeanclaudes vamps first renew friendships then if that works out okay ill see the boys its a cautious plan nah cowardly but its the best i can do okay its the best im willing to do because the truth is that i am no closer to a solution to my love life than i was when i broke off with them over a year ago the few times i fell off the celibacy wagon dont count because i was still trying to avoid them i dont want to avoid them i just want to know what exactly it is that i do want once i figure out what i want who i want the next question is can i have who i want or will the loser pull our little house down around us in bloody ruins i would say its the sixtyfour thousand dollar question but richard and jeanclaude are worth so much more than that to me maybe ramirez is right maybe if i truly loved one of them the choice would be easy or maybe ramirez doesnt know what the hell hes talking about edward loves donna and peter and becca theyre all seeing a therapist together but i think peter is still lying about what really happened you cant get good therapy if you lie to your therapist but i think peter is counting on edward to be his therapist scary thought isnt it edward loves donna do i love richard yes do i love jeanclaude maybe if its really yes for richard and maybe for jeanclaude then why dont i have my answer because maybe just maybe there is no one right answer im beginning to worry that whatever i decide i will be left mourning the one that got away once id been afraid if i chose richard that jeanclaude would kill him rather than share me but strangely the vampire seems willing to share and richard isnt maybe jeanclaude loves the power of the triumvirate more than he loves me or maybe richard is just jealous i certainly wouldnt share either of them with another woman fair is fair which brings me back to the original question who is the love of my life maybe i dont have one maybe its not love at all but if its not love then what is it i wish i knew
