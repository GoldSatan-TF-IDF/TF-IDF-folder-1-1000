marion lennox a child in need the first book in the parents wanted series prologue my perfect woman yeah nick you must have someone pictured in that cool calculating head of yours if you were ever to consider marriage ha no but say your career depended on it say you really needed a wife who would it be nicks fellow lawyers were clustered around the bar late on friday night and they werent letting him off the hook so nick thought about itbut just to humour them there was no way this could ever be serious okay wife requirements coming up he frowned anyone i married would have to be independent i dont need a wife so she couldnt need a husband there was a hoot of derisive laughter and the questioning intensified we guessed that much independent okay what else beats me nick gave a mental shrug this was stupid marriage wasnt on his cards at all but if it was shed have to be really something he said slowly thinking it through tall and gorgeous of course oh of course his friends agreed rolling their eyes catwalk gorgeous trophywife gorgeous nick agreed after all thats the only reason id be marrying and smart absolutely professional something a lawyer or a doctor maybe so shed have her own life rich yep theres no chance im supporting any woman thats a bit unfair you make a mint and thats the way i like it wealth position travel what else is there in life how about kids they asked curiously you have to be joking that was emphatic no now how did we guess that his friends now had their summary so gorgeous intelligent rich independent wanting no ties cold as ice something like you in fact am i cold nick asked mildly but he knew the answer of course he was cold nick daniels kept his emotions to himself he didnt get involved not after what hed been through so this conversation was ridiculous marriage for nicholas daniels was never going to happen it must be getting close nowor has john popped the question already shanni mcdonald laughed and shrugged they were a strange partnership these two shanni kindergarten director at twentyseven still looked about sixteen her assistant marg was in her fifties but they worked together brilliantly there was only one disadvantage as far as shanni was concerned margs age meant she was never backward in asking the hard questions so now she was waiting for an answer and there was only one to give not yet he will i can feel it and youll agree cos he has to be your perfect man i guess isnt he just what youve always wanted marg demanded dont you have a list she held up one finger after another lives locally and never wants to move loves animals and kids family man loves the country has room to stable horses and house half a dozen kids your families like each other everythings right then john fits everything on the list i guess he does shanni said and tried to stop the note of doubt creeping into her voice but marg was astute enough to hear it so whats wrong shanni caught herself and shrugged nothing i guess when he pops the question ill be the happiest girl in the world after all he is my perfect match where could i find a better partner in life than john chapter one the man who just might interfere with her wedding plans wasnt talking marriage now nick had other things on his mind all bleaker than the thought of an unwanted wife i dont want to be a magistrate in hicksville i dont wish to be within a hundred miles of this placeso why on earth am i here it was a good question but there were sensible answers nick daniels had one burning ambition and one onlyto make highcourt judge historically once a lawyer joined queens counsel he could be appointed a judge without leaving the city but that was hard to do now there were new rules no one wanted the country magistrate positions and there was only one way to force aspiring judges to take them on if you want the plum job then you need to do the hard work first nick had been told by the head of his chambers politically theres no other way theres a job going as local magistrate at bay beach great little fishing town four hours drive from melbourne youre not marriedyouve no kidsno ties to keep you in town put in the hard work there boy and well see what we can do for how long nick had been aghast two years two years you never know abe barry had sucked his pipe and had surveyed his hawklike junior with the beginnings of amusement nick was too darned clever by half if he didnt get shot of him soon nick would be edging him aside as chamber head before he knew it you might even enjoy a spot of rustic idyll you could apply for a county court judge position and stay there for life in your dreams no in your dreams and i know you dream of the big one abe had told him the steel in his voice telling nick he had no choice in this but theres only one way to get it youve had a taste of magistrate work already so you know the ropes now take yourself off to the country and show us what youre made of what im made of nicks hands clenched the wheel of his sleek little sports car until his knuckles showed white magistrate at bay beach it was an uninspiring name for an uninspiring place nightmare stuff accustomed to bigtime criminal cases now hed be dealing with parking infringements fines for illegal fishing and not much else though it served as a base for a much larger fishing and farming community bay beach township had less than a thousand inhabitants sofishing and farms what qualifications did he have for judging farming or fishing disputes what did he know of either farms gave milk steak or wool which was exported to italy and returned as nicks superbly tailored suits and fishing fishing produced salmon and caviar that was the end of nicks interest in farming and in fishing period two years as country magistrate two years of purgatory he rounded the headland still groaning bay beach lay before him its whitewashed stone cottages glistening in the morning sun the fishing fleet was coming inat least it must be the fishing fleet there were six boats heading into harbour and surely there couldnt be many more boats than six in this endsoftheearth place ill go stark staring crazy he told himself the sea air was blowing warmly on his face but he hardly noticed his skin was so tanned he didnt fuss about protection and his deep black hair was combed into submission so firmly the sea air didnt shift it he sniffedand wrinkled his aquiline nose in disgust salt and cow dung ugh give him petrol fumes and city pollution any day another bend in the road and the town limits came into view there was a petrol station on this side of the town boundary and on impulse nick pulled in he had to fill the car with petrol and he might as well do it nowgive him a few more minutes before he entered this dump he pulled up to the bowser looked idly over at the youth pulling petrol at the pump beside himand his life changed for ever i need to go to the bathroom shanni sighed and rolled her eyes as threeyearold hugh made his life or death announcement it was friday morningthank heaventhe end of a week which seemed to have gone on for ever marg can you take hugh her assistant at bay beach kindergarten was preparing milk and fruit this would be margs fourth trip to the toilet during reading and the way they were going milk and fruit wouldnt be ready until lunchtime but needs must calm and unflappable marg grinned goodnaturedly shrugged and took hughs hand okay hugh lets go but wed best hurry this is a very exciting story miss mcdonald always tells exciting stories hugh announced i tell them to my dad and my dad says why cant exciting things like that happen around here i guess pirates wouldnt be a very peaceful thing to have around in real life shanni said thoughtfully what do you think boys and girls would we like it if a real live pirate climbed through the window ohhh no but as shanni went back to reading she couldnt stop a vague feeling of regret ohhh no but maybe not a piratebut something sometimes bay beach was just too quiet for words i wouldnt mind one very small pirate she thought as she went back to reading of dirty dicks dastardly deeds an image of her john rose before herkind and placid and as immovable as the friesian cows he ran on his property theyd be married soon shanni knew all in good time when hed paid off the new dairy and had enough to put a decent size down payment on a new home he had it all planned out just a very small pirate she whispered to herself and then went back to her bookwhich was the only place around here that things happened it was len harris nick stared at the youth beside him and the name was burned into his brain they were all of two feet apart no two weeks back nicks junior elsbeth had taken len on as a duty solicitor case and shed asked nicks advice hes on his ninth conviction but hes only sixteen how do i keep him out of remand home you dont nick said skimming through the file and closing it with a snap of finality hopeless save your talent for something worthwhile he probably wont even get to court elsbeth said morosely ill spend days on this and then hell skip bail which was exactly what must have happened nick had seen him in his precourt briefing len had been dragged into chambers by his social worker and like elsbeth nick had thought the kids chances of making court were somewhere between zero and none len had looked surly defiant and fearless which was just the look he gave nick now the youth stared at him for a long minuteenough to recognise nick as surely as nick recognised himand then he swore he threw the fuel hose aside so it snaked away still spurting petrol he leaped into the mercedes he was drivingthat had to be stolenand he spun out of the petrol station leaving a trail of burned rubber behind him harry dont you want to hear about the pirates before she returned to reading shanni tried one more time to attract harrys attention harry was three years oldalmost fourlike the rest of her classbut harry was different abused and battered hed only just joined the kindergarten after being moved from an uncaring family situation into one of the five homes that made up the local orphanage you dont need to take him on if you dont think you can cope shanni had been told by the welfare authorities but of course shed taken him how could she not harry was enough to wrench the most hardened of hearts harrys leg was recovering now from a break which had been poorly tended in the past it had needed resetting and because the healing was taking so long it was bound in a fibreglass cast with an inbuilt heel the whole structure seemed much too heavy for such a little body the child was so smalllittle more than a baby reallyand he was permanently withdrawn from the world he spent his kindergarten time underneath the furthest table and if shanni or anyone else tried to drag him out he kicked and screamed until he was allowed to return after a month in kindergarten shanni was no closer to reaching him than the day hed arrived but still she tried this is a really exciting book she told harry but the huge eyes peering out distrustfully at the world edged further back into the shadows the rest of her children were waiting shanni sighed and kept on reading pirates pirates and problems police its nick daniels here the new magistrate nick was back behind the wheel of his car and was barking into his mobile phone theres a youth driving south into town in a grey mercedes hes sixteen a bail absconder and erratic as hell hes seen me and thinks im after him the way hes driving hes heading for trouble im driving behind him but ive backed off so he doesnt think im chasing him hes turning left toward the coast hes no shanni read on he took his cutlass in his hand and waved it fiercely over his head give me all your treasure the pirate yelled and miss mary frowned youre not a very polite pirate hasnt your mummy ever taught you to say please dirty dick glowered and waved his cutlass some more all your treasure i said there was an almighty smash and a huge grey car came crashing through the kindergarten fence shannis book dropped to the floor as the car ended up with its nose pressed hard against the kindergarten windows its crashed nick was still connected to the police his handsfree phone letting him concentrate on driving as he talked dear god its a kindergarten im pulling up back off dont let any police near hes capable of doing something really stupid but even as he said it he heard sirens in the distance and knew it was too late len sitting dazed and scared witless in his smashed car would hear the sirens too if he was capable of getting out of the car what would he do now and suddenly nick knew he swerved into the kerb got out left his car where it was and started to run children dont move marg stay with them marg had burst back into the room at the sound of the crash and was staring out through the cracked windows at the mess outside her jaw was sagging almost to her waist call the ambulance and the police shanni could see smoke drifting up from the engine if the driver was trapped she moved fast toward the doorand then stopped dead a boy was climbing from the wreck he looked about fifteenskinny and undergrown filthy windcheater ripped jeans long fair hair that hung down over his eyes he had a cut on his forehead and he staggered as he took his first step shanni opened the doorand then saw what he was holding as she saw him he saw her and raised his hand a gun was levelled straight at her heart what the her words were barely uttered before she was interrupted dont move dont do anything stupid it wasnt the boy it was a mans voice tough and authoritative shanni her hand still on the door and standing as if she was frozen looked beyond the boy and saw a man behind the smashed mercedes he couldnt be more different from the boy he was in his thirties immaculately dressed in smart casual trousers a linen shortsleeved shirt and a tie that must have set him back a kindergarten teachers weekly salary he was oliveskinned darkeyed and tallsix foot or so to shannis fivefour his jetblack hair was combed back in citysophisticate style and his bone structure was strong andand male for want of a better word very male in short he looked a man accustomed to strength and accustomed to command his deep brown eyes were creased against the sun and his words were sharp incisive and they flicked like a whip len dont do anything stupid youre hurt put the gun down and let us help you the boys breath hissed in as he wheeled to face him and his fear was palpable you were going to put me away you and that stupid other lawyer well no chance im not going to remand school he waved the gun back at shanni and his hand trembled get inside then he turned and waved it at nick you too you try anything and the lady gets it his hand wasnt trembling enough the gun was too steady to do anything else there was nothing for it but to obey so in the kindergarten there were now twentyfive goggleeyed children one goggleeyed kindergarten assistant len and shanni and nick lineline up against the wall len sounded desperately unsure the sirens in the distance were getting closer everyone leave the children on the mat shanni said in a voice that made nick take a closer look at her no fainting or hysterics here then shanni was diminutive far shorter than nick with shoulderlength blonde curls running riot blue eyes and freckles she was wearing jeans and an oversized mans shirt smeared with finger paints she looked about sixteen but her voice was authoritative and as sure as an experienced schoolmarm well sit on the mat with the children she told him then you can point the gun at all of us and the children wont be frightened len took an audible breath he really was a child himself okay the gun waved wildly outside a siren cut off and there was the sound of running feet you he waved the gun at nick stand just outside the door tell them tell them what nick too sounded calm much calmer than he was feeling fear and guns and tiny children this had all the makings of a nightmare tell them not to come in or ill kill someone ill go he took a step toward the door no len was indecisive and terrified changing his mind in the instant if you want me to give them a message fast then i need to go outside nick said calmly i cant tell them anything from in here ill kill the kids if they come in i understand but i need to go outside to tell them that now or theyre coming in he cast a swift glance at shanni hoping desperately there were some brains behind the riot of blonde curls then he looked back at len forcing his voice to sound calm as he spoke to him if you stay behind me you can keep the gun trained on me while i speak i theyre coming in len no the boy was clearly frightened half to death he waved the gun at the room in general the children were stunned into absolute silence and shanni had sunk down onto the mat beside them and len made up his mind go out he ordered nick tell them what i said but im behind you the rest of youdont move or ill kill him and he shoved the gun into nicks back and pushed him out the door there were sirens screaming from everywhere how many cops did they have in this town nick thought bleakly still noise was good if the kindergarten teacher had any brains at all let her have one neuron at least she did shanni knew exactly what she needed to do the boy had threatened the strangerhed shoot him if they movedbut shanni couldnt allow herself to worry about that her firsther only responsibility was to her children len and his hostage were no sooner out of the door concentrating on the advancing police than she was sending a silent message to marg with her eyes lets get them out of here she had to risk talking a little i want absolute silence she whispered to the children forcing herself to stay on the mat so her eyes were level with theirs somehow she had to keep calm not one peep out of anyone this is a pirate game just like weve been talking about so the order is that you stay quiet as mice and stay exactly where you are until i touch you then when i touch you on the shoulder you run outside to marg just as fast as your legs can carry you but not one sound or dirty dick will win the game then with a final commanding glance at the childrendaring them to disobeyand one cheeky grin to show them it was still funshe rose practically shoved the still boggling marg toward the back door and she touched hugh whod been standing with marg okay run hugh you first now louise go now mary sam tony faster good kids outside and marg will get you right away from dirty dick go nick took a deep breath there were police running toward the place and somehow he had to stop them somehow he had to raise his voice stop right now they stopped but to his horror nick saw that two of the police had their guns drawn greata gun battle with him as the meat in the sandwich he needed to talk and he needed to talk fast he raised his voice and yelled im nick daniels and behind me is len harris lens jumped bail after armed robbery charges he has a gun trained on my back and hell kill me if you come closer he was trying to give as much information as he could in the little time he had but it was as much as he could manage to make his voice work at all let her be moving the kids i didnt tell you to say who i was lens gun jabbed nick hard in the back and nick grimaced with pain just say say one step closer ill kill you there were three policemen now within listening range theyd been running but had stopped dead at nicks words one step closer and hell kill me nick repeated flatly i mean it len yelled and the gun dug deeper now get back now heck did he have the gun cocked somehow nick had sounded calm enough but there were rivulets of sweat running down his forehead but the police had the message okay were backing up the first policeman held out a hand signalling the others to stop behind him what do you want i dunno yet len yelled i gotta think you give me space i got all these kids in here dont touch the children the closest policemans voice rose in fear and nick looked more closely at the officer he looked in his thirtiesaround the right age to have a child of his own in there were going back inside the gun jabbed again into the small of nicks back it hurt dont follow thats all im telling him to let some of the children go nick yelled dragging back against lens insistent pull he cant keep all of them tell him im right he was desperately buying time here len was staring straight out at the policemen and his attention was solely on the outside and inside surely there was a back door in the kindergarten surely the woman wouldnt be so stupid as to stay still and wait for this crazy kid to return he had to give her time you cant keep twentyfive kids hostage the policeman yelled confirming nicks impression yep this officer knew the kindergarten right down to the number of children inside he had personal involvement here that was good nick figured no policeman was going to try heroics if his kid could be caught in the crossfire were the children moving out out of the corner of his eye nick saw a flutter of movement behind him a wisp of colour against the building fast removed please i aint letting any of them go len snarled and you come closer and i kill them one by one he jabbed nick again grabbed his collar and hauled him backwards into the kindergarten at first sight nick thought shed got them all away there wasnt a child in sight but then he saw a neat denimed backside sticking up from underneath a side table and his heart sank surely she hadnt tried to hide as len gave a roar of rage shanni turned to face him her arms cradling a tiny boy you should have gone right and left harry an hour later they were seated against the wall as far from either door as len could set them len was standing opposite staring out through a chink in the closed curtains every so often hed swivel to stare at his hostages and only now had he calmed down enough for them to dare speaking for a while there nick had feared for this girls life but shed stood up to len as shed emerged from under the table to face him i dont care who you are or what youre doing but you dont need twentyfive tiny hostages you have me you have this man and you have one child shed tilted her chin defiant and seemingly fearless and if you hurt harry shed held the child closer then youll only have one hostage because youll have to kill me too and there had been enough steely determination in her voice for len to know hed heard the absolute truth shed looked beautiful nick thought stunned hed never seen anyone with such courage this woman took his breath away and what shed achieved somewhere outside twentyfour children were being reunited with their parents with only one remaining here one emaciated baby with wide eyes and a leg in a cast a baby who sat ramrodstiff on shannis lap and didnt make a sound if only shed been a little faster why didnt you get harry out too he asked looking down at the child surely he wasnt old enough for kindergarten you didnt give me enough time she whispered he was under the table yeah right he didnt understand but he heard the note of accusation in her voice and it wasnt only about not giving her enough time her accusation made him blink you blame me for this you chased him in here of all the stupid hey i didnt his voice rose and he bit his lip and cast a wary glance at len len though was too busy looking outside at the gathering forces of the law he saw me at the petrol station and assumed i was after him youre a cop a lawyer oh great her voice said what she thought of lawyers in generaland one lawyer in particular this is not my fault nick said through gritted teethhe wasnt used to being talked to like this by a woman shanni glowered darkly and held harry closer im not listening i need someone to blame and a city lawyer with a toothin tie and expensive aftershave will do very nicely thank you very much he blinked for heavens sake she waslaughing at him he must be mistaken women didnt laugh at nick daniels and women didnt laugh in situations like this her attention was back on the child now and she was ignoring the reaction shed had on nick her arms were hugging the little boy trying to draw his rigid little body into hers hey harry its okay its okay she rocked him back and forth as shed been rocking him for over half an hour but there was no sound was he mute nick wondered watching woman and child he knew nothing about babies maybe all children reacted like this to fear his mum and dadll be beside themselves with worry he ventured no shanni shook her head harry lives in one of the houses of the local orphanage his house mum wendy will be waiting outside though wont she harry silence nothing is he all right nick stared down at the little boy there was something wrong here apart from the cast on his leg he mightnt know much about children but he wasnt stupid hes fine shanni sighed as fine as each of us are in this mess she bit her lip and then seemed to do an inward shrug retrieving a hand from around harry she extended it in his direction im shanni mcdonald and this is harry lester im nick daniels he took her hand in his and found it surprisingly warm and strong different she was a very different woman from the type he was accustomed to he decided but he couldnt quite figure out why or why she made him feelodd well at least she wasnt falling into hysterics on him he decided thankfully he managed a faint smileand found her eyes disconcertingly twinkling at him i could say the same for you she said i beg your pardon i can guess what youre thinking and like you im really pleased youre not the fainting type we need a couple of cool heads here a couple of cool heads nick blinked she was implying she could help get them out of this messand she seemed almost to be able to read his mind dont do anything he said hurriedly the last thing they needed here was heroics im not stupid she said with dignity not like some people i know then she bit her lip and the twinkle appeared again harry mr daniels might have chased a pirate right into our kindergarten but maybe we should be nice to him shall we offer him some milk and fruit milk and fruit its what you eat she said austerely in a kindergarten and then before he could say a word she raised her voice len len wheeled from the window as if shed yelled and the gun whirled to point straight at her to nicks amazement she didnt react with fear but with purpose rising to her feet with harry still cradled in her arms no fast movementsbut determined for all that sit down lens voice cracked in panic but shanni simply shook her head i cant she said i need to go to the bathroom no there are no windows in the bathrooms she said evenly check and see theres only roof vents and im not that athletic no one is she smiled and her smile would have stopped a tank in its tracks len if you dont let me go youll be sorry i i bet you want to go too she said thoughtfully what with all this excitement tell you what why dont you take your gun and mr daniels and harry into the boys room while i use the girls room you can keep your gun on them and i swear i wont go anywhere he stared at her baffled make as many threats as you like she said calmly you dont need to im promising and i dont break promises i will not try to escape you have my word i wont leave harry but if we cant work bathroom arrangements out were going to be very uncomfortable yes he thought this through if you try and get away ill shoot the kid i mean it i told youi wont leave without harry she said and her eyes were direct and honestso that even nick who didnt trust anyone trusted her i swear and to nicks amazement len agreed chapter two as he agreed to almost everything else she suggested through that long afternoon and night len might be a criminal with a record a mile long but he was also still child enough to respond to shannis authoritative schoolmarming and cheerful smile in fact he almost seemed to like it and as night fell and she warmed milk for him he even gave her a hint of a shy smile in return ta think nothing of it she said ignoring nicks look of amazement she glanced at her watch it was almost ten after a dinner of bananas apples and milk there was nothing more she could do to make them comfortable or to defuse the tension i guess we should all try to sleep now that was too much to expect dont be stupid len clutched his mug of milk in one hand his gun in the other and stared out into the night like a hunted thing thered be scores of policemen outside now nick knew with sharpshooters police psychologiststhe works the police had tried over and over to talk to len through the long afternoon but his fear hadnt let him take the first step the phone was off the hook and he was simply ignoring the loud hailer it was looking as if it would be a long long night you dont mind if we try to sleep then shanni gestured down to the mats they used for the childrens naps she had blankets and pillows piled upeverything they needed do what you want len almost snarled and nick thought hes tired he wants to sleepbut he darent so shanni spread out the bedding two sets of mats three feet apart nick glanced down at them and casually pushed them together itll be warmer he suggested and shanni looked thoughtful but she didnt disagree come on harry she said and slipped down between mat and blankets holding the child close as if she really did intend sleeping nick stared down at them for a long momentand then did the same there was nothing else to do but sleep with her weird len had the lights turned off so he could see outside more clearly nick lay staring up into the dark he was trying to sleep on kindergarten mats for heavens sake with a woman and child by his side he could feel the warmth of shanniher arm was brushing his and he was acutely aware of every movement sleeping with a woman had never seemed like this strangely it had never seemed so intimate she was some woman she made him feel no it was hardly the time to think like this now think of something else the child harry hadnt said a word all day nick remembered dragging his thoughts from where they kept straying right to the feel of shanni the thought of shanni stop it daniels get a hold on yourself keep thinking of the child harry harry had eaten the fruit shanni had fed him and hed drunk his milk hed gone to the bathroom and submitted while shanni had given him a wash all the time hed seemed totally aloof though his wary eyes had been watching every move anyone made nowin the dark nick sensed he was still being watched the little boy was between them with shannis arms around his shoulders holding tight shannis arms comfy shanni murmured and nick grimaced comfy as ill ever be would it have hurt to have fulllength blankets he had blankets draped all over him but with threefoot kindergarten lengths it took four pieces to cover him we dont get many sixfoot students in this place shanni chuckled and the weird sense of intimacy deepened but in the faint light filtering in from outside nick saw her cast a glance across at len she wasnt focussed entirely on nick or harry then she was checking their talking wasnt making len edgy but lens attention was all on the outside it was okay to keep talking mr daniels is a bit big for our beds isnt he harry she said softly into the dark there was no sound from harry but he wasnt asleep does he ever talk who harry shanni gave harry a squeeze to which the child didnt respond at all only when he wants towhich isnt often harrys just new at our kinder he hasnt learned yet that were his friends and were never going to hurt him sothe kid lived in an orphanage and he thought adults were things to be feared nick frowned stunned into silence at the unexpected guttwisting wrench of sympathy he felt for him which was stupid this wasnt like him he didnt get involved emotionally ever come on harry love shanni was whispering settle down let me cuddle you he didnt his eyes watched everything supremely distrustful ill stay awake with harry shanni suggested you try and sleep first maybe its not such a good idea for both of us to sleep i think its a great idea nick said thoughtfully they were whispering into the dark and len seemed to neither know nor care this isnt like the movies the police know their business and at least one of the officers out there is personally involved theres no chance theyll come storming in guns blazing unless len makes any stupid moves well still be here tomorrow and hes not desperate yet you know about this about hostage situations for the first time nick heard a note of fear enter her voice she wasnt as tough as she sounded he thought but then neither was he this wasnt a game im a criminal lawyer ive coped with the aftermath of hostage situations and i know the last thing the police will do is escalate the situation theyll keep talking and waiting they can change shifts and theyll act like they have all the time in the world he smiled across into her worried eyes with what he hoped was his most reassuring smile he watched her face as she thought this through and the fear eased a little so tonight len wont sleep and tomorrow hell be overtired as well as terrified he went on thereforewe sleep now so we have our wits about us tomorrow it sounds sensible shanni whispered into the dark you hear that harry daddy whispered harry and shanni closed her eyes it hurt wendys waiting outside for you sweetheart daddy harry said and his voice broke with a tiny sob wheres his dad nick asked dead shanni said shortly car accident oh no he didnt get involved he didnt but after that one tiny sob there was nothing else harry was holding his grief all to himself hey it was too much for nick the child was cradled between themcloser than nick had ever been to a child before this he reached over and touched the little boys face his arm touching shannis as he moved daddys not here but i am he said and a part of him couldnt believe what he was saying will i dojust for now there was a long long silence harry watched him questioning and just as gravely nick watched back then suddenly as if he could bear it no longer the massive restraint broke harry reached out and put his arms around nicks neck he gave a shuddering sob clung as if he was drowning and he slumped onto his chest he shuddered once more gave a racking sob that convulsed his whole body then went absolutely limp and then he slept what sort of man was this shanni lay awake for far longer than nick and harry the boys slept the lawyer and the baby the contrast was almost ludicrous harry tiny fair and frail with his leg in its fibreglass cast and with the hurts to his small body only just fading and nick danielswhoever he was a city lawyer of some kind he looked lean and tough and ruthless len had run from him because he was afraid and shanni didnt blame him if shed thought she was in nick daniels power shed run too he looked like a hawk she decided strong and not an ounce of spare fat on him his face was almost chiselled with a strong jaw line and deepetched bones he was so tanned his eyes seemed constantly in shadow which furthered the impression of an eagle and yet with his tie undone with the tiny boys arms clinging around his neck he seemed in some strange way almost as vulnerable as the child in his arms that was some crazy thought shanni figured vulnerable no this man was a city lawyer with expensive clothes and looks that would make him stand out like a sore toe in bay beach thelma the local laundress would have kittens if she was asked to clean his suit shanni decided and his ties the locals had learned long ago that gorgeous fabrics simply disappeared when thelma got them into her clutches she loved them and hoarded them as her own if she ever got her hands on nicks tie itd take all his legal wiles to get it backand shannis money was on thelma good grief that was a crazy thought she figured and she almost chuckled into the darkness here she was in a life and death situation and all she could think of was legal battles between a city lawyer and the bay beach laundress but it was a good thought she decided finally it was a brave thought and it was better than going to sleep thinking of hunger and guns she closed her eyes and to her amazement she went to sleep with a smile on her face when nick woke shanni still slept he looked across at her in the filtering dawn light and thought how odd that her mouth was curved into a smile in sleepas if she was having a lovely dream the little boy was cradled between them and her hand was over him as if shed protect him even in sleep nicks arm was around harry and she was pressed against it they were twined together as three like afamily the thought was suddenly gutwrenchingly bitter how would the likes of nick know what a family was this scenario was fantasyworld stuffnot real life and real life was intruding nick stirred and the fantasy ended right there hed slept with harry clinging his neck was screaming its protest and harry was clinging still he reached up and tried to loosen the small arms but harry muttered in sleep and his hold tightened he should pull the child awaybut he couldnt make himself do it somehow instead nick returned his attention to shanni telling himself he needed something to distract him from the discomfort around his neck or maybemaybe it was that he really wanted to look at shanni some more extend the family fantasy she wasnt his type at all he decided as he watched her sure she was lovely enough but she was totally unsophisticated in style and much more simply dressed than any woman nick had ever been attracted to she was dressed as a kindergarten teacher ready for roughandtumble with her children now her jeans and her toobigshirt were crumpled from sleep and her blonde curls were tumbling all over her pillow there was a smattering of freckles running down her nose and her lashes were peculiarly dark for one so blonde but it wasnt mascara that was doing itthey were long and natural and curled upward just like her nose sort of snub pert young she wasnt his type at all he decided and why he should lie here staring at her she opened her eyes and she smiled and his gut kicked in that smile of hers was a real heartstopper straight from sleep it lit her face and brightened the room around her as if someone had flicked on a light switch hi she whispered without moving but taking everything in with wide intelligent eyes are we still hostages her smile stayed where their arms touched was warma link of comfort or more yes were still hostages good grief it was all he could do to make his voice work but were not dead yet she yawned and stretched like a cat under her mound of blankets and the link strengthened as her body stirred against him thats something yeah great try sarcasm daniels well it is her eyes reproached him trust a lawyer to look on the gloomy side theres no need to disparage the legal profession oh ive met some very nice lawyers her eyes twinkled at him teasing all of them over eighty it takes them that long to realise theyre human after all thanks very much dont mention it the twinkle peeped out again isnt this cosy very cosy it was tooabsurdly cosybut he forced his voice to sound dry for the life of him he didnt know how else to react my arms about to drop off it must be she agreed sympathetically but nick its lovely how hes holding you harry hasnt held anyone in the whole time ive known him im honoured that was the lawyer in him now being sardonic but she ignored it you are indeed she said seriously if you knew how hard weve worked to get a link and then she paused butyoure not local are you no but so youre just passing through town there was no mistaking her disappointment and for the life of him nick couldnt stop a weird warm glow stir through his bodystarting from the toes up and then she killed it we want harry so much to form a bond with someone she wanted someone for harry of course what else could she possibly have meant you meanyoud want me to stay for the kid isnt that why women always ask men to stay because of the children she chuckled they were still talking in whispers in the near dark and they were almost nose to nose over by the window len either couldnt hear or he didnt care what else did you think i meant what indeed there was no answer to that one the glow diedbut the link stayed her nose was too close so youre from melbourne he had this almost overwhelming desire to kiss her and she was talking social niceties it was as much as he could do to figure out what she was talking about i yes and youre in bay beach on business she sounded politely interestednothing more i am and then he weakened he might as well tell her soon the whole district would know im taking over from judge andrews rotating magistrate rotating magistrate her eyes widened her eyes lit with pleasure and her lovely smile practically enveloped her face then youre not leaving youre here for two years thats fantastic he chewed that over for a bit why is it fantastic he asked cautiously and here it came of course because harry likes you yes yes he does her eyes darkened and intensified nick you mustnt look like that she put out a hand and touched the little boys soft hair harry was dead to the world sleeping the sleep of the exhausted as his body was cradled between them hed forced himself to stay awake far too late last night he hadnt trusted anyone but in nicks arms hed felt safe harrys had a dreadful time she said simply i dont need to he wasnt wanted she went on ignoring his interruption his mother has two children by a previous marriage and she didnt much like harrys father peter was landed with him at birth peter you meanthe father kept the baby thats right it was okay for a while peter took harry with him everywhere and he loved him to bits butalmost a year ago he and harry were in a car accident peter was killed there was a little money from the sale of peters house held in trust for harry so bernadetteharrys motherdecided shed take harry in again onlyshe didnt like or want harry for himself and it showed you mean she mistreated him dreadfully her luminous eyes swelled with tears in the dim light he had a smashed leg in the accident and after she took him home she never went near the doctor again he needed physiotherapy and he never got it if you knew the condition he was found in when welfare finally took an interest she took a deep breath anyway thats in the past hes safe now settled in one of the homes of the local orphanage system and with you he seems to have finally made some contact im not a contactable person nick said bluntly and shanni stared from all of six inches away why ever not i dont like children come on she teased him gently with her eyes youve let him give you a numb arm only because i didnt want him howling the place down liar its the truth sure her tone said she didnt believe him but she was moving on she glanced at her watch and as she moved her arm shifted away from his he was aware of a surge of emptiness as she did a link broken that hed valued but she didnt notice its six am i wonder how the siege is going patiently theyll wait for weeks if need be nick told her i know our police force theyll wait this out please he added beneath his breath the thought of anyone bursting in here with guns blazing left him cold but a week we cant live for a week on milk and fruit shanni brushed her curls back from her face and stood up decision written firmly all over her good morning len she said softly louder than shed been talking to nick but still not so loud that shed wake harry len wheeled to face them he looked dreadful nick thought dispassionately the youth looked absurdly young to carry the weapon he had in his hands and he lookeddesperate the hands that held the gun shook with weariness and fear shanni saw youre exhausted she said softly you must sleep ill sleep when i want to sleep lens voice was an attempt at a vicious growl but it broke in midsentence marking his youth okay shanni made a placating gesture and sat down on her mat again with them sitting len seemed to relax as if they couldnt spring on him but she kept right on speaking len im really hungry how about if we order in pancakes pancakes theres a fastfood outlet on the edge of town they deliver youve got to be kidding nick said as len stared in disbelief youre proposing we just ring up and tell them to drive in through the barricades i dont see why not shanni smiled her very nicest smile at lenthe smile nick was beginning not to trust it could make a man do strange things that smile my brothers a policeman hes out there somewhere if i talked to him i reckon we could swing it no pancakes and maple syrup and hot chocolate she said beguilingly steaming hot len could well have eaten nothing the day before nick figured then watching the look of raw need flash across his face he must have stolen the car on thursday night and maybe hed been on the run ever since hed had one glass of milk last night and all that was left was fruit cold and unappealing i can do this safely shanni assured him then she paused sneezed grabbed a tissue from her sleeve and sneezed again she grinned as she emerged from her tissue sorry guys hay fever its that time of the year anyway she sneezed again and reassembled honestly she was incorrigible just let me phone and you can listen to every word i say she gave len a happy grin as if he was a friend and then she sneezed again for good measure one more sneeze and she was back to entreaty hey len if you dont like what i do you can shoot me in the toeand its not every day i offer a toe im very attached to my toes len glared shanni sneezed again she sniffed and recovered and smiled once more her very nicest smile len im just a kindergarten teacher with hay fever she said and the lawyer in nick made him stare if he heard this innocent little voice in a witness box hed know she was lying through her teeth but len was no lawyer and she had him dazzled im not some hotshot lawyer with brains like my friend here she said waiflike all im saying is that were hungry and i can organise us a great breakfast but youll have to trust me he still glared shanni sneezed she looked so innocent nick thought shed pulled off her trainers she was barefooted fresh from sleep and her curls were unbrushed and tangling around her face she sneezed again and he wondered how on earth shed ever got this job in charge of a kindergarten she didnt look as if she should be in charge of anything butthere was this tiny twinkle behind her eyes that he mistrusted sorry drat my stupid hay fever she said weakly late springs my worst season theyre cutting hay all around the town and mornings are dreadful and im so hungry len please let me ring my brother you can listen to every word the room held its breath and finally len nodded between pancakes sneezes and smiles he seemed bewitched as nick was okay be fast and im listening shanni smiled she sneezed once more and crossed to the phone and the twinkle stayed hello she dialled emergency and to her relief it took her straight through to the command post outside they must have had the line rigged so every call was monitored police here its shanni mcdonald she said shanni she recognised the voice of the local police inspector and it was hoarse with worry a siege like this must be every policemans nightmare are you okay lass were fine len nudged her in the ribs with the gun on the mat harry stirred in nicks arms and nick sat up cradling the child against him they looked sort of cute shanni thought looking across at the outoftown magistrate and his babybefore concentrating carefully on sneezing again some things were important apart from cute lawyers and lens patience was running out the gun dug into her ribs harder this time and she turned her attention back to what she was doing inspector were very hungry she said all of us i can understand that youre not planning on starving us out tell us what you want she took a deep breath pancakes she said hot food and plenty of it we thought fastfood pancakes maple syrup and hot chocolate from dons diner we can do that how will we get it in have someone put it on the doorstep len wont shoot anyone carrying pancakes will you len the youth was listening to every word being said standing right against her as she talked while the gun stayed pressed into her side she sneezed and he backed off a bit inspector yes i need my hay fever pills she added rob will know the strong night ones i didnt say anything about no len started but shanni sneezed again she gave him an apologetic smile please she said nicely and he grimaced okay he snapped and tell him i want a helicopter that might be harder than pancakes and hay fever pills shanni said mildly and len swore and grabbed the phone i want a helicopter he told the policeman to get me away from here youll leave the hostages behind the inspectors voice was carrying and shanni could hear every word theyll come with me ill dump them where im going itll take time to organise the policeman said urgently maybe all day theres been a storm north of here and emergency services are stretched a helicopter by tonight or someone gets it ill try and get them pancakes len crashed the phone back on the cradle and went back to staring out the window while nick watched shanni whod forgotten to sneeze are we having pancakes harry asked rubbing his sleepy eyes and nick nodded and gave him an impulsive hug when really he wanted to hug shanni thanks to your clever kindergarten teacher we might well be having pancakes then as shanni sat down beside them again nick lowered his voice so only she could hear and said and hay fever tablets to boot how about that if youre thinking what im thinking shanni mcdonald that could make us all feel very much better the pancakes arrived and were delicious though for the life of him nick couldnt urge harry from his knee shanni fed him his pancakes in pieces like a little bird and every time nick tried to put him aside the child forgot about food and turned and clung nick found it claustrophobicand shannis delighted smile made it worse i dont like children nick said through gritted teeth and she chuckled yeah right i can see that but you dont have to like children just harry and len len ate his pancakes as if he hadnt seen food for a week shanni had opened the door and pulled the tray inside and len had fallen on it as if all his christmases had come at once luckily whoever had organised it had decided to provide enough to feed the teeming masses otherwise thered have been none for anyone else that was wonderful shanni said after her third pancake she sneezed as she carried the litter back to the bench and fetched the mugs of hot chocolate and whats coming is better still she twisted the cap off the bottle of hay fever pills my pills sorry guys now i can stop sneezing she carried mugs of hot chocolate over to nick and harry and then to len at his watching post by the window thank you for letting us eat she said softly smiling down at him it was kind yeahall right he looked longingly at the chocolate it was thick and creamy with a melting marshmallow floating on top but the sight disturbed him we shoulda got coffee coffeed keep us awake im sorry she sounded so contrite it was pathetic if you dont want this im sure harry would like two mugs ill drink it he snapped go away hot chocolate nick looked thoughtful as he sipped now why didnt you order coffee shanni mcdonald we have coffee here for marg and i to use instant his tone said what he thought of that this isnt metropolitan melbourne she snapped youve come a long way from cappuccino society here i understand that he grimaced he certainly had but id assume your fastfood chain provides decent coffee not as sweet of course or maybe he cast a glance at len whod drained his chocolate and was back staring intently out of the window maybe not as disguising just drink your chocolate and shut up shanni snapped and wait and see and wait and see your sneeze seems to have stopped those pills must be very effective i do hope so she said simplyand waited they waited an hour len was rocking on his stool by the window the curtains were still drawn and shanni hadnt turned on the light its cosier in the almost dark she said and lay on her back and told harry the story of the very hungry caterpillar still within the safety of nicks arms harry listened and shanni thought it was the first time shed ever known harry to listen at all she held her breath and waited and it wasnt just the pills she was waiting on it was strange nick decided surrealistic for nick accustomed to living life at full speed to be forced to lie and hold a child and listen to the exploits of a makebelieve caterpillar hed never done such a thing in his life the whole world held its breath over at the window shanni could sense len was listening too and waiting she made her voice calm and warm and even and when harry dropped off to sleep again she wasnt surprised what did surprise her was nick gently he disengaged harrys clutching fingers let the little one slip sideways onto the pillows and then with a questioning look at shannia helpmewiththis lookhe rose and crossed steadily to len at the window shanni watched him every step of the way her hand coming down to cradle harry so he wouldnt notice nicks absence len nick said softly his head jerked up he was so close to sleep yes youre cold boy he pushed the reading chair forwardthe only comfortable chair in the kindergarten it was padded with a high back and he tossed a couple of cushions on for good measure it might take hours for the helicopter to arrive if youre not comfortable your muscles might cramp up and youll fall off your stool use this one he pushed the chair against the window then as len hesitated he threw a couple of blankets on top make yourself comfortable he suggested why are you doing this lens face was all suspicion if you fall off the stool chances are that gun will go off nick said bluntly then youll have every cop in the country storming in neither of us wants that and then he grinned and you let us have pancakes his smile was beguilingeven shanni was beguiled for heavens sake and this man was a lawyerand it worked a treat len didnt answerhe glaredbut he grudgingly moved from his hard stool to the comfortable chair and when nick offered blankets he threw them over his knees and almost managed a smile of thanks itll get better nick said and shanni practically gaped in astonishment at the sympathy in his voice this isnt the end of the world you know what would you know about it defiancebut also fear i know you havent killed anyone i know youre young and young offenders dont go to jail they go to remand homes where if they want they can learn a trade i know theres a heart under that tough exterior i cant and you love cars nick said softly i can see that he motioned out of the window to where the smashed grey mercedes lay between them and the police if you have to steal cars at least you steal cars with class its taken a darn sight more skill to steal this baby than a cheaper job his dark eyes twinkled down at len and it wasnt just len who was mesmerised shanni was speechless this was a whole new facet to the man up until now she hadnt been able to see past the smooth exterior but nowthere was a human being in there somewhere if youre willing to learn about mechanics while youre in remand school id bet thered be luxury car dealers whod be prepared to take you on he said yeah like who like my uncle shanni interjected smiling up at nick as if he was talking absolute sense he runs a dealership i know one of his lads has a police record but my uncle doesnt careas long as he keeps straight now and knows how to fix his engines he wouldnt employ me youd have to do your time first shanni said thoughtfully but if you put your time in the remand home to good use i aint going to remand school hey len just think about it nick urged gently while we sleep another story i think nick said as he returned to his mat shannis eyes were wide with appreciation as were nicks this woman was extraordinary as hed made len warm and comfortable and soothed his terror shed given len what he most neededhope len was dead tired and if nicks guess was right he was full of sleeping pills now all they had to do was set the moodand shanni was right onto that how about if i read goodnight goodnight she suggested harrys asleep already nick said reluctantly hed lifted harry into his arms again unthinking as if it was an instinctive movement it was starting to feel as if the child belonged there he might wake up if i dont keep reading shanni said softly if i keep my reading going ill soothe him into sleeping for ever or who else might she soothe into sleep it was soseductive shanni had turned on the heater and the room was warmalmost overwarm the huge breakfast had made nick feel so sated he almost needed sleep again himself even though it was only two hours since hed woken the child in his arms slept on and on catching up on missed time shannis voice was low and sweet and melodicsoothing him toward rest if nick hadnt been watching len but he was he was watching len like a hawk the gun was slowly slipping it must be so heavy please let those outside not use the loud hailer or try to contact him again nick thought but if shannis brother had twigged as to why she wanted the hay fever tablets then they wouldnt be so stupid they werent shanni read and nick watched lenand nick watched shanni he watched the gentle rise and fall of her breast and he listened to the soft lilting of her voice if i was three years old this is where id like to go to kindergarten he thought dazedly and had to shake himself no one had ever read him stories not ever for heavens sake he was thirtytwo years old this was stupid he was feeling like this just because it was a novelty a situation like this a woman like shanni hed never met anyone like her and finally her voice fell away to nothing and shed succeeded hes asleep she said softly at the window lens face had fallen forward so his chin was resting on his chest his gun had fallen to one side in the chair and his hands were lifeless his chest rose and fell in a slow steady rhythm len shanni asked softly leave him be for a bit nick said weve worked on this lets not spoil it by hurrying weve worked on this he grinned at that tension easing okay smartyboots youve worked on it how many tablets did you give him four at twentyfive milligrams enough to stop the worst sneezing even mine she said virtuously she wrinkled her nose and her eyes danced see not even a sniffle miraculous how many did you take hmm somewhere between zero and none i cant quite remember he smiled and they waited on both knowing that once len was deeply asleep they had nothing to fear ten minutes fifteen it was strangely intimate sitting in a pile of bedding holding the child in his arms with shanni watching over them he has such huge problems she said out of the blue who were they talking about len they werent harry of course she sighed placing a hand on harrys mop of fair curls im so worried about him theyre threatening to put him into a home for psychologically disturbed children is he psychologically disturbed she shrugged maybe wouldnt you be if your dad was dead and your mother and stepfather hated you and then she frowned at the look on nicks face why what have i said nothing he somehow put aside shadows of past hurt and shook his head this has nothing to do with me or you either as far as i can see hes just one of your students isnt he what do you get from taking the worries of the world onto your shoulders meaning you think im stupid for trying maybe he shrugged she gave him a long measuring look no you dont mean that for a lawyer i thought you were pretty good to len just then im a magistrate i have to learn niceties legal niceties not human niceties butyou were nice just now it wasnt all an act how did she know that she didnt so how about you then he demanded changing tack talking about him made him feel like running a mile surely your familyyour uncle with the car dealershipwouldnt seriously think about employing such a kid theres no hope for him if someone doesnt she said sadly so maybe its just as well there are people like my family in the world people who care people wholl get walked all over says you she shrugged the nice magistrate who tries so hard not to be nice i mean and then she smiled letting him off the hook where he was beginning to squirm anyway maybe she cast a long look across at lenand another at harry while we have both our children sound asleep i think its time we got ourselves out of here dont you i couldnt agree more ill get the gun it was time to leave but there was a part of hima part which he didnt understand in the leastthat didnt want to leave at all there was no choice move but when he went to hand over harry the childs arms tightened like a vice and if nick had tried to disengage him he would have woken and sobbed so when the kindergarten door opened and shanni nick and harry emerged to the huge relief of the waiting constabulary it was the new town magistrate who was holding the baby and it was the kindergarten teacher who was holding the gun chapter three and after that it was oversort of police officers surged into the building and emerged with one dazed sixteenyearold who looked half asleep and as if he didnt know what was happening please look after him shanni said softly as he emerged handcuffed and secured hes just a scared kid but the police were taking no chances he was taken away sirens screaming while nick and shanni blinked in the unaccustomed daylight and harry stirred in nicks arms and started to sob a womanin her late twenties dishevelled and fearfulemerged from the crowd and tried to take him from nicks arms harry oh baby weve been so worried come to wendy this then must be the woman in charge of harrys home within the orphanage but harry was unimpressed he clung desperately to nick and as she tried to take him he screamed but nick had had enough there was nothing more he could do he unfastened the desperate fingers and placed the weeping bundle of baby into the womans outstretched arms hes all yours no i want to stay i want to stay with my nick harry was screaming with desperation and shanni reached forward to hug him harry dont worry nicks staying here for two years maybe we can visit he had no intention of travelling down that road no way we can visit you nick shanni asked and something snapped i dont think so why ever not she sounded astounded this was blackmail he thought desperately he had to get out of herefast and it was kinder to be blunt see that mountain up there hed had more than he needed of this emotional heartpull what a way to start a new life harry look at the mountain he told him he raised his voice now he could still get through to him harry stopped sobbing for long enough to stare up to where mount borrowah towered over the town thats where i live nick said flatlydefinitely im sorry mate but visiting mes impossible he softened then just a little but it was great to meet you you be good for wendy now and he turned away before he could see the childs face crumple into despair then followed the police debriefing hours of it with question after question what had happened what threats had been made nick and shanni were interviewed together and separately and by the time they were finished nick conceded that the local police force knew their stuff theyd get a solid conviction it was a major crime he thought ruefully damn thered now been one major crime in bay beach but he couldnt be involved as magistrate because he was a witness the committal proceedings would be heard somewhere else which left him still with fishing licences and farm disputes to look forward to terrific finally with interviews complete and after knocking back offers of counselling and psychological help he emerged to find the police inspector waiting to greet him in his new capacity as magistrate mr daniels his hand was gripped in a massive paw welcome to bay beach im sorry your arrival turned into such a mess this place isnt always so exciting great he made himself say something polite and noncommittal while behind him shanni emerged from her own interview room there were a dozen or so people waiting theyd been silent as nick had talked to the inspector but now they surged forward engulfing shanni in a sea of hugs and laughter and relief when they finally released her nick was introduced to what must have been almost the entire population of the town shanni looked exhausted since nicks mention of the mountain to harry shed been decidedly cool but she was still in control enough to stay polite nick these are my parents this is my brother robhes a senior constable here marys my sister and shes your clerk of courts heres sam hatty will and louisetheyre all my younger brothers and sisters grandma grandpa aunt merleuncle simonhes the one with the car yard uncle simon i want you to write a letter for me everybody this is nick daniels the towns new magistrate he lives up on borrowah mountain i dont think they didnt understand that but nick was surged on regardless and his hand was wrung until it felt as if it would drop off were so grateful you were here to take care of our shanni shannis grandmother quavered and to nicks astonishment shannis brothers and sisters hooted with laughter he must have looked stunned because guy mcdonald shannis father noticed dont look like that nick the elderly farmer clapped nick on the shoulder im sure you did well boy but we know shanni isnt a shrinking violet all last night when the rest of the town were worrying themselves sick about their kindergarten teacher shannis mother and i were wondering whether the kid would get out of there alive i was never going to shoot him shanni said affronted no dear but you could have talked him into shooting himself her mother said comfortably and when rob rang and asked what louise took for nighttime hay fever you meanyou dont get hay fever nick demanded staggered louise does shanni said blithely didnt i sneeze well when louise has hay fever she blows us away and the medicine she takes at night knocks her out so hard she snores the roof off i do not louise glared do too there was general laughter and then the police station door burst open a large young man came striding in looking deeply anxious he seemed every inch a farmeropen weathered face with eyes creased by the sun moleskins flannelette shirt widebrimmed hat it only needed a straw sticking out of the side of his mouth to complete the picture the man was in no mood for interruptionsor introductions he was looking for his woman shanni he walked straight to shanni gathered her into his arms and he held her as if there was no tomorrow and she submitted to his embrace as if she belonged there which made nick feelweird but there was nothing he could do but watch and listen shanni love the stranger was saying i took cattle over to the sales at warrbook and ive only just got back to hear this hell love are you okay ill kill the hush she was being raised right off her feet as she was hugged as she smiled down into the strangers eyes nick was aware of a sharp stab of something that might have been jealousy no ridiculous thought there was nothing to be jealous of here for heavens sake im fine shanni was saying struggling to find her feet she motioned to nick nick this is john blainey john nicks our new magistrate he was taken hostage too and you looked after my girl nicks hand was seized and wrung again until his wrist felt broken you got her out of there i owe you i think youll find shanni got herself out of there nick said wryly i just babysat the man staredand then he grinned you can still joke thats fantastic he turned and held shanni tight again that does it sweetheart well get married i know i dont have the house built yet but if you think im going to let you run yourself into danger again by teaching kindergarten by doing anything without me john said stolidly i know how to protect my own and ill protect you he needed to get out of here nick decided as obviously did the rest of shannis family they were all watching the happy couple with expressions ranging from resigned to nauseous im off to collect my car nick said and rob stepped forward with an expression that said hed be glad to helpin fact hed be glad to get out of there as fast as nick wanted ill give you a lift but shanni was breaking away turning within johns hold nick thank you for running you into danger for scaring len into the kindergarten oh ive forgiven you for that she said blithely and grinned at his pained expression i know it wasnt your fault i said it because i like to see lawyers wriggle so im not even going to sue but thank you anyway its me who should be thanking you yep she said happily and grinned and louise it was her tablets did the trick but for harry i didnt do anything you did she said urgently he hugged you and you still can do something you still can help i know you said that stupid thing about the mountain but you were stressed if we can keep that connection up im not prepared to do that he said flatly and she stared why ever not i told you i dont like kids you dont like harry shanni i have a new job here thats going to take all my time he said desperately and she smiled right magistrate at bay beach fulltime job dont badger the man shanni her mother said mildly hes only just walked into the town give him at least a few days before you start involving him in any of your save the world missions shanni wrinkled her pert nose and her eyes twinkled a few days at least her mother said silence then okay nick daniels she said at last you have a few days grace and then well see what we can do to puncture that cool calm exterior oh and nick yes grandma heres a great seamstress pardon he was totally at sea youll want to get those ties widened her smile was gently teasing magistrates in this town command a bit of respect they wear ties and thats not a tie thats a shoelace grandma do you call that a tie her grandmother obediently inspected the slip of expensive italian silk which was now tugged loose around nicks open collar hmm she said disapproving and shanni nodded hmm is right grandma itll have to be widened nicks yet to learn that the only impression designer labels give around here is that he doesnt belong shanni followed her mothers orders nick didnt see her for five days in those days life settled into the pattern hed expectedand more so he was given an apartment above the courthouse which suited him fineno garden to look after and the windows looked out over the sea almost all the way to tasmania he even had a balcony he could use to appreciate the viewwhich he didnt he kept the door closed the courthouse was old and majestic and sleepy as was everything about this town mary shannis eldest sister was his clerk of courts comfortably married to the local newsagent with two little boys at school she knew everything and everybody in bay beach and nick found himself thinking it would be easier for everyone concerned if mary took over the running of the whole courthouse she practically did anyway this is red barring reds up for abalone fishing without a licence she told him on his second case hell plead that he only caught them for a family celebration but he used that excuse the last time and the time before everyone knows he sells them on the black market youre not supposed to tell me this nick said faintly and mary grinned so you didnt hear me saying it but itd be a pity if you were taken in by reds babyblue eyes hes a thief and a bully and hes poaching abalone that fishermen have paid big money for the licences to fish and when sam netherfields boat ran aground last month and he realised his insurance had lapsed red didnt put in a cent to the appeal not one cent even though sam was a character witness for red at his last trial it was all totally improperbut when red stood before the bench and faltered in a whiny voice that hed just caught the few abalone for his wifes birthday and a tough fine would send him to the wall it was sort of hardif not impossiblefor nick to refrain from giving the police authority to look at the mans finances and report back to the court in a week and at the ludicrous look of dismay on the mans face he knew it would be stupid to ignore mary entirely but her interference went beyond work what are you interested in she demanded on his third day at work interested in mmm she beamed what are your hobbies you must have some all work and no play doesnt make for a nice wellbalanced magistrate did you know youre as bossy and interfering as your sister i try she said smugly actually im older than shanni so i think im better at it ive had more practice now im in the local repertory and we need new members can you sing no it didnt faze her no matter theres spots as extras or we need painters backstage no okay she took the rebuff unabashed theres a sailing school on saturdays theres chess clubs theres canoeing theres angling theres mary i am not interested in joining clubs why ever not she was astonished i have plenty to do to keep me employed like what she fixed him with a look that was remarkably like her sisters it was totally disconcerting your work here is hardly go go go what else do you intend to do in this town what else indeed nick took the case file hed come out to retrieve retreated to his office and glowered what in the city his work had been eighty hours a week plus that was the way he liked it he thrived on work and his spare time he filled it with restaurants plays films and art shows all with different women there was a dearth of restaurants plays films and art shows around here he thought desperately and beautiful women nick there was yet another knock on the door and he sighed im busy he called nonsense the door opened and mary walked right in followed by shanniand followed by harry and his heart kicked at the sight of the pair of them shanni was just as he remembered though not as dishevelled as after a night of being held hostage she was now wearing a soft pink print dress which was bare around her shoulders and suited her perfectly her curls were tied back with a pale pink and blue ribbon she looked happy young and carefree and her smile enfolded everyone in the room it was marys smile and then some a knockout smile hi she said mary said you werent busy mary said something would have to be done about mary soon she also said your lunchhour is between one and two but today you have no more court cases until three so harry and i came to take you out to lunch by her side harry said absolutely nothing he was dressed in simple shorts and tshirt as hed been wearing the last time nick saw him and the cast on his leg looked absurdly heavy for such a little one and he was silent waiting for what nick knew harry held onto shannis hand and he looked at nick with eyes that said he was waiting to be struck orhe was waiting for nick to say no same thing i dont think i can nick tried to prevaricate but it sounded weak even to him for heavens sake he did not want to get involved here but he didnt want to hurt the child we arent looking for anything formal are we harry shanni told him choosing to ignore his hesitation but thursday is my halfday off harry wanted to see you and mary tells us that youre free im busy dont be silly theres nothing i cant handle here mary said blithely beaming at her sister in friendly conspiracy off you go and enjoy yourself itll do you good to get out into the fresh air i dont need fresh air oh for heavens sake mary assumed her severest look facing him with an expression that said no nonsense or youll stay in after school and do two hundred lines she used shannis schoolmarm tone you sound like this town will bite nick daniels theres nothing out there to be afraid of and shanni will take good care of you then mary and shanni both beamed what was a man to do im being railroaded he said weakly of course mary agreed its what the mcdonald girls are good at weve been trained from birth by a very railroading mama and grandma and greatgrandma come to that shanni make him take his tie off take your tie off shanni said you cant eat fish and chips on the beach when youre wearing a designer shoelace im not he rose and backed off yes you are mary said and she put her hands behind him and shoved him toward the door know when youre beaten your worship out you go and dont come back before three thats an order he stood on the pavement and couldnt think of a single thing to say shanni was grinning like a cheshire cat and beside her harry was simply looking and looking and looking as if he couldnt get enough of him shanni he was starting to sound inane he was starting to feel inane ive ordered fish and chips she said ignoring him were collecting them down at the wharf in five minutes what if i dont want to come he sounded pathetic of course you want to come she said kindly you just dont think you do harry and i are here to change your mind shall we take your caror walk i dont dont want to drive okay she beamed its not far harry doesnt like cars and hes been practising with the new heel on his cast like anything and please take your tie off no you look silly with it on she twinkled up at him in the sunlight but its the same one you were wearing when we first saw you dont you have a change of clothes i just brought the one suit im heading back to melbourne at the weekend hed go nuts if he couldnt now thats a waste of a weekend if ever i heard one she said spending it in the city changing designer ties and she smiled straight at himand despite himself he was forced to smile right back unbelievable and then he found himself walking at her side down toward the harbour harry clumped on bravely on her other side clutching her hand and occasionally venturing a peep at him around the soft folds of her dress do you never go to melbourne nick asked trying to think of something to say to stop him sounding even more pathetic as a lawyer and magistrate he was used to facing the world on his terms it wasnt often the world had him as off balance as this i did my training there she told him but i hated it i came back here every weekend to get my fix of sea air and laidback country lifestyle so you admit you need your fix of sea air well i need my fix of city were equally addicted miss mcdonald we are indeed she agreed equably equally nuts but if were comparing the sea to the city i know which id rather what do you think harry she tugged the little boy forward scooped him up and placed him so he was between the two of them do you think were nuts harry considered no he said at last seriously and shanni chuckled her delight she really did have the loveliest chuckle youre wonderful harry she told him then she looked down at him he was walking bravely but the cast must be a pain do you want nick to carry you no that was definite enough shanni considered okay what about playing one two three jump harry didnt know what she meant his small face stared up at his kindergarten teacher in mute enquiry we need to teach him she told nick but nick shook his head as in the dark as harry sorry sorry what she stared at him i dont know what youre talking about that stopped her dead she whirled to face them staring from nick down to harry and back to nick again you meanyou both dont know one two three jump enlighten our ignorance nick said dryly knowing she was about to do just that but she gave him a strange lookreassessing it was an odd sideways look and it left nick feeling disturbed as if she was probing where he didnt want to be probed its very simple she said at last falling in again beside them but still with that disturbed look on her face theyd left the single line of shops in the main street behind and were walking down the hill to where the boats were tied up in the harbour below one two three jump requires two adults and one child we have all the prerequisites right here nick take harrys hand but you quibble we cant play she said direfully no quibbling take harrys hand there was nothing for it nick put his hand down and took harrys fingers in his harry looked high up into his face and then stared intently at their linkinghis tiny hand in nicks large one then very slowly harry smiled he turned and headed on down the hill between his two anchors stumping gamely on his cast heading into the wind as if hed just had a win of gargantuan proportions now were ready shanni announced and if nick thought he saw a glimmer of a tear on her eyelashes then surely he was imagining it she swung harrys arm onetwothree and before he realised what he was doing nick was swinging harrys little body out before him jump the tiny boy flew high held safely between them and when harry landed the look on his face of absolute incredulity that anything like this could be happening to him made nick falter damn he might be sure there were tears on shannis eyelashes but what the heck was the lump doing in his throat there was nothing for it now but to do it all over again they one two three jumped all the way to the fish shop and then nick held the fishandchip parcel in one hand and shanni carried the drinks in another so they could keep on one two three jumping all the way to the beach and finally nick found himself sitting on the sand by the sea fish and chips spread out before him and he had absolutely no idea in the world how hed come to be there chapter four to his surprise they ate in silence nick was no longer sure what he expected of this girl but silence surely wasnt it shed chatted and laughed all the way to the beach but now sitting on the sand with harry on her knee and a spread of fish and chips beside her she had subsided into a silence that nick found almost disconcerting not that he didnt welcome it he needed time to get his breath back so he ate the fillets of fish that must surely have only been caught that morning and he crunched on the golden chips and he absorbed the silence it was peaceful it was right but it wasstrange as were the sensations the sand was sunwarmed and soft and the wind was blowing gently in across the rolling waves the beach was pristine there were no footsteps for milesno one had been on this beach since high tide the town was clustered round a horseshoe baythe bay beach the town was named afterbut shanni had led them down the track to the back beach which was the beach the tourists didnt use miles wide with golden sand stretching away into the distance there were ancient norfolk pines at its higher reaches casting sentinels of shade across the sandhills there was nothing else they might as well be the first man and first woman and first child ever to sit on this beach and with the silence it was weird when had he last sat on a deserted beach like this never he thought and the knowledge was suddenly bleak he was a child of the city whod never had parents to take him anywhere he was like harry no he wasnt going to think like that he decided harshly because that was the way of attachment that was what this girl wanted he knew this outing was planned with one thing in mindto establish a link between nick and the little boy she was holding finished your chips she was smiling at him still with that strange look in her eyes that said she was searching for something deeper than an answer about the chips what was she seeing he didnt want to know yes thank you theyd bought far too many shall i feed them to the seagulls harry asked and shanni nodded her agreement thats a fine idea go right ahead okay but he wasnt feeding them where he sat this was a serious business carefully harry wrapped up his pile of cooling chips pushed himself awkwardly to his feet and stumped down to the waters edge then he laid the parcel on the wet sand just as carefully unwrapped it and started tossing chips one at a time skyward but back toward the adults the gulls screamed in from everywhere forming a cacophony of sound and movement between adults and child a barrier it was as if that was what harry had meant to happen and for a long moment nick watched his heart doing all sorts of strange wrenching remembering just how hard his lessons of solitude had been to learn theyre planning on doing psychological assessment on him shanni said conversationally and nick somehow hauled himself back to the present psychological assessment because of the hostage thing no she shook her head because of before and how he is now i dont understand this is as good as it gets she said sadly hes as happy as he can be right now im trying so hard and so is wendy the head of his childrens home but hes so withdrawn around most people he dives for cover or if they come close he screams blue murder screams and screams and screams wendy says he has night terrors and hes keeping every child in the home awake half the night so so if we dont get through to him then hell be placed in a psychiatric institution wendy cant copeand who can blame her shes running a group home for children at risk and she has more than harry to care for theyve tried foster homes but he doesnt last more than a night adoptions out of the question like he is now we must get through to him we you mean nick stirred a whirl of sand under his fingers you mean you and wendy she flicked a glance at him of course she shrugged i mean me and wendy if you dont mind me saying this he said softly i dont see any professional detachment in this professional detachment surely your role of kindergarten teacher doesnt include mental health therapy for your students silence hes not your responsibility nick went on there was no easy way to say this but it must be said if harry needs professional help then surely a psychiatric institution is the place where hell get it he needs to be loved then he needs to be cured and then adopted oh sure she said jeering cured and then adopted but its a catch situation isnt it mr daniels he cant be adopted until hes cured and he cant be cured until hes adopted that sounds clever its not she got up her colour heightened so her cheeks were turning to rose and there was anger building her eyes flashed fire andcontempt of course its not simple either she flashed at him but ive no intention of talking smart or simple theories im talking about a little boys life if i could then id take him home with me maybe id have a chance to make a difference but he doesnt want a woman he needs a man to attach to everyone says that this is ridiculous its not your job to worry about it of course its not my job its no ones job but at least i try at least i care not like some people who say they live on stupid mountains i might as well do he snapped stung he rose to face her fire meeting fire her anger was palpableand so was his how dared she throw this at him meaning meaning no of course i dont want to get involved he threw back at her because what good would it do you think i should try to form an attachment and then move away you know as well as i do that itd make everything worse nick you could do a lot of good in two years she said softening as if there really was a chance she could persuade him youre kidding no you could she said urgently mary says youre bored with work already the orphanage system runs a bigbrother scheme just picking a child up from individual homes taking him out doing this sort of thing mucking around in the sun being a friend i wouldnt know the first thing about being a friend to a threeyearold ill teach you she said wendy and i both think hes desperate for male contact he and his dad were so close and any female contact he had was appalling he needs to bond with a male you have to be kidding he was facing her square on and he couldnt believe this was happening she was almost pleadingbut not quite her eyes defied him to do this thing they told him that this was his duty as another humanor the sort of human with any decency at all the sort with any love but any love had been kicked out of nick daniels a long time ago he stared down into her blazing eyes and the feeling that grew in his heart was leaden and grey what she was asking was impossible no he said flatly and took a step back you dont know what youre asking she opened her mouth to retortand then shut it again once again there was that lookthe look that said she saw further than words and something changed in that instant anger moved to concern whats happened to you nick she said softly almost whispering into the soft wind whats put you on top of that mountain i dont you dont want to talk about it i can see that she smiled suddenly tension dissolving as if it had never been she even managed a wavering smile hmm the plot thickens the plot why you wont take your stupid tie off and you keep combing your hair so you look like a city lawyereven when its totally inappropriate what harms a bit of ruffled hair you might look like a sleek city lawyer in the city but here your image just makes you look like mafioso and you dont know one two three jump shanni yes amazingly there was a twinkle dancing back into her eyes butt out nope she grinned its not my style ill back off though she said equably i can see a bit clearer what im fighting now so ill back off but butt out never there was still time left before three nicks idea of backing off was to retire quietly to his chambers shannis idea of backing off was to head to the playground it was two against one and the outcome was never in doubt i would like to go on the roundabout harry said wistfully looking at a platform mounted on springs with four seats made to look like bucking horses the idea was to sit on a horse and sway as you spun the sight made nicks stomach churn especially after all those chips thats another fine idea shanni said roundly fixing nick with a look that defied him to refuse the child hop right up but suddenly harry wasnt so sure its high nick will help you onwont you nick oh of course he was getting almost past argument so he hopped up onto the platform and lifted harry onto a horseand then before he knew what she was about the platform started to spin shanni devilment in her eyes had started to push hey he clutched the handlecumbridle his hands over harrys small ones and held on for dear life stop its okay nick i can spin you both she was using both hands running shoving the platform around into free whirl her hair was flying there was mischief sparking in her eyes and she was laughing up at both of them hold on harry hold on harry what about him shanni let me off you wont fall if you hold on harry said kindly and then as the platform sped up he threw back his head and smiled shyly up at nick this is fun fun but harrys smile was infectiousand so was the way shanni was laughing at them as she spun them around and around and around he was way out of control and this woman had him so mesmerised there wasnt a thing he could do about it ive been set up he managed weakly you machiavellian drat youve found my true nature she chortled and ran on theres nothing for it but to spin you faster and faster and faster and faster she did just that nick held on standing above harry and whether he realised it or not he was playing the protector because harry was holding on as if his life depended on it he was spinning and spinning but his nick was right above him and he knew his nick wouldnt let him fall and suddenly it wasmagic the sun shone warmly down on their heads the waves washed in and out on the beach below them they spun and they spun and shanni pushed and ran and pushed and smiledand watched both these males and she wondered shanni it couldnt last fifteen minutes pushing was surely enough for any childand nick was all set to lose his chipsbut somehow hed quelled his protests and it wasnt harry who stopped them the yell came from the road and nick looked over to find shannis john heading straight for them good old dependable john nick thought wryly watching him hurrying across the sandhills as they spun the look on his face said he was here to save his shanni from any danger but from which of them from the psychotic threeyearold or the slick city lawyer john must have decided it was fate worse than death for shanni to be stuck with such a combination nick thought humourlessly little did john know his beloved had engineered the whole thingincluding stranding him on this devilish platform it was nick who needed saving but john only had eyes for shanni no matter john was welcome to save shanni all he liked nick decided but then he felt bitterness behind the thoughtand the sensation jolted him what on earth did he have to be bitter about he demanded incredulously of himself this girl was nothing to do with him and neither was the man she intended to marry shannilove the roundabout slowed as shannis attention was distracted thank heaven nick abandoned his horse staggered off lurched as his feet hit solid earth and then tried to stop his world from falling right over good grief and harry was looking at him as if he was wondering why nick had climbed off john shanni had smiled a welcome as john strode across the sandhills but nick heard a note of wariness enter her voice as if she wasnt sure what to expect mary told me youd be here john was out of breath as though hed been hurrying for much longer than the time it had taken to stride across the sandhills he sounded aggrieved i thought you were checking bathroom tiles on your afternoon off nope shanni shrugged and kept her smile fixed you told me i should check tiles but i dont see the point when we havent decided on a house plan she smiled placatingly and then tried to extend the conversation john you remember nick of course i remember nick john said grumpily digging his hands deep in his pockets he flicked an acknowledging nod at the staggering nick and went straight back to his grievance which was just as well because nick was in no state to greet him so why werent you at the tile place i decided to leave the hay and come in and meet you push said harry nick why are you off too much of a good thing nick gasped he waved a helpless hand at shanni who was looking suspiciously as if she might laugh at his plight shed better not but go right ahead without me shanni push wuss but she pushed grinning at him without sympathy and then turning back to john as she pushed john it might rain tomorrow she said thoughtfully still pushing harry gave nick a look of disgustwimpy adults his look saidbut then decided hed turn his attention to the sea as if he was looking for pirates the hay will spoil if it rains shanni said thats why i dont understand why youre not where you said you would be john snapped i dont want to waste time soyou were coming to choose tilesor check on me i just wanted to see that you were okay thats really nice of you john she said softly but as you can see im fine choosing tiles or eating lunch on the beach are hardly dangerous occupations dont let the hay spoil on my account why are you herewith him he glared at nick and nick raised his eyebrows and smiled politely or tried to smile politely his whole world was still looking decidedly crooked he said nothing one reason was that he knew when to shut up but the second was that he was still concentrating on balance very important balance he wondered how it would look if he lay down he didnt a man had some pride plus the sand was wobbling nick and i are taking harry out to lunch shanni was smiling at harry who was still looking for pirates great they were welcome to pay attention to anything other than nicks condition this is john harry you want to say hello no said harry and nick didnt blame him but he was still spinning dont you want to stop yet nick demanded no said harry very definitely if you pushed as well i could go faster good grief but there was no alternative clutching his balance and pride together nick managed a sickly shrug he pushed and he listened shanni lets go john was saying urgently if you come with me now we still have enough time to choose tiles thats crazy shanni said exasperated we dont even have the house plan she took a deep breath in fact we havent even decided to get married that floored john of course were getting married you havent actually asked me we talked about it the other day and we always knew john we need to talk about this by ourselves she said urgently casting a sideways glance at nickwho just as carefully looked away maybe we could meet tonight but john had no intention of being placated this is ridiculous i came into town to choose tiles im with harry and nick leave the kid with the lawyer hey nicks protest was involuntarybut unnecessary he could safely leave this to shanni she was angry enough for both of them the kids name is harry she said bluntly not the kid and harry is my friend i invited him and nickwhos a magistrate not just a lawyerout to lunch and for a play in the playground when were finishedand not beforeill take harry back to wendy wendy johns voice rose in incredulity you mean this is a kid from the orphanage yes she said and there was ice dripping from the word back off nick was thinking urgently but there was no way he could get that message across john had no intention of backing off this was a man used to getting his own way and he wasnt tuned in to ice shanni this is ridiculous john said through gritted teeth the whole town saw you walking down the street with this guy and with the kid between you malcolm taylor rang to tell me so this is the real reason youre here shannis anger was building by the minute because malcolm saw me with another man and decided to report me the town will think youre twotiming me by sitting on the beach eating fish and chips with the local magistrate in broad daylight and with a child between us nick and harry were forgotten now if he were john hed disappear for a while nick thought he could feel the anger radiating from shanni and it was almost tangible its not his place to take you to lunch he didnt take me to lunch i took him for lunch its true nick said mildly i had no choice at all ask harry i dont have a choice in anything this lady has the force of two bulldozers he was ignored look come and choose tiles and well forget all about this john said urgently i meanthe town will forget that im a twotiming hussy i never said you didnt need to she was fairly spitting john i like you very much and youve been a real friendbut i will not be owned you mean you dont want to marry me she paused there was a long long silence unnoticed the roundabout slowed to a halt both nick and harry were watching entranced pirates and stomachs forgotten i guess she closed her eyes and when she opened them the determination that nick was starting to know was back in force i guess thats what i do mean john thank you for asking but no youre kidding no im sorry i see once again there was a long long silenceand then john turned to nick and the look he cast him was pure malevolence i just hope to hell hes worth it he spat to throw me over for a bloody lawyer with designer suits and he turned and stalked off over the sandhills push said harry that at least was something he could do nick pushed while shanni gazed at the retreating back of her lover and he could see indecision written all over her go after him he said gently i can take care of harry what was he saying thank you she turned to face them an overbright smile pinned to her face the decision had been made and there wasnt regret there as far as nick could see there was just pure anger but i dont need any more males telling me what to do especially not a designersuited lawyer it broke the ice she stared at him for a long minute and then slowly the anger faded oh heck she broke into a weak chuckle oh help im sorry no wasnt he awful butif people are getting that impression another thought was hitting nick with force now and he didnt like it if the town thought shanni was throwing her john over for him maybe we should cool it she stared and then her jaw dropped in a sardonic look of incredulity cool it cool what i dont know maybe john has a point anger was flooding right back so people all over town think im falling for you because i asked you to lunch and youre worried about it you jerk youre as conceited and pompous as john push said harry firmlyhe was tired of this adult conversation and was back to basicsand they both pushed while undercurrents zoomed around and between them as if the playground was wired for electricity and some of it had got loose im sorry nick said after a bit maybe he had overreacted it was just this smalltown thing he did not want to get involved he glanced at his watch and saw with relief there was just fifteen minutes left before three i need to get back of course you do she said cordially dont let me keep you youre not coming harry and i are playing on the roundabout she snapped you do what you like right right then he took a deep breath looked at her for a long minute and nodded see you later harry he said when harry demanded startled his voice was urgent when will you see me im not sure mr daniels is a very busy man shanni said icily hes probably got tiles to buy i do have a court case or two to judge then dont let us keep you she said through gritted teeth harry and i can manage very well without you we can manage without men in general and without two males in particular and one of thems you whats been happening i was expecting you to come back with a black eye at least nick was no sooner in the courthouse than he was pounced on mary was at her desk agog and rob was standing beside her immaculate in his police uniform the physical likeness to shanni was unmistakableas was their ability to ignore his personal boundaries he stared at both of them with dislike there was sand in his shoes he needed time to empty it before he was due in court in four minutes his stomach was still churning from the roundabout and he felt ill he didnt need an inquisition why are you here he snapped at rob hey i brought the prisoner rob said aggrieved not that theres any need for force its bart commin in for shoplifting he pinches four cans of baked beans every second wednesday because thats the day before pension it drives everyone nuts but as soon as we make it officialtry to give him the beans and dock his pensionhe changes stores we figure he likes the excitement great nick groaned fourteen years intellectual training for this your ties crooked mary said brighteyed and interested youve never had a crooked tie before so your sister had her wicked way with me behind the sandhills nick snarled you want to put a twopage announcement in the local paper dont reckon we have to rob said lazily and grinned johns done it for us nick stared what exactly do you mean by that hes spreading it all over town rob told him ive heard it from at least three people on the way here seems my sisters thrown john over for the magistrate oh great your hairs not mussed mary said in a tone saying she wouldnt have minded if it was that means you cant have been too far out of line plus they had the littlun with them rob agreed it wouldnt have happened youll go far as a policeman nick snapped great detective work do you mind i have a court case to run bart wont worry if youre running late rob said easily im prosecuting and hes defending himself theres hardly an army of lawyers waiting no he would have preferred it if there wasin fact he would have preferred anything to these four enquiring eyes did she really throw john over mary asked breathless he guessed he could tell them that she did there was a long drawnout sigh from the pair of them and he looked on bemused do you mind telling me whats going on we cant stand the man rob said simply none of us can we were starting to worry shed marry him through lack of competition and now along you come mary said dreamily rob nick eyed his arresting officer with disfavour yes sir there was a glint in robs eye that reminded nick of shanni and he wasnt sure he liked it he wasnt the least bit sure he wasnt being laughed at here theres a jug of water on my bench fetch it and throw it over your sister if you say so rob grinned and mary stopped looking dreamy and gave a halfhearted chuckle herself okay i know im being stupid its just i mean youre eligible as anything and youd be quite goodlooking if you didnt have the she paused and nick glowered if i didnt have the what potbelly and bald spot rob suggested and hooted with laughter jeepers mary leave the guy alone but mary just looked helpful its your hairstyle and slick clothes she said they make you look like a gangster gee thanks or one of those smart city lawyers you see on the movies she added and youre not one of those no mores the pity you dont mind me saying it why should i he rolled his eyes go ahead any more improvements you can think of while youre at it you dont really have to wear those skinny ties she ventured the suit doesnt fit here rob added joining right into the spirit of things old judge andrews wore tweed the old judge kept forgetting to take his wellingtons off too mary said thoughtfully he had a hobby farm so he kept arriving in court smelling of cow dung it made himi dont knowmore approachable somehow youd like me to come to court without my hair combed in a tweed jacket a wide tie and stinking of cow dung you have to do something youll never win our shanni like you are now rob chortled at nicks expression and threw up his hands in mock surrender okay your worship i can see ive gone too far let me organise a prisoner for you and well get this court case under way he shouldnt worry he shouldnt give a damn what they all thought of him nick decided as the afternoon wore on the cases were trivial and demanded hardly any thought at all he might as well think of his appearance he might as well think about shanni which was really really stupid hed go up to town this weekend he decided if he left by five tomorrow night he could be back in his innercity apartment by nine maybe ring a couple of friends catch a late show see the latest enrico exhibition on saturday four hundred dollars or ten days in custody he said and discovered the whole courtroom was looking at him but it was mary and she bit her lip almost as soon as she said it what fifty bucks or overnight the defendant explained for her in a voice that sounded like gravel the old man was an alcoholic he stank the smell of him reached every corner of the court overnight gives us time to see hes fed and washed rob explained so ten days gives you longer next case and he closed his file and glared at them all and they glared right back every single one of them and shanni was waiting for him when court was finished for the day her anger was still skyhigh he came out of court tossed his gown aside and turned to find shanni watching him from the corridor i suppose you know what youve done she said bluntly nick sighed now what lets see he said wearily according to town gossip so far today ive ravished you over fish and chips ive had my wicked way in the sandhills ive broken your engagement to your knight in shining armour and ive smashed the unwritten dress code for bay beach court what else is there left youve made emma feed bart for ten days emma robs wife she does the meals for the custody cells and bartll dry out well have him screaming the place down then maybe he needs to be dried out this was none of her business i thought mary warned you barts dried out at least fifty times in living memory all of them in the police cells all of them with rob and emma not getting sleep for days and all of them totally useless as he hits the bottle the minute hes back on the town but go ahead jail him i already have i know she gritted her teeth smart city lawyers i am the magistrate he said mildly and she ground her teeth some more yeah well stop filling police cells and go do something useful something useful for heavens sake hadnt these people heard of a little respect he was the magistrate but respect wasnt in shannis vocabulary the psychologist is coming to the childrens home tomorrow to assess harry she continued thats why im here dont get any funny ideas that i might want to see you or anything i dont but wendy needs a statement saying that youve been able to make contact make contact nick stared bemused she was still furious and she looked really something when she was angry as if there were sparks inside as well as out yes that youve been able to communicate with him and hes showed signs of affection otherwise he risks being classified as autistic and well get nowhere hell be taken away from wendy and theres no chance hell be considered for adoption with a label like that shanni its none of your business she snapped eyes flashing like bart isnt my business this is a small community here nick daniels and everyone cares for everybody and even if it wasnt a small community havent you ever heard the line any mans death diminishes me that floored him for heavens sake john donnes poetry being flung at him by angry kindergarten teachers any mans death diminishes me because i am involved in mankind but nick wasnt he thought blankly no way hed tried as hard as he could for all of his life to be exactly the opposite as uninvolved in mankind as possible how can you not care shanni said hotly nick youre the only hope he has i you dont care for anyone of course you dont i can see that she shook her blonde curls in fury so dont do anything about it see him locked in a psychiatric institution hey if you care then go and talk to wendy wendy wendy she said kindly as if he was a sandwich short of a picnic the head of the childrens home hes in bay beach orphanage is split into five homes and wendys in charge of harrys she glared again so help her if you have one ounce of decency in your body then its the least you can do but you and you neednt worry you wont meet me there so your reputation will remain untarnished im going to a movie with my mother something about a runaway bride she glowered which will suit me down to the ground runaway bride ha if all the men around her are as appalling as you and john i cant say i blame her for her choice chapter five great he seemed to have sand everywhere nick took himself back up to his apartment emptied his shoes washed his face and poured himself a glass of wine it didnt work he still felt gritty and unsettled and like a kingsized rat he made himself steak and salad sat down to watch the news on tv and he still felt ratlike which was stupidly unfair finally he showered and changed every piece of his sandimpregnated clothing donning casual trousers and an opennecked shirt then he stared at himself in the mirror see he demanded of no one in particularor the absent shanni he could be casual if he wanted to be the thought was so pathetic and inane he made himself grin his hair needed attention hed washed the sand out and it was drying as its usual mop of unruly black curls this wasnt a judgelook at all he grimaced started to comb it flat and smoothand then he stopped this was stupid he conceded slick hairstyles for casual was stupid he wasnt dressing for anyone hed leave it bejust run a comb loosely through it and leave it just for tonight after all he was only reading legal briefs tonightwasnt he hardly worth donning his city lawyer image for he read one legal brief and paused harry psychiatric assessment tomorrow harry it was nothing to do with him he thought savagelydesperately he couldnt help but in his heart maybe he knew he could hed heard court cases before submissions of social workers on why a child should be sent home to his parents or fostered or sent to a remand home this child is incapable of attachment borderline autism theres no point in attempting foster care we believe institutional care is the only option harry was only three years old and if shanni was rightif he could help nick was in a position to guess that attachment was possible if they found a home where there was a decent male parent harry just needed his dad nick thought as he had that had nothing to do with it he thought savagely his own background was irrelevant think of practicalities he shook off the feeling of wanting to stay right out of this and let himself remember how harry had felt holding him close hed hugged him all that long night of the hostage drama and it hadnt just been harry whod received comfort this was ridiculous yes but just talking to wendy couldnt hurttelling wendy if she wanted a statement then he was prepared to make it it couldnt hurt to do that muchand then steer clear andshanni was at the movies it was only nine not too late decision made he grabbed his jacket and headed for the door with his hair still tousled if itll help then ill put that all in writing it will wendy stared across the table at her visitor her eyes troubled the only problem is mmm youre saying he shouldnt be institutionalised because hes capable of attachment but youre not willing to allow that attachment ino do you know about our big brother scheme shannimiss mcdonald told me about it yes and youre not willing to be a part of it no hmm she paused and regarded him across the table with knowing eyes in silence which nick found vaguely unsettling the woman was still relatively young close to thirty maybe but nick knew instinctively that shed make a great house mother for troubled kids she was sort ofcomfortable she had kindly eyes that crinkled from too much smilingeyes that said she accepted all comers as she found them and she knew what she was seeing now youve had a tough time yourself she said softly and nick stared how how do i know she spread her hands you get to know the look and shanni told me what on earth does shanni know she sees as much as i do wendy smiled and pushed her fingers through her mass of dark curls shed tied them back into a knot but they were breaking free everywhere shes quite a girl if thats all then is harry asleep now why had he asked that i doubt it she hesitated its hard to get him to sleep he lies there for hours just staring into the dark but if youre not willing to take this further then maybe its not such a good idea to prolong the agony the agony harry wants you she said simply he cries to go to you thats why shanni took him to lunch with you today and then she paused as she heard a car pull up outside there was a click of the gate and then a low laugh as someone greeted one of the older children speaking of whichhere she is the first thing she saw was his hair shanni burst in the door and stopped dead shed never expected that nick would come shed been expecting wendy and wendy was there but so was nick and this was a very different nick so far shed seen him groomed and immaculate and slick and smooth nowhe was in casual trousers a shortsleeved opennecked shirt and his hair was tousled and thick and unruly she could see why he combed it down smoothed it looked like the hairstyle of a barrister of the highest standing now it was a tousled mop and he looked years younger he didnt look like a magistrate she thought he lookednice nick wasnt nice she told herself strangely offbalance he was a toad all men were toads john was toad number one but nick was running a close second how was the movie he asked mildly and she wrinkled her nose in distaste lousy how come wendy smiled and rose to fetch more coffee werent you seeing the one about the runaway bride yesbut it had a stupid ending she didnt keep running wendy choked on laughter then crossed to give her friend a hug they were obviously very close hey its okay maybe you and john can sort it out no we cant shanni said darkly hugging back he wants a den whats wrong with a man wanting a den nick asked startled and got a glower for his pains we did house plans last night she explainedas if he was a simpleton john has it all worked out three bedrooms living room kitchen for me and a den for him isnt that cosy a man needs a den nick said and found he now had two women glaring at him oh help i have a den said wendy why cant i have a den demanded shanni chauvinist twit but when i said that john just laughedlike i was being cute because what would the little woman want a den for and then he told me to go and choose bathroom tiles and then today i know what happened today wendy said and both of them stared at her well if you will have your domestics in full view of the pier half the retired folk of the town listened in oh great nick groaned i dont know why youre complaining shanni said crossly you get to play magistrate for two years and then leave this place im stuck here for ever she helped herself from the coffee pot wendy produced sat down and stuck a thumb in the direction of nick whats he doing here refusing to play big brother hey im signing an affidavit like shanni wanted me to nick said stung what else do you want you to go in and hug harry goodnightand promise youll do the same tomorrow wendy said promptly silence see shanni said morosely into her coffee theyre all useless theres reasons hes like this wendy said kindly hes got a past yeah but if he had real courage are we talking about me here nick said carefully if we are then would you mind including me you dont include anyone else shanni retorted you go on being solitary and well go on not communicating thats the way you like it shanni if i communicate with him he accuses me of setting my cap at him she told wendy ignoring him nicely as if i would the heroine in my movie had the right ideabut to give in at the end and marry one of the species no i reckon you ought to try though wendy said thoughtfully communicating i mean now hes abandoned his smooth look he seems sort of cute this was way out of hand he was getting out of herefast he is cute shanni admitted but egolawyer and judge and good looks combined phew and aloof wendy said sadly puts himself above everyone in this place bet he thinks hes the greatest intellectual in town hey bet he never ever stays for weekends wendy said whats the bet hes getting in his cute little car tomorrow and heading back to melbourne for the weekend just as fast as he can drive because this place threatens him mmm shanni nodded i cant say i blame him shanni wendy stared hey keep your end of the conversation going here girl i cant keep lawyerbashing on my own but it does get a bit claustrophobic shanni was no longer looking at nick she was staring into the dregs of her coffee her mind on her own problems were having a family beach picnic on sunday she explained morosely grandpas seventieth birthday theyll be so sympatheticor secretly pleased which is worse because of you and john the whole town thought we were getting married including john including you wendy prodded and shanni shrugged yeah i guess so take your new fella i dont have a new fella shanni thumped her mug on the table wendy will you stop it everyone thinks nick and i ran straight into each others arms and the last thing i need is yet another man what about you wendy said wheeling to nick and honing in like an arrow interested no there you go then she said and sat back smugly arms folded so neither of you are interested in any sort of relationship but both of you are interested in saving harry so therefore therefore nick was being swept away here this woman was too much for him he was glad she didnt have a legal degree he thought shed wipe the floor with him at the bar so therefore i can tell the assessor tomorrow that harrys developing relationships all over the place and i can tell harry that the two of you are taking him out on sunday to shannis family picnic no they said in unison and wendy grinned at the twin sound of revulsion in their voices why not it means i have a promise i can use to put harry to sleep at night itll give me breathing space if i can use the two of you til he relaxes with me wendy look she was all earnestness now fighting for one of her kids and nick knew his first assessment of her had been right shed give her all to make sure the kids she cared for had a chance i cant cope with harry now she admitted he screams and he wont let me near i beg cajole hug threaten but nothing i say makes any difference but if i say you go to bed on time and you eat your dinner and you dont scream the place down then shanni and nick will take you out on a picnic on sunday im going back to melbourne nick said faintly so whats more important wendy was fighting every way she knew how your weekend in melbourne or a little boys future if i can settle him here make the psychologist see that theres a chance he might settle wendy were not promising anything longterm shanni said uneasily i mean if he grows too attached you tried to talk nick into being big brother to him wendy said sternly anyone can see nick wont buy that sort of responsibility on his ownhes running scaredso maybe you can convince him to share instead of a big brotherwhy not brother and sister what could be simpler than that maybe shanni was dubious and its even neutral wendy said triumphantly no sex at all or not in front of the children shannis irrepressible twinkle peeped out and nick groaned heck this was his weekend they were talking about this was stupid there was no chance he was staying and then the door opened and a small face appeared peering around as if he expected to be knocked back again harry was wearing pyjamas a couple of sizes too big for him his fibreglass cast made them look ungainly and awkward and his eyes were way too big for his face my nicks here he whispered unbelieving and nicks heart jerked with pain you should be in bed young man wendy said crossing to scoop him up in her arms he held himself rigid arching back in a pose of rejection that nick was starting to know why is nick here he whispered he came to invite you to lunch on sunday would you like to go harrys eyes swung to nicks his face said he didnt believe a word its true nick said weakly because there was nothing else to say sunday picnic with miss mcdonald for her grandpas birthday shanni said shanni you can call me shanni when were not at kindergarten would you like to come to the beach with us again harry yes it was one simple wordbut it was almost like a sigh of relief then you have to promise to go straight to sleep harry lad wendy said sternly three more sleeps until sunday and no protests three more sleepsand then youll come he was looking straight at nick his eyes searching for the truth iyes would you like to tuck him back into bed wendy asked gently and proffered the small body toward nick nick froze but they were all looking at him wendy harry and shanni he was on some sort of fence he thought one way was safetythe way he knew the otherthe other was the unknown and the unknown scared the life out of him but still they looked at him and harrys eyes said he expected nothing life had slapped him once too often to believe in happy endings and he couldnt bear it okay kid nick said resignedly and rose and accepted harry from wendys arms harrys arms swept around his neck and clung wheres your bed show me hes gorgeous you said that about john shanni poured herself more coffee and sank down opposite her friend i lied johns a meathead pleasant kind but a bityou knowthe lights are on but no ones home and this guy the lights are off and the doors locked but hes home all right wendy said hes all in there but hes not letting it show hes running scared im not exactly chasing him shanni sighed heck the last thing i want is emotional entanglement especially not with some smartalec city lawyer just one step at a time wendy said gently just concentrate on harry but if you can kill two birds with one stone i dont know what you mean i mean that man in there has been badly hurt in the past wendy said sternly it stands out a mile in my profession you know the look and you can see it as well as me i reckon our magistrate needs harry as much as harry needs him i hope youre right shanni looked dubiously at her friend and i hope he sees it i know im right wendy said to herself later as she closed her door on the pair of them i also think there are more needs here than harrysand i hope youre both wise enough to see it shanni intended walking nick expected shannis car to be with his but there was only his sports car parked outside mum dropped me off here shanni told him my cars got a cracked head or something ghastly and may be on its way to the car graveyard as we speak the mechanics just shake their heads and groan every time i ask so mum drove me to the pictures but i wanted to check on harry afterwards im walking home wheres home a mile or so thataway a mile nick looked out into the dark in the direction she was pointing they were on the outskirts of town and the road she was pointing to led northwards into the dark you cant do that hey this is bay beach she said laughing you dont get mugged in bay beach there are weirdos everywhere does your mother know you intend walking i told her id call a cab shanni admitted but i want to walk i need to think you dont walk im a big girl now and im a criminal lawyer a magistrate i know whats out there oh scare me stupid why dont you she shook her head halflaughing halfnervous cut it out get in the car shanni he said heavily hed seen too much in this job to let anyone take stupid risks especially shanni do your thinking when youre safe in your own bed im taking you home i dont shanni please she stared at him for a long moment hearing the trace of fear in his voiceand then she silently climbed into his car she didnt know this man at all she thought and she was almost fearful of the sensation shannis family farm was set back from the road between the main road and the coast the country was moonlit and nick could see that it was magnificentrolling hills vast gum trees and cattle standing peacefully in the moonlight its lovely he said and she cast him a wry look hardly your cup of tea no why did you come here she asked theyd been silent all the way from town but now as the car pulled to a halt before the farmhouse verandah she seemed to find her tongue its the first step to becoming a judge i dont want to stay a lawyer for ever he said and unexpectedly she grinned then youve taken the first step youve stopped wearing your suit and tie congratulations it was hard not to grin back her smile was infectious its back to suits tomorrow magistrates dont need suits they needi dont know knowledge wisdom compassion failing all that suits will have to do hmm she shook her head at him he cut the engineshe should get outbut the night was still and warm and there was this thing between them that needed examining its a shame she said softly to wear such severe suits to flatten that gorgeous hair then before he could do anything to stop her her hand came out and touched his head she was running her fingers through his tousled curls as if she couldnt help herself its great hair lovely hair do you take after your mother or father i have no idea the feeling of her fingers in his hair was weird it set every nerve in his body alight he found himself clenching his hands on the steering wheel staring out at the night beyond and trying to halt the flood of sensations coursing through his body i see silence then so wendys right wendy sticks her nose where it has no business being his voice sounded as strained as he felt maybe shanni agreed but then wendys like a judge knowledgeable wise and kind like you intend to be i dont know about that he stirred and shifted his handsand clenched them again on the wheel why dont you know your parents he shrugged i have vague memories of my mother she had a different hair colour every time she visited me though who can say if she looked like me you didnt live with her not often mostly i lived in foster homes she wouldnt let me be adopted oh nick heck were not feeling sorry for me here he said savagely it was a long time since hed railed against the unfairness of his past ive had a very good life thank you very much some great foster homes many a dozen or so my mother kept arriving and deciding shed take me back for a week or so or shed just make so much fuss the foster parents thought i was too much trouble he smiled without humour staring out at the dark my mother and i have a very low tolerance rate domesticitys not my scene not your mothers scene as you say and now youre set to be a judge great isnt it his voice was selfmocking backstreet kid makes good youve fought for this every way i know how he told her and there was no way he could stop the icy determination from his voice every waking minute i remember you remember what she was almost whispering and he told her it must have been the night he told himself later the warmth of the evening and the scent of the garden and the eucalypts towering over them with the stars glimmering through orthe warmth drifting between or it must have been that she was a listenernot like any other woman hed gone out with he only knew he had to talkand talk of something hed never talked about in his life before i remember sitting in court he said and he was speaking almost to himself his voice halfmocking i was about seven id spent a month with my mother and the welfare authorities got an injunction to take me away i wasneglected to say the least so they were all in courtmy motherher boyfriendmy mothers neighbourssocial workers id never met before and they all were saying what should happen to me so her voice was gentle so i remember looking up at the judge and he just saidhe just said what would happen no argument and it was the right thing it was what i wanted and it meant i got fed again and got to go to school so i figuredright then and there i figuredthat that was what i was going to be someone who could say what would happen oh nick pretty silly reason for wanting to be a judge huh he said still in that selfmocking voice good grief he was pathetic but she didnt think so shanni was saying nothing just sitting watching him with eyes that were almost luminescent in the dark there was a glimmer on her lashes that could almost have been tears hey i think thats the best reason ive ever heard for wanting to be a judge nick daniels she said in a choked voice and now youve made it i want highcourt judge he said and his voice firmed wont magistrate at bay beach do or countycourt judge our last judge stayed thirty years thirty years his tone told her what he thought of that no chance two years and im out of here country gets under your skin she couldnt stop a note of bitterness creeping into her own voice then though id have to agree that sometimes the place can even get to me sometimes even you want to get away sometimes she admitted this week will be hard because in case you havent noticed she retorted i threw away a perfectly good marriage proposition this afternoon the news will be all over the town by now johns a very nice person hes a stuffed shirt she grinned at that yes you see it i see it now too but the town sees a very nice boy who ive thrown over for nothing john will be getting sympathy and ill get the wicked witch of the west treatment apart from my familywholl be so pleased that ill want to slug them why do you enjoy people telling you i told you so she demanded bitterly no neither do i my family saw the stuffed shirt bit before i did then she paused as up on the verandah a light fluttered shifted and died against the shadows the bitterness increased oh no i might have known you might have known what i have three teenage brothers and sisters she said sighing and lifting her purse from the seat in readiness to leave theyre all in the front room right now and theyre spying on us ill go in and theyll be all over metheyll be so sympathetic about john and theyll be so avid for information about you itd drive him nuts you dont ever think of moving out oh yeah she jeered gently into the night apartments are hardly thick on the ground in bay beach and everyone would think wed fought and my mother would be hurt and she glowered at the moving curtains and then sighed and id miss them im glad i dont have a family that got to her her eyes widened in the dusk no nick you dont know what youre saying she whispered she turned to him shaken out of her selfpity and she took both of his hands in hers in urgent entreaty to not want a family nick you just dont know then she took a deep breath seemed to collect herself and she pulled away shed taken this too far exposed wounds she had no hope of healing ththank you for the ride home will i see you on sunday i guess he smiled then and softened ill be here shall i call for you at eleven and well collect harry together hell like that and so will i nick thought suddenly to leave her now with no future date in store would be hard shanni wasnt his sort of course not as beautiful as the sophisticated women he normally dated butshe was soft warm compassionate she was getting under his skin youd best go in he said uneasily flicking a glance up at the shifting curtains youll be getting a reputation theyve been watching me for ever she snapped they drive me nuts as if id ever do anything interesting it was the way she said it she didnt say it flatlyshe said it with longing as if id ever do anything interesting what did she want and suddenly he knewor maybe it was what he wanted he laughed a soft carefree laugh that had her staring okay then miss uninteresting miss mcdonaldlets do something to give our audience a show if youre willing his dark eyes dared her in the moonlight and then before she knew or could guess what he intended he took her into his arms and he kissed her chapter six this wasnt just a kiss this was a kiss it wasnt meant to be a kiss of friendship a soft kiss of farewell or even a kiss of the start of a love affair this was passion meant for an audience nick had sized up three watching pairs of eyes and he knew what they most wantedso he gave it to them in full his sports car was open to the weather and to their audience the seats were wide and soft and there was a good eighteen inches between driver and passenger no more nick took a deep breath turned to the lady beside him put his hands on her shouldersand kissed she leaned back with shockand he leaned back with her so they fell together onto the soft leather she gave a squeak of astonishment their mouths met fleetingly as they disappeared underneath the dashboarddisappearing completely from view then nick lifted his face from hers momentarilyhed had to stifle her squeak somehow and kissing her properly was the only way to do it put your feet up high nick whispered urgently before she could squeak again a bit of stocking above the dash for the audience come on shanni lets give them their moneys worth for a moment he didnt think shed respond her body was rigid in his holdshocked into immobility not for long though this was one smart lady and her sense of humour was always bubbling just below the surface as somehow hed known it would be he thought it was as if he knew her without knowing her as if something in his mind read hers and understood as hed known it wouldor hed hoped and it happened he felt laughter ripple though her body in a lovely long chuckle and her arms came around him and held him fast she leaped right into the act with a vengeance oh nick she murmured at full passion her voice ringing out into the still night air carrying right up to the verandah and into the open window beyond nickdarling shanni his mouth was inches from hersonce under the dash he could withdraw just a little laughter was bubbling inside him as well a wiggle i think he whispered urgently a kick and she did with delight he felt her body shift under his her legs raised above dashboard heightshe was wearing a flowing skirt for heavens sake and her legs were silkstockingedand he felt her wiggle like crazy her feet waved back and forth like flags as if she was riding a bicycle upside down inside the house the siblings would be popeyed oh nick she groaned out loud nick nickkiss me kiss me he choked with admiration and laughter and he looked down into her laughing eyes and that was a mistake they were so lovely he was meant to be kissing the girl for a joke she was laughing up at him her stockinged feet were wiggling in the air and her eyes were alight with merriment she was holding him his body was pressed against hers and her breasts were moulding into his her laughing mouth was inches from his and she was so lovely and suddenly her mouth wasnt inches from his it was right under his and his mouth was on hers and he was kissing herbut he was kissing her as if there really was passion between them as if this was a man making love to the most beautiful woman in the worldinstead of an irrepressibly ridiculous smalltown kindergarten teacher who wanted to tease her brothers and sister and shanni had frozen againbut she froze only for one moment she could feel it too he thought dazedly whatever was between them was shared and it was something that was more powerful than either of them this likeminded stuffit was drawing them closer and closer so her lovely laughing eyes merged with the twinkling of the stars and the feel of her body with his and night and girl and desire were all merging into one and nick was kissing her as if hed never let her leave himas long as they both should live shanni it couldnt last of course how could it not end not with such an audience the front door banged wide and a male voice shouted down to them from the verandah shanni is that you she didnt push away not instantly for one tiny second they stayed together and that fraction of an instant told nick that shanni was as reluctant to finish the kiss as he was but needs must she pushed him back and her eyes searched his in the dim light and then she smiled and if there was a trace of uncertainty in her smile it was replaced fast by laughter oh nickwhat have you done my reputation forsooth what have i done what have you done somehow he managed laughter in return wicked witch of the west and scarlet woman to boot she grinned hauling herself up to sit decorously again smoothing her skirt over her knees as both their heads reappeared above the dashboard for the observers to see youre the seducer here she said primly i can see the headlines now magistrate seduces innocent kindergarten teacher in sports car youll be tarred and feathered and run out of town i could be so lucky she heard it thenthe faint trace of bitterness in his voice so he really did want to leave she thought and he wanted it badly butshe couldnt focus on nick any longer her father was out on the verandah staring down at the couple in the car and her mother was following close behind hi she managed smiling up at her father its me dad nick gave me a ride home so i see the farmers voice said he had a shotgun right behind him and hed use it if necessary to nicks amazement shanni didnt blush or try to defend herself she chuckled again and swung herself out of the car dont get your knickers in a twist dad we had an audience she gestured to the curtain where three faces had now appeared fullon her three youngest siblings nick thought we ought to give them a show for their money oh guy mcdonald looked sideways at his three youngest children worry fading as he saw what had happened and he grinned so this was where shanni got her sense of humour i see so you shocked them to the core well done you want to come in for coffee young fella ino i need to get back unlike shanni nick wasnt in control at all something had happened during that kiss and he wasnt at all sure he knew what it was he needed to get back to town and sort out what he was feeling orsort out that he was feeling nothing which he must be nicks coming with us on sunday dad shanni said she left the car climbed the verandah steps then stood between her parents and smiled back down at him to grandpas birthday picnic were bringing harry thats nice dear her mother said placidly did nothing shock these people no it couldnt nick looked up at them guy mcdonalds arm was around his daughters shoulders her mother was standing beside her with affection written clearly on her face and the three young faces were still bobbing up and down at the window and grinning like three clownsand nick suddenly knew what it was he was seeing this family loved their shanni and they loved her absolutely anything she chose to do would be okay by them the knowledgethe sensationwas suddenly almost claustrophobic hed never known a love like this never and here she was surrounded shanni was like an alien creature he thought she was totally apart from the world he lived in ill see you sunday then he said abruptly and he flicked on the engine and spun the car around too fast in the driveway a halfgrown collie pup heading down from the verandah to investigate yelped and scurried for cover and nick had to brake to avoid hitting him which sort of spoiled his dignified exit he made his exit anyway he didnt look backbut shanni and her parents stood on the verandah and watched him drive away and he could feel their eyes follow him all the way into town hes not your sort is he dear shannis mother had no sooner closed the kitchen door and put the kettle on than she was into probe mode nick had been right anything shanni chose to do was okay with her parents but that didnt mean they didnt enquire it was a joke mum shanni said mildly and her mother flashed her a look that said she wasnt stupid your johns been telling the town youve thrown him over for the magistrate johns a chauvinist twitand hes not my john hes a very worthy person her mother said sternly then a matching twinkle to her daughters flashed into her older eyes but youre right he lacks a sense of humour poor john your father and i are very relieved that youve finally seen it its only you think im jumping from the frying pan into the fire i would never have called john a frying pan her mother chuckled and shanni had to smile but maybe maybe nothing shanni took a deep breath im a big girl now mum and im not looking to get involved with a magistrate especially one whos carrying the scars nick is but harry thinks nick is great and if i can get a relationship going between them that baby needs someone who cares you care harry needs a male he needs a daddyand where theres a daddy theres usually a mother too oh for heavens sake shanni glowered halflaughing halfindignant mum i am not interested in nick daniels got it yes dear her mother said and shanni knew she didnt believe a word of it and maybemaybe she didnt either and nick nick drove home feeling more claustrophobic than hed felt in his life before all he wanted to do was to turn his car to head for the city and never come back or was it wasnt it that he wanted to turn the car and return to shanni no he wanted to leave this town which was really stupid his career plans said he had to stick this place out for two years and so far hed done less than a week great and hed be welcomed back to the city with open armshe didnt think if he appeared back in chambers next monday morning theyd assume hed failed his longterm plan was highcourt judge and this was step one he had to take it he didnt want to stay he didnt want this involvement not with the childor the girl he could concentrate on being a fine barrister he thought desperately and there was a possibility he could move sideways to the high court ha hed looked at that option and he knew it depended hugely on luck what he was doing now was the most certain way to get where he wanted put in the hard work abe had told him and abe was right which meant putting up with country lifeputting up with the gossip and the peopleand staying uninvolved but for heavens sake hed only been here for a few days and already he was involved up to his neck he should ring shanni and tell her their sunday date was off i do not want to go on a family picnic with a baby and a gorgeous girl and her grandma and grandpa and her brothers and sisters yes he did sort of he wanted to be there he knew but he wanted to walk away at the end heartwhole and fancyfree but he was starting to think there was no way that could happen and the thought scared him witless friday and saturday were endless even the witnesses and defendants in court seemed to know what was happening in his life and to be summing him up they think youre turning the place upside down mary told him at the break of a long and boring case deciding whether a farmers cows were damaging an access road you arrive weve had a hostage drama which will keep the district talking for years the kindergarten teacher has broken off with her intended he wasnt her intended john sure intended even if shanni didnt and nowthe kids have spread it all over town that their sisters in love with you theyd asked for that with their kissing stunt in the car nick thought wryly and grimaced im darned if i can see why everyone thinks its their business this is bay beach mary said simply everythings everyones business speaking of which dont but she was unstoppable i meant to tell you before this case started bill nuggins could quite easily drive his cows to the dairy across his back paddock instead of using the road hes using the road because the folk bought the place next door as a weekend home and he wanted to buy it himself so now he likes the idea of them having to drive through cow dung gee thanks this was useful information but it wasnt up to his clerk of court to give it to him think nothing of it she said blandly theyre nice people and hes giving them a hard time so i thought you should know im off after this so ill see you sunday at the picnic oh and youd best make your mind up about shanni shes not one to tread water very long what did she mean by that nick didnt know and he couldnt allow himself to care but he did care and not just about shanni he finished workadvising the farmer to reroute his cowstook himself for a solitary walk on the beach and found his feet taking him to harrys home it was bedtime and wendy greeted him as if shed been expecting him hes been waiting for you i didnt say id come he knew you would nick figured hed have to ignore that its implications were enormous how did the assessment go today were giving him another two weeks she said if he doesnt settle by then she left the words unspoken but nick knew exactly what she was saying if nick hadnt pulled off a miracle he shouldnt be here but despite his reservations he sat by the little boys bed and read him a story about a very dirty dog until harrys eyes closed in weariness and he slipped into sleep there was nothing else to do and harry needed him hes so little and his bodys still healing wendy told him as he emerged surprised by how ready for sleep harry had been he needs an afternoon sleep but he wont let himself relax hes exhausted but he fights sleep every inch of the way why did that sound familiar if he closed his eyes then things could happen bad things nick remembered the sensation all too clearly the world wasnt a safe place to sleep in shannis taking him clothesshopping tomorrow morning wendy told him closing the door on the sleeping child she was carrying a little girl on her hip and there were two older boys making hot chocolate in the kitchen much as wendy might care for harry there were limits to the personal attention he could get here and shanni must know it shes picking him up at ten would you like to go with them no nick shook his head im busy but the next day it took an iron will to keep him reading legal briefs in his apartment when he knew theyd be shopping he had to read the briefsif he didnt keep up with the legal world hed turn into a country bumpkinbut shanni and harry were out choosing clothes without him and for some reason the thought was deeply disturbing this was crazy he was going nuts one week down he thought desperately one hundred and three to go beach day grandpas birthday nick woke at six and spent an hour composing urgent messages telling shanni why he had to go to the city right now then he went for a jog on the beach thought of a few more messages showered composed a few more combed his hair flat citylawyer style picked up the phone put down the phone headed back to the shower washed his hair again dressed combed his hair roughly and allowed his curls to dry any which way went to collect shanni i was expecting you to cry off were you he cast her a sideways glance shanni had been waiting on the verandah as hed driven into the farmyard and she looked absolutely breathtakingly lovely she was simply dressed in a pink halterneck top the briefest of brief pink shorts and simple sandals her hair was sort of tousled and bunched on top her look was a million miles from that of any woman hed dated in the cityand she looked a million dollars she wasnt his style no i was expecting myself to cry off he admitted this isnt my scene she grinned teasing chicken id rather be a chicken than a dead hen he said it flippantly enough staring at the road ahead but she wasnt fooled for a minute she looked at him for a long moment as he steered back onto the highway and the smile she gave him became sympathetic hey were not that scary she said softly dont judges get to face murderers gang lords and drug barons whats a family picnic compared to that what indeed so there was no reason at all why his insides were telling him this was much much scarier harry was waiting too standing stolidly on the front porch with wendy with a look on his face that said he hadnt expected them to arrive at all he didnt smile when he saw them but the look of resignation lightened just a little and when wendy walked him to the car he didnt drag behind he looked straight ahead staring directly and unwaveringly at nickas if he was still expecting him to drive off fast then he paused and looked at nicks carseeing it for the first time the lightness faded fear flooding back i dont want to go he whispered harry doesnt like cars wendy said allowing him no time for protests but scooping him up and lifting him into nicks minuscule back seat but sometimes its the only way to get where you want to go right nick right nick turned and gave harry a reassuring grin there were two of them in this together then two males who were both scared to death and there was nothing for it but to go forward concentrate on something else but the fear hey i like your shirt he told harry starting the engine and giving shanni a sideways glance that begged for help he didnt need it his comment was apparently exactly the right thing to say mmm harry put his chin deep down on his chest and tried not to look pleased we bought it yesterday shanni told him harry and i went shopping for clothes didnt we harry its a swimming tshirt so i see the little boys shirt had fish and sharks and octopuses all over it nick approved absolutely its a fine choice for today your hair looks funny harry said yeah it did tooand it felt funny nick put his fingers up and raked his curls selfconsciously he felt exposed like this weird but its a fine choice for today too shanni said solidly and nick looked across at herand grinned maybe it didnt feel so bad after all nicks shirts a bit boring though she told harry dont you think hey im wearing pink spots and youre wearing fish she went on confining her conversation to the child in the back youd think nick could have found a shirt to wear that wasnt white its shortsleeved nick said protesting im not wearing a tie its fine its white do magistrates have to wear white yes always in truth he owned nothing else ill bet they dont shanni said thoughtfully what do you reckon harry i think nick would look better in pink spots do you silence then to nicks absolute astonishment harry chuckled at first he thought hed imagined it shanni too looked as if shed been struck by lightning as the childs rich chuckle slowly formed and echoed around them they looked at each other nick and shanni coconspirators in lighting this childs life and then slowly shannis face broke into a smile that said all her christmases had come at onceand then some pink she said and if her voice was choked with emotion then who could blame her im buying our nick a pinkspotted shirt first thing tomorrow morning and no one in the whole world is going to stop me and after that there was nothing to do but enjoy the day and accept that things were out of his control shannis extended family was enormous with assorted cousins aunts nieces and nephews boyfriends and hangerson like himself all equally welcomed into the chaos there were kids and dogs and food and more food there was beach cricket swimming sandcastles nick was drawn into the fray the minute he arrived hed worn his swimming shorts under his clothes his trousers and shirt were hauled from him by rob the moment he arrived half a gallon of sun lotion was slapped over him harrys cast was tied in an enormous plastic bag to keep it clean and he and harry were declared official cricket umpires magistrate work rob decreed and shanni chuckled and disappeared toward the water thats right make him useful there was part of nick that wanted to follow shannibut she didnt look back then they were made sandcastle judges biggest is not best either shanni told him in passing as she headed to prepare the picnic it was almost as if she was avoiding him and it kept happening after lunch harry was scooped up and placed on a floating airbed the towrope was put in nicks hand and he was sent out to sea with his passenger and shanni again was elsewhere the family assumed nick was here with harrynot with shanni nick found the sensation odd not bad butodd he was accustomed to women taking notice of himto women sticking as close as harrybut shanni wasnt sticking at all to shanni he seemed just one of the mob she was taking marys kids out to sea on their own airbeds she was swimming races diving surfacing for air laughing with delight whether she won or lost and then setting up the next race then she swooped in and made her own sandcastlewhen he and harry were batting at cricket with nick guiding the little boys hands anything he was doing she wasnt it finally started to rile him by midafternoon he was sure it wasnt happening by accident he could watch her all he wanted but only from a distance and she was so lovely youll have to move fast mary said into his ear and he jumped hed been a million miles away harry was settled on a towel by his side threequarters asleep and leaning heavily against him in sleepy contentment they were sated with sun sand and picnic and nick was finding it as hard as harry to focus but while harry was finding it hard to focus on anything nick was simply finding it hard to focus on anything that wasnt shanni iwhat do you mean for some reason it was hard to get his voice working just what i said mary plonked herself down on a towel and looked affectionately over at her sister theres never much of a gap between shannis men i dont know what business there never is for any of the mcdonald girls mary said smugly ignoring his interruption and looking across at her husband with affection theyre always snapped up by the most gorgeous of men my mike included mary take me for instance she said placidly i was married at nineteen and i could have been married a whole heap earlier if i hadnt been very very fussy she motioned across to where louise and her young man were building a sandcastle together im betting this little sister wont be far behindshe and alastair cant keep their eyes off each otherand hatty already has boyfriends even though shes only fifteen its only shanni whos slow on the uptake and thats because she cant choose i dont eleven proposals mary said sagely shaking her head at the wonder of it and thats just the serious ones its now starting all over again mum tells me since the town found out johns a thing of the past the phones been running hot your sisters very attractive nick said stiffly and mary chuckled she is and all i dont he started but she shook her head you do so why not admit it she said rising and shaking the sand from her towel ugh im coated and then she fixed nick with a stern look but whatever you do do it fast because as i said theres a queue she would not go near him shanni was aware of the eyes of her family on herwhat had started out as a joke had them all so interested it was almost sickening they were agogand she wasnt interested she wasnt if only nick wasnt sowasnt so different and that difference was impossible to define in so many ways he was the same as other men shed gone out with he had a great grinyes it was wonderful but other men had great grins he was stronghe must have swum since toddlerhoodhis lean figure had towed harry effortlessly on his floating mat and hed won every race with her various male cousins butother men were strong and tender he was amazingly tender the way he had lifted harry the way he had put sun lotion on the little boy and wiggled patterns down the childs back making him squeal in delight the way hed said something great about every kids sandcastle other men were great with kids it was more than that it was the way he just was the way he was justnick she saw so much that she knew he didnt want anyone to see the way he looked at harry as if he couldnt believe he was committing himself the way he looked around at her family as if he was hungering for something hed never had and yet wanted so badly the way he looked at her the way she seemed to know what was right there in his heart it scared her rigid andall her family were watching she wasnt interested she wasnt she avoided him like the plague it was almost dusk as they drove home theyd eaten tea on the beachshannis grandpa had ordered pizzas and one of the enduring images nick would take home from this day was the pizza delivery boy hiking over sandhills with a dozen or more boxes balanced precariously before him then shannis mum had produced a birthday cake grandpa had blown out seventy candles the birthday song had been bellowed by the entire family and the day had been declared officially over and it had left nick feelingempty as if hed been allowed to glimpse something that could never be his hed half expected to go home alone with harry but as hed put the little boy into the carhe was already fast asleepshanni had emerged from the crowd of her family and tossed her bag in beside him he was therefore deemed her chauffeur according to mary he should feel honoured he didnt he just feltmore empty as if he was being allowed more insight into what could never be his cat got your tongue she smiled at him as he started the engine her hair was escaping every which way from her crazy topknot she was sandcoated her nose was pinktipped from too much sunand he had an almost overwhelming urge to stop the car and kiss her he did no such thing the emptiness was almost tangible but emptiness was his life it was what he was accustomed to and he didnt know how the heck to cope with anything else so he steered the car toward the town and he clenched his hands on the steering wheel and he said nothing for a few minutes she watched him in matching silence nick whats wrong she asked at last and the teasing tone had become serious nothing when i say that to my kindergarten students and they say nothing it usually means theyve just made a puddle he grinned at that miss mcdonald i can assure you that i havent made a puddle im very glad to hear it she looked at him for a long moment questioning and then gave a slight shrug and turned to look over her shoulder at the sleeping harry hes had a wonderful day she said softly yes and you nick youve had a good time iyes im glad she said warmly probing no deeper my family think youre great because im not john there is that she chuckled oh dear i was a twit for thinking i could marry him therell be other fish in the sea i guess her voice faded nick mmm she looked across at him as if she was about to ask something thought better of it and pressed her lips together more silence then the town boundary came into view and it was say something now or the opportunity would be over will you see harry again she asked i dont know he said stiffly not for a while because youre busy she agreed cordially i guess i need to go to melbourne next weekend to change suits and ties i hoped youd kicked the habit he grinned at that yes okay ive kicked the habit but i do have another life you have a girlfriend in town no i see she didnt see at all she stared ahead as the car turned into the street leading to the childrens home time was running out it was now or never nick harrys dad took him to melbourne every weekend she said her voice suddenly urgent he worked here in the timber mill but every friday night he and harry headed for the city harrys grandmother lived there he has a grandmother she died just before peter did but harry still remembers going to the city are you suggesting nick said slowly thinking this through that i take harry to melbourne i dont see why not i think hed love it i cant cope with a baby on my own she thought about that and shook her head of course you can she was all decisive now right back into the bossy mode nick was starting to know and he had to admit enjoy youre a clever competent man nick daniels and harry is one very small boy you can cope if you want then i dont want he said bluntly harry in his favourite restaurants or with his sophisticated friends no and no and no but now shanni was looking at him as if hed personally betrayed her he couldnt let it matter he told himself desperately he couldnt let her drag him into this mess so that he was personally involved but yet as he stopped the car and went to lift the sleeping harry from the back seat he was aware of a lurch of pain in his gut harry was so small his cast looked so heavy and there were shadows of tiredness on his pale little face he stirred in sleep his eyes fluttered open and he smiled just ever so faintly as he saw who was carrying him then his eyes fell closed again and he relaxed absolutely in nicks arms nick might not want to get personally involvedbut he was already he had to walk away and with harry safely left in wendys chargethe little boy hadnt stirred as they washed him and popped him into bedhe had to take shanni home another five minutes in the car get this over with fast he told himself harshly move on but as the car pulled into the farmyard he was aware of a stab of absolute longingto somehow prolong the moment ithey tell me its the mayoral ball on friday week he told her and he was speaking too fast which confused him totally for heavens sake he didnt mess up invitations where was the smooth nick daniels now i gather im expected to attend i dont suppose youd like to go with me she stared at him for a long minute considering isnt that a bit dangerous she said at last her teasing voice back youd be expected to dance with me dancings okay just not emotion i guess she sighed and shook her head teasing fading nope this is never going to work you wont even let a tiny little boy touch your life hey im not asking for emotional entanglement here he said startled just a date i know youre not asking for emotional entanglement she sounded angry and he stared whats wrong youre upset that i wont take harry to melbourne next weekend she tilted her chin yes she said flatly i am you have the chance to do so much good nick daniels and you darent do it because of your precious independence you wont take a riskand harry suffers because of it so if i said id take harry to melbourne then youd come to the ball with me it was the wrong thing to say and he knew it the moment the words were uttered she drew in her breath in a sharp angry hiss and she drew away from him her anger tangible in the still night air she was struggling for wordsstruggling to say anything and in the end all she could manage was a furious how dare you his brows rose what on earth was she on about how dare i what she was almost beside herself with anger youd barter a little boys love fora date thats not what i said thats exactly what you said she snapped she hauled herself out of the car slammed the door shut and glared at him for all she was worth the emotions of the day bubbled to boiling point and the steam had to be let out somehow and here it came you arrogant selfishtoad she threw at him you know what harry needs he needs a friend who cares for him thats all hes not asking anything more of you than that but you sit there in your icy calculating world and you wont let anyone near and everythings bought or sold or thought of as payment due take harry to melbourne and get yourself a date for a ball you dont want to go to come and be a country magistrate and get yourself the next step up the career ladder buy and selland dont ever get involved you make me sick nick daniels you make me absolutely sick shanni goodbye and she stalked up the verandah steps without saying another word while nick sat stunned the front door slammed shut behind her and nick wasnt able to see that with the door safely closed shanni leaned against it and burst into tears chapter seven messed up your love life have you i beg your pardon gowned and groomedif you didnt count his nonsmoothed hairnick was ready for his monday morning list so was mary youre glowering like youve just learned youre having no holidays for a yearand our shannis looking the same what shanni does is nothing to do with me funny mary tossed him an impudent grin thats what shanni says about you well just have to see what happens mary hmm put a sock in it he said dourly and then he stared at his court list mary why does it say bart commin is appearing first up i thought i sentenced him to ten days were appealing she said cheerfully rob organised it emmas going nuts how can it be an appeal when hes not being represented robs representing him a policeman nick said carefully cannot lodge an appeal where does it say that mary demanded and nick stared i they often do she told him kindlyclerk of courts dispensing wise legal advice to magistrate surely you know that the state has the right to appeal if they believe the sentence is too lenient so we figured what if the sentence is too tough whats the difference mary which it is she told him sternly barts screaming the place down shivering sobbingthe works if you let him out then old doc harris will pop him in hospital for a couple of days hell sort him out and well all be happy ill organise him to be shifted to hospital while he serves his time not here you cant your worship she said primly not while hes supposed to be in jail bay beach has a country bush hospital with no secure wards hed have to go to the warrbook hospital and hed hate it oh great so now were into personal preferences nick raked his hair in exasperation mary hes a prisoner hes a convicted thief with a record longer than your arm hes stolen nothing but beansand hes a nice old man marys voice was reproachful he might be a drunk but we all like him go on nick have a heart so fifteen minutes later nick found himself reducing barts sentence by six daysand he found himself wondering just how much more heart was required in this job and how much more he had to give harry required heart all day monday harry stayed in his mind niggling like a bad conscience and all day tuesday shanni was in his mind toobut there was nothing he could do about shanni he told himself savagely shanni didnt need him and he couldnt even begin to think that he might need her no concentrate on harry leave shanni to her queues of suitors he had to concentrate on harry tuesday night he walked over to the home and almost knocked on the doorand then he walked away he did a few miles of jogging on the beach came back stared at the darkened childrens home swore at himself and then went back to his apartment above the courthouse and thought shanni harry shanni harry wednesday night he returned and this time he knocked it was too hard not to nick wendy met him at the door her face wary there were two little girls in the hall playing with dolls wendy half opened the door but she didnt invite him in can i help you i came to see harry have you now there was caution in her voicenot the open friendliness shed shown him last week what had shanni said to her but shanni it seemed hadnt said a word the wariness was all wendys harry had a lovely day on sunday nick she said just wonderful but thenon monday he sort of thought youd come shanni didnt know if you would i wasnt sure so i rang the courthouse mary said shed have you ring back didnt you get my message yeah hed got the message it had taken him up until now to figure out what he wanted to say im sorry harry doesnt mind you not coming so much wendy said well to be honest he does mind but he can cope what he cant cope with is not knowing where he stands with you whether he has a friend or not and there it was if he committed now hed be committing totally this wasnt like a relationship with an adult that he could explain away at some time in the future not like his relationship with shanni for heavens sake think of harry harry there was no way he could back out now can i talk to you he said im here to be talked to wendy said she held the door open a little wider but still she didnt invite him in harrys in the kitchen talk here you need to make a decision before you go one step further her voice warned him and he nodded wendy im not talking about taking harry on longterm or anything he warned i cant adopt him or foster him no ones asking you to do that her eyes were still wary and she was reading his eyes harry isnt asking that he expects nothing of the world but he needs a friend desperately a friend whos constantwho says ill see you once a week and who doesnt break that promise unless theres a darned good reason and harry knows what that reason is once a week any less than that and its not worth it she said bluntly hes just a baby and hes too little to remember so yes once a week or nothing nick took a deep breath and took the plunge i can do that there it was said the commitment made him take a step back hed never made such a promise in his life butit wasnt such a bad feeling except it scared him half to death and wendy saw did you ever have any decent relationships with anyone she asked gently when you were little ino she shook her head and the wariness was gone there was only gentleness and caring left then praise be she said softly it seems bay beach has itself quite a magistrate if you can get over that hey i dont you already have she said warmly and threw the door wide tonight youve taken the first step lets see where we go from here he still had to go to melbourne for the weekend it wasnt just ties he thought dryly hed only brought necessities thinking hed be back and forth all the time so he needed to go but when he told wendy and harry that i like melbourne harry said sitting up at the kitchen table eating a bowl of chocolate ice cream and trying not to look as if hed been given the world because his nick had come to visit because his nick was eating chocolate ice cream beside him me and daddy went to melbourne every weekend did you it was impossible for nick not to hear the hint in the little boys voice the longing and for a whole five seconds he stayed strong but wendy was watching him daring him wendy who was shannis friend and nick knew what shanni would expect him to do harry was watching too with eyes that said he expected nothing it was too much a tougher man than him would break under this pressure would you like to come yes harry said so promptly that nick nearly choked on his ice cream for heavens sake what had he done but it was too late to draw back now ill pick you up on friday after work he said casting a desperate look at wendy she grinned seedoesnt hurt at all i dont know how to care for himlook after his leg ill write you a list of instructions she said blithely but kidcares a doddle easy as falling off a log ill even organise a booster seat for the car but there was one more problem and it wasnt nicks ii dont want to go in the car harry said and his voice was suddenly desperately anxious he even stopped icecreameating wendy sighed scooped him up and placed him on her knee she understood this fear harry you and your daddy had a terrible car crash but that was a really unlucky time its not going to happen again but harry was torn nick could see it he desperately wanted to go to melbournewith his nickbut hours in a car with all of his dreadful memories was almost too much to face okay then in for a penny well take the train nick said wendy almost dropped harry youre joking i never joke nick said heavily mores the pity well catch the evening train on friday will you be ready harry yes he said joyfully and he wriggled off wendys lap and burrowed his face into his ice cream as if it was champagne what had he done he couldnt believe hed offered for the next couple of days nick worked in a stunned stupor taking a tiny child to melbourne giving up his car for the weekend his friends would die laughing they wouldnt see he decided he couldnt take harry to his usual haunts where would he take him youre quiet mary said as she gave him his friday court list heaven knew whether shed heard of his weekend plans probably not he decided shed have said something but it was unlike this town to keep things quiet for wendy not to talk mary was waiting for an answer and he had to dredge one from somewhere its justim looking forward to a weekend away ill bet you are she said softly and her eyes held a look he didnt understand in the least he was running late since when did court cases ever run to time he thought bitterly grabbing his overnight bag and heading for the station with speed he had minutes before the train left please let wendy have harry on the platform she did and she had tickets in her hand as well bless her the whistle blew as she handed over tickets harrys overnight bagand harry have fun boys she called as they disappeared into their carriage and then she grinned and have fun shanni she added and she walked away with her fingers crossed car three compartment five the train jolted into motion harry clung onto nicks hand like grim death and they made their way carefully down the corridor as nick checked seat allocation i wonder if we have the compartment to ourselves nick said and then he stopped he was at the right door but there was already a passenger in the compartment it was shanni for all of ten seconds they stared at each other shocked into immobility in the end it was harry who broke the silence his smile unused for so long now threatened to split his face are you coming to melbourne with us he asked her deeply pleased i am but nick saw she was as flabbergasted as he was are you going on the train to melbourne too yes said harry firmly hitching himself up on to the seat beside shanni and wriggling his small backside deep into the leather i am me and nick why she asked carefully looking at harry and not at nick are you not driving to melbourne in nicks car i dont like cars harry said silence while she chewed that one over nick put the baggage up in the racks and tried to think of something to say anything she was as stuck for words as he was and when she finally spoke her voice was loaded with bitterness i think shanni said carefully that ive been set up not by me he told her and sat down opposite nicks voice sounded angry and harry looked at him in surprise unnoticed the train gathered speed and bay beach faded into the distance behind them i guess i could always get off at the next stop shanni looked as if shed like to jump off right now great but nick bit his lip and looked at harrys drooping face hed looked so pleased why are you going to melbourne he enquired at last to visit my aunt adele shes ill and my mothers worried i see except now she was deep in thought not seeing him and she was almost talking to herself my family have been odd marys been telling me how worried mum was about adele and mum was sort of agreeingonly not saying muchand then when i said id phone adele rob said emma phoned her this morning and she was miserable then mary offered to buy me a train ticket as the family contribution you think theyve set this up nick said he couldnt see any other reason behind this and he wouldnt put it past mary for a minute i wouldnt be the least bit surprised shannis anger matched his john came around last night and louise told himright in my hearingthat he wasnt welcome and i was in love with you he drove off before i could reach him i ask you in love withyou she said you as if he was some sort of dungbeetleand despite his annoyance nick had to grin which is ridiculous he said politely which is ridiculous she said and glowered so what do we do were all going to melbourne harry said pleased again now shanni had stopped talking of getting off you and me and nick i imagine we can put up with each other for the journey nick said politely you never know your aunt might be sick she might not be shanni sighed anger giving way to exasperation i guess i can shop will you shop with me harry asked anxiously and shanni managed a smile hey you and i shopped last saturday you havent worn those clothes out yet no but you and nick are having a boys weekend she told him you dont need a lady youre not a lady he told her youre you that sounds the very nicest thing anyone has ever said about me she told him still smiling but flattery will get you nowhere harry my lad its a boys weekend and i dont need anything to do with it which meant as the train arrived at melbourne harry and nick prepared to bid shanni farewell or nick prepared to harry had other ideas where does your aunty live harry demanded brighton is that close to where were going this was one bright kidand he was certainly persistent nick nodded reluctantly yes were going to st kilda which is on the way to brighton then because it was the only polite thing to say he added a rider would you like to share a cab that would be nice shanni said smiling at harry but eyeing nick with reservations and then separate directions right right only once in the cab harry started to talk hed been his usual silent self on the train journey but now he seemed to sense there was some urgency about proceedings what will you and your aunty do for the weekend he asked shanni if my auntys sick then ill look after her what are you boys going to do nick shrugged im not sure well think of something will you meet us for just a little bit harry said and suddenly there was the faintest tremor in his voice he looked uncertainly at nick and his look said hed suddenly remembered he didnt know this man very well for all he knew nick could be planning a weekend doing very boring grownup thingsand miss mcdonald was fun i shanni wasnt sure what her response should be shed heard the tremor come shopping with us harry urged she glanced at nickand then glanced away again i may not be able to and nick sighed he knew when he was being bulldozed and he was being bulldozed now it would make harry feel more secure if he knew hed see shanni again so there was no choice ill take harry to one of the cake shops in acland street tomorrow morning he said grudgingly join us for coffee if your aunt can spare you or if i can spare my aunt she saidand looked at harry okay harry i make no promises but you just might see me tomorrow morning there was no time for more the taxi pulled up outside the address nick had given and she gazed up in stunned silence nicks apartment was in a three storeyed block right on the esplanade overlooking the ocean she didnt need to see any closer to figure this place had cost him a mint no wonder he hadnt been too impressed with his sea view at bay beach he had his own sea view here surrounded by city comforts wow said harry double wow said shanni st kilda was only ten minutes from the city and her aunts place at brighton was further out it had made sense therefore for the taxi to drop nick and harry off first so now she knew where he livedand his obvious wealth didnt make getting to know the man any easier they had even less in common than shed thought he was a lawyer and a magistrate and he was wealthy he was a man alone a man completely out of her ken she watched in silence as nick handed payment to the taxi driverand then frowned as he demurred at the change no the ladys fare is on me nick you dont need to she started but he allowed no protest itll make me feel better to make sure youre safely home orsafely away from you shanni thought bleakly as the taxi did a uturn and drove away from man and child leaving you to your precious independence butwhy on earth did the thought make her feel so bleak it wasnt only shanni who was questioning feelings nick might have his independencesort ofbut independence wasnt something that sat well with threeyearolds he showed harry into the spare room harry looked at the enormous bed and his eyes stayed blank in a look nick was starting to know it was his withdrawal look its a great big bed nick said cheerfully hed fitted his spare room with a double bed because most of his friends were partneredspasmodically you can sleep in the middle and wiggle all you want where do you sleep harry asked in a subdued little voice that told nick he was in even more trouble than hed thought next door want to see he did so nick led the way opened the bedroom door and heard harry gasp do you sleep in that bed all by yourself yep well most of the time anyway and he wasnt going into that with a threeyearold itsits ginormous it is nick smiled and led the little boy forward its called a kingsized bed actually he admitted its two beds its so big i couldnt get it up the stairs in one piece so i brought two single beds and joined them together see he lifted the covers harry dropped down on the plush pile carpet and inspected eight legs it is two beds he agreed why do you sleep in two beds ii like room to wiggle if we pulled them apart then we could have a little bed each in the same room harry said wistfullyand waited his eyes were still blankas if he was afraid to hope that hadnt been in the plan sleep in the same room as harry but harry was looking at him with dreadful eyeseyes that told him the thought of sleeping in a huge bed in a bedroom all by himself held nothing but terror oh great big choice here so i guess we can nick agreed faintly and watched the blank look fade youd like that harry told him and his eyes dared nick to agree we could talk in bed so we could he hadnt thought of that either wendy says i have to go to bed at eight oclock do you go to bed at eight oclock there was nothing for it nick nodded with all due solemnity not usually he said truthfully but this weekend i just might he did in the end it was easier because harry couldnt settle he lay and stared at the ceiling while nick read him a story and when nick finished reading his eyes were just as firmly open as when hed started when nick tried to leave the room he said nothingjust stayed staring up at the ceiling with a fixed expression of stoicism hed been here before the expression said strange place strange people strange shadows familiar fear and nick who remembered the feeling as if it were yesterday couldnt bear it i am tired he told harry i think ill come to bed too thatd be okay harry said still stoical he was so careful not to let his eagerness show in case this wonderful offer should be snatched away again so nick slid between the covers of his now single bed and stared at the ceiling himself in the halflightfor heavens sake at eight it was hardly dark and while harry drifted firmly into sleep nick wondered what shanni was doing and wondered and wondered and wondered chapter eight coffee and cakes in acland street was an institution the street had been the cake centre of melbourne for generations each shop vying to supply the most mouthwatering cakes and each shopfront more wonderful than the last nick and harry wandered hand in hand for half an hour as harry checked every cake nick was content to do as harry wished two weeks ago cakechoosing would have bored him silly but hed come a long way in two weeks to give harry pleasure was pleasure enough and his mind had things to dwell on finally harry made his choicesponge cake topped with meringue strawberries and chocolate and he wanted a rather strangesounding lemonade and lime drink tooa lime spider nick gave his approvalthis place had great coffee tooand they settled on a table outside on the pavement like longterm friends i like this place harry said in a very muffled voice his mouth was full of cake he took a sip of his lime spider and thought about it then paused and his face clouded i dont think my daddy brought me here he stared down at his cake and his voice fell away i cant even remember if he liked cakes he loved cakes and here she was nick spun around to see shanni bearing down from behind she was dressed in a lovely light linen dress her hair was flying free and she was laden with shoppingshe must have a dozen carrier bags hi boys she beamed her pleasure at finding them dumped her bags in a huge pile and plonked herself onto a spare seat phew harry your daddy was the biggest cakeeater in bay beach when the local school had its fête he was first in the queue for the cake stall and by the look of that cake you take right after him what a great choice can i have one too she kicked off her sandals sighed with relief and beamed again at the pair of them arent i clever to find you we didnt even make a definite time or a place very clever nick said drylythere was no hint in his voice of the lurch of pleasure hed felt at the sight of herand shannis beam broadened you might at least sound pleased to see me harry are you pleased to see me yes harry said definitely i am nicks beds too big we had to chop it in half i see her perplexed forehead said she didnt see at all but she was game to try sotell me all you chopped nicks bed in half with an axe no silly harry giggled and shannis eyes met nicks there was a message clearly writtencongratulations her smile was almost patronising nick thought but he felt his chest expand a notch his world had lightened just a little or maybe a lot he hadnt wanted to see herbut now she was here shanni we think we might be bored now harry was confiding after our cake we dont know what to do nick says we might visit a lawyer he knows who has a baby do you want to do that shanni asked harry buried his nose in lime spider no he whispered avoiding nicks eyes shanni smiled again goodness a harry ready to assert himself this was something indeed i see her eyes flew to nicks gently mocking time for a rethink then your worship ill figure it out he signalled for more coffeehe needed itand cake and spider for shanni and when he turned back harry and shanni were deep in her parcels harry was peering into one parcel after the other his whole head disappearing theyre all clothes he said emerging disgusted and nick grinned women do that yeah and men buy hair cream and silk ties bought your semitrailerload yet shannis eyes flew to his unruly mop and he grinned selfconsciously well no this felt strange he thought weird butgood to be sitting in the sun with a funny bubbly lady and a kid who no one wanted but who looked at him as if he knew everything as if he liked him it wasnt a sensation nick had ever experienced and he wasnt quite sure what to do with it go with the flow he thought and try to keep the goofy grin off your face hows your aunt he asked and shanni wrinkled her pert nose in disgust she isnt that startled him you meanshes dead shes in adelaide visiting an ancient schoolfriend shanni said bitterly she left last week ill my foot lying conniving family you wait until i get my hands on them isee he didnt quite so you stayed in an empty house last night i stayed in a hotel she gave a beleaguered smile my aunts locked the place like fort knox there are signs saying the house is guarded by the automatic shotgun doberman and machetecarrying security company and i dont have a key so i got to stay in a seedy thirdrate hotel shanni you can stay at nicks harry said urgently the conversation was confusing but he had one point clear shanni needed a bedand he needed shanni the course therefore was crystalclear nick has a whole bedroom he doesnt use and he has the biggest bed nick and me sleep in the choppedup bed in nicks room so you can have the big bed hey she was taken abackand even more so when she glanced at nick and found him smiling at her well what else could he do yes shanni its free for heavens sake what was he saying it was as if his mouth was forming words without his head being engaged but he couldnt stop himself or he just had a brilliant thought you could have the choppedup bed if you likewith harryand ill have the big one no harry said urgently you and me have to sleep in the choppedup beds nick wendy says boys dont sleep with girls neither they do nick thought resignedly watching shanni grin and seeing every last vestige of a controlled weekend disappear before his eyes neither they do after elevenses shanni went straight into bossy mode and they went rollerblading because you guys havent decided what to do its up to me to organise something i havent been to the esplanade for years but i bet they still rollerblade just like they did when i was here on teachertraining can i go rollerblading harry said and shanni nodded well sort of itll be rollerpushing for you my boy until you get that leg straight but ill bet youll enjoy it wont he nick sure for the life of him it was all he could think of to say there was nothing for it but to agree so they dumped her gear in nicks apartmentgreat jumping jehosophat shanni said when she saw nicks expensive white and chrome decor and harry chortled his agreementand headed down to hire equipment i cant rollerblade in my leg cast harry said sadly seeing the equipment on offer and looking down at his ungainly leg and i dont know how do i have to watch he most certainly didnt no shanni decreed i told you its rollerpushing for you these are just the ticket and she motioned to the pushchairs beside the hire store youre the navigator shanni told him belting him into a pushchair unlike normal strollers this one had huge wheels and a high handle built for parents who wanted to push children with speed you say fast and well go fast you say stop then we stop she rethought that and grinned up at nick who was too stunned to say anything orwe might stop if we can its a long time since i wore rollerblades and i dont know how good nick is im good nick said affronted and shanni grinned there you go then your nicks a lawyer a magistrate and a rollerblade expert as well harry what a man and nick knew she was mocking him but he was so far out of his depth that he couldnt care less this was a day for putting pride aside for putting everything aside except the moment they rollerbladed for the day with harry before them they took a handle each and went flying along the beachfrontwhizzing in and out of pedestrians and cyclists and dogwalkers as if theyd been born on wheels slow down nick said at first but shanni grinned and increased speed wuss and after that they didnt speak nick was totally befuddledand there was no need to talk anyway the path was hardly crowdedit went for ever all the way along the beachfront toward the cityand their speed matched exactly their movements matched exactly when shanni slowed nick slowed with her anticipating every movement when she turned he turned when a dog lunged toward them off its lead they braked as one waited until the dog shot across their path and then scooted on again harry squealing with delight nick watched her out of the corner of his eyes her curls were flying her eyes were dancing she looked alive and vibrant and free and gorgeous and harry the little boy was lit up like a christmas tree he sat bolt upright in his chair his eyes were wide with excitement and he crowed with joy every now and then he looked up and grinned and nick and shanni grinned back down at himand then grinned at each other as he returned to the serious business of navigation which seemed to be a simple matter of crowing faster faster faster until shanni flung back her head her curls flying and she choked on a bubble of laughter and slowed here slavedriver what did your last horse die of im about to leave my legs behind me at this speed nick okay i concede i concede slow down they slowedbut not much they left the beach and followed the bikepath until they reached the river then slowed as the crowds thickened on the riverbanks but still they wove dexterously through still there were no words spoken they knew what the other intended it was like a sixth sense or more likea combining of senses of becoming one it was like a marriage both felt ityet neither could say and then they were on the banks of the yarra approaching the wide expanse of the riverbank gardens it was the most gorgeous day and melbournites were making the most of it there were couples and families and jugglers and icecream vendors and dogs on leads and enough shanni decreed this is where we stopor ill die of exhaustion so they stopped and they sank onto the grass removed their rollerblades lifted harry out of his pushchair nestled him between them and settled in for a late lunch hot dogs icecreams soft drink and more soft drinkbecause im so dehydrated i could drink a river shanni declared and then they lay back with the sun warm on their faces and watched the rowers lazily stroking up and down the river or rather shanni and harry watched the rowers nick watched shanni what she demanded catching him at his gazing as she gave the last of her chocolate icecream a reluctant farewell lick what do you mean what youve hardly said a word you just watch me do i have icecream on my nose did my hot dog leave ketchup what are you staring at it was impossible to lie just you he told her and the look in his eyes made her blush from the toes up dear heaven and silence fell again but this time the silence was different they almost slept only not quite because harry was too excited and shanni and nick were too aware as the day wore on they rollerbladed through the botanic gardens feeding the ducks checking out every nook and cranny feeling the oneness of themselves as a unit and in his pushchair harry finally slept the sleep of the exhausted and the absolutely content as evening fell they pushed themselves home back along the esplanade still there was so little to say to each otherbut this was no awkward silence it was as if they hardly knew where to startas if there was a great well of untapped sharing that they were not brave enough to tap for fear of starting a flow that each was somehow fearful of the rollerblade hire place was locking up as they reached it the owner smiled as he saw them come not angry in the least now how did i know youd be the last of my customers back he beamed if i may say so as i watched the three of you head off this morning it did my old heart good see i said to the wife theres still love in the world he nudged his elderly wife and the two of them beamed with such goodwill that nick nigh on blushed as crimson as shanni when will your leg get better the lady asked harry who having just woken up was lazily content to lie back and watch the world without fear normally a stranger talking to him would have made him shrivel not today the doctor says i might have to wear my cast until christmas harry said but then itll be all better youre a lucky little boy the lady smiled and so did harry i know he said proudly and shannis going to sleep with us tonight they left with nicks face burning and shanni in a bubble of laughter she couldnt contain then they ateagainin a restaurant overlooking the beachand then what next harry demanded hed had a solid afternoon nap and was raring to go nothing that requires legs shanni groaned i cant feel my feet theyve gone walkabout or rollerbout this afternoon my body forgot it was no longer a teenager but its remembering now nick couldnt agree more he smiled at shanniat the pair of themand he knew what would work pictures i think pictures harry frowned have you ever been to the cinema no that settles it pictures which wasnt as easy as it sounded nicks local cinema catered for adults and shanni checked out its main offerings and shook her head no chance nick daniels mature audience doesnt mean threeyearolds but that means theres only yes she grinned as they perused the advertisement board theres a choice of exactly one or one hundred and one dalmatians to be precise dalmatians nick said faintly and shanni chuckled and took his arm which felt weird but very very good romance and comedy and dogs she said what could be better and fantasy to boot its just what this weekend is all about so nick sat through a movie hed never dreamed of seeing as a child movies hadnt been for the likes of nick and as an adult with his carefully acquired sophistication hed have died rather than see such a show but to his amazement he found himself chortling along with shanni and harry and gasping as harry did then as the dalmatians deadly peril grew closer and harry abandoned his seat and clambered onto nicks knee it was entirely natural that shanni should move across to harrys seat to stay closeand it was also natural that nicks free arm should come around her shoulders so they could gasp together happily evil was conquered and one hundred and one dalmatians were consigned to live happily ever after and as harry sleepy sated and totally content was carried out into the foyerit was also natural that nicks hand should hold shannis nick the exclamation stopped them dead it was a voice he knew only too well nick turned and there was abe barry his head of chambers heading straight for him rachel abes wife of thirty years was right beside him and both were smiling their pleasure nick what on earth are you doing in town abe demanded how are you boy im fine thank you sir nick adjusted harry in his arms and extended his hand in greeting it was pumped enthusiastically but abes eyes were on his companions this is shanni mcdonald sir nick told him and harry theyre from bay beach youre settling in well are you abes keen eyes missed nothing his eyes darted from harry to shanni and back again read about that bit of drama in the papers damned business thought you said nothing would ever happen in bay beach i dont get to try the case but otherwisethe jobs turning out well his eyes were still questioning shannis presence iyou could say that what else was he supposed to say im very happy to hear it rachel tucked her arm into her husbands she inspected shanni and smiled her pleasure hello nicholas this is the kindergarten teacher you were held hostage with isnt it i saw your picture in the paper what a dreadful experience andharry did you say is this your little one dear hes ours for the weekend shanni smiled and her smile hugged harry all by itself arent we lucky what film have you been to see abe asked frowning this jigsaw didnt quite fit and he wasnt a man who took kindly to gaps rachel dragged me along to see some fineart film did you see that no sir we saw dalmatians dalmatians he stared confused this wasnt the nick he knew have we seen that rachel yes dear she said placidly with the grandchildren last school holidays oh the elderly mans bushy eyebrows beetled down astounded so we did and nick practically groaned he could see this story being all around the lawcourts within the week but dont you worry my dear i wont let him gossip rachel said conspiratorially and started pressing her husband away not yet anyway i can tell that things are too precious and too new to breathe about all the best my dears nick im so excited for you ive worried about you so dreadfully and she led abe offspeechless and so was nick iwe should go home its time for bed shanni said finally fighting mounting colour i mean her colour rose higher i know what you mean nick managed and yes i entirely agree with you its time to go home there was no trouble getting harry to sleep no trouble at all he hugged them both put his head onto the pillow and was out like a light before shanni and nick could move from the bed and then what nick didnt know this was unfamiliar territory nick was so aware of shannis body beside him he could hardly breathe and he was so tense why on earth shanni was just a woman a country kindergarten teacher there was no reason at all why every nerve in his body should be screaming its awareness of her but it wasand she seemed to sense it im tired too she said awkwardly it seemed and she stood on tiptoes and gently kissed himlightly on the cheek as one would kiss a friend im going to bed goodnight nick and she took herself off to his spare room fast leaving nick with the overwhelming impression that she was escaping which she was there wasnt much sleep where shanni was going shanni lay in the unfamiliar bed and stared at the ceiling she had absolutely no idea what was going on here or maybe she did and she was just running scared she knew nothing about this man she told herself desperately he was totally out of her ken she liked country boysboys who had family who liked kids dogs horses country things she had a very clear idea of where her life was going and it didnt include someone like nick daniels he wears designer suits she whispered into the night but he wasnt wearing one now she almost wished he was itd make it easier she shouldnt be so attracted why not because he was damaged goods she told herselfand there was another puzzle why did he seem like that she lay with her hands linked behind her head and tried to figure it out damaged most women wouldnt see it she thought theyd see the exterior theyd see nicks almost breathtaking good looks the wealth and position his great smile and the sophisticated lifestyle they were all things that didnt interest her in the least or maybe maybe she was a liar maybe the smile was important the way he let his guard down when she least expected it and the way he grinned down at harry as if they were coconspirators which they were coconspirators in pain she thought wondering just how different their backgrounds were if they were the same nick would never let her close now for harry aged three there was time to heal but a man in his thirties whod been taught the hard way never to let anyone close was a different proposition entirely what was happening this weekend was miracle enough she told herself fiercely and she mustnt expect more if nick could give a part of himself to help heal a child who needed him that was all she should ask but there was a part of her that was screaming for moredemanding more it wanted a part of him for herself there was a part of shanni that wanted nicks love and it would be content with nothing less which is just stupid she said savagely into the night youll just break your heart down that road shanni mcdonald so you might as well forget about it right now and nick just through the wall nicks thoughts were as jumbled as shannis some things though were crystalclear he knew exactly what his body was telling him he wanted shanni like a physical ache and that ache was almost unbearable he wanted her and he wanted her and he wanted her all day hed wanted her every time she brushed his armin the cinema his need had driven him nutsevery touch and every look and every faint scent of her was driving him to distraction butshe was a country girl shed have certain expectations he had no hope of meeting what he wanted he decided was to make fierce passionate love to herto get this need out of his system but she wasnt his normal type of woman he knew instinctively that she wasnt a girl whod accept a onenight stand and afterwards if he succeeded in making love to her and she felt committed no matter how plain he made it that he wanted no ongoing commitment he had to live in the same town as her for another two years her sister was his clerk of courts her brother was one of the policemen he worked with like it or not he was bay beachs magistrate and he knew that making casual love to shanni would mess that up like nothing else could so seduction no out of the question which shouldnt faze him he told himself into the bleak darkness while harry slept on contentedly beside him there were women hed been attracted to in the past who were unobtainable hed never found it a problem hed simply moved on to someone else whod accepted him on his terms seducing country innocents wasnt his style this nearness to shanni was only for this night he told himself for one night he had to keep himself under control and then get on with life move on to someone more suitable but he wanted shanni no the scream spilt the night terror knifing through every last corner of the apartment and shannis feet were out of bed and onto the floor almost before shed heard it what no no no dont hit me dont she was out of bed diving through to the nextdoor bedroom with the speed of light shoving open nicks door and flicking on the switch so she could see no one was hitting anyone of course not nightmares harry was sitting bolt upright in bed his face ashen and his eyes staring at some invisible spectre as if it was the most fiendish apparition imaginable nick was with himholding the boy tight but making no impression on the little ones terror he looked up as shanni entered and his face was almost as white as harrys he started struggling in his sleep sobbing and now this dear god no the scream was heartrending harrys terror was raw and real and shannis heart clenched in horror at what must have gone on in the past to cause this but this was now there was no room for delving into the past nicks attempts at comfort werent working this fear had to be faced and worked through and this was no time for gentle soothing she crossed to the bed sat down facing harry and took his rigid little hands in hers forcing him to turn in nicks arms to face her then she spoke her voice strong and sure and authoritative harry it was a stern commanda voice to be obeyed wake up harry youre having a bad dream can you see me harry he didnt focus the spectre was still there no matter how tight nick held him harry look at me look at me now it was her best commanding kindergartenteacher voice and finally it seemed to get through her face was inches from his she was right in his line of visionputting herself between harry and his terror while nick held on for all he was worth it was all he could do harry look at me please its shanni im here with you and nicks holding you were your friends and were here no ones hitting you harry wake up and look and finally his gaze moved it shifted just fractionally but instead of an unseeing gaze into distant fear he focussed waveringly on shanni the terror was still right behind her she could almost see it and she had to dispel it send it back from wherever it had come from theres no one here but nick and me no one else youre having a bad dream thats all it is a bad dream harry no one is hurting you still the sense of disbelief nicks holding you and he loves you shanni said strongly nick wont let anyone hurt you will you nick no way it was a low growl but it was almost a choke and shanni glanced at nick and saw all sorts of emotions playing on his face there were shadows therebut that had to wait until later focus on harry youre with me and nick harry you have nick and you have me and you have wendy we all love you and we wont let anyone hurt you ever do you hear me nicks hold on his rigid little body tightened even more harry was now staring straight at shanni a trickle of sweat running down his forehead and shanni gave an involuntary shiver its gone harry she said softly holding his hands and not letting her eyes leave his forcing him to keep looking at her were with you youre safe nick and i are right here youre with grownups who love you theres nothing to be afraid of i it was a wavering sob nothing will touch you while youre with us shanni said gently flicking an upward glance at nick i promise thats what were here for to keep you safe andslowlyalmost unbelievablyharry nodded shanni saw his body slacken within nicks grasp the awful rigidity fading with the terror and theninstantlyhis little body slumped against nick his eyes closed and he slipped back into the safety of sleep leaving nick holding him as if hed never let him go it took three of four minutes before either of them moved shanni was aware that she was shaking she was warm enoughshe was wearing very nonsexy long flannelette pyjamasbut harrys terror had left its shadows it was still real and palpable in her heart she looked at nick and she knew he felt the same and then some hes safely asleep she whispered at last he hardly woke up just long enough to be reassured he probably wont remember any of this tomorrow i couldnt get through to him nick said shaken to the core i tried its a trick you learn in kindergarten training she said never be gentle with a terrified child be direct bossy even he gave the ghost of a grin you were certainly that ask my family bossiness is my speciality she rose resplendent in her pink pyjamas with woolly sheep all over them and nick blinked at the vision she created amazing i guessill go back to bed now she said if you slip him down under the covers its my guess hell keep right on sleeping yes nick looked down at harrys mop of unruly fair hair and his mouth twisted into a grimace there was a part of him that really didnt want to let him go shanni thought as she watched ever hed been hurt himself she knew and she was starting to figure out how badly nick had been down this road before and maybe there hadnt been a shanni or a nick or a wendy for him hes been hit in the past yes were you beaten as a child she askedand waited for a long minute she thought he wouldnt answer this was a closet that had long been locked she guessed never to be reopened and here she was probing where it hurt most but if the closet stayed locked what was inside could well stay there for ever i dont he stopped as if he didnt know what else he could possibly say instead he did as shanni suggested letting harry slip down onto the pillows he adjusted his covers touched his hair lightly with his strong fingers and then turned to face shanni this was ridiculous he was wearing boxer shortsnothing elseand he was barechested and felt naked and she was rumpled from sleep her curls flying everywhere and she was standing before him in those ridiculous sheepish pyjamas and suddenly he had to tell her he had to tell someone no he had to tell her explain why it was impossible for him to love yes he said harshly i was beaten badly the last time the last time the last time my mother decided she wanted me my stepfather didnt he gave me a pretty bad time before i was taken away how old were you then seven it was as much as he could say but she needed to know no more nick dont you dare feel sorry for me he said roughlymore roughly than hed intended that was twentyfive years ago and if im not over it now i never will be i dont think you can ever be over something like that like being mistreated lots of kids are like not being loved she whispered kids can bounce back from a bad timebut if they dont think theyre loved harryll be okay she hadnt been talking about harrybut now she turned to look down at the little boy following nicks gaze even though the kingsized bed had been split into two harrys share of the bed still seemed absurdly large for one so small i guess she smiled and turned back to nick if you stay on his side hey im committing myself to nothing here youve already committed she told him you know it its scaring you stupid but you can no sooner walk away from him now than you could fly i cant adopt him heck what was she saying i know that harry knows that her smile softened and suddenly her hands came out and took his but it doesnt stop either of us from knowing that youre committed to loving him right up to here she did her tiptoes thing againbut this time she reached up and kissed him on the forehead and we think youre just wonderful her voice was husky with emotion a votes been taken magistrate daniels the courts come to a verdict and the verdict is fantastic it was a gamble and she knew exactly what she was doing shanni stood absolutely still her hands still holding nicks and her heart seemed to stop beating the whole world seemed to hold its breath shed laid her heart on the line here she thought dazedly she could do no more than that nick might not want commitment but he had itright here in his hands and he stared down at her with his dark fathomless eyes and she knew that his heart was torn just as hers was but hers had come to a decision nick she whispered and her heart reached out for him nick love shanni it was too much she stood in his grasp in her absurd pyjamas with her heart on her sleeve and all the love and compassion and care in the world right there in her eyes a man would have to be inhuman to resist something so lovely so utterly wonderfully desirable this was not sensible but nothing tonight was sensible with a groan that felt almost like the breaking of chains nick took her into his arms and kissed her chapter nine shanni had been kissed before many times starting from when she was about twelve or maybe even before mary had been right when shed told nick the mcdonald girls were desirable and boys were interested from the time they could walk so she knew what to expect or she thought she did what she got wasdifferent it was nick shed felt this force fleetingly in the car the night theyd mockkissed outside the farmhouse but not like this this was like a zillion volts charging right through her starting somewhere about her toes coursing straight through from her lips into nicks body and back to her again this wasright this was how it should be she thought wonderingly it was as if their worlds had been heading along two different paths until this moment but now the paths had converged ended reached their destination and their destiny this was where she was meant to be shannis awareness of anything but this man had shut down entirely there was only nick and her whole body was lighting up as if it was on fire nothing like this had happened to her before she couldnt believe she felt like this and he felt it too he must somehowshe knew nicks hands were holding her body into his pulling her up to meet his kiss and she could feel the rough maleness of his chest beneath her breasts her hands felt the naked expanse of his back and she clungand clung and clung nick nick dear heaven she wanted him her thighs were on fire her whole body was on fire there was a whitehot melt starting somewhere in the region of her heart who knew where it had come from how it had started who knew maybe it had begun with attraction and compassion and the fact that nick was a man and shanni was a woman and he was funny and gorgeous and like no one shed ever met before but now it wasnt like that now it was as if they were cleaved together like magnet to metaltwo forces irresistibly linked with a force neither had recognised until this kiss nick but harry was in the bed behind them the little boy was fastasleep night terrors gone there was little chance he would wake nowbut he was there and he was in the only part of consciousness she was capable of raising nick was aware of him too almost as soon as the thought of responsibilities entered her mind the thought was with him as well he needed to say nothing she could feel it she knew this man and together they could not forget the little one never so he put her away from himjust fractionally but the force it took was unimaginable and the link remained unbroken one moment not here butshanni love wait he moved swiftly to the bedsidedrawer and she knew what he was fetchingknew it and gloried in it because this was right now now was right and then he was back sweeping her up to lie in his arms his eyes caressing her making love to her without a single sound then he turned to harrys bed for a moment they gazed down together at the sleeping child ensuring his sleep was as sound as they knew it must be their need for each other was urgent but not so urgent they could forget how much this little boy needed them but harry needed nothing his face was calmly peaceful almost smiling and shannis mouth curved into a smile to match it was the smile of one who knew what it was to be loved he wont wake she whispered and it was a proclamation of love all by itself and then silently they left the room nick carried her into the adjoining room where the big bed waited and he left the doors ajar so they could hear harry if he woke as shanni had known nick would she knew this man so well she was so close to him and she wanted to be closer my love hush nicks dark eyes gleamed down at her desire flaring it was too late to draw back now and both of them knew it it was too late for separation shannis bed was before them the covers thrown back from when shed left with such haste nick laid down his precious burden and then stood looking down at her in the dim light cast from the street lights outside and all the love and desire and the longing in the world were in that look shanni thought lovingly a man hungering for what hed thought he could never have she raised her hands pleading come to bed my love she whispered come to me but with a superhuman effort he held back and heaven knew how shanni somehow he made his voice work and again heaven only knew the effort it cost him are you sure was she sure how could he ask that question how could she not be sure this was her man nick was her love and nothing had ever felt so right in her life before i love you nick daniels she said and her eyes gently teased him i loved you even when you wore your horrid tie and i thought you were nothing but a city lawyer on the makeand thats saying something but now i can run my fingers through your hair and youre a country magistrate who belongs with me begorra she twinkled up at him but her smile was pleading and youre the most desirable man ive ever met in my life before if only youll come closer shanni get down here nick daniels she seized his hands and pulled him down to her and he was so stunned he almost fell fulllength he came to her his naked chest crushing her breasts under her crazy pyjamas and his body stiffening with desire as her fingers came up and raked through his unruly hair with such tenderness he thought hed melt with wanting her dear god he was on fire and so was she love me she whispered in the night nick love menow it wasnt nick doing the seduction she wanted him as badly as he wanted her and there was no possibility he could pull back the consequences of this night would just have to wait until tomorrow for tonight there was only shanni but no matter how long the nightor how wonderfulthere was always the morning the dawn saw nick wide awake staring up at the ceiling as if it had betrayed him by his side shanni slept on his arm was around her holding her close and her nakedness and her warmth were still arousing him as no woman had ever aroused him in his life he thought she was the most beautiful the most desirable the most wonderful being he had ever met but he feltwrong trapped she must have sensed it somehow her eyes flew open she smiled at him with that smile he knew and loved so much it hurt and her fingers came up to trace the furrow between his brows my love nick what is it the knowledge had been with him all nightnot mentioned until now but it was time to speak and it had to be said you didnt tell me it was your first time he said heavily and her eyes widened no she thought it over still sleepy with love and warmth and happiness i didnt does it matter yes she smiled again and shrugged this was nonsense i cant see why shanni youve been engaged i thought you thought what and i have not been engaged that woke her she pushed herself up on one elbow and glared down at him in mock indignation are you saying theres something wrong with me because i didnt sleep with john there was such revulsion in her voice that he almost grinned no but but what why me he said and she stared down at him her smile fading the echo of his trouble shadowed her face and what could she say there was only room for the truth what was between them was too wonderful for anything less i guessi guess i wanted it to be special the first time and and it was but her smile was now uncertain for you too of course but shanni i know its not your first time she smiled teasing him or i assumed unless youve been saving your condom just for me for all these years shanni im not fussed she turned within his hold and kissed him lightly on the mouthand his need for her rose so strongly within that it was almost overpowering whats past is past only it wasnt his past was always with him im not what you want he said heavily silence then what exactly is it that you think i want nick daniels her voice was lowhuskyand somehow there was a hint of anger in it apart from you making love to me i dont know his arm tightened around her shoulders involuntarily catching her to him again husband material maybe the anger was definitely there she hauled herself out of his arms sat up in bed and glared at him for all she was worth youre kidding you think ill be expecting to marry you nowjust because ive slept with you yeah maybe he did think that he blinked flummoxed but she was still on her soapbox just because i wanted it to be special doesnt mean i wanted it to be that special so you can take that look of a trapped dodo right out of your eyesthis minute and make love to me again i are you refusing no hell no but stop thinking my lovely nicholas she ordered men are always dangerous when they think i said i love you and i do but loving you doesnt mean im setting any trap im taking each moment as it comes and so should you so shut up lie back and think of england do anything but think only of course he did think he made love to her as if there was no tomorrow and at the back of his mind he knew just how desperately he was falling in love with this lady shed said she loved him and the words had exposed a hunger he hadnt known he was capable of butcould he return it could he forge a tomorrow for them he loved her sure but to be a part of a family they showeredtogetherand dressed and were waiting respectably when harry woke and still nick thought they took harry to the zooand decided meerkats were the most wonderful animals in the worldand they laughed at the seals and gawked at giraffes and ate popcorn and lay on the lawns and soaked up the sunand all the while nick thought could he take this further if so how far she was so wonderful this was so wonderful could he let himself fall he had his whole life mapped out and shanni wasnt in it but suddenly his life plans were looking pretty bleak shanni on the other hand was looking more desirable by the minute she lay on her back on the grass and ate her icecream cone upside downa feat ive been practising for a zillion years she saidand she chuckled with harry and told nick he was soooo boring for choosing vanilla and choosing to eat his icecream the right way up and she found a tshirt with a meerkat printed on the frontand promptly bought an extralarge one for nick and a very small one for harry and insisted harry and nick put them on immediately so nick was forced to buy her one tooof courseand they walked around the zoo in three matching ridiculous meerkat shirtsand then nick saw a sign asking for sponsors to adopt a meerkat and they promptly adopted one called tim because he had a sore foot and he was harrys favourite his birthdays next month the keeper told them youll come to celebrate we surely will shanni said eyes glowing and nick knew that expectations or not he was in so deep now he just might never get out and he didnt know if he wanted to get out and then they caught the last train home and life started again life as it was meant to be shanni im engaged shanni shanni shanni it was louise the next mcdonald sister down from shanni she was standing on the platform waiting for them and she was fairly bursting with excitement and news she hugged shanni she hugged harry and then for good measure she hugged nick as well i came to collect you myself because i wanted to tell you first and aunt adele hasnt been answering her phone all weekend where have you been no matter shanni alastair asked me to marry him on friday night just after you left of course i said yes weve been celebrating all weekend and theres a party happening at home right now so you need to come right on out shanni looked helplessly at nickthis was just what she didnt need but nick just shrugged and smiled hed been growing more and more quiet on the train journeyand now this go ahead he told her its been a great weekend my cars here ill take harry home it was a dismissalkindly meant but a dismissal for all thatand shannis heart sank hey you need to come too louise told him but nick shook his head no its a family party but let him be louise shanni said shortly fixing her sister with a look she couldnt ignore she sighed trying to take her mind off the expression on nicks facethe look that said he was back to formality by the way louisedid you know that aunt adele has never been better in her life that the story of her illness was a ruse to get me to melbourne oh louise had the grace to blush well sort of it was marys idea though why shanni was so aware of nicks expression blankly smiling it was as if he was restoring himself to someone she thought had disappeared but he hadnt he was now remembering who he was any minute now hed put his blasted tie back on but louise had regained her composure and was unabashed she gave shanni a cheeky grin mcdonald matchmaking of course she said blithely plus mary thought you needed to get away shanni and we thought you three might have fun did you yes but there you go then all was right in louises world and she had no intention of letting a guilty conscience get in the way of her joy she beamed at the three of them should alastair ask nick to be a groomsman to match you as my bridesmaid no shanni said revolted louise dont be stupid but louise was incorrigible am i being stupid nick she demanded and peeped a smile at him nick managed a smile back as he lifted harry into his arms and prepared to carry him out to the car park i dont think im groomsman material he said shortly how about groom itself louise butt out shanni was practically speechless with mortification her family was impossible i guess im not that either nick told her and he gave shanni a smile that was as impersonal as it was gorgeous it was a smile that said the world was to be greeted with friendliness but held at arms length goodbye shanni he said enjoy the party harry and i need to go well see you around well see you around the words echoed forlornly around the empty railway station and even louises smile faded shanni ill be at kindergarten tomorrow harry said urgently from his safe haven of nicks arms he was trying to keep his precious link with the two of them for as long as possible and dont forget tim meerkats birthday i wont forget shanni said and she gave harry a hugand nick was sort of included somewhere in the hug because after all he was holding harry tims a part of our family weve adopted himso how can we possibly forget but nick said nothing shanni gave him one long searching look as her heart sank still furtherand then she turned and followed her sister because nicks face told her she wasnt welcome to follow him he was nuts nick settled harry back with wendy promised him hed visit on tuesday night and again on thursday left him excitedly telling wendy all about his new friend tim meerkat and then tried to drive home he couldnt he physically couldnt turn the wheels of his car toward the courthouse shanni was with her family and there was a huge part of him that wanted to be right there part of the mcdonald clan part of a family but if he took this next step then he knew he couldnt walk away as he could no longer walk away from harry shanni the car slowed hed been automatically steering toward the farm but now he turned off onto the coast road neither way then not home and not to shanni this was tearing him in two he thought bitterlyto separate from shanni nowbut how could he take this next step it scared him stupid he couldnt just leave it there he knew her face at the railway station had been shocked into stillness shed taken it without flinching but he knew hed hurt her of course youve hurt her he told himself savagely you made love to her and nownow she needs commitment she deserves nothing less as she was committed shed let him take her to him he thoughtshed let him love her and all the love in the world had been written clearly in her eyes sure shed said she didnt intend him to take things further but nick was no fool and somehow he knew her as he knew himself or maybe more so maybe he couldnt know himself as he knew shanni and that was one of the reasons he loved her shanni had no ghosts in her past to rise and haunt him no shadows that screamed keep your distancecommitment was a thing to be feared at all costs so he steered his car onto the headland and sat for hours staring straight out to seaand staring right within himself searching deeper than hed ever looked before if he let himself take the love shanni had to offer hed be taking and taking and taking he told himself bitterly what could he offer a girl like this he had no family he had no deep well of love he had only his own insecurities and needs and one of those needscultivated from the time hed been able to recognise any world at allwas the need to hold himself apart if he drove out to the mcdonalds home now hed be welcomed with open arms he knew and he also knew hed feel so claustrophobic hed want to run because theyd expect things of him expect him to open his heart as shanni had opened hers no hed hurt her already he told himself hurt her maybe unforgivably but if he didnt intend to take this loving further then the time to move on was right now but dear heaven he had to tell her shanni the hubbub was fading her family were still in party mode but louise and mary were talking bridal plans the men were out on the verandah talking mens talkor getting away from talk of veils and guest listsand the younger mcdonalds were drifting reluctantly toward bed shanni was inclined to join them her mother had been eyeing her with concern for a good while now but shanni had deflected her nicely sort of she knew her mother couldnt be deflected for ever shanni it was fifteenyearold hatty calling from the hall its your gorgeous magistrate on the phone she yelled and the remaining hubbub died immediately all eyes flew to shanni her colour mounted drat her family drat them all nick must have heard that yellhe could have heard it in the next county at the level hatty yelled its your gorgeous magistrate on the phone there was nothing for it with the eyes of her entire family following her shanni went to talk to her gorgeous magistrate shanni and as soon as she heard his voice she knew what he intended saying shed known it from the railway station but until this minute shed hopedshed sort of hoped shed desperately hoped nick shanni im sorry she turned her back to the kitchen blocking her family out entirely nick can we talk privately it was an urgent plea but she knew already what hed say theres no point nick ive behaved like a rat he said heavily i should never have let you come near me to justtake you we both wanted it she said steadily i wanted it as much as you i cant take this any further he told her and shanni heard the pain in his voice and she wanted to slam the receiver down before the words were uttered she knew what he was going to say but she couldnt stop him and here it came youre a wonderful woman he said softly magic shanni you deserve better than me you dont think i could be the judge of that she was fighting with everything she had there was no room for pride here there was only her love shanni ive been alone for a long time now too long maybe butits what im accustomed to but not because its what you want youre afraid to be anything else yes he said honestly thats the truth shanni but thats who i am you wont walk away from harry her voice rose fear flooding through for the child and when he answered she sagged against the passage wall in some sort of relief no shanni i wont do that while harry needs me ill be there for him andif i need you she tried so hard to keep her voice strongbut there was raw pain coming through and nick must have heard it his breath was raw with jagged needa need he couldnt acknowledge even to himself ii dont think you can he said at last i thinkneeding me is really really stupid thing because theres nothing i can give and after that there was nothing more to do than to get on with their lives apart chapter ten nick spent the next four weeks throwing himself into work as hed never worked in his life before he rearranged the courthouse he set up a new filing system he put in a new computer and sat up until after midnight every night entering data as if it was vital the thing was up and running a week ago last friday he ignored the mayoral ball and suffered the consequencesespecially since at least twelve people told him that shanni had been there and had looked lovely and had danced all night his court cases became protracted he didnt miss a legal point and the local lawyers and police sighed and cut back their lunchbreaks and wondered how long this could last because you might want to drive yourself to an early grave but i dont see why you should take the rest of us with you mary said darkly just because youve messed up your love life i have not messed up my love life nick retorted throwing his gown aside after a torrid little traffic case that hed managed to stretch out to two hours of court time you know nothing of my personal life and thats the way i like it thats the way you like it ha you dont know hey im a sister to the other side of the equation she told him i can see both sides so i see you trying to fill every available minute with work and i see shanni going around with dark shadows under her eyes like she hasnt slept for a week ouch that hurt it couldnt matter shed just have to get over it nick told himself savagely and she seemed to be trying hard enough and it was better to hurt her now than later as he tried to mould himself into something he could never be a family man you love her you know mary said conversationally watching his face why not give in and admit it he had that was just the problem hed admitted that fact to himself and then some he did love her and if he didnt love her he wouldnt be so darned scared of hurting her and he wouldnt know how much she deserved someone better there was still harry harry was his saving gracehis time of peace with harry hed made his commitment he was forced to spend time with himforced to take every evening he could and head to wendys to read him a bedtime story or take him to the beach after work or walk along the cliff tops hand in hand a peaceful silence between them it was a weird relationship nick knew wendy was watching it with satisfaction and it perturbed himhe felt her expectations of him were unjustifiedbut harry took him at face value and asked nothing more than that hed be there for him he was content to give that much and the less harry asked of him the more he found he was prepared to give as the weeks wore on he found himself automatically walking down to the childrens home each eveningbecause harrys face would light up when he saw him if he didnt arrive there was no recrimination the next night but harrys pleasure was intensified and so was the pleasure for nick to his astonishment he found himself thinking about the little boy during the dayfiguring out what they could do that eveningwandering past the book store hesitating and then going in to choose a story different stuff not like nick daniels at all it helped fill the ache left by shanni the ache of knowing what he was missing but it didnt fill it completely nothing could fill that void but he was accepting that the darkness of his void was there for ever youve achieved a miracle it was four weeks after the melbourne trip four weeks after shanni nick had finished reading harry his bedtime story and had emerged to find wendy alone for once she wasnt surrounded by children she motioned to the coffee pot waited until he was settled and then repeated herself what youve done for harry nickwell it is like a miracle ive done nothing nonsense youve given him a friend hes been one to me it was true and it gave nick a shock to hear himself say it a friend he wasnt into friends ornot friends like harry not friends he loved then maybe harrys done as much for you as you have for him wendy said gently and watched his face i dont know what you mean i meanuntil now youve been as solitary as harry you dont need to be you know its simply a matter of letting go releasing a part of you and trusting it to someone you love and suddenly they werent talking about harry or maybe they were the feelings she was talking of it was crazy entrusting part of him to harry hed never do that but as he sat there with wendys calm eyes resting on him making him think he knew suddenly that he was wrong to believe he could never do it becausesomehow hed done it already hed given a part of himself to a child the thought was like a lightning bolt until now he hadnt been involved at all not one whit hed so carefully cut himself free of all ties but now with harry he was involved whether he liked it or not and with shanni it was fear he thought suddenly that was what was driving him up until now hed figured it was consideration for shanni that was hauling him backworry that hed hurt her more than he had already maybe it waspartlybut it was more than that if he took the next step to loving and something happened he wasnt ready he was scared hey nick wendys hand came over his warm and reassuring theres no need to have angst over this take this one step at a time youve given harry so much dont push yourself shanni i guess shanni knows you need space she said gently and maybe shes prepared to wait he shook his head thats stupid im not not ready to talk about it thats fine by me she lifted his empty mug from his hands and moved across to the sink and then her shoulders stiffened as if she was bracing herself for something unpleasant but we do need to talk about harry harry he stared why we think hes ready for fostering fostering he cant stay here longterm wendy told him turning back to face him trouble in her eyes this is a temporary refuge for troubled and orphaned kids its not a stable home and thats what harry desperately needs hes been here too long already she sat again facing him with eyes that were suddenly sad it was as if she knew that nicks need was almost as great as harrys but the little boy must come first we have a couple who are willing to take harry on as a longterm fosterchild she told him gently maybe theyll even adopt him if it turns out okay normally if a child is available for adoption we like to do it straight away but in harrys case weve hesitated as you know we didnt consider him ready but now yes why was his world suddenly bleak were still not sure if hell handle adoption we suspect he wont straight off he distrusts the world and he needs space but he trusts you now he trusts you totally and if you were to keep the link how do you mean i mean if we move him to local fosterparents and you keep visitingthen slowly back off not so much as hell notice straight away but just gradually cut backso that in two years when you return to the city hes not bereft hell have parents by then and hopefully theyll have taken your place and more it sounds good to me nick said trying to keep his voice light trying really hard because it didnt sound good at all his void was becoming a sickening chasm of emptiness a few weeks ago id practically given up on this happening wendy told him i cant believe the change youve wrought but now hes content and hes socialising and harrys social worker believes we need to move fast before he becomes too established too fond of me and of me nicks eyes met hers steady and questioning and wendy nodded yes andis it supposed to hurt he closed his eyes he couldnt believe the pain does it hurt you thats what my job is she said striving for lightness im accustomed to this take them in love them to bits while theyre here but then launch them out to their own families she smiled im accustomed now almost and i have the rest of the kids to worry about for you though i dont need anyone else no she smiled and cocked an eyebrow and he knew she didnt believe him change the subject it was the only thing he could do when will this happen as soon as possible she said heavily maybe monday tomorrows sunday ill talk him through it and if he objects hes three years old wendy told him we dont give him a choice i know at the moment harry wants to stay in this placewith you and with mebut were not his longterm parents nick so we need to stand aside now and let those who can love do their best it was the right thingthe sensible decisiona path that would give harry a chance at this lottery called life justwhy did it feel so darned bleak and going out nick met shanni coming in she stopped dead at the gate as he walked out through the door her smile slipped and then was carefully repinned nick she said smiling again and there might well have been nothing between them at all if he hadnt seen that tiny slip youve been visiting harry yes of course i promised great it was almost sarcastic and the pain in her voice made him flinch she stood aside so he could pass and he should have kept right on going instead he paused he couldnt help himself harrys asleep he said and he sounded inane even to himself im not here to see harry she told him wendys my friend and its wendy ive come to see shes upset upset he frowned he hadnt seen it why youre not stupid nick because of losing harry of course his frown deepened i dont understand shes told you about the arrangements for fostering yes but i thought shes happy with the arrangements its the right thing you dont think shell miss harry after almost a year of trying to get through to him i thought that shes tough dont you believe it she bleeds just like the rest of us this is her job shanni yes shanni nodded her eyes bleak it is but theres not many who could do it wendy gives and gives some more she takes in children battered and bruised and from all sorts of backgrounds she loves them she fights to get through to them and then when she sees theyre on their way to healingwhen theyre just at the point where they can love hershe sends them off to longterm carers she sends them away he thought this one through and saw it saw wendys need for the first time instead of just his own i guess it must hurt at that sowhy does she do it he asked slowly open herself to hurt like that she has courage shannis voice tried to be light but it didnt quite come off she knows shes the only chance these kids have of finding love by hurting herself she gives them that hope i hadnt seen no she said bleakly and for the first time she allowed her own hurt to show you dont see do you nick you dont see there are others in the world who are just as fearful as youbut who have the courage to open themselves to love i goodnight nick leave others to care you just look after yourself and how could he sleep after that nick spent the night staring at the ceiling and thinking of every option under the sun and as dawn came he knew what he must do he wasnt one of these people who could love and risk losing all he had no place here shanni had been right when shed implied he had no courage he didnt he was a coward and he knew it sothere was nothing for it but to stop hurting people and get back to the city where he belonged forget the ambition it wasnt so important any more maybe facelessness and solitude were more important than a position as highcourt judge but harry still needed him so hed come at the weekends to visit harry while he was needed he told himself that was all on monday hed hand in his resignation hed give a months notice and he was out of here for good his intention stayed with him for all of the next morning he stayed inside and tried to focus on legal journals but the pages danced before his eyes meaningless and empty wendy would be telling harry about his new family he thought maybe his new mum and dad would be visiting how would he be taking it who could know what the little boy would make of it wendy thoughwendy would be hurting and somewhere shanni would be aching for all of them enfolding them all in her huge heart and taking their pain into her the three of them whirled through his thoughts and gave him no peace harry wendy shanni he was going nuts he was leaving that afternoon he walked for miles but it didnt help one bit when he got back the answering machine told him he had messages waiting and the phone rang again as he walked in the door for some reason as he lifted the receiver he had a sudden lurch of dread nick shanni he didnt need more than one syllable to know she was in trouble something was dreadfully wrong so much for not caring ha his heart twisted in fear shanni what is it harrys not with you no why should he be dear god nick hes run away wendy told him about the fosterparents and he took it on the chinyou know like he doesnot saying anything but just looking straight ahead but looking like hes blind she said that helen and doug his new prospective parents were coming to see him this afternoon that was all then one of the other children grazed her knee wendy took her into the bathroom to clean her up and when she finished he wasnt there then where thats just it we dont know shanni said raggedly nick weve all looked everyones looking weve been trying to contact you for hours but i knew you wouldnt have him without telling wendy the police are here nowrobeveryone oh nick her breathing was way too fast as if shed been running nick does harry know where you live have you ever taken him to your place above the courthouse we thought that was where hed try to go no nick frowned trying to make his fearful mind focus thered never been a need to bring him here have you told him where you live i dont think so his brow creased in concentration thinking it through no weve looked everywhere silenceand then he heard her breath draw in from shock as if shed just had a dreadful thought no what you remember that day in the kindergarten after the hostage thing you told him where you lived i didnt you told him you lived on borrowah mountain she said raggedly nick harry can see borrowah from his bedroom window weve searched every street in townevery inch of the beach but if hes headed for the mountain its not so far to the start of the national park nick he could be in thick bush by now dear god chapter eleven they searched for the rest of that day and then for one of the longest nights nick had ever known every ablebodied person in town and for miles around the district turned out to scour the mountainside and nick searched with them shanni was asked to stay at base camp in case he returned as wendy couldnt leave her other charges but the look on her face told nick it was one of the hardest things she had ever done in her life to stay still and wait at least he could search and nick searched like a man possessed but it was like looking for a needle in a haystack one tiny crippled boy in rugged national park bushland some of it so thickly forested that it took machetes and raw strength to hack a mans way through why had he ever said it nick demanded of himself over and over again as he bashed through the bush why had he ever told harry he lived in such a dreadful place shanni must hate him but she couldnt hate him for it as much as he hated himself he thought bleakly he was hating himself enough for the both of them all through that long night as he joined the line of searchers bashing their way in lines through the forest nick was calling himself every type of fool he could think of why had he told the child he lived in one of the most inaccessible places in the state because hed wanted to be inaccessible he acknowledged and that need for solitude was now exacting such a cost he couldnt bear it andfor what a solitude he no longer craved he was no longer independent he acknowledged his very self now depended on the welfare of one small boy and one woman when hed turned up at search headquartersa mobile police caravan set up in a clearing at the base of the mountainhed looked at shannis face and hed seen a terror matching his own reflected in her eyes for some reason harry had spun his little self around her heart becoming as much a part of her as he was part of him if they couldnt find him please please the same pain in shannis eyes was reflected in others the policemen organising search teams team members all shannis family the older children from the childrens homes associated with bay beach orphanage shopkeepers mill workers teachers boy scouts even the womens lawn bowls association for heavens sake the lady bowlers were making cups of tea as if their lives depended on it and the fitter ladies were donning protective clothing instead of bowling whites and bashing through the bush with the best of them every last person in the district was desperate to help and nicks distress was reflected in their faces one little boys pain taken on by so many any mans death diminishes me these people knew what it was to care but that care came at a cost a cost nick was prepared to pay and more hed pay anything it took harry but in the enforced breaks the search coordinators forced him to take it was shannis face he kept coming back to there was raw agony in her eyes and he felt such a twisting knot of helplessness and rage and fear that he didnt know how to hold it in how could he face her after such stupidity dear god how could he bear it he had to have someone to holdand he was alone because that was the way he wanted it no at two in the morning his group was called in after the moon went behind clouds and he felt so sick he wanted to retch he lifted his hand and smashed it down on a tree stump and then gazed helplessly at the graze hed made on his skin these peoplethey knew how to care and he didnt hed told a baby that he lived on borrowah mountain he closed his eyes in despairand then opened them at the feel of someone touching him gently on his injured hand shanni nick it was a tentative whisper and the look he gave her was bleaker than death what could he say to her hed caused this hurt you dont need to speak to me he told her thats nonsense we need each other shanni how could i have done it he demanded his voice raw with despair how could i have done something so criminally stupid i must have been mad you werent to know it could ever come to this she said softly and then before he could say anything more she wrapped her arms around him and held him and held him and held him as if her life depended on it and for one long moment he kept himself ramrodstiff it needed only this he didnt deserve comfort that she should try and comfort him when he was so dreadfully at fault well find him she said softly i know we will nick hes here somewhere youre not to blame yourself youre here now for him and togetherwell find him please and she held him close kissing him softly on the hair holding him like a child and pouring her love into him she was willing into him a strength that alone he could never have and when they moved awayinches but enoughthere was a new steely determination between them that was an affirmation that the whole was far greater than the parts together they could face this feeding each other strength we can find him shanni said we must together we must he wont come out heaven knew what made him see it but suddenly he knew this thing that he feltthat shanni had given him trust love completeness it gave him knowledge harry was his child as surely now as shanni was his woman and harry trusted nick things were suddenly blindingly clear there was no chance of these searchers finding harrynot if one small boy didnt want to be foundbecause harry was heading for nick with the same singleminded purpose that nick would feel if shanni or harry was in danger he was heading for the one person in the world he trusted and he loved wendy had told him new people were coming to see himpeople he didnt know but who wanted to be his parents so harry had run and hed keep running he wouldnt want to be found by anyone but nick all night harry must have been trying to find nick but if hed come to this point where the road ended and the wilderness of mountain started he would have gone nowhere but up his leg was so weakso damaged he couldnt climb strongly in the dark he must have stumbled and fallen over and over hed be terrified but if he heard people searchingcalling as each group had beenwould he answer no nick thought seeing things with a clarity that he hadnt seen before harry was terrified of more than the dark people hadnt treated him with love they were things to be feared but not nick whether he deserved it or not harry loved nick the thought made nicks heart wrench so hard it must surely break lets try this another way he said strongly turning to the men who were coordinating the search parties when the moon had gone behind clouds theyd called in all but the most experienced searchers until dawn now nick looked again at shanni seeking confirmation in her eyes but he knew he was right at dawnlet me go up with shanni no one else youd be lost in minutes up there sir a coordinator told him shaking his head the head of the emergency services was hard and efficient and the last thing he wanted was an extended search if the towns magistrate got himself lost nick thought this through of course they were right he was city born and bred and no matter how much he wanted it otherwise he didnt know the bush then stay with us but behind nick said stay silent and let me call without anyone else making a noise its my guess hell be hiding i should have thought this through before but if hell come for anyone hell come for me the search coordinator looked at shanni he knew her she was a local one of them is that right maam and shanni was looking at nick with eyes that were clear and steady the terror had receded her mind was back in gear as nick had thoughtthe parts were stronger than the whole shed gained strength with their love if harry wants to be found by anyone he wants to be found by nick she said her own thoughts crystallising i thinki think nicks right hes harrys only chance and because nick doesnt know the bush hell also be able to see the path harry might takenot looking at the overall picture like you and me but at the logical way for a threeyearold and please god he just might do it so at dawn the mass of searchers were held backwell give you til noon sirand one small group of experienced bushwalkers were equipped to the hilt to accompany them but they let nick decide the course im going straight up nick told them bear with me im a dope in the climbing department but then sos harry so every time theres a decision im going to ask myself what harry would have done and im going to yell myself hoarse he took shannis hand in his hand and held it hard ready my love the endearment slipped out unnoticed but it was between them anyway acknowledged for ever whatever this day held they were no longer two they were a man and a woman made one in need and in love im ready she said she gripped him as if she couldnt bear to let go and then she turned back to the searchers who had to stay behind but who were breaking their hearts to help well bring him back please nick will do it she looked at him her eyes calm and clear and determined i know it he loves harry and three hours and twenty minutes later hoarse from calling and over five hundred yards as the crow flies straight up the mountain nick called for the thousandth time and thought he heard a faint response he stopped dead the tension in shannis hand was tangibledear god please the group behind them also stopped theyd heard it then it wasnt just him harry nicks voice echoed out around the mountainside and he and shanni moved in the direction he thought the sound had come from the rest of the group surged behind them two of the searchers cutting a path but dropping back as soon as it was clear harry its nick harry he didnt let shanni gonot for a moment harry im here harry and thirty seconds later they rounded an outcrop and stopped harry was crouched motionless in the midst of a massive prickly grevillea that was three times as big as he was the bush had been in the way of up hed tried to crawl over it the thorns had stuck from all sides and hed slipped through and was wedged fast harry with a great shout of joy nick released shannis hand and clambered up ignoring thorns ignoring pain reaching the tiny battered and scratched little boy and gathering him to his heart as if hed never let him go again as he never would and somehow shanni reached them too and they were sitting in the middle of the dreadful thorns and clinging togetherthree and yet oneand shanni was weeping and so was nick but they were together and nick knew this was how it was going to be for ever i thought you lived here the team had got them down from their mound of thorns but were standing back in joyous silence savouring success and letting them be harry was so exhausted he was limp in nicks hold but his arms still somehow clung his eyes devoured him i thought you lived up here all by yourself so i came i dont live here harry nicks voice was a hoarse whisperhe could still hardly believe he had the child in his arms not any more no nick had his face in harrys hair but his eyes over harrys head were watching shanni watching the love on her face the tears the joy the destiny then where do you live it was an exhausted whisper but he was still desperate to know and nick knew why he was desperate it was because harry didnt believe in happy endings he needed to know in case he was torn away again and had to find his nick so this time nick knew what the answer had to be the only answer i live with you he said strongly hugging him close from today harry from today i live with you and with shanni if shell have me shanni harry twisted his face around to see and she was right there all the love in the world shining from her eyes wendy told you you needed a mummy and a daddyright nick asked and he looked at shanni again and saw her watching harrywith such a lookand his heart twisted with such love that he didnt think he could bear it mmm how would you feel if that was shanni and me if we were your mummy and daddy harry stiffened in nicks hold he pushed his head back and gazed into nicks face searching this little one had been told lies before youd be my daddy heck all he wanted was to burst into tears instead he made his voice gruff and deep and magistratelike definite if you want me thats what i want more than anything in the world why there it was the simple questionwith the simple answer because i love you nick said strongly and his spare arm came out and held shanni to him as well she hugged him backhugged both of themher eyes glistening with tears and all the love she possessed shining in her face because i love you and i love shanni he said i love you both with all my heart and i figureif im to come down from my mountain what better reason could a man have than thatto come down for love it was midafternoon harry had been checked over medically had been pronounced one very lucky young man his scratches and bruises had been anointed hed been fed cuddled put to bed and cuddled some more until hed fallen fast asleep from sheer exhaustion it was his last sleep in this bed nick had told him when he woke theyd move his belongings to where he belonged with nick and now wendy was watching over him one last time her joy tinged with sadness im getting too old for this she said as she watched nick and shanni cluck over their little one its time i moved on maybe took a chance at permanent fostering loving and letting go isnt something you can do for ever shanni said softly watching her friends face and nick could only agree loving and letting go no hed only just learned to love and he intended to hold somehow he forced himself to focus on wendy can you do that move to permanent fostering he asked and wendy nodded soon she smiled as one of her charges peeped in holding up a scratched finger for inspection and sympathy she beckoned her in lifted the little girl and hugged her hard then turned back to gaze down at harry some children have the capacity to break you up but now and then theres a happy ending that makes it fine like you and shanni and harry go on you two go and sort out your future while i watch over your baby and she stayed with harry and watched as nick led shanni outside they didnt speak as if of one accord they made their way to nicks car and nick drove the short way to the beach he stopped the motor and for a long moment sat looking out to sea shanni sat silent she knew exactly what was happening nick was saying goodbye to something hed never wanted in the past but hed learned to guard as if it was the most important thing in the world and nowhe was saying farewell to solitude for ever and then he turned to shanni his love his face was tense she thought unsure of what was to come shanni when i said back thereto harrythat we he faltered her heart lurched no maybe she was wrong maybe even now he wanted to back away i know nick she said heavily you didnt mean it or if you did she fingered her hands being harrys parentsnick im not staying with you just for harry i wouldnt ask you to do that she turned to him then tilting her chin a trace of the redoubtable shanni returning what would you be asking then nick daniels and the answer was there already written clear as day only hed been too blind to see it until this day im asking you to marry me because i love you more than life itself he said youve given yourself to me with all the love in your heart and i was too blind too stupid and too cowardly to return it but i need it shanni i need your love like ive never needed anything so much in my life youre part of me you and harry meand harry could you bear to be a part of a family he said simply my family you and me and harry there was a glimmer of laughter in her lovely eyes and she held out her hands and took his between them oh nicknick thats all i want in the whole wide world you and me and harry oh my love and then as he took her into his arms and kissed her and the afternoon sunshine exploded in a mist of joy and love and desire nick thought that life could hold no more than it possibly did at this very moment he was loved and he loved in return hed reached the pinnacle but his love was pulling out of his arms and the laughter was still there me and you and harry mmm its not enough what was she talking about love i think we should get this straight she said trying for sternness but her voice was husky with love before we commit arent we committed i want this legal as legal as you want ill sign anything he paused his legal training screaming all sorts of warnings drat his legal training for this moment he was a lovernot a magistrate what do you want me to sign she chuckled a lovely carefree sound that echoed around them as an affirmation of their love of their passing from dark to light i want two dogs and a horse written into the contract two dogs and a horse and four more children at least four and wendy and her fosterkids must be welcome whenever they want to stay with us is this a marriage were arrangingor a menagerie both she laughed into his eyes he smiled back and she knew she needed no legal agreement she knew she had him in the palm of her hand okay your worship that about sums it up she said sweetly do you still want to be a high court judge by the way i cant see two dogs one horse five kids plus assorted hangerson in my city apartment how long did you say your last judge stayed in this town thirty years she said serenely thirty years he took her into his arms and they might well have been married right at that moment no vows could ever be more permanent than this thirty years eh it seems to me what does it seem my lovely nicholas it seems to me like thirty years is not nearly long enough marion lennox
