ian slater asian front chapter one khabarovsk siberia rock and roll david brentwood yelled and everything opened up from the rip of the ps mm bursts to the steady bomp bomp bomp of grenade launchers joined by the long guttural roar of ms pouring out a deadly stream of two hundred rpm mm fire the acrid stench of cordite was all about the british and american commandoes the thumps and rattle of mm rounds hitting their targets lost beneath the crash of supporting heavy mm mortar fire next to brentwood aussie lewis glancing at his ps plastic mag could see that he had about ten rounds left for the belgianmade machine gun the empties casings spewing down beneath the gun catching a beam of sunlight that was penetrating the siberian pines it was only for a second but a member of the red team saw it fired and aussie lewis heard the two tones of a near miss he rolled quickly but not fast enough to escape the high monotone or smoke alarm as they called the noise from the miles the multiple integrated laser engagement system shit aussie said as he took out the key from his rifle transmitter disengaging the weapon then put the key in his helmet and chest control unit ending the tone he saw the grader scratch him from the sheet it meant that for aussie a veteran of general freemans second armys crack britishamerican special air servicesdelta commando team or sasd as it was known by its elite members was out of the war game and had lost a bet with his fellow commandoes choir williams who hailed from wales and his two american buddies captain david brentwood and private first class salvini aussie had bet these other three members of brentwoods sasd troop that hed be the last to be taken out and to rub it in brentwood choir williams and salvini were already demanding their money bloody scavengers aussie retorted thats what you are suppose if we get in a real punchup again and i got hit you bastardsd probably take my friggin watch lets see you smile boyo choir williams instructed what cant you smile aussie flashed a quick grin as if he was at the dentists satisfied ah williams said feigning disappointment to brentwood and salvini just as i figured e hasnt got any gold fillings lads his watchll have to do what a fucking trio aussie said you blokes oughta shut up lewis the grader ordered you want to get the rest of your squad taken out no sir aussie answered muttering under his breath what the hell would he know about it that bloke hasnt seen a shot fired in anger lets hope it stays that way boyo choir williams said it has to lewis said hows that salvini put in because im just getting to know olga aussie replied you know the one with the big yes said david brentwood who although married was always shocked by aussies vivid descriptions of female anatomy we know shes a member of the khabarovsk polar bear club swims in the nude yeah salvini added well you can have her buddy any piece that swims naked in freezing water isnt playin with a full deck well i dont intend playing fucking cards with her sal okay you four the grader decreed youre all out thats all right aussie lewis said this rackets frazzled my nerves anyway after firing all these blanks i need a drink normally the grader would have had more to say and normally the britishamerican sasd team wouldnt have acted so cavalierly but as members of the usled un forces under general douglas freeman they were veterans of the daring raid on pyongyang in korea fierce fighting on and around ratmanov island in the bering strait and lake baikal in siberia and had earned a certain cachet even the most gentlemanly among them the twentyfiveyearold medal of honor winner david brentwood was known as one of the toughest of the tough sasdelta training broke anyone else besides everyone including the graders was in a fairly good mood these days spring had sprung aussie lewis had found olga an accommodating if large blond siberian bird as he called her and pretty soon it seemed that david brentwood salvini and choir williams would be on home leave david back to his wife georgina in the states choir williams to his beloved wales and salvini to his haunts in brooklyn this time everyone was saying the ceasefire between siberia china and the un force would hold that is everyone except general douglas freeman chapter two further west of khabarovsk along the amur river hump in the town of poyarkovo on the siberian side of the dmz an american soldier was meeting a chinese goodtime girl who caught on the americanpatrolled north bank of the amur when the dmz went into effect was making the best of it neither she nor the american spoke the others language but they understood each other perfectly he was handing over dollars and she was about to give him sex with an almondeyed smile she smelled of lavender and was dressed in a thighsplit qi pao of radiant ming blue silk embroidered with tiny golden birds only a tantalizing glimpse of firm tan thigh visible she disappeared behind the fine bamboo screen the soldier heard the soft purr of a zipper then saw the qi pao being draped carefully over the bamboo divider the gi closed his eyes and swallowed hard oh man hed been too long in the uspatrolled un demilitarized zone between china and the breakaway united siberian republic both of which the us had had to fight as part of the uns wish to stabilize the area he was bored with the routine of patrolling the trace the dmz to see whether there had been violations by either siberian or chinese troops as a prelude to possible land grabs along the longdisputed chinesesiberian border marked by fertile valleys the stillfrozen amur or black dragon as it was called by the chinese wound itself through mountain gorges and an endless taiga of pine beech and fir separating manchuria from the old soviet empire patrolling the border was a dangerous as well as a dreary duty because before the present ceasefire had come into effect china and the new siberian republic had already made an alliance of convenience albeit a shaky one against the americans it was a cold and lonely duty too despite the advent of spring along the amur no matter how beautiful the taiga or how busty the siberian women in any case the soldier preferred the chinese girls if some of those siberian women sat on your face youd be pulp but on a soldiers pay he would never have been able to afford spring flower as she called herself the soldier like many others had been given the money personally by general freeman even though it was known he abhorred whores as being little better than politicians freeman often referred to as george for his striking resemblance to the actor george c scott was a legend in his own time the greatest american general since patton and schwarzkopf and he was walking down the line doling out money his own to his soldiers telling them to go to the chinese brothels along the dmz and not to worry about bringing back change you fellas have a good time now the general said and remember boys safe sex so draw your rubbers from the quartermaster as churchill had believed that the armistice following die war with germany was nothing more than a temporary ceasefire that germany sooner or later would start another war freeman had no faith in the present ceasefire between china and siberia on one side and the united states on the other and this brothel subsidy as he called it was his latest effective if eccentric tactic a preemptive strike as he explained to his aide colonel dick norton washingtons not going to like it general washington isnt going to know about it dick dick norton shook his head worriedly sir its only a matter of time before the press gets onto it they love stuff like this thered be hell to pay and as for the womens lobby norton rolled his eyes heavenward paying dogfaces to get laid dick you worry too much i know thats your job but ive told you before by the time i get this business about being recalled for consultation in washington over with we could be at war again with these jokers chinese siberians or both i dont trust novosibirsk any more than i do beijing this is the second ceasefire weve had and i tell you its no better than any of the seventyfive the yugoslavs had goddamn it youd think washington could see that we were sent over here to keep this upstart united siberian republic from annexing more territory and what happened the chinese made a land grab into siberia first and we ended up with a war on two fronts and now just when we turn the tide on the bastards and look like were kicking their ass across the black dragon river back into china where they belong and the siberians back beyond lake baikal where they belong beijing and novosibirsk ask for a ceasefire and of course those fairies in washington give it to them the public doesnt want the war to go on general dick the general began exasperatedly like the man in the transmission commercial used to say pay me now or pay me later we should have kicked ass all the way to beijing teach em a lesson like we taught that siberian yesov son of a bitch he messed with second army and got a bloody nose we got one too general before we stopped them norton reminded him the almost complete destruction of the american iii corps its blood and equipment streaked across the frozen twentymile escape route across lake baikal was evidence of that yes because the goddamned chinks attacked us when we were preoccupied with the siberians so we ended up with a twofront war general you shouldnt use that wordchinks youre being recalled now because of what washington calls your intemperate remarks about those two spets norton was referring to two spetsnaz siberian special operations in this case women commandos whod tried to assassinate freeman at his khabarovsk hq intemperate remarks freeman thundered bitches tried to kill me in my own quarters goddamn it i know general but after you shot them and said it was a case of equal opportunity employment well the feminists said in the heat of the moment dick i know that general but the feminists back home went absolutely ape freeman cut in gleefully listen norton those crazies from the femisphere are free to go ape and im free to say what i think because a lot of good men died for freedom all the way from normandy to here thats a fact and im not about to be cowed by a bunch of skirts i know general but its a new world yes freeman sighed and by god i dont like it more dangerous now than the cold war not much we can do about it sir ill tell you what you can do about it while im back in washington getting my ass reamed out for offending the femisphere you can help keep second army razor sharp so that if any more chinks cross the amur into siberia we can push em back yes sir well try i know have every confidence in my staff the general reached for his coat his tone dropped you make that appointment for me with that taiwanese admiral kuang yes sir hell see you in tokyo strictly unofficial civilian dress you order the meal i wanted no damned sushi american beef yes sir norton assured him prime rib range fed just like you said none of that steroidfed crap no sir i promise norton paused you think hell go for the dessert youve got in mind the dessert the general had told norton would be china if beijing ever moved across the amur again their public announcements aside freeman was convinced that the top leadership of the old kmt kuomintang party in taiwan once commanded by chiang kaishek or as harry truman called him cash my check had never wavered in its determination to go back home taiwan had infinite patience and with one of the most powerful armies and navies in asia fully intended to return to china and oust the leadership in beijing if the opportunity ever presented itself an opportunity their agents had constantly been working for along the coast of the east china sea since freeman was also aware of something else something he didnt believe the fairies back in washington understood that in china there were many chinas that one of the great illusions of the twentieth century was seeing china as a cohesive whole a monolithic structure too big to topple since tiananmen square especially internal dissent had grown not vanished it had merely gone underground it had been part of that underground that had enabled the americans to gain information with which they had been able to blow up the nanking bridge across the yangtze and so sever the long logistical supply line from southern to northern china even so for the moment beijing still ruled with an iron fist and the hundreds of individual chinas had not yet been galvanized into a decisive bloc but freeman was convinced they were there waiting general i hate to sound like a harpy but thats something else youre going to have to watch i mean if the press ever discovers youre talking to the taiwanese every tabloid in the countryll bury you alive in particular the general knew his aide meant the la roche tabloid chain owned by the multibilliondollar newspaperindustrial magnate now arrested under the us emergency powers act to combat internal sabotage during the war for having traded with the enemy specifically la roche and his front asian companies from singapore to hong kong had been providing communist china with the weapons and ammunition used against fellow americans in the slaughter of the american iii corps on lake baikal to hell with la roche that weaselll be behind bars after a grand jury gets through with him even so general he still runs the newspapers and hell use his editors to whip up opinion any way he wants youll have to watch what you say when youre back home i say whats on my mind dick i wont waffle dick norton didnt believe him freeman was a toyourface man all right but he could be as selective or as evasive as the next commander in what he said if he wanted to be witness his mysteriously terse order for wolf dung and only wolf dung to be collected and frozen at headquarters not even norton knew what the hell it was about the only thing the general would say was that he wanted it on standby just throw it outside on the permafrost thatll keep it frozenand that if there was a war with china it could save thousands of american lives well have a good trip sir hope to see you back soon dont worry dick freeman said slapping his aide on the back ill straighten everything out sides its spring now in washington puts the pentagon fairies in a good mood fairies were anyone who disagreed with him the fairies were in a good mood but as aussie lewis would have said there was a plot on one supported by the unwitting consensus of editorial writers throughout the country to strip freeman of his command and keep him home this time for good it was widely acknowledged that he was a marvelous war general but a loose cannon in the peace better to send him back to fort ord in california let him retire at his desk where he wouldnt talk about chinks and equal opportunity when he killed spets at least hed be out of the public eye how washington had got wind of his intended meeting with admiral kuang freeman didnt know but upon landing at narita airport in tokyo freeman was met by us embassy officials who were to accompany him to the meeting with kuang it was all very polite but freemans meeting with the taiwanese admiral was effectively sabotaged little more than pleasantries being exchanged freeman was furious knowing he could do nothing but sip tea and drink to taiwaneseus friendship before taking his flight out to san francisco via hawaii when spring flower emerged from behind the screen her nakedness had taken the gis breath away her breasts far more prominent than die tight dress had allowed after being without a woman for months in the cold siberian winter it was almost too much and he told himself if he didnt calm down hed just be wasting the fifty bucks to concentrate to divert himself from her beauty for a moment he rather ponderously counted out the fifty dollars converting them to yuan in his head thinking god shes beautiful you must take it off she told him in slow and deliberate english what he looked up at her you must take it off she repeated pointing to the strapped in its canvas holster and the clip ammo in the canvas pockets about the belt oh he said yeah sure i thought you meant he pointed to what he meant and hand before her mouth her eyes averted shyly she gave the most delightful giggle and obviously thought it not at all surprising that a private would be carrying a sidearm come she said extending her hand not too quickly i hope he said sorry i do not under its okay i have surprise for you she said softly her tongue wetting her dark cherryred lips as she extended her hand demurely and led him into the next room which was redolent with sandalwood incense and illuminated by a pale golden flickering lantern seated in the nest of silklacebordered pillows was another girl her legs drawn coquettishly her nakedness partially hidden by the pillows the soldiers mouth went dry and in a cracked voice he said i cant pay another fifty for no bother spring blossom said she wishes to learn do you mind he could barely speak oh man no i dont mind chapter three monterey california damn it hes done it again freeman said his generals stars catching the light as he pointed the tvs remote control and zapped cbn done what again douglas marjorie duchene his sisterinlaw asked from the kitchen that cbn clown calling apcs tanks whats an apc marjorie asked please dont bait me dory marjorie hed used his deceased wifes name for though hed loved her shed had the same habit of teasing him im not baiting you douglas dear ive no idea what an apc is some truck or other i suppose armored personnel carrier freeman grumped goddamn education in this countrys going to hell in a handbasket please dont swear douglas i know its rough and ready in the army but now youre home you mean put out to pasture those congressional sons of those gentlemen in washington recalled me from siberia for consultation havent called me in for a week but i know when i go there theyre going to give me a special assignment what they mean is they dont want me in command of second army well the war is over douglas wars never over marjorie just interrupted now and then by peace good god in over five thousand years of history we havent had three hundred years of peace you realize that you should go for a walk marjorie said the tides out rock poolsll be beautiful you know what happens in rock pools freeman said invoking an image that had never ceased to arrest him one creatures fighting the other for food and space to the death oh douglas thats a forlorn way of looking at the world it can be a forlorn world marjorie freeman responded second army lost the best part of four thousand men to yesovs hordes on lake baikal and thats not counting the casualties inflicted by the chinese when they attacked us from the south so what happens when i counterattack make up some lost territory and start taking prisoners beijing and novosibirsk sing in unison for a ceasefire and those those fairies back in washington gave it to them we want peace douglas marjorie said hell we all want peace problem is how to secure it you dont think those comrades in beijing would roll up their blankets do you this is a breathing space for them time to build up their forces again for another northward push and what if they attack again weve got a supply line stretched over four thousand miles of ocean between here and siberia manchurias their backyard theyre going to want to grab as much territory along the amur river valleys as they can siberians and chinese have been fighting over it for more than a hundred years only reason they formed an alliance against us was to try and push our allied force into the sea then without any un overwatch they could carve one another up then why didnt we just let them do it marjorie said ingenuously because if we let them at it once theyd exhausted their conventional forces wed be in an icbm war and pretty soon everyone else around them from kazakhstan to southeast asia would have to choose sides wed have a world war that you couldnt put out marjorie hell thats why the un sent us over there to keep the peace but im telling you this ceasefire isnt keeping the peace its just time out for cheng and yesov to rearm resupply meanwhile their diplomats are yakking away with our diplomats well you know what will rogers said about diplomacy no i dont marjorie said diplomacys saying nice doggie till you can find a rock thats what theyre doing marjorie getting the rocks ready for their slingshots oh im sure washington knows what its doing marjorie the last time washington knew what it was doing was when it declared war on saddam insane go for a walk douglas itll do you good he did and it didnt all he could think of was nortons call that morning about the airconditioning units in hong kong la roche industries had received a fax an order from general cheng in beijing c in c of the peoples liberation army two and a half million strong the order was for everything from americanmade goretex sleeping bags to five thousand airconditioning units of the kind used by heavyhaul refrigerator trucks though hong kong was now firmly in pla hands it was still used by beijing as in the days when the colony had been british as a capitalist outpost for trade with the west chineseborn agents loyal to britain were still at large in the former british colony and along with everything else they heard they passed the information about the la roche order to the american second armys headquarters at khabarovsk via the harbinmanchurian underground democracy movement from khabarovsk colonel dick norton had called freeman careful to bill it as a personal and not an official call these airconditioning units freeman asked they portable didnt say general find out dick call me back tentoone theyre portable yes sir as freeman had sat impatiently reading the lives of sherman and grant norton rang back youre right theyre portable sir how did you thank you dick when he put down the receiver freeman began to pace back and forth in the lounge room talking to himself whats that douglas marjorie called from the kitchen suddenly freeman had stopped now in late march the spring thaw was in full swing along the siberianchinesemanchurian border why on earth summer that little turd is going to launch a summer offensive where marjorie said rushing in what you saw a little tern where whatah no i oh dear theyre such beautiful birds striding along the beach freeman was buffeted by a chilly wind and unusually wracked by doubt was he overreacting no that damn cheng was up to something it aggravated freeman so much he felt his skin itch here and there and had to shift the mm sig sauer parabellum he always carried further along his waistband so that he could scratch the offending part the sea crashed in wildly along the ribbon of sand that was montereys beach he couldnt help but hear the sounds of second armys iii corps floundering in the crashing waters of lake baikal yesovs heavy artillery chopping up the ice cutting off iii corpss retreat and the siberians spets and omon commandos butchering die retreating americans the ice floes smeared with americans blood for a while he thought he was alone on the beach mistaking the lone figure further up for a piece of rock he or she seemed to be waiting for him but as he went past the man who was too far up on the dunes for his features to be clear the man turned and walked away as the general headed back to the house his generals thoughts were back along the amur now he was convinced more than ever that it was a summer offensive cheng doesnt want to make the same mistake the arabs did against the israelis he thought half the arab tank crews were prostrate with heat exhaustion got to over a hundred and twenty degrees inside those ts hell it was so bad sadat thought the israelis mossad had issued the israeli pilots some new kind of debilitating gas bombs wasnt gas it was the goddamn heat it would be easy to mount the airconditioning units on me rear of the ts and ts right near the extra gas drum hed equally want his lead tanks cool for a longreaching preemptive strike july or august there could only be one place the gobi desert bypassing the manchurian mountain chain on his chengs right flank driving into the heart of the americancontrolled dmz along the amur next question the big question was would the mongolian communists come in on the chinese side to find out he began formulating what he would call preventive medicine and he did not mean his advice to his soldiers to practice safe sex chapter four the two pla guards snapped to attention the red flag fluttering stiffly in the breeze as captain lee aide to general cheng chief of the twoandahalfmillion peoples liberation army arrived at the xinhuamen the gate of new china the southern entrance to the zhongnanhai compound off changan avenue here a short distance west of the forbidden city the partys top officials resided and had offices behind a high wall and around two lakes lee had been raised on the discipline of the tao his mind resolved never to show his emotions to anyone and certainly not to his enemy but this morning he knew he could not contain himself besides general cheng was no enemy lee told the general theyd pulled it off are you sure cheng inquired impassively yes comrade general almost as soon as we placed the order for the airconditioning units one of the british spies in hong kong sent a message north to khabarovsk via the manchurian route the harbin democracy movement cell cheng proffered yes general chengs fingers carefully squeezed the end of his camel cigarette to a point and pushed it with a twist into the end of his persian blue cloisonné cigarette holder and freeman has received the information personally yes general a phone call from his khabarovsk headquarters are you confident of this weve had two men watching his house one equipped with a multidirectional aerial the transmitter is inside his sisterinlaws house he will no doubt think we will attack in the summer good freeman has no doubt alerted the pentagon to this and his second army will be so advised and then to prevent him from secondguessing us any further we will kill him but general lee began clearly perplexed you said our embassy in washington has it that he is to be relieved of command of second army sent back to fort ord he wont be any danger to us there cheng turned to the window overlooking the two lakes sugarylooking ice still clinging to the banks youve not fought against freeman no sir he is formidable did you know he keeps a copy of our chinese general sun tzus the art of war next to his bible he well understands sun tzus maxim that all war is deception yes general but he may discern my trap if he is given time to think about it we will not give him that time so long as our agents are discreet lee suggested when the siberian spets tried to when the siberian women tried to kill him he was not on his home ground he was in khabarovsk more alert in california there is a large chinese population it would just seem like another citizen approaching him when will it be done cheng inhaled and then seconds later smoke came out in voluminous clouds of bluish gray that rose and spilled down off the ancient roof chengs silence his answer cheng had risen fast through the partys ranks to head the pla not only because he was a brilliant strategist but also because he was able to keep secrets never tempted to tell subordinates more than they needed to know about any operation chapter five in washington where great faith had been put in the ceasefire the buds on the japanese cherry trees the trees a gift of the japanese government long ago were seized on by the media as symbols of promise and reconciliation between two other disputants japan and the us after the mutually draining trade wars of the s and s it wasnt clear whether the symbolic importance of cherry blossoms prompted the president andor his advisers to turn their thoughts to what more japan might give the united states to make up for the bruised relationships of the trade war and the american and allied disgust with japans checkbook participation or rather nonparticipation in die gulf war with iraq in any event harry schuman national security adviser saw how japan might make a conciliatory move he pointed out how in order to bolster the idea of building up a multinational peacekeeping force along the siberianmanchurian border like the force theyd sent to fight saddam insane the japanese should be invited to contribute not just yen to offset the huge american contribution but men as well it was true that under article of the japanese constitution the jdf japanese defense force in order to allay old and persistent fears in asia of a resurgent japanese militarism was permitted to send only a maximum of two thousand military personnel at any one time furthermore the two thousand could only carry arms for selfdefense nevertheless it was felt in washington that the presence of an active japanese contingent would be a welcome addition in bolstering the multinational aspect of the peacekeeping force in the same way as the smaller arab nations were asked to be part of the usled allied force in kuwait in order to show saddam that it wasnt simply the us desire that he vacate kuwait it was felt that a contingent from an asian power japan albeit a tiny contingent would sustain the idea of a multinational force and so would help deter novosibirsk and beijing from any further aggression the president liked the idea and put it to the japanese prime minister who put it to the diet and after lively debate the motion was passed a precedent having already been set by the japanese diet sending a peacekeeping contingent to thailand in october and so for only the second time since world war ii japanese forces were deployed overseas it was a colossal blunder and when freeman heard the news flash from cbn he was shaving and almost cut himself he still used a cutthroat razor believing a man must have a weapon at hand even in his toilet kit he walked to the bathroom door and stood glowering through the hallway at the cbn reporter well now its official freeman rumbled washingtons a lunatic asylum asylum it was marjorie good god freeman proclaimed standing in his khaki trousers suspenders down at his sides razor being used as a pointer dont they know dont they realize that the one thing the chinesell never stand for is japanese on chinese soil chinesell buy japanese hondas but this is a different ball game by god the chinese hate the japanese isnt it time for your morning run japanese occupied manchuria for thirteen years even changed its name to manchukuo then there was the rape of nanking butchering people right left and center and then the razor flew out at the screen to illustrate the point for marjorie japanese had a biological and chemical warfare unit used chinese and some of our boys as guinea pigs injected them anthrax and all kinds of diseases as well as gassing them chinese have a long memory by god i wish you wouldnt use that language douglas came marjories unruffled tone from the kitchen arent you going for your run soon marjorie beijingll see this as a provocation what you jogging i shouldnt think so douglas but even freeman had underestimated the ferocity of the chinese reaction to beijing it was clearly a test by the west to see what china would do when faced with the fact that the japanese had been invited by the americans and had accepted it was proof positive to general cheng and other members of the central committee that japan with us backing was testing the waters returning to its old obsession manchuria to its old dream of possessing untold oil and mineral wealth that would make japan independent of other countries for raw materials and make her an even greater industrial powerhouse than she was already in the golden light of the brothel the air redolent with incense and the smell of rice cooking downstairs spring blossom had prepared her surprise well no sooner had she led him into the other room than summer flower even more beautiful than spring blossom dressed in nothing but a scarlet vkini took him by the hand after they had undressed him and he lay naked except for his dog tags summer flower knelt before him on the floor mattress her legs straddling his chest her hands behind his head swaying gently back and forth over him one second offering her pendulous breasts to suck the next moment all but sitting on his face while spring blossom moistened her lips and went down on him he was in such ecstasy he neither saw nor heard the chinese youth who came in and took the s holster and belt arriving in his chauffeurdriven red flag at the great hall of the people which bordered tiananmen square for the meeting with the allpowerful central committee under chairman nie cheng received further news of the japanese intervention and his second shock of the day chairman nie a painfully cautious man who knew how to play both sides against the middle and who normally questioned the other members until they were numb with fatigue now quickly concurred with cheng and the rest of the committee that the japanese had obviously thrown in their hand in order to qualify for the lucrative kind of capitalist contract feeding frenzy that followed the gulf war then nie did something that for the premier was extremely difficult he surprised general cheng by demonstrating a cunning that even the strategist cheng had to admire for nie a politician the political reality always subsumed the narrower military perspective yet he now clearly approved of unhesitating military action explaining with the smoothing consensusseeking gestures of his hands that while of course it was regrettable that the peoples liberation army would find it necessary to fight from an internal political perspective a xiao guz muo zan dou a skirmish or two on the northern borders of their grossly overpopulated country would have a salutary result for quite apart from rebuffing the japanese it would have the timeproven effect of diverting domestic dissatisfaction away from beijings widely unpopular antiinflationary policies and its ruthless hunt for dissident elements cheng agreed it was axiomatic that internal dissent would be far less tolerated by the masses whose attention would of necessity shift to that of concern for a foreign devil at chinas gates along the ancient northern wall of genghis khan besides cheng knew an external enemy in any country had the effect of burying or at least subsuming internal squabbles within the party as well as on the street such a move of course would also consolidate nies power chengs attack with the central committees unanimous backing was set for dawn april cheng said nothing about the plan he had set in motion against freeman for nie and the others freeman for the most part was an open book a career soldier of fiftyfive who bore an uncanny resemblance to an american actor and whose strategies and tactical brilliance had earned him four stars and the grudging respect of even enemy commanders his reputation had grown rapidly since his daring attack on pyongyang earlier in the war and his brilliant defense against the siberian aist giant hovercraft offensive on lake baikal on the lake he had what little artillery he had brought with him on the airdrop fired into the ice around his paratroopers positions at the lakes end this bombardment had created a jagged sea of autosize bergs that the aists could not negotiate the result had been known as freemans basra a telescoping pile of wreckage that looked like the destruction meted out to the retreating iraqis along the highway from kuwait chapter six if freemans victories were an open book he had a few secrets he shared with no one one of them was that fit as he was he detested having to keep it up jogging and physical exercise made you too damn hot and sweaty unless of course you were in combat then you were so busy so fearful at times usually after so exhilarated you didnt notice but he had to force himself to run at least four miles a day to stay in shape and go easy on the buttered popcorn montereys beach was perfect the sand making it more exhausting making him feel doubly heroic and at the end he could walk into the ocean that as marjorie said every time would cool you off right enough for the past three days freeman hadnt seen the figure on the dunes and this morning the general was particularly relaxed going over the old battles in his mind as he jogged along the waterfirmed beach he remembered the armored battle in the yakutsk region of siberia where it had plunged to minus sixty degrees at which temperature metal became brittle and the waxes in the hydraulic lines of the siberian tanks but not the american abrams ma separated out the oils constituent waxes then clogging the tanks arteries in the same way as lumps of cholesterol clog the bloodstream the ts and some ts had suddenly become sitting ducks whereas the american tanks burst through the snow berms at forty miles per hour like exploding icing sugar picking the siberians off it was one of the most beautiful things freeman had ever seen and he was thinking of it now as suddenly he saw the lone figure on the dunes once again freemans world was a hobbesian one one in which only the sword or the threat of it by the sovereign whether the sovereign was one or many guaranteed peace and tranquility and so it was the most natural thing in the world for him to pat the bulge beneath the waistband of his jogging trousers to make sure that the sig sauer was snug and ready his wife had been fatally wounded by a siberian spetsnaz a specialforces sleeper who along with so many others had been inserted during the heyday of the lovein between gorby and the new york times and who when activated to take out freeman earlier in the war had surprised his wife in the house instead freeman having been delayed on the flight from washington the intruder fatally wounded her and she died a few hours later in the monterey peninsula hospital freeman could tell by the way the man chinese in a jogging suit was standing on the dune staring out to sea not bothering to turn in the generals direction that he was waiting for him again or was he one of californias legion of ecofreaks kill all the people but save the whales and was the stranger the same man as a few days ago morning freeman said not altering his pace merely nodding as he passed the man nodded back son of a bitch looks suspicious freeman thought and immediately thought after that maybe he wasnt he looked lithe wiry and unusually tall but somehow maybe because of the smart matching jogging outfit and the nike pumps very modern in some indefinable way freeman didnt place him as a party member but then theyd hardly send someone in a baggy mao suit with party written all over him two hundred yards further on freeman stopped and began some leg stretches love a duck the chinese jogger was doing tai chi moving with that graceful deliberation that for once made westerners stare at the chinese rather than the other way around now ahead a hundred yards further on up the beach he saw another figure and off to his left another appeared atop the dunes bad news dick freeman was speaking as if colonel dick norton were by his side one in front of me one behind and one on the left flank the sea was to his right boxed in all right you bastards freeman muttered beneath the crash of the sea youre going to have to come and get me up on the highway he could hear the hum of tires and saw a winnebago go by then a bus and a motorbike but they might as well have been on mars well dick i told you to build up the un line get things ready in case of a punchup and over here ive fouled up my friend he was doing a few pushups during which he could see all of them at one glance he stopped the pushups foolish to get his heartbeat up too much could make his aim a little shaky still he wasnt fool enough to think he could get three of them two maybe but not three he looked up and saw that tai chi was now moving toward him hands in his pockets well dick last time i saw a jogger with his hands in his pockets son of a bitch was playing with himself dont like it you hear that sig time i played a little pocket billiards myself he knelt down as if going into another exercise routine which immediately reduced his target size he felt under the jogging suit for the grip had it and turned the gun barrel out still under the cloth pushing off the safety he figured tai chi would be within good range in about sixty seventy seconds and began the count chapter seven five thousand miles away it had been a slow morning along the un line everything was quiet and only the fourman sasdelta troop of david brentwood salvini choir williams and aussie lewis were unhurriedly busy checking all their equipment from the transparent mags for the belgian p to the pencil flares and handheld cigarettepacksize gpss geosynchronous positioning systems they all carried jenghiz the mongolian interpreterguide they had assigned them was fluent not only in the khalkha mongol dialect that was used by threequarters of the population but also the dialects of the durbet mongols who lived in and about the mountainous region north of the tableland between siberia and china that the rest of the world called mongolia jenghiz also spoke the tongue of the darigangra inhabitants of eastern mongolia and that of the kazakhs turvins and khotans that made up less than percent of the sparsely populated country the size of texas with jenghiz they would be going in over the wall not the great wall of china but the big rampart of genghis khan in northeast mongolia near the mongolianchinese border and over the twomilehigh hentiyn nuruu mountains south of the siberianmongolian border and eighty miles northeast of the mongolian capital of ulan bator it was a high country that unlike the steppes and the gobi desert south and east of it was one of fastrunning rivers deep gorges and wild windswept mountains outcrops of larch and spruce hanging grimly onto rock faces battered by the winds that alternately came out of siberia to the north and chinese inner mongolia to the south if they were caught jenghiz was to destroy freemans sealed message the cover story given them by colonel dick norton would be that while patrolling the un dmz the pave low mj chopper had lost its noe nap of the earth radar and in one of the many dust storms that plagued mongolia they had lost their way straying into mongolian airspace the mongolian interpreter as lost for recognizable landmarks as they were it had happened before both in the almost featureless expanse of the gobi desert to the southeast and to those pilots trying to negotiate their way around the hentiyn nuruu but aussie lewis reckoned the mongolians wouldnt buy it they certainly didnt buy any incursions on their territory by the chinese from inner mongolia whom they hated this is different david brentwood assured aussie well be wearing un identification armbands et cetera yeah until we reach the insertion point salvini said but what if they come across us while were changing into our mongolian garb you know what they do to spies he paused you know what we do to spies were not at war with them boyo choir williams said itd be mighty embarrassing thats all aussie chimed in maybe choir but sals got a point we could be embarrassed for twentyfive years hard fucking yakka in some friggin coal mine hey david brentwood said checking over the clothes theyd slip into in order to travel down through the mountains to ulan bator on dick nortons that is freemans preventive medicine mission davids tone was older than his twentyfive years he was cutting short the worry talk no one twisted your arms you know you guys volunteered norton told me that was the generals first directive for this mission you know the conditions we get caught we get caught uncle sam cant do anything you want to cry about it dont go it was about the worst insult you could deliver to the elite commandos of special air service or delta force these were men who had gone deep into enemy country from the coast only a few weeks before the ceasefire to help a stranded seal detachment near nanking these men had been together on ratmanov island had gone down into the labyrinth of tunnels to sweep out the spetsnaz were not complaining aussie said just looking at it square in the face davey i think freemans doin the right thing its just aw why dont you admit it aussie salvini said his brooklyn accent at its height you don wanna leave little olga big olga choir added aussie slipped an elastic band around two mm mags dont be so fucking rude dont take any pictures of her david said easily smiling to break the tension now his point had been made remember no personal effects all right if i bring my dick along aussie countered david brentwood essentially a shy individual shook his head at the australians unrelenting vulgarity just keep it in your trousers boyo choir williams advised it might get shot off otherwise salvini thought this was very funny oh youre a riot aussie told them a regular fucking riot if anybodys going to be missing their member its the first mongolian who pokes his nose aussie stopped and winked at jenghiz the interpreterguide no offense ghiz no off fence jenghiz said his goodhumored smile of pearlwhite teeth framed by a drooping black mustache it made him look somewhat sinister despite the fine bright teeth and aussie suspected that he grew it more to bug the han chinese who for the most part couldnt grow one and who in general regarded facial hair as the sign of barbarians except when one was old listen up aussie said tentoone ill be the first to spot a mongolian choir sal what do you say choir williams whod lost and made money from the australians obsession with gambling before was careful to set the ground rules how will we know for sure well aussie said its not very difficult if the fucker starts shooting choir and salvini bet tentoone theyd spot the first mongolian after the drop after they started making their way down from the mountains toward ulan bator where they hoped they would be able to make contact with the prosiberian but antichinese government since gorbachevs perestroika and glasnost the mongolians though only with a population of just over two million had started to go their own way and despite the presence of siberian garrisons were determined to make their country their own as fer as they could there were bound to be russian patrols but brentwoods team was to avoid all combat if at all possible and make its way to ulan bator with a message that freeman had once jocularly called lets make a deal by the way aussie said anyone hear about that poor bastard smythe he was referring to one of the seal members whod been captured by the chinese general cheng refusing to give the american back in a prisoner exchange because the chinese were maintaining that as smythe was out of uniform when captured and therefore a spy he was not to be accredited normal pow treatment the fact that smythe was hardly a spy decked out as hed been in seal rebreather and wet suit was of no account to the chinese and the fact that smythe a man in his early thirties with a wife and two young children back in maine hadnt been shot was not due to any compassion on the chinese part but because cheng wanted to question him in greater detail about the seals in short they wanted to torture him last i heard david brentwood told aussie was that intelligence reports from the democracy movement underground said that theyd moved him from nanking to beijing more interrogation probably poor bugger aussie said and that jewish sheila the one who was you know the one who was smuggled out of harbin north to us what sheila salvini pressed the jewish bird who told our side cheng was moving masses of troops across the nanking bridge on their way north oh sal said her yeah i remember someone told me she got back to the jao he meant the jewish autonomous region or oblast wedged between manchuria and siberia of which it had ostensibly been a part or what used to be the jao before we got here sal added shes still around why heard shes some looker aussie said enormous yes okay david said we know enormous eyes they all laughed even jenghiz who didnt always understand their english they said in the sasdelta force that if aussie wasnt in a firefight he was in bed two minutes later they were told the pave low was ready its big noisesuppressed rotors impatiently chopping the air still bloody loud aussie commented like your ties salvini joshed with that they were all aboard and once the rear ramp closed swallowing them up the pave lows big bulbous nose the choppers fuselage flanked by two scallopshaped fuel tanks lifted the rear rotor higher the choppers downpush kicking up hard crystalline snow that chafed the faces of its ground crew who did not know whether theyd see the pave low again chapter eight the man whod been assiduously practicing his tai chi was now no more than twenty feet away general freeman yes freeman answered now squatting on his haunches arms akimbo doing breathing exercises who are you colonel wei republic of china his english was impeccable i am with the consulate in new york admiral lin kuang was sorry you were unable to discuss ideas with him and has sent identification freeman demanded standing up now indicating the chinese behind him near the water and the other one on his flank up on the dunes those your people freeman added his tone curtly businesslike no the man calling himself wei said we might have a problem in that regard which is why i why did you wait freeman said accepting the consulate identification card and drivers license with residency address and the home address in taiwan why didnt you approach me back there he indicated the dunes further behind him up the beach i did not know i still do not know general who these other two men are i thought they might try to stop me or me freeman said handing him back the identification what do you want to see me about the generals eyes were still on the other two men one a hundred yards to his right down the beach and the other about the same distance up from him atop the dunes the brownish green dune grass stubble blowing stiffly in the wind the admiral wanted you to know that if he can be of any assistance he will gladly give it freeman grunted his tone somewhere between gratitude and frustration he appreciated the admirals gesture but it was just that a gesture too vague a promise besides freeman was no longer c in c second army and he told colonel wei this he had effectively been relieved of his command didnt taipei read the papers the la roche tabloids had been screaming freeman fired for a week besides id was so easily forged in an age where they were using xerox color copiers to pass on forged banknotes why the hell didnt you call me at the house freeman demanded still suspicious instead of this cloak and your house is being watched general your phone lines are tapped by whom we do not know we at the consulate the man said hesitating i can give you other contacts to verify my credentials if you its all right freeman said whats admiral kuang say specifically only that if you should need his assistance he will do whatever he can you dont seem to understand ive lost command of second army furthermore im merely an instrument of national policy i cant do what the united states government doesnt want me to do we understand general but you may yet be returned to command huh thatd be a miracle freeman commented looking again at the two other men then he knew who they must be goddamn it theyre bodyguards he said smiling at wei for once the fairiesve done something right still freeman wondered would bodyguards be assigned after you were no longer a threat to the enemy well hell expresidents had bodyguards for life was it too much conceit that after his victories he would have earned the wrath of vindictive losers that they might send someone after him we feel wei continued choosing his words as carefully as a chef selecting his tomatoes for the day working around it we feel that things are in a state of flux in the disputed area between siberia and manchuria and that the worlds in a state of flux colonel freeman interrupted its her natural condition perhaps but the signs are more propitious than i think you realize general for yourself even if youre correct again what can i do should the occasion arise you would send the word mercury to our consulate this would activate certain procedures with admiral kuang dont dance with me colonel does mercury mean youd intervene militarily this is possible colonel wei flew into freeman knocking him to the harder sand by the waters edge blood and bone from his shattered cheek spurting over the generals chest turning the white foamy sea pink jesus freeman began weis eyes were frozen in shock the shot having killed him the instant the depleted uranium bullet had exploded in his brain creating a hole the size of a fist in the back of his head another bullet thudded into him and freeman felt a warm sensation flooding over his stomach now the general had the sig sauer out and pushing wei off him but snuggling in close to the body took careful aim the sig sauer bucked twice and the man by the water seemed to hesitate trembling looking as if he were shot but he kept coming the man from the dunes had disappeared only to reappear moments later his head barely visible through the windshield of a fourwheeldrive jeep renegade coming straight at freeman who fired again to his left the man by the water crumpled at the seas edge the waves issuing over his body their forward motion rolling cumbersomely toward die beach the undertow sucking at him and wet sand pouring over his legs back into the sea the fourwheeldrive was now hurtling down from the dunes a hundred feet away when freeman fired one two three four five at the windshield one of the shots found the target the fourwheeldrive flipping onto its side careening for a bit on the beach making the drier sand squeak like the sound of piglets its wheels still spinning at the sky freeman knew he had only a few shots left and ran toward the vehicle from the off side the man was dead and freeman couldnt see where hed been hit until he realized he hadnt been hit at all the windshield was a milky spiders web little glass had flown out instead what must have happened was that as soon as the windshield had been hit turning opaque the man had instantly stuck his head out far left to see where to steer when the vehicle flipped digging deep into the dry sand his head taking the impact full on and now lolling like a rag dolls no one had heard any shots against the noise of the surf but someone passing up on the highway had seen the overturned renegade and the body at the surfs edge when the police arrived they couldnt find any id on the two men you have any idea who they were general asked a blonde whose figure couldnt be disguised despite the state trooper uniform no the general answered id only be speculating go ahead general she encouraged him guo an bu chinese intelligence service external affairs why would they be after you general dont know freeman said unless they think im another subutai the general was staring out at the sea not in the near distance but as if somehow he could see all the way to china subutai he explained served genghis khan marched all the way from china to the hungarian plain at one stage his armies covered four hundred miles took several cities and fought two great battles conquering poland and all of silesia in less than thirty days he paused oblivious to me policewomans stare before that hed taken russia and before that genghis khan had taken all china by god what an army general what oh sorry officer no what i mean was theres a good chance it was politically motivated but i dont want that to get into the press politically motivated sir yes thats what i think chinese dont want me in the picture which makes me believe that wei that joker over there was right maybe the ceasefire over there isnt worth the paper its written on you mean the chinese were trying to assassinate you general either that freeman said orflashing a smilesomeone in washington everyone laughed it happened now and then at a homicide the tension had to snap but as the roc colonel was carried away freemans jaw clenched no matter what army when a soldier went down like that having risked all knowing the odds it never failed to move him at that moment he felt as if wei were a son in a way that transcended time and borders hearing the roll of the sea he felt that he had been with subutai that destiny had thrown wei upon him to protect him that god had used the roc colonel as a shield and that therefore freemans time had not come yet chapter nine sergeant first class minoru sato was fiftytwo years of age one year away from mandatory retirement in the japanese defense force the company to which he was attached was part of the second asahikawa division one of the jdfs northern armys four divisions under the constitution the jdf did not get to take either the type or tank or the fh also denied them were the mm howitzer and the selfpropelled mm recoilless rifle by stretching the definition of what constituted small arms the twothousandman jdf unit was permitted to take law antitank launchers and antipersonnel mines as these came under the heading of selfdefense but for the jdfs purposes the restrictions were not seen as any impediment to what was thought would be basically a unsanctioned observer team on a tenbyfivemile strip of the un s dmz in any event us armor and artillery were in effect on call should they be needed in some unforeseen circumstance and at least the two battalions that made up the jdf force were equipped with topoftheline type mm rifles with a thoroughness for which the japanese were known in their industrial policy the jdf battalion organized itself promptly into a classic perimeter defense with the jdf commander true to his un mission playing no favorites both the western and eastern sectors of the perimeter that fronted american garrisons no less manned than the southern side of the fivebytenmile sector where jdf troops looked across the amur river into manchuria the japanese were determined to look and to be as professional as possible after all this was only the second time japanese troops had been abroad since world war ii over sixty years ago and the nation would be watching expecting them to meet the highest standards japanese pride was not about to be embarrassed by any attack even by chinese bandits who in this sparsely populated region of manchuria could come down from the high country across the river and conceivably launch a raid across the river on the siberian villages in fact beijing had warned the un central command before the japanese defense force had even been despatched that it beijing could not be responsible for the actions of chinese border brigands the admission constituted something of a loss of face for beijing apparently conceding that part of the peoples republic was not completely under communist control but beijings caution about brigands was seen by washington as a genuine effort to forestall any possible misunderstanding should a local warlord and his followers forge over the river and cause the pla to be blamed for violating the ceasefire freeman on the other hand dismissed chengs plea as beijing bullshit claiming that it was a goddamned façade a readymade excuse for the pla to hit and run wherever they like and then blame it on some bandit why would they bother he was asked by washington because its a hidden message to us that says you boys want a un line fine but be prepared to lose men in border raids over the next twenty years same as korea there are still people in the us who dont know we lose men every year in incidents on that damn thirtyeighth parallel this bandit cover is beijings way of reminding us that were stuck here to garrison the un line and to pay for it a trace ten times longer than the korean dmz for the next twenty years douglas they said in washington is just looking for a fight get him out of here fast and now he was sitting with marjorie on the eve of april the twentyfourth watching the jdf set up camp on the un line at one point he could do nothing more than shake his head in disgust and disbelief cbn was already interviewing members of the japanese contingent beautiful freeman said his voice dripping with sarcasm look at the background for this interview you could plot their sections strong points and battle positions to the nearest yard cbns giving us an aerial shot now jesus why dont they just send the plans to beijing and be done with it well marjorie said shed long given up on douglass blasphemyim sure it will all work out for the best douglas she was an allforthebest lady she could have turned the battle for hue into an allforthebest event she was getting on his nerves and he was trying to think of a way of telling her that from now on he had decided to stay up at fort ord he figured his duty to his dead wife to give marjorie a chance to look after you had long been fulfilled though he was watching an earlier taped newscast of the jdf near poyarkovo it was already dawn there and a phone call from a sympathetic colleague at the pentagon informed him that poyarkovo was as of this moment under heavy attack us firesupport teams being rushed from both the western and eastern sectors of the rectangle to try to help the jdf hold the forward slope nearest the amur or black dragon as the chinese called it was already under heavy mm mortar assault by the time the americans got there it was too late for the jdf to regroup and retake the forward slope theyd lost now they had to fell back along a fivepoint reverse slope defense behind a crest on the northern side of the river the forward half of the fivebytenmile area already lost to waves of what were being called chinese irregulars the japanese were in shock while they had quickly placed law antitank teams and machine gun nests on either flank producing a withering fire a tank ditch as the trp target reference point the chinese none of whom were dressed in army garb were running through the mine fields as one man fell another used him as a stepping stone just as the russians had done at stalingrad and chinese were already using bamboo ladders to cross the eightfootwide by fivefootdeep antitank ditch only yards below the crest but where had so many chinese come from taking the jdf by complete surprise that question was about to be answered by a reconnaissance flight immediately ordered by colonel dick norton a stealth fb fighter was at sapporo airfield in northern japan but a hairline fracture had been found in its ram radarabsorbing material contoured intake grid the concern was that the fracture under the enormous stresses imposed on the aircraft might suddenly become something much larger possibly radiating out to the wing in any event this was the reason that the carrier uss salt lake city in the east china sea was contacted and ordered to launch immediately a photo reconnaissance of the poyarkovo area though by now the f phantom the wondrous fighter of an earlier age was all but extinct relegated to a secondary role as a quick photo recon aircraft it was at this moment exactly the right plane in the right place and so was given the mission to find out just how much chicom activity was going on along the sector of the un line now under attack and how many troops were massing on the southern bank of the amur in manchuria was this a local warlord action or merely a tactical probe for something much larger as the carrier steamed into a saffron china dawn twin ribbons of steam rose and broke ghostlike from its angled deck catapults and the deck director a yellow dot against the wide gray expanse of sea and sky watched as the fs deck crew swung into action suddenly the plane had the most important mission aboard a return to its old glory the phantoms twin nose wheels rising slightly as they passed up over the shuttle the catapult bridle looped over the shuttle and onto the two wing forgings the bridles slack was taken up the cable now looking like a huge black rubber band stretched beneath the nose strut which now rose to full flight attitude and the wings on deck the bitterly cold wind whistled about the planes canopy kerosene fumes mixing with the salt air of the sea the pilot watching the deck director raise his hands turning them as if he were securing twinvalve wheels aboard a submarine it was the signal to go to full afterburner thrust the howl of the notoriously smoky j engine became a banshee scream the fighter straining full against the bridle the yellowjacketed deck officer dropped to one knee right arm extended sideways pointing seaward out over the deck his action was immediately followed by the phantom as the plane its pilot slammed back hard against the martinbaker ejector seat was hurled aloft in seconds in less than a twohundredfoot run the phantom banked sharply to the left and headed toward the blurred squiggle of gray that was the manchurian coast general william beatty the man with whom washington had replaced douglas freeman as c in c second army had surprised the joint chiefs in washington with the speed with which hed dispatched his troops to help the japanese defense force plug the gap at poyarkovo even though he was not in time to help much as the chinese withdrew they left behind them a savaged and demoralized jdf master sergeant sato and officers killed at the rivers edge in fact more chinese over two hundred lay dead than japanese and americans but the shock effect of the chicorns attack had been total american observers were quick to note how many of the japanese had been either decapitated or had limbs hacked off despite it was believed having been dead already as a result of the fusillade of smallarms fire from the waves of chinese infantry most of the chinese dead had fallen victim to the jdfs mine field the chinese in an eerie action reminiscent of the kind of fanatical japanese defense that americans had come to expect in world war ii had used the bodies of their dead and dying comrades as stepping stones in a crazy path of human flesh to cross the mine field general beatty immediately ordered the american first battalion of ii corps to pursue the chinese irregulars or whoever they were across the amur to destroy them andor teach them the lesson that this was one un peacekeeping force that wouldnt sit still and tolerate such violations of the dmz by hours the american first and second battalions had crossed the slowthawing ice of the amur river and were engaging rearguard elements of the fleeing chinese force on the rivers southern that is chinese bank the americans of ii corps already taking dozens of prisoners but struck by the speed of the chinese withdrawal beatty wisely ordered pontoon bridges at the ready should a sudden thaw in the unpredictable spring weather weaken the ice and so temporarily cut off the us supply line he then ordered two more battalions across the river it was the high point of his career and his downfall it wasnt that he had exceeded his mandate in ordering the battalions across the border in this washington and tokyo pushed by outraged public opinion in both countries over the number of japanese and american soldiers killed fully supported beattys action freeman had called the pentagon the moment he had heard news reports of beattys counterattack but his warning having to go through normal channels was treated merely as an advisory which while it stunned those in washington who never thought theyd hear freeman back away from a fight arrived too late to have any effect by now more us and japanese troops had been committed and general william beatty was within hours of earning the epithet of batty beatty freeman had seen immediately from the rapidity of the hitandrun chinese attack that this was a typical chicom guerrilla tactic more than that it was a classic maneuver right out of the pages of sun tzus the art of war about trapping your enemy by withdrawing or as freeman called it a sucker play subutai had used the same tactic at the battle of sajo river in withdrawing across the river dummying the hungarians after him before suddenly turning in a massive broadstroke movement snapping shut the trap and this is precisely what chengs troops did as they wheeled about in the hills around xunhe a village three miles south of the river their numbers were swollen to ten times their original four thousand by troops from the harbinbased twentythree army corps who had been rushed forward on a forced march the night before from supposedly destroyed barracks sixtyfive miles west of the river on the single lane road along the xun river valley beatty realized his mistake but too late for by then the two chinese pincers of the breaststroke had closed on the southern bank three guard companies men in all having the express task of mortar bombing the fogshrouded ice and pontoons hence not only destroying any natural bridge for an american retreat but smashing their supply line meanwhile chinese ts upgunned ts were now moving up the road from the deserted barracks to xunhe village and toward the bridge the american first battalion taking the brunt of the armored attack while second battalion quickly made an abatis sappers from second battalion blowing trees at a height of five to six feet from their base felling them at approximately a fortyfivedegree angle creating a formidable obstacle course of fallen but not completely severed trees along the road delaying the tanks for two hours this saved some americans from death if not capture but the bulk of the american force remained cut off from retreat the chinese were so close to them that even if beatty called in tacair strikes the fog would deny the pilots any reliable identification of friend or foe the final bloodboiling humiliation for the americans was the glimpse of a lone lowflying phantom fighter which might have at least made an attempt to rake the old chicom barracks with its mm cannon but which made only one low pass in a gap in the fog and then turned eastward presumably hightailing it for the coast within minutes of the phantom slamming down on the deck at miles per hour its tail grabbing the threewire arrestor cable its video shown aboard salt lake city revealed sullenlooking hills in a stark monochrome covered for the most part with fog and hills further south devoid of fog but covered with what seemed like thousands of insects zoom shots showing however that they were chinese regulars advancing along an estimated fiftymile front against the poyarkovo section of the unmanchurian line one of the more brazen acts of lying even by communist standards occurred the following day in the un when general chengs emissaries tried to explain away the xunhe incident by claiming that the presence of pla troops was in response to concerns over banditry in the area bandits it was said had been responsible for launching the hitandrun attack on the japanese defense force the pla presence merely a reaction to the americans violating the integrity of chinas borders oh no president mayne said not this time those bastards cant have their cake and eat it too they started this well finish it what can we do press secretary and adviser trainor asked beatty made a complete hash of reinstate freeman but mr president the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff began unleash him mayne ordered yes sir but trainor the president added yes mr president tell him to end it as soon as he contains it this isnt a fishing expedition yes sir you think thatll do it mr president inquired schuman the national security advisor well see mayne answered the presidents advisers were not sure what he meant by it what would they see the end of the fighting or how difficult it was to contain douglas freeman once he was unleashed chapter ten khabarovsk that son of a bitch tried to kill me they were the first words freeman uttered upon touching down at khabarovsk you mean cheng norton inquired i mean cheng monkey wants to make it personal well dick i wont fall for that piece of sun tzu about getting angry and then losing the battle because you lose your head im not angry norton no sir im mad as hell freeman pulled on his learner gloves weathers supposed to be warming up it is sir course dick freeman said striding toward his staff car like an old athlete resurrected trick is not to stay mad be cool rational yes sir whats his disposition of forces we figure it at ten divisions minimum on the manchurian border more coming they got that damn nanking bridge fixed over the yangtze it was the bridge that the captured smythe and the other seals had attacked and severed earlier in the war figure they must have general norton said either that or theyve put a pontoon across though that would take some making its at least three miles across there freeman grunted pulled up his collar and buttoned it at the throat should be warmer than this we heard anything from that sasd troop no sir thats good news then the commandos were on radio silence we hope sir how far would they be from ulan bator they re flying in on a pave low now whats the drill freeman asked a burst radio message approximately fortyeight hours from now when theyve completed their mission yes sir if they do pray to god we get that message through dick yes sir anything else he sensed there was norton had that look about him yes sir spit it out norton slipped a folder from his fliptop briefcase as they entered the quonset hut bad news im afraid photos he said taking a steaming cup of coffee from the general all from ofek it was the israeli highresolution electrooptical camera satellite one of those launched by iaiisraeli aviation industries using a shavit or comet rocket known to freemans g staff as a shove it well freeman said looking down at the whitish shape made by the microdotsize pixels that looked about half the size of a cigarette filter against a background of gray barren landscape sure as hell arent scuds east winds norton said type four confirmed by the pentagon conventional or threemegaton payload range three thousand miles has a circular error probability of around plus or minus two miles so tel aviv says but a cep of plus or minus two miles doesnt matter much if theyre after a big target like a city or an army freeman said yes sir theyre theaterlevel offensive all right not divisional thats why i thought you ought to see them straight away freeman sat down patting his shirt for his bifocals couldnt find them and had to go to the makeshift bedroom where he retrieved a spare pair from atop a gideon bible its pages held open by a box of buckshot cartridges for the winchester shotgun he kept by his bedside the general found he didnt need his glasses after all for even without them israeli and pentagon intelligence reports had already concurred with dick nortons assessment classifying the missiles in large black capitals as inf intermediate nuclear forces from plas second artillery he was shaking his head in disgust as well as alarm i told them in washington i told them the moment those goddamned fairies signed that inf treaty with the russians while we were sending our pershings to the scrap heap and the russians were doing the same he looked up at norton then back down at the missiles a cluster of six of them beijing my friend was grinning eartoear moment gorby and reagan signed the inf china became the number one inf power in the world you figure the fairies didnt think of that freeman was getting madder by the second i tell you what norton when i think of all that goddamn incompetence running around loose in washington it makes my blood the general stopped midsentence directing a wary glance at norton these infrared confirmed yes sir norton knew that the general was remembering the humiliation heaped upon him by the press the la roche tabloids in particular for the casualties second army had suffered earlier in the siberian campaign when freeman believed as intelligence had reported that he was about to engage a division of enemy tanks hidden in the taiga they had also been infrared confirmed the siberians having simply put batterypowered heaters inside the plastic mockups of the ts to give off a sufficient infrared signature to fool aerial reconnaissance as well as leading his armor into the trap freeman had sent apaches on ahead to soften the siberian armor up only to have over fifteen of the hellfire missilearmed choppers blown out of the sky by vams or vertical area mines freeman knew that hed been lucky that hed lost only the battle on the neverskovorodino road and not the war it was a lesson hed not soon forget any other confirmation he pressed norton norton reached over turning past the photographs to page three of the typed report yes sir indentation we can tell from blowups of the tire tracks in the desert approximately how many tons the carrier vehicles and loads are the indentation weight equals that of a missile if theyre fakes theyre sure as hell heavy ones and you know how the chicoms are about fuel its damn near a capital offense to waste a gallon in the chinese army i dont think theyd be driving heavy fakes around for fun from the coordinates freeman could tell at a glance that it was somewhere in sinkiang province lanzhou military region missile sites at lop nor further west than that norton answered past the turpan depression in the foothills of the tien shan range pentagon and israeli intelligence figure the missiles were originally situated there because moscow was well within striking distance they still dont trust one another especially now with the breakup of the old soviet union beijings afraid the diseasell spread maybe freeman replied but the point is dick their threethousandmile radius means they could easily reach us thats what the report concludes general washington and tel aviv are agreed on that only need to hit us with two or three in the first salvo and thatd be it for second army freeman was tapping his teeth with his bifocals a habit that annoyed norton intensely by god dick what we need is a preemptive strike apart from anything else those missiles are so close to the border theyre a gift to yesov if he wanted to use them against us if he and the chinese are in cahoots remember in siberia novosibirsk doesnt like moscow any more than beijing the general saw nortons unease about a preemptive strike i know i know freeman waved his hand impatiently fairiesll have a fit hopefully the white house will back us this time i think thats why mossad sent their report straight to washington but if we move anything in there general wed be in a much wider war with china sixtyeight divisions against our fortyfour and thesere only the divisions on the sinosiberian border freeman didnt need the figures he already knew that chinas fulltime army alone stood at over one hundred divisions a million and a half men and this ignored the two million men they had in the reserves and freeman knew the chinese werent iraqis it wouldnt be simply a mass of poorly led conscripts hed have to face if it hit the fan to a man the chinese were volunteers and longterm volunteers at that like the german wehrmacht the pla had taken pains to make sure that the members of any unit came from not only the same province but wherever possible from the same village it seemed like a small enough detail but freeman pointed out it was enormously important in terms of morale you might bug out in front of strangers but itd be a long time before youd let your own village down everyone in the village knew you and your parents the disgrace would be total it went a long way to making up for lack of sophisticated weaponry the united states had learned that in nam and as theyd shown in korea the chicom commanders knew a few more tricks than the iraqis like slipping a division or two over twenty thousand men right under your damn nose theyd wait for a thunderstorm to trip off all the groundmovement sensors then move and pla officers while paid more were much closer to their men than the iraqi officers had been to theirs in this respect the chinese were more like their traditional enemies the vietnamese still freeman was confronted by the brutal reality of the missiles a massive attack on second army could take out its heart the problem would be to get permission for a bombing mission to try to take out the missiles it was so deep into china miles that if the bombers were to stand a chance of getting through to the target the flight given the fractures found in more stealths would have to consist of bs originating out of western europe but most likely france wouldnt allow it just as shed refused permission for the us to overfly french soil in the raid against qaddafi in libya there was nothing for it but to ask the white house to ask the brits still maggie thatcher was long gone and elements of the leftist labour party opposition were bound to oppose such a flight as they had in the case of libya in beijing meanwhile the extent of general beattys unexpected response had made it clear that china was now de facto in a war with the united states both premier nies and general chengs forcefully stated determination to defend chinas borders against imperialist us aggression immediately gave way to reawakening asian memories of the humiliating defeat inflicted upon the americans in vietnam the chinese hated the vietnamese who were continually arguing over border areas and the resourcerich islands in the south china sea but nevertheless nie and cheng had no qualms about invoking the vietnamese victory over the americans to remind the pla that a much smaller asian country had defeated the mighty usa besides the pla was many times the size of the north vietnamese army and for the pla to be victorious over the americans along the black dragon river in the north would enhance chinas reputation in all asia particularly given the vacuum left by the demise of the ussr chapter eleven britain the minister for defense stanley wrightattersley was sitting at the long cabinet room table at downing street a batteredlooking red box of ministerial documents in front of him on the green baizecovered table when the pm entered wrightattersley rose prime minister is my information correct stanley the french wont come on side afraid so sir elysée palace issued a secret memo earlier this morning that the french cabinet deem it an inappropriate response to the misunderstanding along the black dragon river is that what they actually said a misunderstanding along the black dragon not the amur yes prime minister theyre afraid that an american bombing mission would to quote their president inflame the situation further misunderstanding the prime minister huffed my god the chinese attacked the un line any schoolboy could understand it wrightattersley nodded quite so prime minister but were dealing with the french the pm grunted pulled out a chair and his aide knew it would be a potoftea decision darjeeling prime minister or earl grey darjeeling the pm said without turning putting on his pincenez to read the remainder of the french communiqué theyre a fractious lot the frogs sometimes i think its against their principle to say yes to anything they simply cannot tolerate any idea that doesnt originate with them they no doubt feel wrightattersley said that frenchchinese trade would be damaged if they allowed bombers to use french airspace and do they think the prime minister asked rhetorically that our trade with china would not be affected and never mind the retaliation that the communists may very well wreak on british passport holders in hong kong now that its under the benevolent rule of beijing those of tiananmen massacre fame the defense minister said nothing there was nothing more he could say about the french in the world of selfinterest theirs was the most selfinterested the french had always had a lovehate relationship with america a love of hollywood and a contempt for everything else the pms private secretary entered as tea was being poured he had the latest poll results the government was fifteen points behind labour he said nothing but merely laid the message slip alongside the secret french communiqué refusing to assist the americans does labour know the pm inquired i mean has the us request leaked no prime minister the private secretary answered though i cant answer for the next twentyfour hours wrightattersley sipped the darjeeling and placed the cup down without a sound be that as it may he said looking over at the prime minister i feel obliged to tell you that this kind of thing is extremely difficult to keep under wraps bound to get out sooner or later prime minister there was a long silence it was a trying decision for the british pm already down in the polls and shortly to face a general election a decision to assist the americans could cost the prime minister not only personal popularity he could well lose the entire election to labour a prospect infinitely more worrying to the government than french displeasure the pm took tea and thought upon the matter his mind went back to the time during the falklands war when he was but a junior in whitehall he remembered the clandestine operations made necessary by the americans haig secretary of navy lehmann and un envoy jeane kirkpatrick especially by kirkpatricks hostility toward britain and her support along with that of assistant secretary for latin american affairs thomas enders for argentina against the british the american who had saved the day was caspar weinberger the us secretary of defense who arranged at great personal political danger secret transfer of us weapons and spy plane intelligence on argentinian positions to the british the airtosurface stinger missiles which the sas had used to such good effect in the falklands were just part of the massive aid supplied by weinberger which included everything from airtoair missiles to kc tanker aircraft used for the midair refueling of the british vulcan bombers the prime minister knew that without american help the british with only one carrier could not have defeated general galtieri of course well help the americans he said taking up his tea again i should never be able to look at myself in the mirror again if we didnt he looked directly at the defense minister were cousins after all quite so wrightattersley answered the polls prime minister the private secretary suggested one eyebrow arched apprehensively damn the polls he turned to his defense minister a friend in need stanley isnt that right absolutely sir absolutely dont tell me the details stanley less theyre discussed the better and perhaps they wont have to go after all media types get wind of this slap a d notice on em thatll shut them up very good prime minister a defence ministry notice would mean anyone who published anything about the planned raid would be immediately prosecuted chapter twelve frank shirer wasnt happy about the mission it wasnt the danger it was the insult like being asked to drive the school bus after a bmw he was a fighter pilot born and bred he liked living on the edge of technology and had done so in the f tomcats there was nothing like the thrust of afterburner the twin turbofans rocketing you to mach slamming you back into the martinbaker and the feathery rush through your genitals it wasnt a thing you could explain to anyone who hadnt done it including lana brentwood with whom hed fallen in love while recovering from wounds at dutch harbor and whom he wanted to marry as soon as jay la roche her husband deigned to give her a divorce shirer knew more than he wanted to know about la roche mr smooth and successful on the outside inside a slimeball who rolled over people as though they were ants lana had left la roche tired of his sexual madness and had begun a new life for herself gone back to school finishing her nursing training and joining the waves winding up through la roches malevolent influence in congress being posted to the naval hospital in what was called americas siberia dutch harbor alaska off unalaska island in the aleutian chain where it could go from sunshine to full blizzard within half an hour the foul weather was mitigated however by her falling in love with shirer and then ratmanov happened when the small island the bigger of the two diomedes smack in the middle of the bering strait between alaska and siberia had to be taken by freemans paratroopers shirer had flown cas but close air support had got him downed his rio radar intercept officer captured by siberian spets one of whose interrogators had stabbed shirers left eye from sheer bloodymindedness and to make sure shirer never flew again but after ratmanov was taken by freemans sasd commandos frank was sent to dutch harbor where with the help of mr doolittle a streetwise cockney and fellow patient hed learned how to do what doolittle called an adolf galland galland who was the top luftwaffe air ace of world war ii had only one eye hed cheated the charts and shirer likewise passed the eye test but instead of being reassigned to fighter duty shirer now found himself driving a buff big ugly fat fellow the acronym for the wellworn b rumor had it that he might get a crack at being posted to a harrier squadron but it was only that a rumor besides he wasnt that enthused a harrier was small stuff next to a tomcat murphy his rear gunner wasnt happy about the mission either but in murphys case it was sheer unadulterated fright though he tried not to show it murphy for whom the there mention of china evoked childhood images of san franciscos chinatown mysterious smells and fearsome dragons shot through with weird music fervently wished the bs had had their turrets rigged for radar remote firing as they had been in the old days however with the news with a higher rate of fire but not yet successfully slaved to the turret the machine guns in the rear turret would have to be manned albeit with radar assist whenever possible at lakenheath in southeastern england bemoaning the awful weather that swept in from the channel was de rigueur among the b crews because it was the expected thing gunner murphy always joined in but secretly he couldnt think of anything better than bad weather so it might mean a rough ride especially over the european alps and the mountains of south central asia which included the himalayas but gray cloud socking them in would keep them out of visible sight and as a rear gunner despite all the advances in infrared starlite vision and radar murphy retained an oldfashioned belief that lack of visibility in the enemys territory was your best defense besides on the visual skyrange hed brought down many more drones with line of sight than with radar assist sometimes there were too many damn dials to watch instead of your sights his big worry of course was that the bad weather wouldnt hold in spring the stratus could suddenly clear revealing vistas of sky and earth that would be an antiaircraft batterys heaven to be on the safe side murphy went again to the lakenheath px and stocked up on the new and improved peptobismol tablets tearing open the cardboard packages and stuffing the cellophanewrapped pink tablets into every opening in his flying suit he could find he explained away the peptobismol on the basis of having some vague stomach condition undiagnosed by the doctors but due he was convinced to the service food the px quartermaster was shaking his head at the quantities of peptobismol that murphy was concealing about his person murph you fart up there the skyll turn pink dont be a smart ass you got any more christ youve got the last six packs youve bought enough for the whole damn flight what if we go down christ youre a happy fella arent ya cautious murph said tersely i like to cover my ass rear gunners motto right listen murph if you go down youre gonna need a hell of a lot more than peptobismol cheery son of a bit murphy began then suddenly stopped whend you hear about the mission the quartermaster shrugged yesterday i think scuttlebutt is your wings on call could be tomorrow could be next week right right cept you arent supposed to know they tell you the target nope well thats something murphy said and was gone when he got back to the ncos mess the buzz all over was that the mission had been scrapped oh shit murphy said as if he really meant it whats up politics someone said some labour congressman mp another cut in member of parliament they dont have congressmen yeah well some parliament jokers heard about the request to launch a flight from here in england and threatens to raise shit unless the labour shadow cabinet gets a chance to hash it over aw shoot murphy said really getting into the disappointed flier mode now that could mean weeks could mean never another rear gunner said aw shit murphy said shirer was ambivalent about the news on the one hand a cancellation might mean a bit of time to grab a c cargo flight over the pole to alaska to spend a few days leave with lana on the other he didnt like just sitting around waiting so what if the mission would mean driving a buff at least that was some kind of flying besides the longer it took for the politicos to make a decision to stop the labour party from going public the greater the danger that news of the exact target would leak out at the moment hopefully all that would leak was a request for a us air force overflight the target unspecified but if shirer was concerned about that the one thing he had to feel good about was that jay la roche was about to go on trial in the states for treasonable activityselling arms to china before the ceasefire many of the weapons having been used in the slaughter of freemans iii corps on lake baikal hed been out on bail ever since his arrest on the last night of the presidential moratorium an emergency powers act that had allowed police to arrest on due suspicion only and without having to mirandize or to release their prisoner if a charge had not been made although the moratorium was over there was speculation that it might be quickly reintroduced by the president if hostilities increased to combat any potential internal sabotage in the united states in any case la roche had been arrested twenty minutes before midnight midnight having been given by the president as the end of the moratorium and la roche had been flown from alaska for trial in manhattan the newspapers were full of it except la roches tabloid chains and frank was looking forward like many others to seeing la roche put away if la roche had been locked up for what hed already done against some of the underage boys and girls hed had picked up to perform oral sex on him as well as beating them up he would the in jail so far however his money and influence had thwarted any such charges but now they had him cold on the selling of weapons to the pla through his hong kong front men one of the hong kong chinese having spilled his guts in la roches words in return for not being prosecuted and being under the protection of the government witnesses program chapter thirteen the pave lows blades chopped the air its flirforwardlooking infrared sensor guiding it over the corrugations that on the radar were the ridges radiating out of the hentiyn nuruu mountains fifty miles northeast of ulan bator the helicopters vibrations could be felt in the bone aussie lewis and salvini were asleep aussie snoring so loudly that because of the paves relatively quiet rotors he could be heard by the others david brentwood and choir williams were reassured by their colleagues apparent cool but david had seen it often enough before something that civilians never believed how men going into harms way in this case flying over hostile territory about to land on a dangerous mission could manage to fall asleep but they did for like mountain climbers who were sometimes able to strap themselves to the pitons on a narrow ledge and take a nap their nervous energy had been exhausted by the meticulous preparation the adrenaline put in reserve as the body demanded rest before the final push david had seen sas and delta commandos catnapping with only a few minutes before the descent or the drop david shook the australian awake then salvini what time is it aussie asked oh four hundred hours david said dark as pitch no moon pilot must be sweating it aussie lewis began strapping on his gear haversack containing his mongolian herdsmans outfit two threeandahalfpound claymore mines ten topfeed mags of mm ammunition for the p a canteen of water six hand grenades folding spade and furled washing line satellite antenna they were still on radio silence and would remain so until they accomplished their mission andor were back at the insertion point should their mission have to be aborted a radio burst an sos giving their position condensed into a fraction of a second would be permitted plus any information on siberian troop movements into mongolia the latter often called the sixteenth soviet republic still had siberian advisers and their units along the railroad from ulan ude near lake baikal south to ulan bator the rail being a branch off the transsiberian the stony terrain being too risky for a landing at night the pave low would hover as brentwood salvini aussie lewis choir williams and jenghiz fastroped down with their heavy packs aussie lewis was putting on rubber gloves to prevent rope burn in preparation for the mission that would take them through the foothills and down to the pasturerich plain before ulan bator none of the men had been permitted to wash or shave for several days and the air in the chopper was as aussie lewis put it like a bloody parrot cage but better this than the smell of aftershave which could cost them their lives jenghiz swore that a plainsman could smell foreigners a mile off the cabins red glow gave way to an eerie green and the pave lows ramp opened the rope uncoiling fast like a huge snake frantically descending into the abyss jenghiz was the first to touch ground and the dusty smell of cold wind and of a few spring bushes that had flowered high in the hentiyn nuruu together with the rushing sound of water nearby flooded him with a nostalgia that brought tears to his eyes right david brentwood said as they all regrouped jenghiz lead the way okay roger jenghiz said cheerfully david had told him several times that the double affirmative wasnt necessary that either okay or roger would suffice but jenghiz would simply smile and still say okay roger chapter fourteen praporshnikor warrant officer petrov in charge of the sevenman spetsnaz commando team checked his gear an aks mm with noise suppressor front pouch magazines half a dozen rgd grenades and five f grenades an rr vhf transceiver a dozhd air mattress tenpower bn night binoculars gas mask canteen map case and mm makarov pistol finally he checked his mr throwing knife attached to his calf next he turned to his radio operator helping him to check his r highfrequency burst transmission radio ak mm makarov pistol and rpg antitank grenade launcher the third man in the sevenman spetsnaz commando team carried a svd sniper rifle along with cmdiameter contactfused pmn antipersonnel mines like the other six members he also carried one of the mon trip wire fragmentation mines that could destroy anything up to feet away and which were now being collected in the middle of the squad the mons would be used to square off the area where the transmitter had first indicated the american helicopter had stopped either by hovering or landing to let off the four sasd commandos whether or not the american chopper had actually touched down the spetsnaz couldnt be sure only that the transmitter had indicated the zone exactly it had all been easier to arrange than anybody at the glavnoye razvedyvatelnoye upravleniye gru or military intelligence quarters had had any right to expect the guide jenghiz was well known in khabarovsk for his knowledge of eastern mongolia and so his relatives in ulan bator were just as easy to trace he had been given a simple choice by the gru take the cigarettelightersize transmitter they gave him or well kill all your relatives praporshnik petrov joked how he wished hed been given the same chance to be rid of his motherinlaw the spets had been worried that because of the rugged mountainous area north of the capital the transmitter would at times be blinded by the natural terrain for a while this had happened but then theyd been in luck and picked it up again the sevenman spetsnaz squads orders were specific for the guide jenghiz did not know the purpose of the sas mission acting as guide only the spets had opted not to use their hind a helicopter to overfly the sasd group as this would only create a firefight and the purpose of the sasd mission might the with the firefight between spets and the sasd gru hq had ordered warrant officer petrov to take at least two of the sasd alive if not all of them petrov however and the six men in his squad agreed that the only way you were going to take an sasd man alive was to get him in his sleep overpower the guard and be onto him before he had a chance to know what was happening for this too a chopper was ruled out it could only be used at night but even then only when the sasd team was far enough away not to hear its approach the spets were not worried about the sasd getting out for when the american helo came back in two or three days or whenever it would set off the trip wire once it landed the resultant fusillade of fragmentation pieces from the mons explosions so deadly that the american helo would look like a sieve as the spets chopper carrying only two spets rose then banked to fly due north for ten miles toward the map reference that marked the sasd dropoff zone from which the transmitter was now moving and where the spets would plant the mines the other five spets spread out following petrov whose radio operator was locked onto the transmitter signal the sasd commandos would almost certainly stop to hide and rest just before dawn rather than risk being seen approaching the capital in daylight in this assumption the spets were not to be disappointed for by am when the first hint of dawn presented itself on the horizon david brentwood gave the order to wrap it up for the night and go to cover they selected a spill of autosize boulders scattered about the end of the escarpment there were several caves nearby in the foothills but the sasd avoided them a cave was marvelous for making you feel safe but if anything happened and you were discovered there was only one way out and this could easily be curtained off by enemy fire jenghiz and aussie first watch okay roger okay jenghiz said right aussie answered and positioned himself between two of the biggest boulders whose shadow easily hid him from the view of anyone on the plain he felt his right leg itching almost uncontrollably the horsehide mongol pants beneath the herdsmans smock had been chafing his shin and it took all his willpower not to scratch if necessary hed dump the horseskin trousers and put on his sasd camouflage trousers for the journey back but until they got there hed have to put up with it he glanced back at the snowmantled peaks of the hentiyn nuruu and men back south toward the pastureland plain before them that ran like a pale green apron down from the foothills toward the lonely capital of ulan bator now about forty miles away a twonight march should get them to the capital of half a million theyd been told by colonel norton at freemans hq that once in the capital they would be less likely to be stopped for it would be nighttime and there would be kazakhs khalkas chinese and russian mongolians all mixing and caring only about their own interests at first it was thought by norton that they would take freemans message his preventive medicine to the mongolian president at government house in sukhbaatar square a message that had been entrusted only to the four sasd men but this was dropped in favor of approaching him in the more public less defended pagoda temple now visited daily by the suddenly converted communist president should one of them meet any misadventure the other three would have it and each had been given the message in the majority kazakh tongue jenghiz had not been told as his job was merely to get them there and to translate if and when necessary again it wasnt that anyone mistrusted him but the sasd men had been following the old need to know rule david choir williams and salvini were already out of it dead to the world the six shenyang far northeast armies fortythree thousand men in each specifically the twentythird based in harbin the fortysixth from kirin the sixteenth from changchun and the three armies the thirtyninth fortieth and sixtyfourth from near shenyang city itself over a quarter million men in all were now moving en masse crossing the sungari and nen chiang rivers en route to the amur river hump but now instead of attacking their traditional enemy the siberians they were attacking the american second army and lin biaos famous dictum during the korean warso we lose a million or twowas being broadcast through loudspeakers all along the amur river crossings trying to terrify the us soldiers the us army countered by reminding their men of american technological superiority but to men who knew how the mightiest nation on earth theirs had been humbled by the north vietnamese army a much smaller army than that of the chinese the chinese broadcast had some success freeman gave an order for every piece of goddamn ice from here khabarovsk to manzhouli in far western manchuria to be blown out of the river he knew of course there wasnt enough tnt in second army or in the pacific convoys of resupply to blow up that much river ice but it got the message across the chinese had to be stopped at the river crossings and all bridges were to be blown as ice coagulated around the piers cas close air support was part of his strategy but only part of it as even the u s air force and carrier force in the sea of japan couldnt hope to lay down a bomb fence twentyfour hours a day particularly given the vicissitudes of the weather in these latitudes and over eighteen hundred miles of winding river of course the major crossing points known from the long siberianchinese hostility on the border might be taken out but cheng was known like freeman for not being tied to the orthodox battle plans of others he would make crossings wherever he willed freeman looked at the vast front on his wall map a front longer than the wehrmacht had faced in russia in a front along which the vast amur river became the argun further to the west still further west flowed the herlen river which came down from mongolias hentiyn nuruu the west mongolia freeman told norton his bifocals used as a pointer flashing in the quonset huts light here south of chita on the siberian side of the bordersouth of mangut across the border beyond the jumble of mountains on the siberianchinese border thats where we have to strike head south hit the bastard on his left flank push him back dick into the manchurian fastness keep him tied up there in the foothills on the mongolianchinese border while our main force drives south it seemed sound enough giving your opponent a straight left while your right outflanked him south norton too was gazing up at the huge wall map how far south general you mean far enough to push them well across the siberianchinese border the dmz south freeman said and norton felt a cold fear turn his bowels it was unthinkable congress would have a blue fit but then freeman had made a career of thinking the unthinkable and then doing it but general norton cautioned if you drive due south from mangut to get at chengs left flank youd have to pass through mongolian territory and if we dont well have to move east of mangut freeman retorted wed have to make a detour through chinese territory a detour of hundreds of miles with each m tank guzzling two gallons for every mile thats one hell of a detour norton but it is in chinese territory norton pointed out going straight south from mangut would mean taking a shortcut across mongolian he stopped for it was at that moment that he realized precisely why freeman had sent the sasd troop of four on their mission deep into mongolia the sasd troop as freemans envoys were to tell the mongolian president in ulan bator that it might be necessary for american troops to cross from mangut into china so as to hit the chinese deeper on their left flank go into the steppe country in the gobi desert tank country across which freemans echelons might race would freemans request for free passage be acceded to by the mongolians on the one hand the mongolians had a long and intense hatred of the chinese on the other they were still in fact if not in name largely dependent on the whims of siberia would novosibirsk go along with letting freeman take the shortcut across mongolian territory or had freeman told young david brentwood something else to tell the commander of the ulan bator forces was it to be as much a warning as a request let the americans pass through mongolian territory or else norton suspected it had been both the carrot and the stick suddenly norton saw it freemans real objective and the general sensed disbelief in the face of his aide listen colonel freeman told him i didnt come over here to dance his fist thumped beijing rattling the map only thing these jokers understand dick is defeat we dont get this dragon where it lives by the throat the son of a bitchll be hissing and spitting for another twenty years we lost china once in fortyeight goddamn it were not going to lose it again trouble with you dick is youre thinking like the rest of them monolithic china dont you see its just like we used to think of the soviet union now what do we have he answered his own question gesturing at the board north of the siberianchinese border thirteen new republics and theyre still counting chinas the same dick rotten at the center old farts hanging onto power for grim death like tortoises in their shell general they could lose a million men and still have twice as many men at arms as we do a tough shell ill agree to that dick damn tough but dick with a little ingenuity and determination we can do anything any excitement in norton had waned and now all he felt was a dull headache a little ingenuity general your southern strategy seems sound enough but how about all these chinese armies massing on the manchurian border along the amur what if they suddenly come west against your flank attack then my flank attack wouldnt work dick well sir we can hardly ignore them therere over five armies along that river he meant the amur hump weve got to keep them occupied freeman answered with what seemed calculated ingenuousness yes general but how our cas can only do so much and given the bad weather dick you have that wolf dung i told you to get lots of it general you know what theyre calling us here in khabarovsk what the shitheads freeman let forth a belly laugh that could be heard in his communications room shit stirrers dick thats what theyre going to call us stirrers yes sir but what if the ulan bator mission doesnt go smoothly why shouldnt it freeman demanded no one knows theyre there except us boys are well trained for exactly this kind of mission thrive on it their instructors were with special forces in iraq theyll be okay i hope youre right general and then there are those missiles we have to worry about ah i dont think well have any trouble with that either freeman responded confidently youre a good officer dick but you have to guard against being too pessimistic stop seeing the glass as half empty start seeing it half full sometimes the generals optimism frightened norton more than the chinese did the worst thing about it was that if something went truly wrong the general could be prone to a depression so dark that few realized how perilously close his pride rode to the abyss his depressions as intense in their way as his highs well at least the general was right about the sasd mission no one else knew about it but the four sasd troopers involved chapter fifteen london the republic of china or taiwan was a country worth cultivating if and when the labour party came to power the taiwanese would have to do business with the government and trevor brenson mp thought it might as well be with him besides there was no more excitement in living with his wife hed grown tired of her she spent all her time at womens rights rallies so much so that brenson wondered whether she was married to the feminist movement instead of him and when they did get to be together in bed she began telling him what to dothis way not that way youre too roughharderslower after a while it felt as if he were learning to drive and she was the instructor more and more he just wanted to swerve off the bloody road lin meiling however was different and she offered him a way out like his wife she was outspoken too but she had the oriental sense of place which in bed was to do what the man wanted anything to please besides at their rendezvous in a hampstead flat she never rushed it or talked politics and when shed finished with him he felt so deliciously drained so completely relaxed that hed already missed one shadow cabinet meeting because lin meiling had literally squeezed then sucked him dry and as he told her later he must have slept right through his alarm in fact lin meiling had turned off the alarm giving her ample time to go through his briefcase after they made love so far shed found nothing of note only some dry skulduggery against a conservative mp for having had personal use of government aircraft taking his family on a hop across to france they all did it of course and brenson had absolutely no doubt that hed be doing it when he got into power but he wouldnt be as damned silly as the tory and when he got to power he wouldnt tell lin meiling any more than he did now which was naught she could be a spy for either the roc or the prc whatever she could detect his mood the moment he walked into the flat and all she had to do was let him talk about the idiots and various assholes who were trying to run the government and how he could do it so much better here and there hed unconsciously drop a hint about what was going on but she never seemed interested the trick as lin meiling knew was patience and knowing that it was better sometimes to know someone in the shadow cabinet man the real cabinet itself for in order for the shadow cabinet to operate they had to know exactly what the government was up to there was some brouhaha at the moment something about the americans exactly what she didnt know but she remained patient knowing that in two or three days brenson would be so horny again that hed want her desperately it would give her another opportunity to flick through his files andor listen to his selfpitying frustrations about what a thankless job it was being a member of the queens loyal opposition chapter sixteen aussie lewis like salvini brentwood and choir williams had been well briefed in what to expect in the mountains northeast around ulan bator indeed hed been so well instructed that he was by now thoroughly disabused of the false notion held by most foreigners that mongolia was nothing but desert he knew that in its far west mountainous region there were lakes and streams and vegetation that reminded one of switzerland and that parts of the gobi desert that ran from southwestern mongolia east swinging up into manchuria werent all desert much of it was semidesert pastureland capable of sustaining great herds of sheep camels and wild horses that roamed about outnumbering the human population by fourteen to one the population density of the whole country being no more than three people per square mile because of his briefing on the flora and fauna of the oncemighty kingdom of genghis khan aussie lewis was not surprised to see ermine sable and squirrels in the mountains but because the briefing officer had not mentioned it he wasnt at all prepared for the two roe deer that jenghiz pointed out to him one of which in lewiss inelegant phrase upset the bloody applecart he glimpsed the deer only a moment before it descended between a smaller spill of the rocky outcrop and stood stock still its nose twitching in the hot spring sun before it bounded across the open area beyond the blind side of a large boulder that protected thensouthern exposure against a sudden sneak attack no it was jenghizs panicstricken voice from the other side of the huge boulder behind which he had suddenly flung himself in that split second aussie visualized the whole thing the deer must have hit the trip wire releasing the springloaded firing pin the claymore mine set up on its legs in dry grass so as to go off at chest height and so avoid any accidental trip by small animals he could hear its backblast hitting the protective boulders about their camp the claymores earstunning blast echoed throughout the foothills its eight hundred steel ball bearings screaming out at supersonic speed the equivalent of over eighty shotguns fired simultaneously deadly to anything within four hundred feet of the perimeter the deer was momentarily lost to view shrouded in clouds of gritty dust that looked like yellow smoke the sound continuing to roll down through the foothills and back up into the mountains in an instant brentwood and choir williams were awake salvini still openmouthed at their bad luck was staring at aussie holy david brentwood his eyes temporarily blinded by the dust particles staggered up dabbed his shirt tail with his canteen and wiped his eyes what the fucking deer aussie said mustve tripped the wire lets go brentwood ordered and within two minutes theyd broken camp each man carrying a cigarettepacksize gps geosynchronous positioning system his browning highpower mm pistol and pack salvini humping the radio all of them moved briskly despite their heavy packs and the unfamiliarity with their dels the anklelength silklined tunics of the mongolian herdsmen the echoes of the explosions alone alerted everything and everyone within miles to their presence ulan bator lay ten miles several hours ahead and it would be dark if and when they arrived there in the daylight they could be seen moving in the direction of the capital jenghiz however aussie noticed looked strangely elated it was almost as if the explosion had been received by him as a good omen or perhaps his brighteyed expression was nothing more than a sudden surge of fear five miles behind the spets praporshnik was hurrying his men from their position and cursing his luck now the sasd team would know that someone would come to investigate the explosion and so they would be doubly vigilant but then he slowed his pace the small avalanche of rocks he was starting slowing to a trickle as another realization swept over him namely that perhaps part or all of their equipment had accidentally exploded and wiped out the sasd troop ending whatever mission they had been on nevertheless he resumed his steady gait the seven spets hurrying down beneath the ridge line of one of the foothills whatever the situation he had to make sure and in any case there was still no reason for the enemy commandos to expect anyone so close on their heels if anything the sasd team would probably expect a mongolianforces helicopter to investigate the explosion and for a moment he was tempted to call the hind now returning from setting the mine trap at the enemys insertion point and have it sent south but then he decided against it the absence of a helo would give the americans a false sense of security just what he needed to catch up to them speshi hurry up we want to be close to them by dark before they get into ulan bator lin meiling loved the storms in england some of her fellow guo an bu agents who like her also used the jobs at the taiwanese consulate as the perfect cover for their prc activities complained unendingly about the weather about the everchanging skies governed so much by the english channel and why the english channel they asked why not the french the dutch or european channel but lin meiling cherished the eccentricity and the vicissitudes of england though in the larger sense she detested its political system the party had given lin meiling everything including her university education in marxismleninism and her unshakable belief in communism despite the vicious attacks from the runningdog lackeys in the commonwealth of independent states once these had been a brotherly union of socialist soviet republics now long betrayed by gorbachev and yeltsin and the others delivered up to the altar of western capitalism oh theythe west had tried to topple the party too through the agents provocateurs in the tiananmen square incident of when the goddess of democracy was paraded by the degenerate counterrevolutionaries down changan avenue well the party had flexed its muscle and shown who ran china after all it was flexing its muscle now against the criminal freeman and his gang and the party would flex it against any lackeys in england who dared to undo the work begun by the great helmsman chairman mao one could see the chaos created in england by the capitalists the problem was too much freedom the english and american disease that so affected the young it even affected trevor brenson who called himself a leftist the british labour party was about as leftist as a tibetan monk they had no fiber no toughness to clamp down on the religionist disease on the freethought disease of degenerate democracy selfindulgence was what they wanted trevor brenson the labour partys muchtouted shadow defence minister still claimed he was socialist said he greatly respected mao and yet in the bedroom his religion too was selfindulgence the party had warned lin meiling of what might be required of her to extract information from such a man as brenson who despite his labour party protestations of brotherhood with the workers was at heart a capitalist lackey a woman to a capitalist was merely another thing a plaything and trevor brenson liked to play disgusting games games that lin meiling was sure the great leaders of the party in beijing would never indulge in to have sex with brenson it was necessary to remind herself that she was doing it for the party and greater socialism if she could find out from brenson what the americans were up to in this war then she could do the party a great service and no matter her personal sacrifice he was late this evening and had rung to say he would not be back at the flat till ten liar he pretended he was hard at work in the shadow cabinet when he was no doubt seeing his wife the other thing he used from time to time meiling undid the box he had sent her from harrods the great socialist store no doubt she brushed aside the soft rustling tissue wrapping as thin as rice paper and saw a scarlet bustier and matching scarlet lace panties he had signed the card to m love t careful as usual not to use his full name and to write in a hand distinctly unlike that which he usually used in the event that she might accidentally leave the card around the flat no doubt the peoples store had thought he was buying the lingerie for his wife and he would have been sure to pay in cash no credit card traceable should he be under surveillance by the tories or mi she shrugged off her status as one of his two women or did he have more as easily as she crushed the tissue paper into a tight ball pushing it into the recycling bag he was very big on recycling well lin meiling determined that when she got what she wanted she would recycle him it was ten after nine when he walked in at ten he smelled roses and saw her sitting legs drawn up seductively on the sofa beneath a low soft lamp that turned the scarlet bustier and panties blood red her long black hair combed forward draped over the bustier like a tantalizing curtain beside her she had a tall drink her fingers trailing up and down the frosted glass her lips parting for a moment over the cherry sucking it caressing it with her tongue he dropped the briefcase and all but tore off his rainsplattered mackintosh walking toward her unzipping himself as he approached no she said and turned away please he urged she shook her head like a petulant child rolling the cherry between her lips her hair a black sheen whipping back and forth over her breasts ill go crazy he said she shook her head again youre too cold what youre too her hand closed over his erection and squeezed youre too cold christ ill ill warm up ill take a shower all right she smiled when she heard the torrential downpour and saw steam emerging from beneath the bathroom door she got up from the sofa and kneeling on the carpet one eye on the bathroom she went quickly through his briefcase chapter seventeen the first visible signs of ulan bator were its six high smoke stacks unlike the ghers the round canvasskinned huts of the mongolians that were kept warm by burning camel dung the capital was heated by more modern methods including coal and a nuclear power plant the four sasd troops and jenghiz paused to hide their packs only salvini allowed to take the small but powerful radio under his del along with his browning mm they had a short rest and checked their flatfolding pvss or nightvision goggles before beginning what they hoped would be the final tenmile leg of their hike to ulan bator and to the capitals gandan monastery since perestroika and glasnost part of the mongolians determination to make their country their own was their determination to allow more religious freedom though even in this mongolia aped soviet example the communists like those in beijing still hated religion for two reasons not only did religion pose an alternative to the only way the party way but in mongolia it had encouraged males to take holy orders in the lama monasteries over seventy of them and because the monks were required to be celibate this had led to a drastic fall in population the mongolian hordes who under genghis khan had ruled all china and whose kingdom had included much of europe were now reduced to no more than million in the entire country a country twice as big as texas freeman believed that this fact alone would play a decisive part in the secret request the sasd troop was entrusted with though thoroughly atheistic the mongolian president since glasnost had made a practice each evening of going from the great hural the peoples national assembly to the gandan monastery to pray by either prostrating himself before the buddha or spinning a prayer wheel on the gandan wall it was unlikely freeman believed that the president with such a small population would refuse to let the american second army have free transit across its territory into china but freeman held it as an article of his faith that the difference between doing it and asking to do it first marked a profound difference between totalitarianism and democracy and for this hed been willing to dispatch the four sasd men to see the president there was always the danger of course that the mongolians could inform the siberians of the american intention but it was a chance freeman was prepared to take in the belief that the mongolian president would be loath to put himself in a squeeze between freemans second army and marshal yesovs army which so far at least was abiding by the ceasefire the absence of any helos in the sky was taken by david brentwoods troop as a good sign and as jenghiz led them through the silken dust on the outskirts of the flat ulan bator the pale green foothills of the hentiyn nuruu took on a peaceful deeper mauvish hue beneath a darkening royalblue sky that reminded david of the grasslands of the big sky country in montana it was so peaceful that he was now viewing the accident with the trip wire as a blessing in disguise for it had forced them to take the risk of a daylight hike out in the open over the protruding fingers of the foothills down to the plain a journey they would not have otherwise attempted till nightfall it meant that they were now well ahead of schedule and brentwood thought of freemans quoting the ancient chinese warrior sun tzu that an army is like water that it must adapt itself to the terrain and circumstance it was exactly what the sasd team was doing using the explosion of the claymore not as an impediment that had set plans awry but as a new opportunity brentwood fought the temptation to be pleased with himself but freemans directive to approach the mongolian president at the monastery in the evening fit in perfectly if nothing happened to stop them they should reach it within a few hours with jenghiz leading the way across the vast sukhbaatar square in the center of the city toward the gadan chapter eighteen chinese divisions continued to mass across the amur and with the weather clearing though for how long no one knew it seemed that only the threat of close air attack by the us air force particularly the presence of ac spectre gunships firing their deadly sevenbarreled vulcan machine guns and mm howitzers had stemmed crossings by the chinese troops but while the awesome power of the gunships was part of the reason for a pause in the chinese advance there was a much more pressing cause chinese officers were reporting deficiencies in the small arms supplied to the northern armies dozens of men having been seriously wounded some having lost limbs andor been killed when grenades exploded as soon as the pin was pulled others having weapons exploding in their faces under such conditions of substandard equipment an advance was deemed unadvisable by general cheng and an investigation promptly launched at first it was suspected that la roche industries had wilfully furnished defective munitions that is until several grenade fragments were collected and sent to harbin for closer forensic inspection cheng doubted that la roche already in trouble in the us suspected of supplying arms to certain countries against congressional edict would be likely to jeopardize his lucrative multibillion underthetable arms business by shipping poorquality arms and ammunition to his prime customer confirmation that cheng was right came when scientists rushed up from turpans first artillery regiment the name the pla gave to its missile contingent determined that while serial numbers made it clear that the defective grenades had indeed been american made they were not from any of the la roche batches further investigation along the amur revealed that the arms in question had been among those stolen from american soldiers in brothels along the river towns of the dmz cheng immediately ordered all such arms and ammunition destroyed but by now they were mixed up with standard issue and the testing was a hazardous painstaking and extremely timeconsuming business as in order to find a single round that had been tampered with every round had to be examined carefully the incident told cheng and freeman something important about each other cheng learned that the american generals muchtouted attention to detail was as great as it was reputed to be while freemans intelligence services fed the information by underground democracy movement agents like the jewish woman alexsandra malof learned that cheng was not as cavalier as say lin biao had been in the korean war about sacrificing the lives of his men if he could avoid it in fact cheng would rather pause even though it gave second army time to reinforce the crossing points and make sure everything was in order before he would strike of course it also gave cheng more time to reinforce his side of the river chapter nineteen it was pm jay la roche and his guards were met by a barrage of cameras and microphones as he made his way up the steps of new yorks central criminal court building his head held high looking sneeringly at the blind statue of justice as though confident that nothing could touch him it took only minutes for the charges to be read and less time for la roches lawyer to get him off scotfree the reason stunningly simple jay la roche had been arrested under the emergency powers act which ended at midnight washington time on the day of his arrest and under which a suspect could be arrested without being mirandized but having been arrested at pm alaskan time meant that he had in fact been arrested at am washington time that is three hours and forty minutes after the washington deadline thus rendering his arrest technically invalid as he had not been mirandized that is jay la roche had been arrested and not advised of his rights under a law that no longer was in force it was pandemonium in the courtroom and even more flashbulbs and tv crews crowding the corridors than had been on the steps when la roche had entered the building as he exited a free man he walked down the steps of the courthouse unhurriedly pausing halfway so that his picture in his own tabloid would show him released beneath blindfolded justice who had shown impartiality under the law he made a grave face about how he was of course innocent of the charges of trading with the enemy and he would have much preferred to have been cleared on other evidence but that in the present political climate during wartime he doubted that he could have received a fair trial lana still in shock called frank shirer and as it was pm in dutch harbor when she made the call she woke him up at at lakenheath all air crews having already turned in while waiting for a decision to come down as to whether or not they would be going on the china mission set free he asked lana yes absolutely i dont believe it frank said and then made a remark about lawyers that all but turned lanas face red with embarrassment i know she agreed i cant believe it either she sighed it was part pain part resignation i suppose we were all naive in thinking theyd get him the rich get richer and the poor the bastard shirer cut in his tone one of bitter resentment it meant more than la roche was free again it meant that the divorce lana had longed for a divorce that would have been much easier to get if hed been convicted was now as far off as ever ii dont know what to say frank i he could tell she was crying in the dutch harbor hospital shed seen some of the worst injuries of the war melted skin where once thered been a mans face a mangled stump of splintered bone and flesh that had once been a limb and the smells the vinegary stink of fear the eyewatering stench of pusfilled gangrene with all this she could cope but the trapped feeling of being sealed in a marriage gone sour with no release in sight was too much hang on honey frank told her lamely well beat it lana yes she replied but it was so desolate a response that he felt it in his gut and was left too with that desolate feeling that only a telephone can give in its awful illusion of nearness shattered by the reality of being so far apart the feeling that teased you into thinking you could do something against the cold reality of knowing you could do nothing in his pain he selfishly wished that she hadnt called when he went back to his bunk he couldnt sleep the thought of her thousands of miles away in the windblown loneliness of dutch harbor a speck in the vast darkness of the world brought tears to his eyes and with them the animal urge to be with her to feel her warmth to give her his to be in her to possess her so that he tossed and turned nothing but the low moan of a channel storm blowing about the eaves of the quonset hut for company and the gray dawn creeping chapter twenty aussie lewis didnt think the day would ever come when hed be happy to see a siberian but now in the gathering purple dusk the presence of other caucasian faces no doubt siberian advisers and the like afforded brentwoods group added protection as they lost themselves in the crowds milling about the temple long shafts of golden moonlight shone through the pillars the beams getting thinner and thinner as the moon passed in a golden wafer through cloud at the entrance to the temple several pilgrims were prostrate while in the temple itself others moved so silently that all that could be heard was the wind sweeping down from the hentiyn nuruu the shuffle of feet and the soft whir of prayer wheels whose spokes containing the little paper messages that the buddhists believed would find their way to heaven spun about like small merrygorounds the notorious mongolian cold was already seeping up from the ground like dry ice the change dramatic and particularly uncomfortable for salvini who had worked up a sweat during the long hike dressed in his del the only firearm he like the others carried into the city was his mm browning and it was irritating his skin beneath the silklined tunic soon the official presidential party arrived the presidents entrance to the holy place as lowkey as theyd been briefed it would be now everything depended on jenghiz handing the president freemans sealed note the same size as those that were inserted in the prayer wheels requesting free passage for the american troops in the hostilities against china if anything went awry david brentwood knew that even with the mms hidden under their dels it would be dicey as aussie was wont to say as jenghiz in a silent respectful attitude of prayer made his way closer to the president the latter acting as yet another pilgrim with no special prestige within the temple bowed his head to the buddha in respect one of the bodyguards cast an eye over the crowd in the darkened temple its candlelight casting huge flickering shadows on the monasterys temple walls the four sas men moved into the throng of worshippers trying to form a rough protective semicircle around jenghiz as he faced the buddha aussie lewis said a prayer of his own that there would be no fighting in the holy place the buddhists subscribed to the theory of nonviolence but he knew the presidential guard wouldnt it was then however that aussie felt strangely uncomfortable was it that the claymore explosion aside everything had gone so smoothly too smoothly almost that there was an air of unreality about it all as if they were somehow going through the wellrehearsed motions of a play written by someone else perhaps he thought it was the relative silence of the monastery itself and the almost ethereal sight of the saffronrobed monks some with small scarlet skullcaps on their heads the whole atmosphere added to by the thick aroma of incense in the air it had been only seconds since jenghiz had pressed the piece of prayer paper into the presidents hand but now jenghiz having said his prayer was talking to one of the bodyguards at the same moment david brentwood saw a white face near a candles flame then caught a glimpse of spets military fatigues beneath it and yelled abort into the darkness in that instant aussie saw jenghizs hand shoot out toward him and aussie fired through his del an explosion of orange silk dark in the dim light filling the air jenghiz hit twice falling dead and the crowd into which the sas men turned now surging in panic all trying to head for the exits there were shouts from the siberians a burst of jagged red fire over the crowds heads but to no avail the crowd moving even more frantically now surging through the temples entrance passing around the spets commandos in a dark river of dels and fur caps a roar coming from the street as the panic spread like an instant contagion each of the four sasd team members was now on his own separated from each other by the mob and being carried along by it past the incongruous sight of animals that one moment had been wandering in grazing peacefully around the square now in stampede each sasd man knowing that jenghiz had betrayed them each of them had to assume that their insertion point and therefore extraction point was known realizing they would now have to revert to the emergency extraction plan the latter called for them to rendezvous sixteen miles southwest of ulan bator just north of nalayh the actual eep or emergency extraction point at longitude degrees minutes east latitude degrees minutes north in a valley between two mountains one to the north seven thousand feet high the other to the south five thousand feet with each man carrying a handheld calculatorsize gps none of them had any doubt about finding the place the gps could get you within fifty feet of a grid reference the problem was would they get there alive and if they got there would they get there in time their window or time frame was thirty hours it was far too deep in enemy territory for a helo pickup and so it would have to be a fighterprotected star surface to air recovery pickup if they werent picked up first by the spets seen at the monastery it was only then that aussie realized that it hadnt been a deer tripping the wire at all it had been jenghiz all hed needed was a piece of string the resulting explosion no doubt pinpointing their position whereas a transmitter would have been boxed in by the boulders but right then neither lewis salvini choir williams nor david brentwood was burning with the rage of betrayal survival being first and foremost in their minds chapter twentyone england meiling hadnt found anything in the briefcase of any interest except a xeroxed sheet notifying brenson of a shadow cabinet meeting on the china question the problem was what china question was it confirmation of one of beijings biggest fears the possibility of a taiwanese invasion on its east flank while the americans invaded manchuria the pla with over four million in arms counting the reservists could more than cope with two fronts could in fact turn them into victory but its achilles heel was what foreign businessmen like jay la roche had euphemistically called its internal distribution system by which they meant a bad road system one that was prey to monsoons much more than to enemy action in short the difficulty for beijing was transporting troops quickly from one part of china to another before the ceasefire the doubledecker roadrail bridge across the threemilewide yangtze at nanking had been hit by some of freemans commandos seals and the result was a catastrophic bottleneck on the southern shore of the yangtze that had extended as far south as wuhan it had been the biggest single factor forcing cheng to sue for a ceasefire now the bridge was repaired and the waters about it thoroughly mined patrolled by chinese frogmen the bridge itself ringed by a thicket of aa missile batteries and by two squadrons of sovietbuilt mig fulcrums but this kind of protection could not extend to all of the convoys rail links and taking heart from the resumption of the hostilities between the american un line and china the underground democracy movement was increasing its sabotage cheng needed to know how deep they had infiltrated the party structure and what else they were planning to sabotage should the opportunity present itself it was particularly important that his agent in london find out what it was about the china theater of operations that was preoccupying the british political parties oh of course he told his comrades it would most probably be an air attack if the british were involved a european overflight perhaps which would mean the attack would come from the west but where along the thousands of miles to the west or perhaps it was to be a flight further north to sever the transsiberian that forked off at ulan ude to become the transmongolian to bomb it hoping to thwart any siberian assistance from the north but railways were notoriously difficult to keep out of action for long by air attacks fake rails and quick mending by ground crew could make it a losing proposition for the enemy it might of course be an air attack on the missile complex at turpan but cheng had to be sure if he had to move fighters west away from the east coast this would weaken his coastal defenses once again he was struck by the fact that you could have all the satrecon reports have all the experts and all the computer enhancements you liked but there were times when there was no substitute for a beautiful woman who was prepared to go to bed with the enemy especially the ones like lin meiling who enjoyed it she pretended of course that she was not promiscuous and this only made the men more anxious to conquer her cheng sent a message to london that meiling was to find out precisely what the chinese question was and to this end she must do whatever was necessary this time as brenson was having a shower meiling drew the translucent shower curtain aside brensons naked body was steaming filling me bathroom with a dense fog are you finished she said slowly disappointedly already im in a hurry he replied grinning flicking the towel behind him ready to dry his back you sure youre clean she asked him cheekily she had the cake of soap in her hands and caressed it and squeezed it producing a ring of suds around her forefinger and thumb you need someone to wash you she said smiling demurely she got into the tub and pushing herself into him began massaging his buttocks kissing his chest sucking on him before her soapy hands slid between his buttocks pulling him even closer against her damp scarlet lace panties undo me she whispered and in a second the scarlet bra fell to the side of the tub her breasts rising pressinglunging forward arent you going to turn the water on she inquired what oh yes of course oh meiling you dont know how much shh she whispered and now a gossamer spray of warm water cascaded over them washing away the soap as one arm about her brenson slid down licked her and with the other arm pulled the suction rubber that down from the side of the bath dont want to break our necks he said or something else she giggled oh lord meiling suddenly she stepped out of the tub jerked the long fluffy towel off the bar and wrapped it about her prancing out to the living room her panties still about her thighs where hed pulled them down in eager anticipation what the hell are you doing teasing she shot back giggling pulling her panties up so high they seemed to be cutting into her why you little slut he yelled boyishly wait till i get you have to catch me first she was glad to see him fully aroused at his most vulnerable she would ask him there was no time he took her hard and fast and rolled off her satiated and silent chapter twentytwo when the cis commonwealth of independent states or what used to be the soviet union was desperately short of cash in it sold a twentyfourplane squadron of mikoyan gurevich mig fulcrum jet fighters to the german luftwaffe the germans americans and others had seen the highly rated soviet counterair fighter performing at air shows with its computercontrolled maneuvering flaps and the canton lever structure of its twinfinned tail unit demonstrating its agility but until now the west had never had a fulcrum really to put through its paces and all of the experts knew that airshow flying was one thing air combat something else the fulcrum had demonstrated its ability for example to go into a tailslide climb a characteristic underscored in the hammerhead stalltailslide maneuver the aircraft was able to accomplish at a relatively low altitude of feet losing itself on radar in the nearvertical hover position but how dazzling would it be when put through the tight gutwrenching maneuvers dictated by a dogfight against say an f tomcat the first upclose inspection of the fulcrum by western experts didnt look that promising the german engineers sent from messerschmitt kicked the tires and felt the planes skin and were frankly disdainful one of them from frankfurt contemptuously called the skin rice krispies the planes bumpy surface compared with the smooth surfaces produced for the american fighters being the result of inferior rolling of the metal then the luftwaffe pilots took the fulcrum up and were ecstatic some claimed the mig was the best fighter ever built at mach or miles per hour the plane which could pull eleven gs as opposed to an american nine was a relatively small fighter it was only feet inches from wingtip to wingtip and feet long as opposed to the american tomcats feet inch width and length of feet the planes box intake engines pushed the fulcrum faster not only than the tomcat but also the f falcon and f hornet and it had a faster rate of climb than the hornet only the f eagle could match its speed but even then the fulcrum was so good in its double s turns loops its flipup midflight attack and its spectacular dives on afterburner its pilot equipped with an amazingly simple and cheap infrared lookshoot system that the luftwaffe quickly incorporated the fulcrum squadron into its air force and then the habitually skeptical engineers made the most intriguing discovery of all namely that the inferior bumpy skin afforded the aircraft substantially more lift than the smoother bettermilled skin of its allied counterparts its two serious weaknesses were a comparatively small fuel capacity giving it a maximum inair time of only two hours without external tanks which would have made it heavier and like all cismade fighters it had been built to be directed by ground control and could take only one target on at a time if ground control went out then the fulcrum was effectively out as opposed to the allied pilots who fought largely independently of ground control this factor notwithstanding the speed and sheer agility of the fulcrum made it a superb aircraft and china through the timely purchases of general cheng congratulated itself on gaining fifty of the aircraft from the cis all fifty planes stationed on airfields throughout the populous eastern half of the country one of the siberian instructors who had come to china with the fifty aircraft was sergei marchenko the renowned air ace who had downed over seventeen us fighters among them frank shirers f tomcat shirer had returned the compliment over korea but like him marchenko had managed to bail out to live and fight another day shirer doubted he would ever get the chance to go up against marchenko again even the talk of him possibly being given a try on the harrier in britain was no real consolation oh the harrier was a fighter all right but with a maximum speed of only miles per hour mach not much faster than some commercial airliners it was hardly a promotion to topoftheline if flying bs was like driving a bus after the thrill of a bmw then a harrier was like getting a station wagon to drive after having handled a formula one racer it would be a step up of sorts from the bombers perhaps but the harrier was so damn slow compared to the tomcat and besides he knew he was being asked only because of the shortage of harrier pilots most of them having graduated upward to the falcons and hornets sergei marchenkos reputation in siberia as the ubiytsa yanki yankee killerace came with him though in beijing he was called the cat man the man of many lives whatever he was called he was held in awe for despite the fact that he was a longnose a caucasian the chinese pilots knew they had a lot to learn from his experience and even if he was aloof and sometimes distant toward his pla hosts his ability to take the fulcrum into a hammerhead stallslide to go into a near vertical climb reduce the thrust of the twin pound augmented bypass turbojets and then let the plane slide earthward all under feet was legendary and when the chinese saw how this maneuver could play havoc with enemy radar which because of the lack of relative speed momentarily lost the fulcrum from its screen marchenkos skill was greeted with gasps of admiration politically speaking marchenko a russian son of the onetime stavka or high command member kiril marchenko in moscow had no particularly strong beliefs one way or the other about the chinese the siberians or the americans for that matter but he was a russian proud of it and like shirer all he cared about was flying if this involved killing americans so be it all he wanted to do was to maintain his reputation as the top ace and he was somewhat chagrined by the fact that unless the americans crossed the manchurian border in significant numbers of aircraft it didnt seem as if hed be doing any more than training chinese pilots as part of the fiftyplane deal chapter twentythree the fact that their journey to ulan bator had been on one of the nights of the baraany zahthe weekly threeday openair market meant it had been easier for the sasd four to escape the indeterminate boundaries of the flat city where the round pointedroofed canvasandfelt tent houses or ghers inhabited by the mongolian herdsmen stood next to modern buildings the culture of the plains meeting but not yet quite intermingling with that of the city as aussie lewis quickly made his way past the new mongolian stock exchange building on sukhbaatar square he saw there were not as many mongolian regulars roaring by in trucks as there were siberians it was stark enough evidence of freemans view that the mongolians were caught in a squeeze between the han chinese to the south whom they detested and the siberians whom they were more fond of but not friendly enough toward to want to be dragged into a war by proxy because of them even so the political views of the soldiers hunting you aussie knew didnt make any difference a bullet from a siberian ak could kill you as easily as a bullet from the older mongolian ak his adrenaline up lewis didnt notice the cold until he was well beyond the citys limits the khaki color of his bluesilklined del making him invisible against the dark foothills of the hentiyn nuruu by avoiding the main roads such as they were one leading south to saynshand and china and the other east to choybalsan lewis followed the course of the tuul river for a few miles south then headed due east figuring that by skirting the base of the sixthousandfoot mountain he could be at the rendezvous point between it and the higher mountain to the north within the thirtyhour deadline all his senses were heightened more intense and he could smell the sweet spring grass and feel the cold that was now invading the warm wrap of the del and as it had done with salvini was turning his perspiration to ice he slowed the pace and got his second wind he heard a truck coming in his direction about a mile behind him on the rolling grassland of the foothills much of them still crusted here and there with patches of snow often drivers on the steppes didnt bother about a road as such the land being so amenable to vehicular traffic even in the stonier southern regions of the gobi that a driver providing he had a good compass andor good sense of direction could easily make his own road in doing so he scarred the topsoil for decades the earth was so porous the hold of the grass so tenuous that once driven over it took decades to heal the truck its headlights two dim orange blobs was off to his left following the course of the river probably heading for some gher settlement of a few nomadic herder families often herders were told when and where to move to better pastures by the party whether they liked it or not suddenly something moved in front of him his hand dove for the mm but in a vibrant moonlight he saw it was a tarbagan a marmotlike animal scuttling down toward the river it was then he heard the feint but distinctive wokkawokka of a helo coming eastward from the city he scanned the sky for any sign of a choppers searchlights but in the cloudless black velvet sky of mongolia where stars were so clear that they seemed to spangle just above his head he could see nothing he heard the helicopter sound the away and felt reassured by the feet that the sasds greatest weapon was that they were moving south from the city to escape before turning east it was the exact opposite of the direction someone heading out of the city would take if he wanted to head back toward the hentiyn nuruu closer to the siberianmongolian border all logic would tell the spets to head north into the mountains to where the sasd had been inserted and not to head south away from the siberianmongolian border there was only one hitch however to the fallback extraction point east of the city jenghiz had been given it too after hed handed the message prayer to the president had he betrayed the extraction point or had he only had time to say a few words as hed fingered aussie lewis and the other three sasd troopers before aussie had shot him dead if aussie was a betting man and he indubitably was then he would say jenghiz hadnt had a chance to say anything else but the thing that made gambling gambling was that you could never be sure the outside chance was always lying in wait for you would the spets be waiting if jenghiz had talked though aussie would still bet dollars to donuts that he hadnt aussie salvini brentwood and choir williams would be hurrying into a trap which might explain the present lack of local activity the spets wouldnt want to give their hand away on the other hand there might be no local activity because jenghiz hadnt a chance to say much else in ulan bator the president was still badly shaken this business at the temple he nervously joked with his advisers is what becomes of converting from the party to buddhism you go to the temples and you get killed they all laughed at the irony of their chief who like so many others in the communist world had suddenly become a religious convert after perestroika and glasnost on a more serious note the aides pointed out that if the sasd men had wanted to kill him he would have been dead they shot the man jenghiz because he betrayed them mr president yes the president conceded you are right comrade i was not the target have you shown the siberians your request from the american general no the aides understood the presidents wisdom in this if they gave it to marshal yesovs hq the siberians would want to move even more siberian divisions into mongolia but we have to give novosibirsk something another aide put in there were spets in the temple they saw the guide hand you the prayer strip you cannot tell them it contained nothing they wont believe you and their suspicion could do more damage to us than yes yes youre quite right comrade the president agreed at once full of gratitude more than he could explain for the comfort and attendance of his friends after the fright hed got in the temple he asked the aide to look at the paper again at the american generals request for free passage of american troops across eastern mongolia should it become necessary the american general had clearly meant the message to be seen only by the president but the guide jenghiz had added something else at the end of the prayer there was another sentence save my family followed by seven numbers what are these the president asked his aide coordinates i believe mr president map references the president had a moment of inspiration should we give these to novosibirsk tell them it was an assassination party against me and this is the enemys escape plan the aides nodded they liked the idea there was a danger of course that if captured the sasd men would be tortured and confess freemans request but the chief aide said that this was highly unlikely now that the sasd and spets group were on the lookout for one another there would be no prisoners if they met yes the president said brightening with me prospect yes give the siberians the coordinates let them think the sas was on an assassination mission tell them the bullet was meant for me instead whether they believe it or not theyll settle for an sasd troop yesov can do what he likes with them the aide tore off the coordinates and gave them to a messenger have these radioed to novosibirsk immediate novosibirsk bounced the encoded signal off satellite and within minutes the spets squad was enplaning a kamov helixb chopper armed with a fourbarrel rotary mm gun behind a starboard articulated door and an array of antitank spiral radioguided missiles and two mm rocket packs on four pylon hard points the helix would take them to nalayh the extraction point for the sasd troop no more than five miles north of nalayh townships center but even with the helixb the praporshnik and his sixman team knew theyd have to hurry for the sasd was as well trained as they were they knew that for a member of the sas to be badged with the highly coveted special air services beige beret with its cloth insignia of a bluewinged white dagger on a black shield the sas recruit had to go through a grueling regimen with everything from crosscountry marches with full packs to the halo high altitude low opening drop with oxygen mask and full gear the sasd commando requirement for an inhouse assault was that a man armed with a submachine gun must be able to burst into an embassy or enemy hq and mortally wound three opponents using only one magazine from as far away as thirty feet as with the spets no more than three shots were allowed on target and in sas closequarter battle every sas man no matter what his previous incarnation artillery engineering catering corps or infantry had to be able to achieve minimum kill taking out four men from a distance of sixty feet with no more than thirteen rounds of mm from his browning pistol if he had to go to a second clip he was disqualified only after theyd finished their course in the black mountains on the welshenglish border where the sas sabre combat groups were trained eighty men in a squadron would they be allowed to graduate with the coveted insignia who dares wins the spets leader had studied the sas minutely he knew also of their tremendous esprit de corps how hard they trained to beat the clock for when sas men were killed in action the regimental tradition called for their names to be carved on the clock at hereford hq since over had died in action not a lot compared to the casualty list of regular army line units but for a small elite unit like the sas it was heavy enough and among those had been twentyone american dead from us special forces who had served with and helped train the sas in field medicine and lit language immersion techniques hurry the praporshnik told his sixman squad aboard a boeing ea sentry awac airborne warning and control aircraft the thirtyfootdiameter rotodome picked up the green blip of the helixb chopper rising from the vicinity of ulan bator and given that this was during the time slot allocated for the sasd mission into ulan bator the awac crew automatically notified freemans hq of its presence but there was nothing more that freeman whod retired for the night or colonel norton whod received the introuble burst transmission from the sasd group could do at this juncture the drill was straightforward if something had gone wrong the radio burst transmission from the sasd troop would indicate this and they would have to rendezvous at the backup position near nalayh an mc combat talon aircraft with fighter cover would be dispatched for a quick star extraction such an extraction norton knew as did everyone else whod tried it was highly dangerous but first the sasd team had to reach the emergency extraction point norton wish though he might could do nothing they were on their own unfortunately this wasnt nortons only worry even if the sasd team had got the message through to the mongolian president any american drive south in the coming days would be in high jeopardy so long as the chinese could use their imf missiles which israeli intelligence had confirmed were in the turpan depression in western sinkiang meanwhile all norton could do was tell second armys logistics officers in the usheld siberian zone to get ready with as much matériel as was needed at railheads south of ulan ude and chita which would be the main supply hubs for any southward drive of freemans meanwhile satrecon showed the chinese still massing troops on the border between their inner mongolia and mongolia proper as if rushing to form a reverseseven defense troops on the top of the reverse seven in its northern sector protected the manchuriansiberian border along the black dragon or amur those units constituting the vertical section of the reverse seven forming the plas left flank norton could only hope that the new whiz kid general jorgenson a brilliant fortyfiveyearold flown out from the states to take over as chief logistics officer after the previous one had died in the action around poyarkovo knew what he was doing jorgenson had been selected because of his experience in the iraqi war even so norton knew that given the distances and varied terrain here it would take more than logistical brilliance to sustain an american counterattack either to the south or against the chinese northern or left flank while general cheng was taking care not to move his troops before the chaotic smallarms mess was sorted out at the front he had used the time to bring up ten companies of selfpropelled mm howitzers mounted on sovietstyle m amphibious fighting vehicles twenty companies of zil launcher vehicles carrying sixteen mm rockets apiece with sidemounted reloads and three hundred sixteentube zil truck launchers for mm rockets along with three hundred of a pla favorite the twelvetube mm rocket launcher at four hundred pounds the mm unit was heavy enough but sufficiently light that it could be manhandled that is pulled by a squad of chinese infantry or if they were lucky by a bm truck or mules as they passed through the manchurian mountains under cover of stratonimbus cloud that stretched like a thick gray ceiling all the way to the sea of japan colonel soong hero of the a capture a being a mountain on the siberian side of the chinesesiberian border that he had overrun earner in the war was honored to be placed in the breach at poyarkovo cheng knew that soong was under no illusion about the americans it was popular in beijing to decry them as capitalist degenerates turned soft by a consumercrazed democracy and while this might have been true for some of the conscripts at the wars beginning it no longer held for the soldiers of freemans second army for the most part they had already been blooded from the landings at rudnaya pristan on the coast to the battle for lake baikal and their sasd troopers were the jin rui bu dm the elite had there been more sasd troops atop a soong knew it would have taken another battalion as well as his own to dislodge them and soong knew that it was because of his experience with the sasd commandos that general cheng had placed him at poyarkovo for the americans as the iraqi war had shown were prone to using their special forces as the tip of the spear it was a spear cheng wanted to first blunt then smash nearing the rendezvous point in the valley between the two mountains east of ulan bator aussie paused to get his bearings with the handheld magellan gps global positioning system using the folds of his del to hide even the faint greenish luminescent glow as one hand held the small fat cigarsize aerial the other the gps he saw on the computer dial using batt pow select op mode quick fix and within seconds via the gpss mgrs or military grid reference system he had a readout and knew he was barely a half mile yards to be exact away from the rendezvous point in the valley between the peaks suddenly there was an approaching thudding sound and he dove to the ground whipping out the browning mm swinging it in the direction of the noise only to see a ghostly apparition as three shaggy wild horses manes flowing were momentarily and beautifully silhouetted against the cutoutmoon sky above the steppes they headed down into a depression off to his left the thing that struck him was how these wild semidesert przhevalsky horses as the briefer at freemans hq had described them had been spooked quickly either by him or someone else already in place he donned the nightvision goggles which contrary to public belief were not easy to wear indeed they were notorious for giving the men especially the pilots who had to use them severe headaches from eyestrain but at least now they were smaller and easier to carry than earlier models aussie had no sooner put them on than he heard the distant drone of a plane and above it a highertoned sound of fighters obviously salvini brentwood and choir williams had already reached the rendezvous or perhaps more accurately were about to do so having sent the sosaep alternate extraction point burst radio transmission whether the awacs had picked it up before second army signaled hq aussie didnt know and didnt care you beaut was the only whispered comment he allowed himself as he made his way toward the pickup point then dimly at first he saw two shadowy figures moving about a hundred yards ahead of him he went to ground wondering if theyd seen him and in that moment for a reason he couldnt explain he became acutely aware of the sweet smell of the early spring grass sprouting up between the ice crystals of crusty snow as his senses were on high alert again an alert downgraded when he thought one of the figures was choir williams it wasnt a fronton view he had but it was one of those moments in which you recognize someone you know from the back choir had a lazy monkeylike slouch when he was in the headdown position a slouch that aussie unmercifully teased him about during maneuvers then both figures disappeared beneath a knoll cautiously aussie made his way forward mm at the ready toward the knoll he had gone about thirty yards when his throat was so dry it felt like leather a manifestation of his almost obsessive fear of being a victim of what the sas called blue on blueor friendly fire aussie bastard it was said in a hoarse whisper and he swung about to see a figure behind him and heard another voice in front where the fuck you going shit aussie whispered in a surge of relief the heavy pulsating drone of a big plane he guessed an mc talon drawing closer you bastards frightened the friggin life out of me for a moment he felt the adrenaline draining out of him a flood of weakkneed relief passing over him as he gestured skyward with the mm am i right that the cavalry coming sure is boyo choir said cheerfully wheres sal aussie asked up yonder choir said pointing to a sharp rise about sixty yards away and fifteen feet above the level grassland hes signaling the big bird penlight code how come you got lost in the temple lost my arse aussie responded still keeping his voice low i just got out o there faster than you three can it david ordered lets get ready for the fust he meant the highly dangerous but lastditch star or more correctly fulton star surfacetoair recovery technique used only by commandos and seals the pilot of the mc combat talon on night vision devices as were the sasd aussie of course called it the fuck technique the fulton cock killer weve been waiting for you for hours williams teased aussie what dya mean aussie retorted the drone of the plane making it safe to talk albeit in low tones got a truck boyo williams explained with a long bloody ack ack gun on it just drove straight out of the city and you you poor sod on your paddy malone aussie now realized that it had probably been their truck hed seen earlier and i had to bloody hoof it aussie quipped you bastards the planes the combat talon and fighter escort were closer but now there was another sound at first it was as if firecrackers were going off but it rose to a crescendo and the sky lit up revealing the mctalon and fighter escort caught in the glare of a high flare red tracer lazily crisscrossing the sky seemingly filling the night with red and white dots to the truck david brentwood yelled realizing that the attempted fust rescue was over the star technique dangerous enough when everything was going right in this melee it would be impossible it was davids quick thinking that saved them for once they were in the truck a zil he ordered them to fire the twin mm aa gun at an acute angle skyward its spitting flame masking it for the spets or whoever else had reached the pickup point making it seem as if it were a friendly vehicle a truck manned by mongolian regulars perhaps trying to aid their siberian friends in trying to deny the sasd troop wherever it was any possibility of rescue aussie was on me machine gun salvini driving with brentwood and choir williams feeding the mm that was spitting out eighty rounds a minute to a height just under ten thousand feet aussies aim was well away from the us aircraft yet in the general direction enough to fool anyone watching nearby but his tracer made an f pilot mad enough to peel off and come at them with his mm rotary cannon blazing and dropping two of his six fivehundredpound bombs from two hard points under the wings the bombs whistling down into the night fortunately they were not laser guided and exploded wide but their combined shock wave almost knocked the truck over as me zil jumped sped up a small hillock and came rattling down on the other side the fs cannon unzipping the earth in a furious run churning up clouds of dust behind the truck dust that was now mingling with the enormous dirt cloud thrown up by the bombs which in turn obscured the truck from the spets who were firing with everything they had at the american planes east brentwood yelled to salvini drive east im going fucking east salvini replied and then the night turned red the mc exploding breaking in half bodies spilling like black toys into the orange balls of flame the bodies now afire screams lost to those below in the flickering shadows of the plain the combat talon was now nothing but falling pieces of burning fuselage after being hit by a spets groundtoair conicalnosed sa one of the soviet unions most portable surfacetoair missiles the truck with the sasd troop aboard its lights out continued to race over the flat grasslands the spets now being paid back in full by an f dropping a napalm canister that turned the grassland to a long bulbous rush of tangerine and black incinerating four spets two of them struggling out from the fringes of the fire but so badly burned that the praporshnik drew his mm makarov and shot them he had no time to waste for he now suspected that the truck hed heard its engine in high whine as it pulled out from the circle of flickering lights from the debris of the downed american plane might well be carrying the sasd troop of which no evidence had yet been found by the time he had collected his three remaining men he knew the sasd troop must have had at least a fifteenminute head start but there was no need to be despondent in a few hours it would be dawn and you could see the trucks tracks even if they hid the truck somehow etched clearly for miles over the hard yet fragile grasslands like hansel and gretel he told the spets troop four of them now including himself well just follow their path back to the helix we still have orders to take at least one of them alive one of the spets asked if we can the praporshnik said but he said it without any real commitment they the americans had killed four of his best men including the radio operator and destroyed the r km highfrequency radio set with burst transmission system the radio nothing more now than twisted and charred metal its plastic components having melted over it like taffy i say we kill the bastards one of the other three troopers said yes another said as slowly as possible we have to get them first the third member said he was pointing at what remained of the helix a burntout shell no doubt caught in the fs napalm run the dead pilot and copilot still strapped in their seats well get them the praporshnik promised whatever it takes chapter twentyfour lands end was hauntingly beautiful the skys saffron ripples spreading forever westward over the celtic sea white streaks of foam from an exhausted storm flung in a golden lace about the ancient pinkbrown rocks trevor brenson mp had a soft spot for cornwall with its moody air of romance and its legacy of smuggling of defying the proprieties of the establishment his ancestors on his mothers side had come from cornwall and though hed been born and raised in london he liked the idea that the genes of cornish smugglers were in his blood it didnt stop him from having his own grand plans for taxing the populace when labour got into power meiling didnt comment on this more obvious hypocrisy of brensons to do so would have upset the mood as brenson and she walked atop the cliffs their hair blown roughly by a gusty southerly the salty air of the sea both invigorating and relaxing at the same time turning from the celtic sea in the west south toward the atlantic and the channel brenson held her hand with what was for him an uncommon show of affection for his mistress i feel like im whole down here he told her his gaze fixed on the horizon where there was nothing but sea meiling knew what he meant the closeness of the sea the enormity of it gave them at once a feeling of insignificance and yet integration with the whole world with one another with all things and it was then as in a quiet moment with a friend that he apologized for not seeing enough of her lately for coming to her flat burdened with files and cares of the day what he said next surprised her because she had thought that when it happened it would be in the quiet exhaustion of having made love the most unguarded moment of all weve got the conservatives where we want them he explained theyre sucking up to the americans as usual oh she was careful not to ask why and looked out to sea affecting disinterest listening more out of politeness her focus fixed on the vista of sea land and sky yes he continued yanks want to overfly europebomb china i dont know why london didnt tell washington to go take a is that a petrel she asked suddenly in what she considered a flash of brilliance even more to convey a profound indifference that only encouraged him what he asked oh yes i think its a petrel stormy petrel im sorry she said i interrupted what were you saying americans want to send bombers to china which china not taiwan i hope she said flippantly no of course not in the far west apparently the west the far west she felt her heart racing it had to be the missile site at turpan it was the only target of any real military significance she took his hand its all right she said of his apology for not seeing her enough youre with me now yes he said and stopped looking down at her what is it she asked i love you he said i love you she lied and kissed him she would have to keep seeing him after shed passed the message to the chinese embassy via the dead drop near hampton court besides it occurred to her that if she complained about him not seeing her enough over the next week she might get the actual target though she believed she probably knew enough already on their way back to london they stopped for tea at penzance and when she went to the ladies room she had the urge to phone but had enough control to stem her excitement her trade craft quickly reining in her emotional high reminding her that in a world of beamfed directional microphones that could pick up a conversation through glass across a street you were never to use the phone to contact the te wuthe resident or head of station instead that night she worked off her nervous energy by letting him try a halfdozen positions before he finally settled on one rear entry mounting her like a dog god i love you he gasped you too chapter twentyfive having sped eighty miles east across the plain with dawn only two hours away david brentwood aussie lewis salvini and choir williams knew they would soon have to abandon the truck for come first light the spets would be looking for them in fact the spets whose chopper had been gutted all but vaporized in one of the fs napalm runs had had to walk back to nalayh before calling in helicopter gunships among them a hokum and this gave david brentwoods sasd troop more time but they were still three hundred miles from the northeastern mongoliansiberian border and to be in the truck come daylight would be asking for certain death the trouble was that because of the distance from the nearest american chopper base a helo pickup in time was out of the question even given the possibility of inair refueling the most they could hope for was a drop of heavier weapons and supplies in the early hours of dawn before the pale gray was transformed into cerulean blue the four sasd troopers approached a group of ghers the round feltandcanvas dwellings of the mongolian nomad herders a welcome sight they had deliberately chosen a group of six or seven ghers south of where they had abandoned the outofgas zil assuming that any search party would naturally fan out north of the abandoned truck which had been heading northeast toward the mongoliansiberian border and not south it was a calculated risk to buy time for if the siberians andor mongolians who were looking for them came to the ghers before any us aircraft could reach them for a drop it would all be over for the four men apart from the chance of a resupply drop to aid a possible escape the sasds only confidence lay in what theyd been told about mongolian herdsmen at second armys hq briefing for the mongolian long used to the vast emptiness and often rocky harshness of the steppe to refuse a stranger hospitality was to be regarded as a cur not fit for the company of humans the problem as aussie lewis reminded the others was that in every group there was the possibility of a cur or as he more colloquially put it the danger that some son of a bitch whod had a bad day on the range might take his frustration out on the strangers rather than on the expensive camel or mare whod kicked him or if any one of the herdsmen was a good party man he might saddle up and bring down the wrath of the authorities on the small group of longnoses the four men were now half a mile from the gher walking down a ridge careful to avoid its summit lest they silhouette themselves against the brightening dawn a gust of wind quickly gathered itself into a spiraling eddy like a miniature tornado and david brentwood hoped it wasnt an omen like the first trickle of a grain of earth that starts a smothering avalanche he tried to dismiss his fear as unworthy of the sasd team but he remained distinctly uneasy and as if to confirm his suspicions spiraling clouds of dust could be seen weaving their way through the kneehigh spring grass with surprising speed lifting the topsoil with them at times hiding the ghers from view brentwood hoped he hadnt made a mistake that soon they would be safe and he could have salvini send a transmit requesting a drop if brentwood hadnt made a mistake freeman had assuming that chengs orders for the air conditioners indicated a summer not a spring offensive freeman had allowed a battalion of lighter tougher block m tanks with their new gun and modular armor to be given a lower priority on his sealift resupply convoys so that the newest and latest tanks were only now leaving the us west coast for the siberian and manchurian theaters meanwhile freeman knew cheng would be building up his echelons of tanks freemans g estimating the chinese t to american m ratio at fourtoone there was no doubt that the m was the superior weapons platform with its seethrough smoke and laser range finders but no matter how good a range finder was against a t and no matter how much better me ms mm cannon was against the ts mm the best tank commander in the us army knew that if you had to kill four tanks against the enemy killing just one of yours just to stay even you were in deep trouble but first the ms had to come up to strength which meant the convoys had to get through unmolested this was considered a cinch after all while the chinese had seventyfive submarines only two were nuclear besides which the us sosus sound surveillance system underwater microphone network along the us coasts could it was said pick up a whales fart and classify the whale by species which was a gross exaggeration but was a measure of the confidence the pentagon had in the sosus it could certainly classify any ship from a threat library of known prop cavitation sounds in the same way a mechanic could tell the make of a car by its engine sound printout chapter twentysix manhattans lights spread out below his penthouse like spangled jewels jay la roche was celebrating his court victory already drunk on champagne and ordering one of his covey of lawyers to go get some chicken by which la roche meant young boys whom he could play around with later francine whod started as a bar girl in la roches d trovatore and who had been promoted to his stable of fillies as he called them wasnt amused it wasnt that she cared much one way or the other about the kids that la roche would be having it off with but she saw his request as a rejection of her that night she knew that for her it was a lovehate thing with la roche but she couldnt help it the things he made her do sometimes turned her stomach but for the security his money and position brought her she figured being humiliated every time they had sex hed urinate on her was a temporary inconvenience animal that he was he was the one man who was untouchable in the city as in the way his lawyers had beaten the treason charge for example however cruel he was and he was if you were with jay la roche you were protected from out there now jay slowing down his drinking eyes bright from a snort or two of angel dust was announcing a new plan to the assembled party he was atop the grand piano boasting that la roche industries was going to go ahead and do what it had intended to do before the buffoons from washington falsely accused methat la roche industries wasnt going to be put off going to visit the guys and gals at the front to show la roche industries continued support for the american war effort there was a lot of yahooing and clapping francine noticed a face in the crowd that shed seen in the newspapers some politician or other she remarked on the fact to jimmy the barman who was wrapping a towel around another bottle of champagne whats that senator doing here she asked congressman jimmy corrected her running the bottle along a line of sparkling tulip glasses he wants to be seen with jay dont we all francine still didnt get it oh she didnt mind what jimmy was doing with jay la roche ready to go up and have it off with la roche whenever la roche rang for him but she told jimmy she didnt know the congressman was gay he wasnt and jimmy was shaking his head at her francine was an all right kid but naive as a babe mostly about herself more than once as when jimmy had to go up to the penthouse when la roche had pulled a knife from the drawer and cut off her bra it had taken him half an hour to calm her down before he realized that she sort of liked it the danger not knowing the rules somehow made it more exciting isnt he running a risk francine said what if hes photographed by dont worry jimmy assured her his voice all but drowned out by the party the congressman wont get his picture in the paper see that gorilla by the door francine sipped some champagne yeah wears size thirteen d specializes in stomping on cameras congressmans safe so long as he does what hes told votes the way la roche tells him to and as long as he keeps la roches wife stationed up in alaska he can do that francine asked jesus christ francine when you gonna learn la roche has these guys ious all over the friggin place remember that guy a hand came out of the crowd and snatched four glasses of champagne without a word and thank you dear jimmy said that congressman who shot himself jimmy reminded her hailey bout a year ago no hey francine you stoned or what anyway this congressman was asked to do la roche a big favor congressman didnt want to do it so la roche showed him a few polaroids of the congressman with a page boy jimmy paused pouring the champagne pretty too anyway the congressman was caught between a rock and a hard place as they say couldnt pull off the favor couldnt bear the photos coming out for all his kids in college to see so bang funny thing is la roches papers gave him the front page tragic death blah blah blah francine wasnt listening she was anxious to get to the powder room to take another snort it made it easier to go down on him and lick him behind which is what he really liked after he got his load off he was still up on the piano singing north to alaska the flunky congressman standing in the crowd of flunkies with that fixed imhavingagreattimemrlaroche stare on their faces reelection cost ten million these days and without la roche industries it would be a near impossible run francine saw a tv starlet take off her high heels now gyrating shoving pussy at la roche atop the piano like she was trying to break down a door with it it made francine jealous mad and smug all at the same time jealous because she knew she wasnt the only one he could give security to and smug because she knew something the others didnt that jay la roche when he gave you the strap to beat him before he did his thing with you before he used you like a piece of toilet paper kept calling out lana the name of his estranged wife hed had something beautiful in her and had lost it the starlet even if the bitch got to lick him all way round would be strictly a onenight stand so long as lana la roche nee brentwood stayed in that outhouse of a burg dutch harbor up in alaska francine would be first filly in the stable colonel soongs soldiers werent taking any chances it was bad weather all over northern manchuria excellent cover from enemy photo reconnaissance but any unnecessary sound such as the mules braying could travel across the mistshrouded snowpatched valleys and so soongs men were thrusting their arms down the mules throats severing their vocal chords as they continued moving men and equipment and many heavy onehundredpound mm mortars up along the eastwest ridge lines that ran like an extension eastward of the genghis khan wall much of it like the great wall still intact general cheng deciding that whatever happened the americans would not use gas had made a decision that though small enough in itself allowed each man to carry extra rounds and rice in place of the cumbersome biological and chemical warfare protective suits how can you be so sure chairman nie had pressed him that the americans wont use gas because the americans have bourgeois notions of war comrade cheng answered no matter that they have tons of vx and sarin theyve never used the nerve gases they proved that earlier in korea even when the nka almost pushed them into the sea they didnt use it in vietnam or iraq they wont use it here but the commander of the shenyang armies cut in what if they do general general chengs reply was as even as that of a schoolmaster who had been asked a simple mathematical problem he had thought he had made this clear earlier in the war we run away comrade cheng knew that gas attacks depended much on local conditions and rather than lose precious time climbing into a suit so heavy that many more pounds of supplies could be carried in its stead and never mind the cost of the suit it was better to have the men simply flee the field oh certainly youd lose some but the ratio of the pla to the us second army was fifteentoone the pla could afford to take the risk also orders whether or not to suit up for chemical attack were so dependent on local conditions that a chaos of countermanding orders could affect an entire offensive anywhere along the black dragon river that a major war was in the offing there was no doubt for as in the great russian empire of the czar in once general mobilization was ordered in china the scale of the callup was so vast that it became an unstoppable bureaucratic juggernaut that under its own momentum all but demanded a clash of armies the man who emerged from the first gher reminded david brentwood of eskimos hed seen the same broadboned tanned face clear almondshaped eyes and a smile of teeth white as ice the mans thick sheepskin del reinforced the impression for the sun was still not fully up and the deep creepingup cold of the semidesert had yet to be driven off nor had the wind whistling down from the hentiyn nuruu abated the air gritty with the dust and infused with the pungent odor of burning camel dung its smoke escaping from the ghers roof vent causing salvinis eyes to water uncontrollably so that he appeared to be weeping according to the ancient custom the mongolian opened the wooden door of the gher and welcomed them into the round canvasandfelt house as theyd been briefed at headquarters the four men were careful not to walk on the doors low board frame but to step over it so as not to bring the gher bad luck inside the gher it was an island of sheepskin and other hide rugs on the floor the walls of canvas and felt supported by wooden poles no more than five feet six inches high spars of wood leading from these to the center where the stove pipe from the stonebased oven met the vent again as was customary the four guests were bidden to sit on the westward side their backs to nalayh their faces to the east the door directly to the right of them their feet pointing to the stove where camel and cow dung kept smoldering providing heat not only against the cold but to warm the arkhi an alcoholic drink of fermented mares milk the head man of the gher careful to sit opposite the four sasd troopers waited until all had partaken of the light orange cheese his wife had passed around this was the best insurance the troopers could have for by custom once the cheese had been shared there could be no conflict between host and guest but as aussie braced himself for another sip of the arkhi a small streak of melted yak butter giving it a taste like sour milk he was ready to reach for the nine millimeter if anything went wrong a wideeyed child watched him from atop one of the two metalspring beds a dark red and persian blue carpet of silk and wool draped behind the beds on the ghers wall adhering to custom once more david brentwood consulting his phrase book knew he should avoid disputatious subjects politics especially and wondered how he might confine himself to generalities about the weather and such at first this had struck him as being as peculiar to the mongolians until he realized how during his own childhood he his two brothers robert the oldest an ssn commander and ray and his sister lana had been told by their father never to talk about politics or religion it was no different with the mongolians headman he decided except he knew that perestroika and glasnost had worked some magic here too and that the party was finding it tougher these days to control the herdsmen or what they spoke about but whatever the customs brentwood also knew he didnt have time to pussyfoot around and so started with the weather using it to come at the main point from an oblique angle what he wanted to know was whether they could seek shelter here from the sun till nightfall whether it was the heat from the vodkaspiced arkhi or from the stove itself the cold was being driven off and he felt sweaty about the neck as he finished his question trusting he had used the correct mongolian phrase the headman smiled and pointing to himself said little english me struth aussie said thats good news mate struth the headman didnt understand but he knew what david brentwood meant about bad weather not to be moving the old man said in bad weather right mate aussie put in relieved no bloody good at all shut up aussie david said in an intentionally stern tone were not out of the woods yet no friggin woods here mate aussie said then saw the child sorry the painfully slow conversation between david and the headman was really not necessary however for the mongolian had understood the moment he had seen them come in from the plain that they were on the run from authority it was all he had needed you rest he told them well move tonight david brentwood promised the old man nodded his hand pointing to the sheepskin rugs on the bed as he talked to his wife just till tonight david promised again david took a chance and gestured back toward nalayh communists he knew enough already to know that the herdsmen didnt like the communists they told the herdsmen where to go and when striking at the very heart of the nomads life his freedom to move when and where he wanted chapter twentyseven in new york alex miro a tall thin man pulled up the furlined collar of his brown suede topcoat as he made his way past the plaza hotel toward the columbus circle entrance on central parks southwest corner he liked the park it had brought him luck and he was as convinced of his purpose as he had been on the very first day those years before when as a bearded young man his future before him he had arrived as one of the thousands of russian minorities allowed to emigrate to america in the heady days following gorbachevs and then yeltsins perestroika the reception committee in those days consisted mostly of older émigrés who had managed to flee the soviet union before gorbachev and alex could still recall the day when as one of about thirty new arrivals he had been taken on a tour of the city by one of these older émigrés the group had paused for a moment across from the plaza near the horsedrawn cabriolets the wealth of the people entering and leaving the famous hotel overwhelmed the new arrivals almost as much as their first sight of a supermarket one babushka from the ukraine had kept clicking her tongue and shaking her head beneath the black head scarf at the sight of such opulence after going north on fifth avenue seeing the stately stone townhouses on the east side and being told by the guide that only one family lived in each house alex had seen the womans disbelief her tongue clicking again as she gazed at the stately buildings her husband however skeptically informing several of the group that the guide was as bad as the old pravda lozhall lies it was probably just a potemkin village he said made exclusively to impress visitors just as the fake potemkin village had been for the czarina why any fool could see there was enough room for six families in any one of the townhouses one of the émigrés asked the guide to take them to harleminsisted they see harlem the place of the gigantskie basketbolisty alexs beard was so full in those days it had hidden the tightlipped grimace of satisfaction hed allowed himself on seeing that what the party had said was true here was the grinding poverty the rampant disorder the halfnaked black children the awful discordant noise of democracy the look of hatred and despair in the eyes of me blacks who stared resentfully at the bus of tourists like caged animals the putrid smell of garbage overpowering it was still so vivid in his mind particularly the loss of dignity he had seen in these faces a poverty that was horrible to nikolai ryzhkov ryzhkov being his russian name before he had taken the oath of allegiance to his newly adopted country and changed ryzhkov to miro it was the lack of dignity in the blacks eyes that struck him as being more crushing than any he had known in his youth in russia for there though people had been poorer in material things than their american counterparts there hadnt been the burning rage and spiritual deprivation that he saw in these faces the memory of this his first experience of the vast disparity in wealth between rich and poor in america not only stayed with him but all his life had acted as a spur to his singleminded goal the memory of harlem as troubling and as clearly etched on his mind as was that of the immigrants first visit to central park there in the green ordered world that accepted everybody it had been completely different surely what the great abraham lincoln had in his mind a place that did not depend on whom you knew on special party shops accessible only to the powerful but was a refuge for the common people he hated the zoo though hating anything being put in a cage anything that was hemmed in as a boy he had loved the moscow circus which he had seen illegally sneaking beneath the tent flaps of the traveling troupe when it had visited his town but when they had brought on the bears the huge muzzled beasts reduced to playing big babies for the amusement of rude peasants like his father alex had felt immeasurably sad not only for the bears but for those like his father whose sensitivities had been so brutalized by poverty in old russia in siberia to be exact that they could find the sight of the leashed bears only amusing as alex had grown older he learned that to liberate such people from such brutality no effective appeal could be made to sensibilities deadened by the constant crush of circumstance throughout history he was convinced there had been only one way one had to fight indifference and prejudice as lenin had said not submit to it but gorbachev had warned that you would get no thanks for trying to improve the lot of the people those in chains did not always thank those who set them free look at what had happened to gorbachev himself and how vividly alex remembered the muscovites demonstrating in red square telling the american announcer mike wallace who was doing his openmouthed surprise act that theyd had enough of perestroika of glasnostof how they pined for the order the comfort of predictability that stalins postwar years had given them id like to take the muzzle off that bear young alex had confessed to his father at the circus osvoboditset him free ha his fattier had laughed you are the first hed kill bite your head off but if thats what his father had said lenin had told every younger generation budsmel budterpelivbe brave be patient yes the party had made serious mistakes but at heart the party was still right lenin was gone now reviled by some as some atheists reviled christ but alex had not deserted the party nor had the other members of his sleeper cell as firm as ever in their conviction that capitalism was at heart evil that its enemies were their friends this wintry afternoon alexs returning again to the park seemed propitious presently he was joined by a short stout man mike ricardo parks had always been a favorite meeting place for the soviets and still were in what was now the commonwealth of independent states or cis last time they met they had set operation kirovs ballet in action knocking out con eds indian point plant poisoning the citys water supply at hillsview reservoir with one thermos of pcbs and taking out the cesium clock in hillsboro wisconsin the pacemaker clock for all the computers in the country including the pentagons what dyou think mike asked walking up helping himself to a chestnut from the packet alex was holding tossing the nut from hand to hand blowing on it his breath short coming in sharp puffs of mist in the chilly air you think the chinesell cross they always have yeah i know but i mean all along the line who knows alex replied i cant even figure out how they do embroidery embroidery doublesided stuff theyll do a picture on a silk screen you swing it around same picture on the other side but no knots stitch marks or loose thread beats me where they hide the ends must go blind time mike explained peeling the chestnut its steaming wisp in the air joining that of his own breath chinks are in no hurry alex theyre building up their strength chinese cant wait forever or freeman might cross the line mike rolled up the post hed been carrying and stuck it under his arm hands thrust deep in his topcoat pockets whats in it for us novosibirsk wants us to give beijing as much help as we can beijing cant start sending their operatives into new york frisco maybe but not here so we do our job and turn this thing around well be on top chinksll make a deal with us on the disputed border areas along the amur the black dragon mike said the amur alex said anyway this way novosibirsk stays out of it ostensibly but if we do our job shut things down here hit con ed again slow up the sea lift resupply sow panic in the population well have beijings iou mike took one of the chestnuts from the bag noticed it was too sooty pulled out another and saw a squirrel keeping pace with them in short quick dashes by the snowdusted path leading down past the puppet house toward the dairy son of a bitch is with the cia he threw the husk at the squirrel you sure well pull it off look we did con ed okay alex reminded him tartly if we do this thing right christ knows weve been training for it long enough washingtonll shit its pants americans dont have the stomach for it you know that we americans are tougher than you think mike said alex didnt like the we but figured it was probably a good sign mike always got right into the part mike pointed out that some of the others though neither he nor alex met them very often had gone a bit soft not on the strategy but theyd been waiting so long theyd started going to seed donut guts alex called them they liked the bluecollar affluence they enjoyed plumbers eighty bucks an hour but if theyd gone soft it didnt mean theyd gone over anyway most still had at least one parent back in the cis republics and grandparents even brothers and sisters whatever siberian intelligences kgb chief chernko had decided he needed to keep everyone committed to the semyafamily one of them had gone off the rails completely started playing around with street women spending most of his time screwing and spending paid out more at the track than he made on his job as subcontractor for new york port authoritys hert the harbor emergency response team theyd found him a floater in the east river off the south street seaport blood alcohol count of and his testicles sewn in his mouth the post had run a story that the man a diver for hert had been humping one of the mobs tarts it had shaken everybody up except alex who mike thought might have done it the thing was you never knew who was chernkos iceman in new york or anywhere else before the war the rezidents in the un unicef or in the embassy in washington would have handled it now you never knew who it was alex said it didnt matter who whacked the big spender that the americans would do the same to any one of their people who started screwing anything in sight you couldnt afford the risk of who theyd blab to when theyd gone that far off the rails oh yeah mike said in an accent as flawlessly american as alexs what about kennedy he screwed anything in a skirt and they whacked him alex said mike got the message though hed never bought the idea of a conspiracy theory some big organizational plan to get kennedy even though he did think for one man to get away three shots at a moving target in a few seconds was tough to do he alex and every other apprentice at spets training school in novosibirsk had tried it alex had been the fastest and most accurate blowing kennedys head off three times in a row but that wasnt why hed been chosen as the foreman nor had he been chosen because he could do a floater if needed no alexs outstanding quality was his ability to sustain the long view to bide his time through all the gorbachevyeltsin turbulence and to hold the others to it whoever shot the floater alex told mike was unimportant the point was he couldnt keep his pecker in his pants and he paid for it drew too much attention to himself put everybody at risk they saw stefan a wiry man well over six feet with what the doctors had told him was poor posture stooped from ducking doorways mike joked stefan was a tradesman too an electrician from upstate but he always wore a jacket and tie that made him look like a small businessman he was standing by the monkey cage watching one of the animals sitting high on the loops the monkey ignoring them peering down into his crotch grooming himself alex could smell stefans breath as he approached him and tried not to make a face here stefan was living in the most advanced industrial country on earth the home of the brave and dental floss and he wouldnt take care of his teeth but it was a subject that alex for all his hardnosed spets training couldnt bring himself to broach though he did move around mike so that he was upwind as they stood either side of stefan look at his red ass stefan said yeah mike said hes a party monkey how bigs the park alex asked flatly and he wasnt smiling at mikes little joke stefan immediately sensing alex was in his usual allbusiness mood answered eight hundred and fortythree acres then stefan asked his question how many blocks despite being upwind alex had to turn away from stefans bad breath before answering fiftyone blocks chernko in novosibirsk obsessed by the possibility of infiltration insisted that every cell go through the formality of such a preset exchange after an american lookalike years ago had penetrated the walker ring in vienna on appearance alone the formality over alex suggested the three of them walk down to the reservoir christ if id known that stefan complained adjusting the porkpie corduroy hat that made him look strangely elfish despite his height i could have met you at eightyfourth street i like to walk alex said and offered stefan a chestnut maybe thatd help his breath no thanks makes my throat itchy listen i know this is it but which one do we take care of eeny meeny miney mo what do you care alex asked unsmiling all you need to know is how to work your end dont worry about me alexi stefan said could do it with my eyes closed just like to know how many are going down thats all were lucky johnny ferrago didnt get to tell them anything ferrago had been the foreman of another cell theyd done their job poisoning the new york water supply earlier in the war but ferrago had ended up being taken out in a swat team firefight alex quietly stepped to his left on the pathway to let a weaving ghetto blaster with skateboard attached fly through them closing the gap he told stefan all four of em his tone unchanged rush hours the best time for eeny meeny early morning between two and three miney and mo anytime after that have you got the rats ready he asked stefan yeah listen alex you sure all four are going down i mean man its gonna be an asylum well alex said watching another ghetto blaster approaching it wasnt meant to be a tea party was it not waiting for an answer he continued by the book remember none of your families leave thats the first thing theyll be looking for a sudden move to another city all youve gotta do is just follow the instructions to the letter and youll be okay alex it was mike trying not to look as worried as stefan but he was bothered too it had come as a bit of a shock theyd been living with a secret for so long that by now theyd stopped worrying about it ever getting out and now suddenly they were going to do it their lives would never be the same not after a job this big they were approaching bethesda terrace the sun already lost to the skyscrapers itd sure help to know there were others in the same boat mike said i mean i know yeah sure we shouldnt ask no you shouldnt alex said are you nuts christ its basic right stefan only one of us knows two others ever that way we could lose a cell but not the whole group alex cupped his hands to warm them against his mouth what is it he asked them sensing a sudden reluctance you all want to hold hands your wives you going soft he was looking at both stefan and mike weve had perfect cover for over fifteen years and now youre going slackass on me like gregory gregory was the floater whom the police had found in the east river too old for it alex pressed is that it mommys boys jesus stefan said jesus alex it was we were only asking alex turned on him well dont just do your fucking jobs or i can send your request for layoff to cheerio cheerio was the name they used for chernko hes got the master list knows where everybody lives we can replace you two quick as i did gregory you arent the only fish in the tank weve got understudies all me way okay alex mike said relax were ready to go no problem stefan alex snapped yeah fine no problem alex was so angry with stefan he was about to tell him to clean his goddamn teeth when they reached bethesda terrace where the footpath they were on an extension of east nd street wound westward a silence reigned over the three as they approached the winged statue fountain the water falling from the tapered tier in an uninterrupted veil the air remarkably clean a small boy kneeling trying to crack a thin crust of ice at the edge to put in a sailboat alex watched him automatically looking for any sign that the older man reaching down holding the boys jacket was carrying a parabolic pickup mike using the kid as cover even though he knew mike was carrying a detector there was always the possibility that its batteries were on the fritz but then he realized his sudden anxiety was merely a result of mike and stefan asking too many questions this is the last meet he told them quietly after its done you fade back into the woodwork he told them if they hadnt already seen it for themselves that the ad like the one for a man in his early thirties desiring a livein companion sexual preference not important must like catsno republicans which had activated the ferrago cell earlier in the war was now appearing in every major newspaper across the united states it was chernkos go signal for spets sleepers who had so easily infiltrated the us during the kgbs vershinahigh summerof the wests honeymoon with yeltsin and the cis before they parted they spoke a little longer about incidental family concerns alex trying to ease things up a little showing he understood how they felt complaining about his kids dental bills christ theyll break me he said smiling youd be covered by the con ed benefits mike said yeah but not preexisting conditions what the hell does that mean mike asked alex shrugged anything they dont want to pay for i guess stefan nodded toward the boy across the pool that kidll fall in if hes not careful the weather should help us alex said they say theres a cold front moving down from canada he was half right there was a cold front moving down from canada but it was the storm brewing over virginia and moving up the coast that would help them most of all to shatter american morale oh shit stefan said and started off around the edge of the pool the kid with the boat having fallen in and the old man frantically reaching for him chapter twentyeight over three thousand miles away on the other side of the world the old mongolian herdsman entered his gher reached down toward the four sleeping sasd men first grabbing david brentwood by the collar then shaking choir williams aussie lewis and salvini instantly aussie slipped his hand beneath the del for his pistol the mongolian stopped him dogs he said quietly dogs brentwood asked sleepily what do you the old man put his finger to his mouth and motioned to listen we tell you dogs they are jesus salvini said whipping the sheepskin cover off him tracking dogs it wasnt yet dark no way could they risk a daylight trek from the gher through the desert how far away david asked the old man made a circling motion with his hand helos minutes bastards are probably searching every settlement aussie said right david instructed sal get on your blower and call in our map reference for a fust weve got no choice were in too far for our helos to help within a minute salvini had his whip aerial up through the ghers smoke opening and broke radio silence giving their position for a fust choir brentwood instructed you go first ta it was an ironic cockney thankyou aussie you and ill provide covering fire if any spets show up to intercept sal you stay here aussie and ill fan out outside the gher and see whether we can spot them first suddenly brentwood turned to the old man how do you know there are helos and dogs coming the old man was astonished that the american didnt know herdsmen the old man explained one camel herdsman told another and so on then the old man had a stroke of genius for aussie and brentwood if they were to make a reconnaissance outside the gher camels dressed in their dels high atop the animals they would be able to see for miles across the plain toward the mountains and this way everyone else could stay under cover in the gher salvini was inside the gher manning the radio hed only used a burst message and hopefully there had not been time for any enemy intercept to backplot him no sooner had brentwood and aussie mounted their respective camels than a bulbouseyed hind e passed low overhead heading further to the northeast aussie waving up at them silly bastard choir called out gotta play the part avent we squire aussie said what are you going to do choir asked when they come back and let out some dogs sniffing for us thanks to that bastard jenghiz theyll have scent from stuff we handled back at the dropoff not to worry sport aussie said flippantly the old ctll be here in a jiff he meant the combat talon aircraft but for all of aussies patter they knew it was more bravado than certainty the old ct or mc combat talon wouldnt be over them in a jiff and the best hope they had now was the lowflying f eagles coming in in fluid four formation screaming low overhead to avoid radar the first pair closer together than the second pair the wingman further apart all four releasing four packs from their hard points as quickly as they had appeared over the mongolian desert the eagles were gone in a screaming uturn with the high hentiyn nuruu as a backdrop only when the mongolian herdsmen from the ghers had retrieved the four drumsize packages and like excited schoolchildren were feeling the silk canopy of the bundles did brentwood think they might have a chance problem was you didnt even get a chance to practice a fust it was considered so dangerous it was only ever used as a last resort the best they could do in training was to use dummies to show you how it should be done go check the helium tanks brentwood called out to choir amid the excited chatter of the mongolians as they gathered around to see what was inside the cylindricalshaped helium canisters one canister was already open a fust harness spilling out afraid that some of the fust tackle might get tangled in the herdsmens excitement brentwood asked the old man to call his herdsmen off it took one command the headman smacking the butt of his slung rifle for emphasis and they were gone leaving only aussie and brentwood still on the camels as choir checked the packs bloody lovely int it aussie complained bloody lovely there they are opening the packs and im stuck up ere having my ass reamed out by this bloody great beast while sals inside having a cuppa looks like you got a bum rap brentwood jousted oh very droll very fucking amusing im sure lets see what your ass looks like after he stopped as salvini burst from the gher to tell them the fighterescorted talon would be there in twenty minutes you beaut aussie said slapping the camels rump in his excitement the animal immediately taking off throwing aussie two feet in the air before he came crashing down and saw three specks coming out of the eastern sky spets helicopters one of them probably the one that had previously passed overhead the enemy helos looked to be losing altitude coming straight for the ghers only one chance aussie said calling out to brentwood who had just spotted the approaching helos within minutes aussie and brentwood devoid of the dels showing only their light sasd camouflage drill uniforms were tied together as the headman waved at the three helos one helo peeled off the other two fanning out toward other settlements some miles to the south of nalayh as the helo came down blowing up dust of such intensity it was as if the whole settlement had been momentarily obliterated aussie could barely see the black rotor spin of the hind the headman holding on to the rope that was tied to aussie and brentwood waved up again at the spets pilot who saluted back and who could see several of the other herdsmen now jeering at the two americans one of the herdsmen throwing patties of camel dung at the two bound sasd men as the high whine of the spets choppers two shp turboshafts decreased making a chunky sound in the gritty sand cloud aussie could hear the rear door opening where the eightman assault squad would be soon filing out to take aboard their prisoners and setting loose the dogs as the door was opened the head herdsman in a swift movement that belied his age shot the pilot point blank with his range rifle while brentwood and aussie with one pull on the bowline knot that bound them quickly tossed six stun grenades into the rear cabin the explosion was loud yet the sounds of the dogs and men screaming and dying was muffled as if inside a great boiler the rotors began to cough to life but not before the headman had also taken out the copilot the undernose mm multibarrel rotary machine gun immobilized by a maneuver that would have done any american rodeo proud as ropes from two camels one pulling hard left the other hard right prevented it from moving even if the operator above was still functional enough to try for a traverse aussie david and choir went inside the cabin where four of the spets were already dead from the concussion the others in such a state that they fell quickly beneath the enfilade of smallarms fire bloody waste aussie said reloading the parabellum mag then grabbing a fire extinguisher to put out a small electrical fire that had started up forward and a bloody shame none of us can drive one of these friggin things it was a singular deficiency that none of them had ever thought much about before they were men who had been trained to survive in the harshest environments in the world wherever they were dropped and it was a matter of no small pride that at least one of them could get by in the local language but piloting a chopper had not yet been added to the course and for a moment they all felt less for it but if that was the case they would soon have ample opportunity to show what they were made of should the combat talon and its fighter escort appear already salvini had received a burst message that chicom fighter units were being scrambled to intercept the incoming american f eagles and it was only now that aussie lewis and the others realized what an extraordinary sacrifice the mongolians had made for them and how it answered freemans question about whether or not the mongolians would stand in his way if freeman drove south everything the sasd team had seen showed clearly that the mongolians had no intention of trying to stop the americans from reaching mongolias hated chinese neighbors for freeman however this might not be that much help after all for he could not move south with any confidence so long as the missiles in the turpan depression in western china were still intact the british labour party was playing blackmail with the tories well support an overflight if you will agree to higher capital gains tax it was a question of who would give in meanwhile frank shirer was being summoned to the wing commanders hut at lakenheath here a captain fowlerjones from the british navy air arm was accompanied and introduced by a captain moore of the usaf fowlerjones did most of the talking so youre not satisfied frank was taken aback wasnt the british officer corps supposed to be known for its polite reserve havent time to waste old boy fowlerjones pressed youre not satisfied flying the big jobs fowlerjones indicated the nine bs on the rainslick tarmac well shirer began tentatively id rather be flying cats he means tomcats captain moore put in yes yes i know fs good plane but we have all the fighter pilots we need at least for that caliber weapons platform there was a long pause shot down werent you wing commander fowlerjones said bluntly opening a file and studying it twice yes sir he looked up at shirer learn anything shirer shrugged a migs a lot better than we thought it was in the stall slide it can yes quite but your nerves and i want gospel on this up to snuff yes sir i believe so believe so know so know so well then fowlerjones said to the us captain thats that may i ask shirer began harriers fowlerjones said were very short of men on harriers vertical takeoff and landing old carrier pilots like yourself often get quite good at it in a short time short takeoff and landing that is you game yes yes sir you sound hesitant no sir im just yes yes i know you just expected a topoftheline combat fighter well ill tell you this shirer we need good harrier men right now cant go into all the whys and wherefores at this time need to know follow me yes sir shirer lied the man talked like a telex machine quite frankly theyre the only aircraft in any supply we have left in this theater idea is that if this mission to china goes off then we could give harrier escort inflight refueling of course the harrier shirer thought jesus it might be better than jockeying the big ugly fat fellows but it had always been the ugly duckling of production lines with its funny ferry tips or swivel jet nozzles at the end of each wing that made it look more like an aspiring fighter blighted by dropsy than a revolutionary new aircraft not the new harrier two mind you fowlerjones explained to show there was no misunderstanding its the harrier one singleseater job were offering you people people yes captain moore put in the idea is to put in a flight or two of harriers to go in with the bs yes fowlerjones cut in riding shotgun i believe you chaps call it if we get the word go it would mean two harriers per bomber as i say inflight refueling in pakistan before you go over the hindu kush to join the big chaps on the raid in i assume youre inflight qualified shirer still hadnt shown the kind of enthusiastic response fowlerjones had been looking for and he snatched up his cap and gloves well of course if youd rather not i just thought that some of you people were itching no sir shirer began i mean yes id be happy to go sir good your combat experience just the thing we need but youll have to get used to the harrier in short order thats up to you im afraid yes sir what field theyre squadroned in peshawar youll join them there yes sir with that shirer saluted and fowlerjones was gone is it anywhere near lakenheath shirer asked captain moore what peshawar youre joking other side of the world you heard him hindu kush and all that harrier squadron is based in peshawar at the moment pakistan is in bed with washington and london you see this way they dont have to move fighters around where theyd be noticed by the chinese oh how about moving nine bs around theyd notice that wouldnt they sure would but weve been flying c relief planes from the militarys air transport command during the spring floods dropping urgent food relief at least thats one reason why planes have been flying back and forth from london to pakistan for the last two weeks so when the bs show up on chinese radar they wont know the difference that is until they start turning in toward the turpan depression thats when theyre going to need you boys oh shirer said and what do you think the chinesell do then dont worry pal moore cut in all their topoftheline fighters fulcrums especially are in eastern china right now theyre trying to bottle up manchuria and keeping one sharp eye on taiwan they cant have their jets all over the place at the same time no but when the bs start crossing that old hindu kush or thereabouts buddy theyll move a few sure they will but by then the missionll be half over you guys in the harriers probably wont see anything more exciting than an avalanche this is all assuming that the chinese dont figure were going to hit them right wheres your faith in intelligence look how we pulled me wool over old saddam insanes eyes maybe captain but the chinese arent the iraqis besides once bitten twice shy anyway shirer continued what the hell are british harriers doing in pakistan they arent british theyre pakistani but dont worry by the time you go up therell be old glory on the tail jesus shirer said this is all politics so whats new all you need to know is youd better get a handle on the fuckers in case youre going in britsll make the decision yea or nay anytime now yeah well i hope the chinese fall for your relief flight routines dont worry theyre too busy trying to lock up manchuria then moore hit him with the bombshell hed have ten days from the moment he reached peshawar to train on the harrier to brighten him up moore told shirer that the older singleseater went faster than the newer harrier two how fast shirer asked the veteran of mach tomcats around point nine moore said point nine shirer stopped in his tracks not all the time moore assured him sometimes it drops to mach point eight jesus christ has it got enough power to take off well it hasnt moore said adopting shirers ironic tone you see there are these four guys good runners one under each wingtip one under the nose the other under the up your ass shirer said not if i can help it shirer couldnt help laughing well hell at least hed be flying again a lone eagle pulling out the coil of strong ply nylon rope and the tight roll of twentythreefootlong polyethylene balloon aussie clipped on the first of the thermossize pressure tanks and pulled the safety pin releasing a hiss of helium gas the balloon inflating in an obscene condom shape until the second tank kicked in and filled the twentythreefoothigh balloon that now with its flanged tail also inflated took on the shape of one of those tethered aa balloons used during the german air attacks over britain within five minutes the white balloon trailing its white nylon rope like some gigantic tadpole tail rose to five hundred feet the end of the rope trailing earthward already attached by means of a ring bolt to a wide strip of canvas harness that was now clamped tightly against salvinis midriff the combat talons dull rumble could be heard before the sudden scream and sonic boom of the f fighters that were well ahead of the talon passing over them even though the dust had settled it was still difficult for aussie to see the horizontal v that extended from the talons nose like a pair of scissors one blade projecting left the other right the idea being that the talon using the balloon as a fix above it would fly its v into the nylon rope like someone extending two index fingers in front of him snaring the line which would then jerk the man off the ground as the talon kept going winching him up should the talon miss catching the cable with its nose v the cable instead of endangering the props would slide off the v against a taut protective wire strung from wingtip to the forward fuselage thus buffeting the balloon rope along the protective wire away from the props at least that was the theory it was tough enough to do without interference but with the knowledge of siberian migs now scrambling aloft to meet the fs everything as aussie said while checking choirs harness was a tad tight next aussie made sure that choirs chute was firmly attached in front of him and head held up you ready mr williams no mother of god choir replied ah youll be laughin in a few minutes here she comes come on choir legs straight out hands palm down head up atta boy the rope looked like a thread of curving cotton stretching between him and the fourtailed balloon there was a line of orange tracer arcing from the east and then two orange streaks sidewinders from the fs aussie could see the slack taken up as the talons v snared the line then suddenly choir was jerked violently aloft it was the most dangerous moment for if the talon hit a wind shear or lost altitude for any reason choir would smash into the ground at over mph but the talon kept climbing and slowly they could see the arc that was the balloons line with choir at its end reducing in angle as the talon crew continued winching him up the line growing tauter salvini was the next to go his balloon already hissing loudly inflating with the helium and rising heavenward aussie glanced at his watch it was smacking salvinis boots together making sure he was in the correct position aussie joshed him bet you ten bucks they winch me aboard faster than you what salvini asked his anxiety for all his sasd training suddenly betraying itself bet you ten bucks aussie repeated that they take longer to winch you in than me oh yeah and how do you figure that easy aussie retorted they could hear the tracer getting closer youre heavier than i am im as fit as you are course you are but youre heavier come on pay up or shut up youre sick salvini said his anxiety written all over his face all right five bucks i cant do better than that right salvini nodded thinking that the australian was now asking him if he was in the proper position for the jerk he was but aussie always liked to make sure of a bet five bucks okay yeah five bucks all right all right wheres the talon shes making the turn aussie said just then a small sandstorm broke locally and they could see nothing damn it salvini said dont sweat it sport aussie encouraged the talonll pick it up we cant see them but they can see the rope up higher just you get ready for the before he finished salvini simply disappeared into the dust aussie barely glimpsing his boots as he was jerked aloft two up two to go aussie said cheerfully david brentwood was thanking the mongolian herdsman who had risked his life and family to help them already the herdsmen were gathering up their ghers and packing ready to move to avoid any punishment patrols that might be sent out from ulan bator come on dave aussie yelled or youll miss the friggin bus within two minutes brentwood was in his harness aussie having already released the balloon from its small bedrolltype wrapping as it expanded disappearing into the dust it looked like some fantastic ghost in a mustard cloak palms down aussie instructed him davey you want to make a wager no ten bucks they winch me in faster than you no youve got some scheme to help pull yourself up a few feet on the cable and beat us all is that it no way aussie said look ive never been on one of these things either i just figure my lucks in what do you say ten bucks all right anything to shut you up thats my man wheres that damn talon before aussie could answer him there was a loud explosion followed by another i hope to hell thats one of theirs david said well soon know if the talon doesnt reappear how will we know in this dust storm lord ive never seen anything like it huh aussie said locals tell me this is only a bit of a whirly in the gobi they say you cant see your hand in front of your face during a dust storm all very educational aussie but how the hell can we tell where the talon is keep your bloody head in position dont want a case of whiplash on top of suddenly brentwood was being dragged along the ground swearing bumping on pebbles then he too suddenly disappeared into the whirling dust storm next aussie already in harness pulled two helium tanks to fill the balloon and within minutes could hear the talon off to the north making its circle his balloon now ascending the old herdsman shook his hand and around them like shadows in the darkness of the dust he could see the various odds and ends of the herdsmens life as the canvasandfelt homes came down to be loaded onto a wagon a small tv being wrapped carefully in a carpet and camels laden with bedding and harness the mongolians wishing him well with their eskimolike smiles and golden teeth there was a crash like thunder either a siberian or american jet hitting the desert floor then in less than a second aussie his arms now crossed tightly in against his chest was airborne the spring in the nylon cord making the initial ascent smoother faster than hed anticipated but then the spring was at its end and this was followed by a sudden jolt so fierce that aussie felt his head was about to come off once above the twohundredfoothigh dust storm that had invaded the ghers aussie could see far above him the three now small balloons that had been severed free once the vshaped scissor clamp had got hold of the previous three lines now from the tail of the aircraft another vertical line descended that would hook onto the rescue line and haul it up and into the belly of the plane the talon was flying higher than usual because of the loss of visibility due to the dust storm they liked to see their man as quickly as possible before engaging the winch with wind and dust screaming about his ears aussie could hear the staccato of machine gun fire off to the west where the american and siberian fighters were engaging and now and then he caught a glimpse of tracer as one of the siberian fighters would try to break out of the american fighters box to try to bring down the talon a fishbedj mig was visible for a moment when aussie dangling like a toy at the end of the enormous rope was six hundred feet above ground but as soon as hed seen the fishbedj with its green khaki camouflage pattern he saw an f eagle on its tail and the spitting of fire from its mm sixbarrel rotary cannon the fishbed immediately started making smoke rolling into evasive action its twin barrel gsh mm cannon firing from its belly pack suddenly aussie knew he was in free fall the line severed he had less than a second to make the decision that was no decision at all either pull the key ring release on his chute or smash into the ground his right hand grabbed the key ring and jerked hard there was a flurry of air about him like a hundred pigeons being released and suddenly his downward thrust was slowed as the chute filled and he descended back into the dust storm the talon already having overstayed its welcome was forced to turn back northeastward across the mongolian border into second army territory before the siberian migs got lucky again aussie used swearwords on the way down he thought hed forgotten whether the line had somehow fouled in one of the props despite the safety wire rigged in front of them or whether it had been a lucky tracer bullet didnt really matter whatever severed the line he wasnt going back with his three buddies but like all members of the elite sas and delta force commandos he was trained in how to turn a losing situation into a winning one cold reason also told him though as he entered the gritty dust storm and hit the ground harder than he had wanted that the spets helicopters and patrols would soon head out from nalayh and possibly ulan bator looking for him and right now he had four hundred miles of grassland and desert between him and the safety of second army it seemed impossible yet the only thing he could think of was the motto of his unit who dares wins or as general freeman echoing frederick the great would have said laudace iaudace toujours laudace but meantime aussie was stunned by another realization that he had just lost fifteen bucks cold chapter twentynine next afternoon a friday when mike ricardo walked into con eds eightstoryhigh fossilfuel astoria station for his fourtomidnight shift he paused for a moment to look up at the five sets of high twin stacks belching their white smoke in sharply etched columns against the cerulean blue hed been working at the astoria fourteen years his job a member of one of the maintenance crews for the six giant white logcakeshaped turbines that sat on an immaculately kept rustredpainted boilerroom floor over a hundred and twenty feet below the miles of piping that bent and curved like the exposed innards of some enormous refrigerator but here it was far from cold temperatures soaring to degrees fahrenheit as the fossil fuels coal mainly burned twentyfour hours a day to drive the turbines that helped feed the enormous appetite of the new york grid at the same time that mike was beginning his shift at indian point in upstate new york thirty miles north of central park stefan the third member of the cell was donning a blue surgical cap slipping his idlock card into the slot he passed first through the turnstile and the bluegreen protective door on through the second shielding door and into what the men at the two plants at indian point called the blue room here the fuel rods lay in an innocuous honeycomb arrangement twentyfive feet beneath the blue water shield in albany the computer monitoring the flow of electricity was showing above average power being consumed in manhattan and queens so that up to half of it had to be drawn from the grid fed by the enormous hydropower complex at la grande in quebec the juice coming down on the volt lines from the roaring spillways of la grande one and two manhattans eight substations transformers like those throughout the rest of the city downstepped the voltage so that davids father admiral john brentwood in the world trade centers offices of the new york port authority could keep track of the highly complex business of coordinating convoy loading departure and arrivals and when he had time brew the coffee that kept him and millions of other new yorkers from brokerage houses to subway drivers working the extended war hours northeast of the bronx on the calm waters of croton reservoir the waterpolice helicopter was carrying out its normal patrol to insure that no powerboats were churning up the bottom if left undisturbed the water would be aerated through the action of the suns ultraviolet light and once rid of impurities would pass through the aqueducts and tunnels built a hundred years before and become part of those oneandahalf billion gallons of water that new yorkers consumed every day the chopper came down as it spotted the qualitycontrol men on the only powerboat allowed in the lake lowering the seki disk which they saw was visible down about three and a quarter meters much deeper than the two meters required by law in new york the fourth spets who was replacing the floater gregory walked as casually as he had for the past ten years into con eds orangecarpeted ecc energy control center the controller glanced about at the twelvefoothigh halfmoonshaped wall beaded by quartersize lights that traced the lines on the hundreds of flowcharts making it all look like the massive circuit board of a railway network rather than that of new yorks electric flow the weather report was now predicting variable overcast conditions preceding the storm moving up from virginia the overcast was responsible for more afternoon lights than usual being turned on in manhattan the operator pushing himself back in the high gray luxurious chair at the center of the control room glided quickly and deftly to the tracking ball control his palm moving over it as blue and amber readouts on the computer screens told him backup alarms were about to ring the indicator for the substation at west fortyninth and vernon was flashing overloaded at nine hundred megawatts about to trip and set in motion a brownout this was averted by the controller siphoning off extra power from feeder line eighty the line which brought the hydropower down from canada still overload threatened if it goes above two thousand the controller called start shedding which for the men on the fourtomidnight watch meant that they werent to wait until substations started tripping out call kennedy hospitals medical fire ambulance theyll have to go to egs but the spets man knew that the controller didnt suspect any crisis building up he was merely taking strict precautionary measures confident that con eds bjgs backup jet generators could kick in at a few moments notice if necessary what the chief controller didnt know however was that the jetengine generators had over ten pounds of sand thrown into their innards it had been as simple as a child throwing sand at a beach the moment they kicked in theyd overheat and burn out while the controller watched alarm lights started to flash all over the circuit board twentyseven minutes later the huge spillways of la grande in quebec exploded causing massive flooding racing at unprecedented speed over the vast canadian tundra feeder eighty and all other transmission lines from quebec went dead fourpointseven minutes later both the nuclear plants at indian point reported explosions not in the restricted rod pool area inside the plant but in the control rooms themselves six operators were dead more than twenty critically injured now devoid of nuclear power its hydro feeder and fossilfuel generating plant capacity out over percent of new york city was plunged into darkness only hospitals and control towers at laguardia and kennedy functioning on their own emergency generators the lightning forked blue over new york so that at first new yorkers believed the power lines and substations had been hit by the storm moving up from virginia and they blamed this for stopping everything from their tvs to the subway over two million people caught in rush hour the port loading facilities immobilized auto accidents by the thousands and in flatbush looting worse than during the blackout of in mount sinai and other hospitals from new york to new jersey and in westchester county over fortythree patients died during the delays before emergency generators kicked in at bellevue a new orderly eager to help struck a match creating a flashback along the oxygen feed line to an oxygen tank which became a rocket tearing through two walls and killing four elderly patients waiting to go into or and two more in the recovery room the explosion also creating a massive fire oxygen feeds were quickly cut off to prevent other explosions but this meant that dozens of emphysema patients most elderly went into respiratory distress eleven of them dying despite heroic efforts under emergency battery lights to resuscitate them ambulance crews did their best but were plagued by motor accidents fourteen in manhattan alone which prevented them from responding to emergency walkietalkie calls many civilians were struck down in times square as they were pushed off curbs by the sheer force of crowds panicking in response to the gunfire of a mugging at the corner of fortysecond and broadway two women were dragged off near central park west between west ninetythird and ninetyfourth and raped one was left dead her throat slit by her attacker there were quiet heroic actions too throughout the city but these were isolated cases that couldnt hope to arrest the warspurred fear which climaxed around pm that evening when a radio station broadcasting weakly but broadcasting nevertheless via its own emergency generator power relayed a conversation with a ham radio operator claiming the police had found evidence of coordinated sabotage against the city furious the mayor having to drive through the terrorfilled streets first to con eds ecc and then to the radio station finally countered the report by announcing that he had been assured by con ed that the blackout was an unusual confluence of forces and that power would be restored as soon as possible many people took refuge in churches and some caught by the blackout near fifth avenue sought protection in the metropolitan museum of art and the guggenheim but nowhere was it totally safe several people mugged in the western chapel of st patricks while on sixth avenue a visitor to new york driving north took a right onto fiftyseventh street and was sideswiped twice before being hit and killed by a city garbage truck the accident creating a solid traffic jam four blocks east to lexington while most others had been heading home when the power went out some had been on their way back to work in the new york port authoritys convoycoordinating center in trade tower one when the power went out and found themselves trapped on an elevator between the sixtieth and sixtyfirst floors all telephone lines were out the only news being relayed by the emergencygeneratorrun radio stations the mayors assurance sounding thinner by the minute with one station reporting heavy gunfire in flatbush between blacks and little seoul and several shootings in the midtown tunnel by pm the new york radio stations operating on their own power had grown to half a dozen their lights like those of the hospitals pinpoints of illumination in the canyons of darkness several more stations broadcasting unconfirmed reports of sabotage against the feeder lines coming through westchester county and from the east rockies mountain grid the mayor did what he could to disavow these rumors as well and indeed several of the stations refused to run them but those that did were no longer relying on the unconfirmed reports of ham radio operators but on fm radio du canada broadcasts out of montreal and cbc stations in toronto picked up by truckers on the interstates from chicago to the adirondacks the mayor again appealed for calm nows the time he told the population of eleven million for new yorkers to stick together for the most part they did but the widespread random acts of violence had not yet abated and by the time the mayor returned to city hall he was already trying to compute the political costs to him of having told a barefaced lie earlier on having dismissed the rumors of sabotage as patent nonsense one of his aides told him that he was wanted on the phone better be the president of con ed his honor snapped no sir its the president of the united states the mayor held his hand over the receiver for a moment to compose himself mr president the presidents voice was competing with static on the radio telephone mr mayor im sending al trainor up to see you the mayor wasnt sure what to say what he needed was electricity and fast not presidential aides well mr president he wont be able to his voice disappeared in the sound of an enormous explosion and a ball of crimson flame curling in on itself followed by the sound of crashing glass a chopper all but out of gas had tried for a lastminute landing atop one of the skyscraper pads but instead buffeted by wind shear into the darkness the pilot momentarily disorientated in the pitch black night a rotor had hit the water tank we dont want to get in your way jim the president was telling him switching to an informal tone impressing the mayors media aide who was close enough to pick up the conversation he could hear mayne cough briefly then continue i ordered fort dix to give all possible assistance the mayor knew he was alluding to the riots but was being nonspecific as they were on an open line al trainorll fill you in with the details of assistance i want him to be with you to see at first hand then report back to me help you coordinate recovery efforts we dont want washington bureaucrats standing in your way hell be bringing the apple two contingency plan with him get rid of any red tape thank you mr president putting down the receiver the mayor seemed even more puzzled by the presidents last comment he turned to the clutch of aides what in hell was that all about contingency apple two what the hell was that marvin thatd be the emergency response plan mr mayor apple for new york weve got our own contingency plans the mayor replied tartly what we need is electricity and money not goddamned its not just for new york the aide explained its a plan that ties in new york with the feds with the rest of the country ah you signed it mr mayor the mayor raised an eyebrow you mean were only going to get whats left over after washington gets finished allocating it to no sir marvin said he liked the mayor had worked for him for five years but his honor had a tendency to see the whole world in terms of political clout and money no sir apple two means that its not just us involved its all over the country the west coast has been hit too who the hell else is going to get in on it the mayor pushed we dont need trainor up here to tell us that i dont want jersey and the rest of them riding on our coattails new yorks my priority my responsibility if trainors coming up here to slice up the pie i until trainor gets here mr mayor we wont know the mayor took a breather and relaxed as much as the situation would allow before turning to another of his aides what dyou think frank well maynes fresh from reelection no cause for him to go grandstanding with us to win votes long as he doesnt send us a quayle for a moment the mayor thought his aide meant a bird trainors no quayle put in the mayors stenographer a petite redhead who up till now hadnt said anything preoccupied with worry that her parents had been caught in the tunnel trainors very well thought of in washington the mayor grunted he was always skeptical of washington no matter what the situation washington always wanted something in return if he wasnt careful the mayor of the big apple knew that the president would get all the glory jennifer he said looking across at the stenographer i want air time booked prime time soon as con eds got the power back on cant right now mr mayor phone lines are down again what jesus well send someone by car send a smoke signal anything if were not on the tube first washingtonll steal all the bases jennifer dispatched messengers some by bike for some strange reason in the flashlightlit hallways her voice seemed to echo more than it ever did in the bright night light when the messengers returned an hour later one of them bleeding badly from a fall they apologized to jennifer that though theyd booked time for the mayor the white house had already requested air time ahead of them damn it i knew it the mayor thundered washington wants all the glory its a grandstand play it wasnt electricaldistribution networks right throughout the united states had been hit including and especially the west coast ports where sabotage throughout the rocky mountain grid caused a back jam of ships urgently needed to resupply second army over five thousand miles away it was the presidents decision in the face of such overwhelming sabotage to once again broadcast a reintroduction of the emergency powers act of the kind that had allowed them to pick up the likes of la roche though in that instance their timing had been all wrong to assure the nation that the government was still intact the top washington bureaucrats were already en route to mount weather fortynine miles west of washington its hub a massive bunker dug into the mountain that was operated by em a emergency management agency with fourfootthick blastproof reinforced steel doors a complex that had its own underground water supply cafeterias hospital tv and radio communication center and particularly vital in such situations as that created by the blackouts its own power plant and sewage facilities that evening as washingtons bureaucratic convoy moved through virginias loudoun county along county route slowing near heart trouble lane to no more than ten miles per hour they saw the barbed wire atop a tenfoot cyclone chain fence that ringed mount weathers four hundred acres above the bunker amid the rich virginia foliage barracks and microwave relay antennae were already alive with activity it might take only several days for the total power failure to be put partially right but until then mayne was playing it safe what mayne desperately needed for the american people was not to give them any more humiliating communiqués from a superhardened bunker but a victory the feeling that despite their trials and tribulations at home at least america was winning what in hell was freeman doing what freeman was doing was waiting for the brand new m abrams block automatic loader modulararmor main battle tanks which at fiftyone tons versus the old sixtyplus could go faster and fight harder but which were now sitting cluttered dockside the usas power failures meanwhile paralyzing communications not only from the pentagon to the west coast but even within the pentagon itself meanwhile freemans g was informing him that general chengs chicom buildup along the manchurian border was continuing unabated that second army must expect an allout crossing of the amur within seven days there was another minor impediment as freeman with calculated understatement put it they can hit me from the turpan depression with intermediate missiles if i move south to engage the manchurian west flank yes they can norton confirmed your estimate gentlemen freeman asked looking about the forward headquarters quonset hut at chita were between a rock and a hard place a young colonel proffered norton waited for the explosion to come for the officer having stated the obvious but it didnt colonels quite correct freeman conceded his face drawn and tired from looking at the maps well gentlemen theres only one thing to do sir norton asked take a walk and with that freeman buttoned up his winter coat and pulled on his gloves sir it was norton yes think youd better have two minders whatever you think dick but if the good lord says your times come so it has and with that two nonplussed marksmen were sent out after him give him at least twenty yards norton advised them otherwise hell start giving you the gears for being goddamned nannies got it yes sir ah colonel norton sir yes i sure hope he thinks of something to get us out of this a clump of needle ice crashed from a pine onto the roof of a humvee so do i norton said freeman hadnt even turned at the ice smashing on the humvee he was already doing what norton called his napoleon head down walking stick behind him trudging through the crisp spring snow the pla was south and east of him along the manchurian hump and no word yet from the sasd team hed sent in to sound out the mongolians disposition east of nalayh over four hundred miles south of the confluence of the manchuriansiberianmongolian border the wind was increasing and aussie lewis after having floated down into the gritty dust storm had to rely entirely on his gps to know exactly where he was he lost sight of the talon completely hearing only its fading roar as it together with its fighter escort withdrew heading back north to second armys territory aussie wasnt bitter had he been david brentwood he would have done the same thing ordering the talon to withdraw not having enough time to try another fust as aussie unclipped his chute the head herdsman moved quickly over to him yelling excitedly perhaps he had heard a chopper but no now the talon had gone the dogfights had ended and all he could hear was the banshee howl of the wind then he saw it suspended by two parachutes a blurred orange image at first in the dust but its archetypal image more definite now as it struck the ground bounced and flipped on its side you bloody beaut aussie shouted immediately running to and unharnessing the talons farewell gift it was no guarantee hed get away but at least there was a chance the headman recognized it of course as a motorcycle but he had only seen some of the motor and sidecar units of the chinese army in earlier skirmishes with the pla over southern borders not one like this you bloody beaut aussie repeated it was a khakipainted kawasakid which had won out against the harleydavidson and yamaha for the marine corps and army contract used mainly in desert storm for recon and courier service during radio silence among the most forward units the kawasaki had performed well aussie cut the chute straps with his ankle kbar knife heaving the pound bike up onto its stand and could hear the tight slosh of a full tank another jerrican of gas strapped to the left side of the pinion seat a carbine in a right hand reverse cavalry leather holster with a liquidcooled engine the kawasaki could give him eightyplus miles per hour over the rockstrewn plains the motorcycle modified for the army so as to have wider bettergrip tires especially in sand with a fortysixtooth reartires sprocket giving it two better than the standard fortyfour and so reducing its gearing and the biggest plus of all given aussies position was that the kawasaki had a liquidcooled engine this made it not only more environmentally friendly in reducing fuel emission but more importantly for aussie made it about the quietest bike in its class aussie figured if he could average fifty miles per hour through the dust storm that had now enveloped him and the enemy alike and could drive on through the night he could make the border in eight to ten hours but first he went back to the bulletriddled spets chopper and helped himself to a makarov pistol an ak with six clips and a dozen spets f grenades he stuck two of them in the pockets of his del and the others in the right saddlebag with a water canister and the dried camel meat the herdsmen had given him using a canvas strap from the parachute he made a sling for the ak the makarov mm in his belt beneath his del a pair of tenpower nightvision binoculars around his neck and packed on or rather packed around the pinion seat more cargo from the immobilized chopper namely an rpgd antitank rocket launcher with five rockets then courtesy of the dead spets chopper pilot he took off the mans spets uniform including the telltale blueandwhitestriped tshirt rolling it into a bundle that he stuck between the seat and gas tank the herdsman was grinning appreciatively and shook aussies hand vigorously as if it were a water pump two minutes later aussie was lost to the herdsmens view in a muffled roar as the kawasaki headed east from the gher caravan that itself was already on the move checking his gps lewis knew exactly where he was within ten meters because of the satellite triangulation what he couldnt tell was what hed meet along the way and soon he was too far from the ghers to see what happened a half hour later when a spets chopper out of nalayh blasted the moving caravan of ghers to a stop then landed and took prisoners in the swirling dust storm they asked them which route me american had taken and how was he traveling by camel by foot how the siberian fighters probably fulcrums though having driven off the americans had reported the three dirigibles that were part of the singleline extraction technique where was the fourth was he heading north or east for the border along the indermeg road or even further east towards choybalsan on the herlen river before turning north the terrified mongolians reminded the spets that the mongolian peoples republic was a friend of the siberians and told the spets that they did not know what direction the fourth american took the spets loaded them all aboard the hind flew it to two thousand feet above the dust cloud where it looked like a huge bugeyed dragonfly and threw all of them seven adults and three children out then headed toward choybalsan flying through the dust storm they could see nothing but one never knew a sudden shift in the wind here and there might suddenly reveal a break the spets were in no mood for any more noncooperation especially by mongolians whom they no longer thought of as the master race that had terrorized and subdued their world under genghis khan but as there lackeys of siberian will they glimpsed another gher village during a break in the dust cover landed and asked about the americans the herdsmen eleven of them had nothing to tell them and were quickly shot then two spets held the youngest female a girl of about thirteen while a third spets raped her by locking his arms about her neck barely able to enter her because she was bucking so much the other two spets laughing until finally she was exhausted and groaning like a wounded animal bleeding having no option but to submit to his will then they shot her it was clear theyd get no information from the mongolians who were obviously more favorably disposed to the americans but at least from now on word would spread quickly through the ghers that if the spets wanted information youd better give it to them the hind took off through the dust cloud what are we looking for the spets pilot asked is he on a camel horseback walking or what we dont know the praporshnik an afghanistan veteran snapped well shoot anything that moves anything understood da frankly aussie told the wind he would have preferred a harley mtcc better suspension besides hed always fancied himself a bit of a rake on an electra glide in blue and like fonda not his commie fawning sister out on the road on the old harleydavidson still the kawasakis whine was just fine and head down goggles firmly attached he was making good time though learning that driving virtually blind visibility down to fifteen feet took more courage than hed thought man if his olga by the volga with the big tits could only see him now whoa through the dust he could see a darker dust looking like a huge scab a stationary sovietbuilt armed personnel carrier a bmp aussie knew the odds immediately a crew of three three passengers with assorted nasty small arms a main turret gunmm killing range twentyfive hundred yards also armed with a coaxial mm and antitank guided weapons stifling inside most of its infantry resting outside its hull armor plus or minus mm only thing in his favor was that the kawasaki was almost twice as fast as the bmp and if theyd seen him by the time theyd loaded up with their full complement of infantry hed be a quarter mile ahead anyway say byebye to ivan aussie told the kawasaki and gave it full throttle the next minute he was airborne the bike skidding furiously in front of him the right side of his del shredded to pieces by the gravel rash the spill driving the makharov hard into his groin he had the bike up its wheels still spinning and was resaddled in a matter of seconds pride a little punctured the earth exploding about him with smallarms fire but then he was flat out again into the curtain of dirt the bmps started chattering as if it felt left out followed by the steady thudthudthud of the mm but the shots were wild and well behind him but of course now the word would be out the lone sas was on a motorcycle heading east for choybalsan the bmp didnt even start its engine no doubt radioing his position to the next roadblock as he rode parallel to the herlen river road aboard the talon combat aircraft david brentwood salvini and choir williams were grimfaced at having had to leave aussie behind the only good news they could give freemans headquarters was that from what theyd seen the mongolians were clearly antichinese and that marshal yesov if he did have any plans of attacking the americans from the west wasnt going to get much help from the mongolian militia or the regulars otherwise the mongolian president would have had the foothills and the flats around the hentiyn nuruu swarming with patrols looking for the sasd team instead hed left it entirely up to his siberian guests chapter thirty the thing that struck frank shirer immediately about peshawar was the smell of the northern pakistani town one of smoke dust dung gasoline and spices that he was unfamiliar with which arose from the towns bazaars where one could wander down the street of partridge lovers or the street of the storytellers looking at the famed persian carpets and watching the coppersmiths beating out their wares in the timehonored way but if he thought he was in for any more sightseeing he was in for a shock as within an hour of landing at peshawar he was being familiarized with what had once been the cinderella of the fighter production line the harrier verticalshort takeoff and landing closesupportreconnaissance fighter now see ere a british nco said with me same kind of accent as that of the man called doolittle who had managed to help shirer fake his way through the eye chart exam at dutch harbor earlier in the war see weve placed two mm cannon hundred rounds per gun under the fuselage can carry up to eight thousand pounds of disposables if you like but if youre going up over the hindu kush mate its not bombs youre gonna need its height so apart from the airtoair missiles well put on your underwing hard points most of your weightll be extra gas and thirtymillimeter rounds okay suits me shirer said now how many hours have you had in em the nco asked none shirer said the nco looked at him aghast none blimey mate i ope youre a quick learner i can fly anything from a tomcat to a b yeah maybe so mate but you got runways there avent you well before the instructor gets here shirer said why dont you show me round the kitchen crikey youre keen ill say that about you thanks the nco began with the ejector seat martinbaker mark nine just in case right i like your sense of priorities sergeant the sergeant grinned loosened up a bit there youve got your hud smiths cant get em better than that and a smiths air data computer it comes to radar warning we hand you over to old marconi here and if you get lucky you can lock on with the ferranti laser range finder and target seeker youre strapped on top of a rollsroyce pegasus vectoredthrust turbofan maximum speed at low altitude plus or minus point nine maybe mach one if you fart ill remember this little babys big winner is the old viff those two titshe meant the ferry tips or lowdrag jet nozzlesare little marvels they are wivout them you might as well leave er parked in the garage thats what youll be spending most of your time on how to control those little buggers up down and around handled right can make a faster attacker look bloody stupid hopefully of course you wont have anyone attacking you you mean theres a good chance the mission might be off shirer asked oh i dunno about the politics of it mate but i mean the chowsdave to get their crackerjack fighters west in a big hurry in time to intercept any bombing raid wouldnt they i keep thinking they might have thought of that shirer said sardonically only if they know about the mission and with these dummy runs weve been making they probably dont have a clue the ground crew sergeant had no sooner finished talking than squadron leader j williams came out excitedly on the tarmac to exclaim its on just come through from london hq turpan when maam the sergeant asked four days time five at the outside shirer was in shock squadron leader williams was a petite blonde christ it was out before shirer could stop himself youre major shirer arent you she asked tersely taking her mood from his yes he said weve heard quite a lot about you you and your nemesis marchenko how many times did he shoot you down bloody hell thought the sergeant if he didnt get in between them thered be blood on the tarmac squadron leader williamsll be leading the harrier cover i take it that doesnt meet with your approval major she said tartly what er no i mean fine thats fine i hope youre a better flier than you are a liar she flashed an angry smile ill try good because youve only got four days think you can handle it ill handle it well see shirer knew rationally that there was no reason a woman shouldnt be a combat pilot no reason her reflexes shouldnt be as quick as his that she didnt need a mans physical strength to fly by wire so what was his problem he didnt like it thats what ah major shirer the sergeant tentatively said yes ah we dont call the ferry tips tits when the boss is around anything else i ought to know yes sir shes a damn good pilot can turn this little gremlin on a dime one more thing shes a stickler for discipline sounds like fun that night frank sat down to write a quick note to lana at dutch harbor he had to be circumspect about what he said and his letter was terse not only because of what the squadron censors would take out or because he was fatigued from ten hours straight on the harrier without yet having taken it up but because he simply could not bring himself as a oncehousehold name in america an american ace a tomcat veteran to tell lana that his boss was female and younger than he my boss is english he said and left it at that he knew he should be more broadminded more magnanimous but damn it hed flown tomcats hooking the threewire in zero visibility on a rolling deck when shed been going through puberty no way hed let on to thompson his replacement on the b that he was under the direct command of a woman damn now he knew why that toffeenosed fowlerjones had talked him into it they were so short of harrier pilots they were having to use skirts it was humiliating thats what it was all right so he was a male chauvinist pig but hell it just didnt seem right one thing for damn sure he was going to learn every possible thing about the harrier this little gremlin as the nco had put it that he could hed live on coffee alone in the next few days if thats what it took and go over the gremlin inch by inch until he knew every part of it why was it he wondered that men always called their ships and their aircraft she he pushed it out of his mind and buried himself in the manual for the ferranti inertial navigation and attack system the smith head up display much the same as hed seen before redeyed and determined shirer mastered the vertical takeoff and landing over the next twentyfour hours and was ready for highaltitude tests what was it she had said your nemesis marchenko cheeky bitch and whether it was her or some of the other pilots in the harrier squadron a rumor was going around that marchenko was now stationed somewhere in eastern china as an adviser on the migs chapter thirtyone as the crunchy ice gave way beneath his boots freeman had pondered his strategy to go south while the missiles remained intact at turpan to the southwest would be suicide yet to wait much longer for cheng to build up his forces in manchuria east of the bulk of second army would be equally disastrous yet to mount a frontal attack on the manchurian border all along the amur would also be suicidal he watched the small trickles of water formed by the stamp of his boots flattening the ice and was reminded how at night images of rivers had kept running through his dreams not in a gurgling hypnotic sleepgiving way but more as impediments to his sleep in childhood rain falling on the barn roof in the midwest and later on the barracks at fort ord and his home at monterey had always given him comfort so why not now what was the running water trying to tell him often before a problem had resolved itself for him while he had been asleep but to date the dreams of water were elusive in their message if the ice suddenly melted on the amur his tanks would sink without a trace but anyone knew that the more he thought of the message of the water the more he thought of the work of the ancient chinese warrior whose book on the art of war had been beside his bedside along with the king james version of the bible what was it that cao cao one of sun tzus lieutenants had said to him the military has no constant form just as water has no constant shape adapt as you face the enemy adapt freeman told himself and now another of master suns lieutenants spoke to him use deception to throw them into confusion lead them on in order to take them freeman stopped suddenly in the snow more rivulets running from his boots like streams finding the easiest runoff path the line of least resistance often the most obvious answers were hidden because of the maze of detail what was it you couldnt see the woods for the trees well freeman had suddenly seen through the trees into the heart of sun tzu as he turned back to his headquarters hut his minders found it difficult to keep up with him he was walking so fast aussie lewis knew he was on the horns of a dilemma the spets knew he was headed east in the direction of choybalsan where he would no doubt turn north but now all the river crossings that would take him north to the uscontrolled siberian border would be manned if not blocked by bmps and the river was deep wide and particularly dangerous now great lumps of ice were piling up at the bends in the river it was a strange landscape the temperature rising daily sending up forests of mist dropping to freezing and below at night and now the dust storm was beginning to abate it was pm come morning the storm would probably disappear altogether a fresh easterly overcoming the west wind that had brought on the storm he saw a blur up ahead then another for a moment they seemed in his fatigued saddlesore state like sheep but in fact they were the outlines of two or three ghers the question was had the spets had time to reach this settlement and spring some kind of trap shutting down the kawasaki then lowering it with some effort to its side to break any possible silhouette he took out his kbar knife and moved forward into the dust storm it was only as he got a hundred yards or so closer that he realized what had happened why the settlement of the three or four ghers had looked like sheep shrunken in size the smell of wood smoke now mixed with the dust and he guessed in a moment what had happened as he came stealthily upon the first gher his guess was proven right the ghers had been burned to the ground and in a small depression in the middle of them lay the murdered bodies of the few families who had been there and who could not tell the spets that they had seen the escaping american lewis had seen some painful sights in his time but this turned his stomach one of the children disemboweled he could feel the bile rising within him as he saw another small childs body its head crushed by a rock a rag doll held tightly lying still in the dust storm that was howling eerily about him the sand smattering on his goggles aussie could see a circle of sand and pebbles that had been thrown up by the spets helicopter the butchery had all the signs of a ferocious haste one of the ghers still smoking one mongolian an elder probably the head herdsman having been struck halfway down between two of the ghers surrounded now by bleating sheep it was clear the chopper had gone but lewis taking no chances crept slowly toward the wreckage of the first gher and smiled whispering as if choir brentwood or salvini was by his side the stupid bastards with the canvas felt wooden doors and slats lewis went to work with his kbar knife stopping now and then to make a quick circuit of the burnedout ghers in the event that anyone had returned but he was alone in the dust storm when he had finished it wasnt pretty to look at but if he didnt get caught between two chunks of rogue ice the rough raft he had fashioned would get him and the kawasaki across the river to the northern side he kept two sturdy roof poles apart and now put them in the center of the raft as he hauled it back toward the kawasaki as hard as this was the most difficult part he knew would be getting the raft into the water once it was loaded with the kawasaki using the two poles as the rafts slipway suddenly he stopped for he thought he heard a noise nearby he whipped out the makharovmm but saw nothing thinking it must be the bleating of one of the sheep the other side of the river which he could see only dimly now and then in the dust storm was about a hundred yards away and if his guess was right the current would carry him swiftly toward a lefttoright bend in the river that would push the raft into a jumble of ice that had collected at the turn there but that would allow him to leap ashore and anchor the raft before the swirling eddies about the bend once again took it out into me river chapter thirtytwo the radio message coming in to canadian forces base esquimalt on the southern tip of vancouver island just north of washington states olympic peninsula was garbled panicky reported the us coast guard who was also picking up the message off whidbey island as well as being an sos the signal patched together made it seem that the southern star a fishprocessing factory ship out of seattle which had headed out to beat its competition with four small fast trawlers was saying something about an enemy submarine it sounded highly improbable given the extensive sosus underwater hydrophone or microphone array network along the west coast for this reason neither esquimalt nor the submarine base at bangor washington was inclined to take the report seriously there was no storm that as in the case of torpedoed tankers at the start of the siberian war could have masked the sound of an enemy sub attack besides with the sea wolfclass uss aaron peal the dualpurpose attack and icbm nuclear sub egressing through the degaussing or demagnetizing station on behm canal further north on the british columbiaalaska border it was considered extremely unlikely that the sea wolfs sonar wouldnt have detected any large enemy sub movement further out in the north pacific would have been a different matter with enemy subs expected to be nosing about the perimeter of the old soviet buffer zone that stretched halfmoonshaped from the bering sea south to southwest toward the kuril islands north of japan lying in wait for the vital convoys en route to freemans second army but going by the radio message the southern star was within the wellpatrolled twohundredmile zone off the canadianus mainland ah washington state coast guard pronounced they probably saw one of our hunterkillers going out on patrol started shitting themselves or a school of fish the second officer added the sudden shifts in water color caused by the quicksilverlike veering of nearsurface feeders could suddenly alter the pattern of water giving it a shivery patch look a patch often mistaken by fishermen especially in wartime for the change occasioned by rapid temperature shifts at the waterair interface caused by a subs venting excess fresh water a side effect of its abundant nuclear power a suspiciouslooking patch could also be produced by the upwelling of hydrothermal vents or hot springs on the sea floor whose spouting columns racing up through the cold layers produced a bubbling effect on the oceans surface akin to a huge globule of oil popping and expanding on the surface in less dense water the mv southern star her listing on the coast guards manifest showing that she was a fish processor of tons was asked politely calmly whether she could have been mistaken no way the immediate reply came this time unencumbered by any kind of static nothing garbled about that the coast guard duty officer said must have seen something i guess notify whidbey island they can send out a chaser within twenty minutes a p orion replete with sonobuoys and other asw equipment including eight mk depth bombs eight pound bombs six mk torpedoes and six twothousandpound mines on underwing hard points was being dispatched on full alert speed at mph after the saboteur attack on a trident sub by an antitank missile earlier in the war as she had egressed hood canal the duty officer wasnt about to take chances even though he believed the lookouts on southern star had seen no enemy sub but perhaps a whale breaching with its mad magnetic anomaly detector boom an extension of the planes tail on active the orion made for the last reported position of the southern star and within twenty minutes of crossing the surffringed ribbon of vancouver islands long beach saw the factory ship the dots on the southern stars forward deck waving frantically up at the aircraft more crew members spilling out by the second as if by sheer force of numbers they could somehow convince the aircraft to shepherd them into port what are they worried about the orions radar operator asked no ones gonna go after a fish boat yeah the copilot wryly said but figure its you down there buddy boy and you thought youd seen a hostile youd want protection too from the southern stars position the copilot gave the captain a search pattern for possible hunterkillers in the area that taking the southern star as its center extended in a circle two hundred miles in diameter the only anomaly the mad picked up was metalliferous deposits around sea mounts where superheated water from the unstable sea floor southwest of vancouver island had streamed up causing minerals to be leached out as the hot plume hit the colder water of the northeast pacific but these anomalies were already marked clearly on the oceanographic charts unless the radar operator proffered a hostile has nestled in all cozylike against a sea mount using the magnetic mineral deposits as a cover siberian or chinese sub wouldnt know the sea bottom that well around here youd need to have it laid out like the back of your hand buddy boy maybe they do dont think so our navy didnt put up with any of the oceanographic research bullshit the soviet trawlers tried to pull goddamn things had so many aerials sproutin from them they looked like anemones kicked their ass out of here years ago anyway tricky business hanging around sea mounts all those canyons running off the base turbidity currents galore sub could end up gettin buried in a friggin great mudslide i dunno they might try it specially if theyre chicom diesels the senior asw officer took the point everyone was thinking about siberian subs a cold war habit but the chinese had subs too and being diesel electric they were often more dangerous than nuclear subs the nuclear boats though faster always had to have the water pumps going to cool the reactor and so gave off sound the diesel electrics just as capable at firing torpedoes or icbms could go on battery and remain completely silent hey im easy to get along with the senior asw officer said drop a deuce and see what we get you got it with that two chuteborn sonobuoys were popped out of the left side of the aircraft the sensitive mikes that would unravel twenty feet below the airsea interface would send back any abnormal sound from the noisy world of the deep freemans convoys couldnt afford to lose one ship even so the best asw equipment in the world told the asw crew aboard the p orion that the southern star must have seen a ghost as when everchanging cloud patterns threw light and dark shapes on the sea there was a tendency at sea to see what you feared most like a child at night imagining that a coat hanging in a dark hallway was an intruder chapter thirtythree aussie lewis dragged the long tenbysixfoot raft of wooden slats and canvas down to the rivers edge at a point where he estimated the current would take him diagonally across to the other side where the bend in the river was jammed with floes of ice coagulated where the current had narrowed with darkness approaching he fed the two long poles that he was going to use as a slipway into the water and firmly anchored the raft by means of ten tough hide straps which in turn were held fast by wooden stakes that hed driven into the sandy soil with the butt of his ak with slipway and raft held steady he went up the bank to bring down the kawasaki he saw movement near it dropped and heard a noise the same low moan he thought hed heard before it was a mongolian herdsman lying next to the bike he must have made his way down to the river as aussie had done a lastminute check around the ghers aussie switched the ak off safety and going low crawled about to the right of the kawasaki so as to come up behind the man if the man had punctured his gas tank aussie swore hed take his head off at the neck when aussie was only a few feet from him he could see the old man had done nothing of the sort aussie could see the mans del bloodsoaked to the chest he had been one of those who had been shot by the spets who were punishing them for not knowing anything of the sasd when he saw aussie in the tattered del he gestured with what little energy he had left for the sasd trooper to come closer lewis moved his finger off the safety of the ak and could tell from the old mans chest wound that he was not long for this world it was a miracle he had managed to crawl so far from the rubble of the ghers aussie lewis knelt beside him and gave him several sips of water from the motorcycles canteen the man made as if to talk but could only gesture the same kind of moan coming from his throat but it was as clear as a desert day in that dark dustriven twilight what he wanted begging lewis to finish him off to see that his agony might not go on aussie couldnt use the ak for fear of the shots being heard but the old man was reading his thoughts and drew his hand across his own throat aussie lewis nodded and with an agnostics hedging of the bet made the sign of the cross on the old man whose hands now stretched out from his side perhaps the old man would understand perhaps not aussie took out his kbar knife and quickly drew it across the old mans throat the blood spurted then gurgled like a crimson brook and it was done aussie then dug a hole in the sand and covered the old man leaving a hastily rigged cross from two of the gher slats then he lifted the kawasaki it felt twice as heavy as before as he wheeled the bike aboard the raft and again had to lower it before cutting the leather straps that had held the raft in place immediately he began pushing on the stern oar a long slat hard to port to catch the current a piece of jagged ice about four feet square bumped into the raft sent a shudder through it then another hit it amidships bloody hell was lewiss response but in the swift current he was now already a third of the way across the river with only seventy yards to go desperately working the rudder hard to port lest he be sucked into the fastflowing midbend channel but the length of the raft took care of that for it couldnt make a sharp turn and its front end was already crashing and splintering into the packed ice of the bend in a flash aussie was racing through the ice jam with the painter of hide and anchoring the hide rope to a stake he was driving hard into the ground then without pausing for breath he hauled for all his might the ice jam now helping him slide the raft albeit bumpily a few feet forward acting like glider wheels beneath the raft but then one of two pieces obstructed him suddenly he could pull it no further he felt the impact of several more lumps of ice hitting the stern of the raft but paid no attention going back and starting the kawasaki on its side holding it in neutral then lifting it up and in one movement pushing it hard forward and accelerating in gear he was off the raft in a second and up the side of the riverbank heading north of the river through the tractless dornod depression not toward the great wall which was hundreds of miles to the south but instead toward the stillexistent wall of genghis khan he estimated it would be about miles to the border three to four hours if he made good time barring any other impediments certainly the spets would think he was still on the southern side of the herlen river heading east toward choybalsan rather than north now and then he had to slow down on the rockstrewn stretches but at others the firm grassland still hard despite the thaw from its winter hardness gave him a surprisingly fast and relatively comfortable ride no problems he assured the kawasaki not to worry chapter thirtyfour an attack on the chinese front norton said general i thought you said never mind what i said dick get my corps commanders here for a meeting at oh nine hundred hours the general listened intently to what david brentwood had to say namely that it seemed quite clear from everything theyd seen that the mongolians were in no mood to die on marshal yesovs behalf that the mongolians in short had taken perestroika and glasnost as seriously as the eastern europeans the mongolians wouldnt be a problem but from what theyd seen of the spets behavior yesov couldnt be trusted never did trust that son of a bitch how about this lewis brentwood said they just didnt know he was as resourceful in the desert as any other clime that the sas had been trained for and they had dropped him a kawasaki a what kawasaki jesus christ freeman said you mean we couldnt even get him an allamerican bike no one knew quite what to say ill tell you something brentwood the general said his eyes glowering someone back in detroit needs their ass kicked for letting japan take over like that goddamn disgraceful yes general course freeman said it was doug macarthurs fault got to thinking he was goddamn king of japan gave women the vote then helped japan build up new factories to outindustrialize us i tell you brentwood thats what happens when a man gets too far from the good old us of a and he starts going native and nato on you eisenhower was the same damn it kept holding georgie patton back on a leash patton couldve stopped the cold war before it began yes sir yes well long as the sonofabitch motorbike gets him here he got a rescue beeper purple flare yes sir well i want every chopper outfit west of manzhouli to keep on alert so that we can go in and pick him up soon as hes close enough if he gets close enough yes sir now if he gets back hell be part of operation front door the door gentlemen being the amur or as the chicoms call it the black dragon brentwood sir i want you to take a squadron of your men in here as norton listened to the plan unfold a smile began to replace his earlier apprehension it was brilliant vintage freeman daring all right but still there was always the question would it work after the general left the quonset hut to relieve himself someone remarked im glad our helos are american made right another said but the friggin beeper isnt and half the electronics aboard the chopper are japa quiet here he comes as freeman began to go into more detail salvini brentwood and choir found it hard to concentrate they were thinking of aussie lewis alone in the mongolian expanse special operations had already lost one man earlier in the war in a commando raid near nanking smythe and he was now rotting away in beijing jail number one a chinese jail they said was unimaginable the jewish woman alexsandra malof had been in the harbin jail to stay alive she had to lick the walls for moisture and pick out tiny pieces of undigested food from her feces when she escaped they said she was thin as a rake chapter thirtyfive in beijing general cheng was about to switch off his reading light above the antimacassartopped lounge chair that was the only luxury he allowed himself he was reading transcripts of general schwarzkopfs press conferences during the iraqi war most of it was routine stuff silly questions by silly reporters who had no idea of the complexity of war but one answer of schwarzkopfs was burned into chengs memory and he had it marked for the red box the documents that would be taken to the military central committee schwarzkopf had said theres black smoke and haze in the air its an infantrymans weather god loves the infantryman and thats just the kind of weather the infantryman likes to fight in but i would also tell you that our sights have worked fantastically well in their ability to acquire through that kind of dust and haze the enemy targets and the enemy sights have not worked that well as a matter of fact weve had several anecdotal reports today of enemy who were saying to us that they couldnt see anything through their sights and all of a sudden their tank exploded when their tank was hit by our sights cheng had made an immediate rush order via la roches front companies in hong kong for the infrared night vision particularly the thermalimaging sights that could cut through smoke and dust plus additional supplies of smoke thickener that had caused freemans tanks so much trouble when yesov had used it up around lake baikal before the ceasefire the other thing cheng was banking on was that delivery of the newer abrams ma tank which had two gun sights one for the gunner and one for the tank commander to track two targets simultaneously unlike the m in which both commander and gunner had to share the same sight the delivery had been delayed by the widespread sabotage carried out in the united states from dockside to communications chapter thirtysix the two us destroyers footlong knoxclass warships of tons each and manned by seamen along with a canadian tribalclass destroyer whose previous twin angled stacks were now one in order to reduce her lineofsight infrared signature moved at flank speed on patrol slicing through long pacific swells they were heading toward the lastreported sos position of the disabled factory ship the mv southern star which had reported earlier that she might have seen a submarine in the area being fished by her four trawlers the three investigating destroyers were three miles apart seventyone miles out southwest of long beach on vancouver island on the main egress or navy exit track for us and canadian warships coming out of the pacific northwest suddenly there was a feral roar enormous mushrooms of foaming water both knoxclass destroyers ripped apart sinking within minutes the only reason some survivors thirtyseven in all were plucked up from the oil and debrisscummed water was that the canadian destroyer was slower and running three miles astern of the americans when the pressureactivated mines blew gashing the destroyers open the modern ships thin armor plate a concession in the constant tugofwar between more equipment and speed five hundred and seventy men and twentysix women aboard the us ships perished tragic as it was the loss of the destroyers to the us navy was hardly something in itself to undo the strategy of the chief naval officer in washington but the damage was far worse than at first supposed for the entire egress channels for the northwest were now an unknown factor meaning that each cargo vessel submarine or us warship setting out to sea off the pacific northwest had to make a onethousandmile southern detour loop to avoid the suspect area thus effectively bottling up andor delaying large sections of compacs west coast fleet the sinkings became a crisis because of the cluster of questions pressing the cno why didnt the us navy know about the mines how could a submarine recalling the southern stars sighting mine such a huge area if it was huge and not merely local just as alarming how could an enemy submarine get so close in undetected if enemy submarines could do this with impunity within a stones throw of our coastline the new york times had asked what were the implications for the desperately needed resupply of freemans second army the cnos spokesperson gave a terse no comment at this time to the scrum of reporters dogging her and the cno as the admiral prepared to enplane the helicopter in washington to report directly to the president at mount weather as he was whisked across the line into virginia cno admiral horton was now giving much more credence to the southern stars initial report and ordered compaccommander pacific to have his chief of naval intelligence send someone immediately out to the southern star to interview her captain and crew before she limped back to dock and before airborne experts were rushed out by the tv networks and la roches tabloids this proved impossible there was no difficulty locating the southern star despite the failure of the navy and the factory ships four trawlers to make radio contact in surges of static afflicting the northwestern states the problem was that the ship wasnt where she was supposed to be the southernflowing californian current taking the disabled vessel to a point sixty miles off the olympic peninsula the swells lethargically moving the big ship to and fro like a wallowing whale who had lost all sense of direction when lieutenant eleanor brady a vivacious redhead who compacs intelligence officer craftily gauged would elicit much more response than her male counterparts was lowered by harness onto the southern stars aft helicopter deck there was no one to greet her southern star was far from a ghost ship however the bodies of the two hundred men who had crewed her were painfully visible strewn all over the ship in the galley walkways others having been shot down in midmeal others murdered in their bunks the officers on watch and the lookouts found sprawled amid the debris of shattered glass on the bridge the ships telegraph still set for full ahead though the engines while still warm were dead the commandos who eleanor brady supposed had obviously taken over the ship had moved with grotesque swiftness and thoroughness in the cavernous engine room over twenty men many more than usually would be on shift had sought frantic refuge and now lay dead to say lieutenant bradys discovery shocked her would be an understatement when other naval intelligence officers arrived aboard the ship from bangor they found her ashenfaced the ammunition used was quickly ascertained to be depleteduraniumtipped mm of the kind used by spets at first the theory was that spets aboard some other merchantman had somehow taken over one of the four trawlers and once aboard the southern star had been the ones to radio in the sighting of a submarine in order to lure the americans into the mine field thus inciting a massive panic attack amid the navy brass and precipitating an equally massive lack of confidence in the navy throughout the country pressure mines the cno informed the president would not have shown up on the subchasing orions magnetic anomaly detector as the mines were often manufactured of nonmagnetic plastic composite the supposition that the spets had sent out the message to lure the allied ships made sense but then questions were asked about where they had come from in the first place satellite pictures showed no other surface vessel within a hundred miles of the southern star had there been a sub as the southern star first reported a sub carrying spets commandos all the theories fell apart however when the four trawlers were found between a and mile radius from the southern stars last position furthermore none of the four trawlers had seen any other vessels the other common agreement among the four skippers being that they had been unable to contact southern star after midnight with the certainty of ice turning blood cold the truth began to sink in and the director of naval intelligence along with the cno knew he would have to inform the president without delay the dni his gold rings catching the velvety firelight in the deceptively calm atmosphere of the presidents mount weather lounge gave the president the bad news that contrary to first suspicions the spets had certainly not come from a submarine the undersea sounddetection network was working fine both us and canadian ships out of bangor and esquimalt respectively having run prosigs prop signature recognition tests in the hours following the southern star incident and to show that everything had been working properly it was pointed out that the shore sosus stations had plotted the canadian and us warships exact positions and given detailed computer visual recognition of the ships and their armaments within twenty seconds of first noise pickup a sub would likewise have been picked up by sosus with the same ease even if a sub had been hiding near a hot spot using the sound of thermal vents to mask it once the sub made any move to attack or release mines sosus would have picked it up if there were no subs in the area the president asked then where the hell did the spets come from mr president the dni replied they were already there he paused aboard the southern star sleepers southern star laid the mines its difficult for the layman the dni began stopped short by a warning glance from the cno im sorry sir the dni corrected himself i mean for nonnavy personnel to realize but a ship that size fifteen thousand tons while not a big vessel in navy terms is plenty big enough to hide a couple of automobiles without anyone noticing if the parts are brought aboard piece by piece pressure mines would be a cinch chicom agents among the crew could have been stashing them aboard for months even years waiting to be dumped in the event of war so far the dni continued weve listed thirty crewmen not accounted for all chinese names out of san francisco but in all honesty wed have to search the vessel for days to be absolutely certain there are so many nooks and crannies a body might have been dumped in they would have killed the crew before dumping the mines mayne proffered thats what it looks like mr president what puzzled us for a while is how they got away but we think we have the answer for that one now the factory ships helicopter is gone so its pretty clear they escaped to shore flying low taking advantage of wave clutter to avoid our radar but could thirty men i mean against two hundred mr president it would have taken only ten commandos from the guo an bu chinese intelligence or anywhere else against unarmed men they used grenades as well for mayne this was the last straw the attack on hillsboros cesium clock the sabotage against the huge electric grid the water poisoning in new york and other cities and now his entire west coast sealift shipping having to be rerouted losing days possibly weeks in reaching freeman he and his cabinet decided he had no alternative but to extend and widen the emergency powers act curfews and empowering the police to arrest on there suspicion and suspension of mirandizing suspects he turned to trainor whose gaze during the crisis seemed morbidly attracted to the flickering of the fireplace trainor cancel all my appointments in the morning wha ah yes mr president trainor answered embarrassed at being caught daydreaming his attention having momentarily been drawn to the crumbling symbolism of logs collapsing in the fire suddenly there was a bang the door flew open the two secret service men already either side of mayne one of them his uzi drawn the other knocking the president to the floor crouching protectively over him everyone down somebody in the marine corps detachment guarding mount weather had goofed and inadvertently thrown a couple of cypress logs in the stack of firewood a knot in the wood having exploded enough the president said damn it chapter thirtyseven taiwan in his home port of kaohsiung on taiwans far southwest coast admiral kuang was waiting he had been waiting for twenty years and another few weeks here or there didnt matter if his dream of personally leading an invasion across the straits came true after which he would personally go to hangchow which marco polo believed to be the most beautiful place on earth and there cross the west lake to raze maos hallowed villa to the ground but kuang knew that in taipei the war council would not release him until they saw the american freeman was fully committed to an attack from the north kuang knew his lieutenant had promised the american general his full support when the time came but it was a half truth a promise based on the assumption that freeman would lead off and so draw the bulk of chengs army northward away from the straits of taiwan but now kuangs agents had told the admiral about the chicoms sabotage via the southern star on the american west coast which would seriously delay resupply for freeman kuang was anxious it involved his word as an officer to help freeman he had as the americans would say stuck his neck out knowing that only if taipei was willing to move could he had the admiral known however the full measure of the growing pressure against freeman by chengs northern buildup in manchuria he would have relaxed for freeman in the face of chengs buildup would have to do something and quickly or be crushed by the manchurian colossus still freeman in view of the sabotage on the united states particularly that on the west coast delaying his sealift might be tempted to hold back kuang sent an encoded signal to freemans hq that decoded read simply mercury freeman could move or not but kuangs message would tell him the roc navy was ready to invade the beaches of fukien and thus take pressure off freeman after freeman read the message there were tears in his eyes he pulled out a tissue and blew his nose hard damn dust in this hut doesnt anybody clean it chapter thirtyeight you dumb bastard aussie castigated himself in the neardawn light he was less than a hundred miles from the border and was ready to use the beeper to bring in an e vac when he heard the ominous chudchudchud of a bugeyed hind coming from behind him to the south it had been the cross probably a spets chopper or ground patrol for that matter had probably come across the cross and then once alerted they might have seen the leftovers and signs of his raft making in any case he told the kawasaki they were in deep shit and hed have to think fast he picked one of the narrow gullies up ahead that went into an scurve probably following an old dried riverbed given the size of the boulders and sand dunes between them he pulled the kawasaki into the gully laid it down on its side took off his del scooping sand underneath it quickly sculpturing it into a body shape by the collapsed motorcycle sweat streaking his blueandwhite spets undershirt as he pulled out the fifteenpound rpg and two of its fivepound rounds and scrambled further down into the gully amid a small island of dunes and boulders scattered along its base the chudchudchud of the fiverotor chopper not yet visible was coming closer and then suddenly its shadow passed over the gully and went into a turn the pilot no doubt having seen the splayed figure by the bike and realizing that the gully was too narrow to land turned the helo about coming down as close as he could to inspect the scene in the indistinct light the rotors blowing sand every which way obscuring his view the chopper suddenly rose turned abaft further away from the fallen kawasaki then lowered its rope ladder two spets aks slung across their backs were already descending aussie knew the rpg well enough from enemy arms training he knew thered be no backblast to give him away as he moved behind the rocks further away from the kawasaki with the chopper about meters away he was well within range of the rpgs five hundred meters unlike with the controls of the sagger or spigot antitank weapons he would have no toggle by which to steer either horizontally or vertically it was strictly line of sight aimhit or miss the chopper was drifting now about meters away leaning against a boulder aussie inhaled exhaled half his breath held the rest to subdue any nerve tremor saw the lower spets about to jump from the ladder and fired feeling the strong jerk backward the pilot must have seen something coming at him and banked hard right but with the warhead traveling at two hundred meters per second the helo couldnt escape the antitank round hitting it below the left engine intake the hind exploding like some huge airborne animal pieces of shard metal much of it aluminum looking like flaccid skin as they flew through the air falling to the earth like so much tin among the stones then the deafening roar of me gas explosion spewing out bodies like toys the man who had been at the bottom of the ladder had been blown to the ground by the downdraft and was now walking or rather stumbling around holding his head aussie immediately raced forward the man saw him coming and fumbled for the ak but lewis had three shots off each one hitting the russian the man was still alive when lewis reached him holding his head as if in pain as lewis pumped another into him thatll cure your headache aussie said and this ones for those kids back there in the pit you bastard aussie was back on the kawasaki and took off pushing the beeper mad at himself again he should have been able to fell the spets with one shot and not got mad when he was doing it his old instructor in hereford would have chewed him out for that but then the old instructor wasnt dog tired and on the run no excuses he told himself no bloody whining lewis now come on you air cav where the fuck are you they two blackhawks were locked onto the beeper via an awac feed and they were coming in low over the mongolian sand withs nosing out the doors and four f eagles flying cover and within eleven minutes a blackhawks rotor was stinging aussie with small stones the size of marbles jesus christ he complained as he jumped aboard fucking near stoned me to death welcome aboard the corporal said thanks mate aussie said shaking his hand you saved my bacon the corporal shouting over the roar of the rotors as they headed across the dmz to the ussiberian territory east of baikal handed aussie two envelopes one was from freemans headquarters telling him to report there to major david brentwood immediately upon his return the second was from salvini and brentwood the note was terse you owe us a bundle we were hoisted aboard talon quicker than you bastards aussie said who the corporal yelled his voice barely audible my mates aussie answered david brentwood had suggested to freeman that aussie lewis be excused participation in operation front door he wounded freeman asked no sir but hes been on the run for then hell have his second wind freeman said this isnt a lunch break operations so important every man designated is needed especially with a commandos experience is that understood yes sir well i want you to go over the plan once more fill in lewis once he gets here or en route to the target ill leave the decision to you hell have six hours to sleep before the mission david brentwood was about to say that aussie would appreciate that but his discretion got the better part of cheekiness with freeman one thing you couldnt fault freeman for work and one thing that drove washington up the wall was the generals determination to lead his own men into action hed done it at pyongyang over ratmanov island at nizhneangarsk and now he was willing to do it again like patton rommel and macarthur before him he had a fatalism in the face of fire that either awed men or struck them as bone stupid when aussie lewis showed up his blueandwhite spets shirt was filthy torn to shreds also his del was missing what happened to your dress choir asked yeah salvini said you cant come like that i can come anywhere aussie said where we goin little job on the old rampart salvini answered what fucking rampart genghis khans you ignorant man choir said not the great wall another one in manchuria only a couple of hours flying from here christ i havent had breakfast the australian replied choir williams tuttutted its breakfast he wants shouldve kept up with us then boyostead of playing silly buggers on that bike yeah salvini added and you owe me five bucks david brentwood smiled inwardly at the esprit de corps among the commandos at the unemotional emotion of welcoming aussie back all right lewis said as someone threw him a towel and a bar of soap whats it this time mongolian gear or wall street bankers in our own kit mate choir williams said full sas aussie was impressed must be serious then it is brentwood confirmed pointing down at the computerenhanced threedimensional map of northern manchuria simulated attacks all along the line simulated aussie asked you mean we just yell out at them frighten em a bit real attacks david answered half a dozen places from manzhouli in the west to fuyuan in the east near khabarovsk right across the manchurian front but if we go full frontal aussie began thatd be crazy david brentwood finished for him agreed aussie said the general knows that brentwood assured him what we have to do is create so much racket make it look like a full frontal attack do more than yell at them aussie tie down chengs troops all along the manchurian border so that our second army can make its dash south of manzhouli into the gobi where freeman can hit them on their left flank if it works sal said well be halfway to beijing before cheng wakes up and can withdraw any of his forces from the north to reinforce his left flank all right aussie said but how are we going to convince the chinese its a fullout attack when it isnt dont you think theyll twig to that david brentwood looked up from the threedimensional mockup you know freeman goes to sleep reading sun tzu who the hells son sue an ancient chinese general brentwood said very big on the art of war very big on deception right aussie said i dont suppose it occurred to any of you blokes that old cheng might read this son sue you know being chinese and all that salvini looked worried i think brentwood said that when you have the chance to see the plan in detail youll see how freemanll outfox cheng david brentwood paused by the way aussie everyone is to bring a lighter with him theres a box of bics over on the counter and one quart bag of this he nodded toward a cardboard box packed with quartsize plastic bags each bag filled with what looked like gray powder what the hells that aussie asked wolf dung brentwood answered matteroffactly dont bullshit me aussie riposted brentwood shook his head at salvini and williams hes a hard man to convince ten bucks its wolf dung choir williams proffered salvini couldnt suppress a snort of laughter aussie eyed them suspiciously what are you bastards up to go on brentwood told him clean up have breakfast and hit the sack well fill you in en route all right david brentwood said its airland battle right right came the chorus of twenty sasd troopers there were a million details for any airland battle and for the twenty men to be led by david brentwood the first was weapon selection and uniform weapon selection was very much an individual affair among the commandos but the uniform wasnt not on this predawn attack that hopefully would penetrate the chicom line in enough places to convince cheng that a fullscale frontal attack was in progress there would be many more sasd troops along the amur together with regular elements of second army involved most of the sas elected to arm themselves with the american mm m rifle rather than the threepoundsheavier british mm particularly with the m grenade launcher fitted beneath the barrel of the m rifle others like brentwood who had seen freeman in action on ratmanov island opted for the militarymodified winchester riot gun with five shotgun shells one up the spout four in the tubular magazine the pumping effected by the forestock going back and forth the range of the shotgun increased from to yards by fléchettes twenty highquality steel darts leadslug shells were also carried these being capable of passing right through an engine block at over fifty meters or blowing a door out of its frame and almost every man carried at least several soup cans smoke grenades and the smaller palmsize sas special the stun grenade but because it would be an attack in darkness and could well be at close quarters in the town of manzhouli the uniform was the allblack sas antiterrorist gear including the sf respirator in case the chinese used gas black leather gloves for rappelling down or climbing up the genghis khan wall or any other wall for that matter danner lightweight firmgrip boots favored by us swat teams and each mans black belt kit holding magazine pouches and grenades and thirteen rounds of mm for the browning automatic all right fellas now lets go over the airland prayer one maneuver the chorused reply came two fire support three command and control four intelligence five combat service support six mobility survivability seven air defense eight aussie shouted best of fucking luck brentwood grinned now our shortrange fighterbombers and wild weasel jammers will penetrate as deeply as they can at points all along the line to simulate full frontal attack main battle tanks will go in where possible with bradley fastfighting infantry vehicles behind and with apache helos as antitank cover this will be followed by hueys eleven men apiece some helos carrying a one oh five millimeter howitzer and crew now behind all this theres the patriot missile defense should we be bothered by anything from turpan but remember the patriot is great but is overestimated unless it hits the enemy missiles warhead and explodes it midair it simply blasts the body of the incoming missile and the warhead still comes down it isnt a great deal of help to us no matter what you read in the papers got it got it now brentwood continued therell be sasdgreen beret special operations squadrons hitting fuyuan near khabarovsk another sasd team hitting at heihe halfway along the amur a third commando force targeting shiwei and the fourth team us will be paying a return visit near our old friend a there was a groan from several of the veterans who had vivid memories of the fighting atop the foot mountain just north of manzhouli in the siberian argunskiy range it marked the most northwesterly point or corner of the manchurian arc defense line that stretched from khabarovsk up around neverskovorodino and down into western manchuria a had been the very spot where the war had started before the socalled ceasefire and so would now be heavily fortified its high ground having a commanding view of the american side of the line dont worry david said anticipating his men a will be left to our air force and about time choir williams quipped so give us the bad news aussie said well be going southeast beyond a into manzhouli brentwood answered just east of manzhouli were to secure the railhead there so cheng cant move troops west out of northern manchuria and hit freemans left flank old cheng wont have to move anything choir williams said if those chink missiles arent taken out in turpan thats the air forces job david said well they better get on with it boyo or else well be in range while were in bloody manzhouli question it was from one of the young american sasd troopers look i know our shortrange bombers cant take out turpan its just too far west but why cant we use them against manzhouli i mean just go in and blow up the tracks david gave a wry smile the trooper was one of the latest recruits not yet blooded if wed been able to blow up train tracks and trails wed have won the vietnam war in the first two years only way to make sure that railway stays ours is to go into manzhouli there are a hundred different ways of the enemy making it look as if youve destroyed their train lines from the air and the next morning theyve passed a thousand tons of munitions over it only way is to go in on the ground and make sure besides theyve got a communications tower there so well have to hit it with c charges aussie thatll be your troops job thanks very much well hell aussie you cant ask for everything someone shouted jesus i wish i was with that fuyuan crowd a few of the newer men didnt understand and werent as confident as veterans like aussie or brentwood salvini or williams in knowing there was no shame in saying youd rather be somewhere else ah choir williams said nodding his head toward aussie pay him no mind lads he misses olga he does he likes the titty bloody right i do aussie said why are we all black aussie asked his question wasnt meant as any kind of joke for normally sas were allowed some leeway in the choice of uniform but all black antiterrorist usually meant closequarter combat freeman doesnt want manzhouli bombed so if were to clear it itll be house to house brentwood said tersely right aussie said quickly exchanging an m for a stockless heckler koch mm mpk submachine gun you aimed it by jabbing it toward the target and adjusting your aim according to the hits the last thing that every man checked was the black gloves for quite apart from the rappelling down and climbing up that might be necessary word had come down that it would be a fast rope descent from the helos h hour was set for hours the pilots aboard the pave lows would be flying on night vision and by hover coupler which would orchestrate gyroscope radar altimeter and inertial guidance system readouts to keep the helo steady and very low apart from anything else salvini reminded one of the newcomers the sas black antiterrorist uniform is meant to frighten the enemy you dont need one then sal aussie quipped youre ugly enough already we show them salvini and its instant fuckin surrender up yours salvini told aussie promise all right you guys brentwood said lets move out four of you attach yourselves to myself lewis williams or salvini hey davey aussie asked brentwood as they went out onto the chita strip whats all this crap about freeman not wanting to bomb the towns and villages dont know aussie part of the strategy he gone soft in the head or something freeman i doubt it so do i so why the hell brentwood couldnt hear aussies last word as a brisk wind was blowing east off of lake baikal a bitter edge to it as the pave lows began warming up their stuttering now a full roar their warm wash felt through the allblack uniforms as those sectors of freemans forces designated to simulate an allout attack on the manchurian front started to move out freeman received word that at long last the labour opposition in britain had conceded to the b overflight over britain france still wouldnt agree however and this would mean a diversion around spain but at least the mission of the big bombers was on the problem was would it come in time yet he could wait no longer with the north chinese buildup of men and materiel about to burst upon him from the manchurian fastness besides admiral huang would tie up the southern forces chapter thirtynine lakenheath england as he climbed into the rear barbette of the lead b sergeant murphy or peptobismol as he was now known was very unhappy and festooned with packets of the new and improved antacid tablets crabbing it their wheels angling into the crosswind compensating for their natural tendency to drift to one side on takeoff the nine bgs forming the nineplane wave of stratofortresses from the fortysecond wing of the us sixtyninth bombardment squadron thundered along the runway and roared into the night sky over southeastern england each of the eight thirteenthousandpoundthrust prattandwhitney jet engines on the big ugly fat fellows was in high scream as the bombers tops painted wavy khaki green undersides whitegray headed across the channel at the beginning of their mile mission half a world away to attack the missile sites at turpan traveling at forty thousand feet plus each of the nine bombers that made up the three cells ebony gold and purple carried in its bomb bay and beneath its foot wingspan the conventional bombload equivalent of fifteen world war ii bs due to recent malfunctions in the normally remotecontrol console of the rear barbette with itsfour millimeter cannon the guns were manned murphy being the rear barbette gunner in ebonys lead plane the heavy ordnance aboard the bs included thirty elevenhundredpound fae or fuel air explosive bombs each bomb of jellied gasoline over four times as powerful as the equivalent weight of highexplosive in addition each plane carried twelve fivehundredpound freefall highexplosive iron contact bombs with pave conversion kits that turned them into smart bombs wish we were carrying cruise the radar navigator aboard ebony ones leader commented you and me both added the ecm electronic countermeasures or electronics warfare officer a technician who when the war broke out had been selling the superfast cray computers it was a political decision answered ebonys captain the air commander of the nineplane wave washington doesnt want us carrying cruise missiles anywhere near the mideast wouldnt give us a weapons free release even if we were packing them too risky the iranians are the worst they pick up a cruise missile think were popping off nuclear warheads and bingo the balloon goes up to make especially sure that no such interpretation would be made by any one of the countries theyd be flying over each one of the nine planes in ebony gold and purple had been fitted with the special flaredwing fairings which if the bs were picked up by satellite would identify them as being cruise free none of the sixman crew aboard ebony one the pilot and aircraft commander colonel thompson copilot navigator radar navigator ewo electronics warfare officer and gunner was at all happy about the decision but neither were they anxious about starting what was euphemistically referred to in air force manuals as a nuclear exchange even so me ewo in the cramped windowless electronics recess of the tiny lower deck had confided to the navigator and radar navigator forward of him on the lower deck that if he was to be downed hed just as soon go out in a mushroom as in some iranian prison camp the sight of the pows in vietnam and of the american hostages of the eighties and nineties was still a chilling memory for the american fliers several of the crew teenagers then could still recall the terrifying images of the ayatollah seen on television and the humiliation of the americans above the ewo the air commander and his pilot were carrying out visual checks using the erratic wash of moonlight to make sure that all the contact bombs on the extender racks beneath the wings were well in place the fine wires that would extract the safety pins of the primers could not be seen in the moonlight but none of the bombs looked askew to the ac as he scanned the huge foot wingspan that supporting the four pods of the twin engines and the bombs rose slowly as they gained altitude though the line of the wing was still below that of the fuselage the tanks loaded to me gills as murphy the rear gunner was fond of putting it with over thirtyfive thousand gallons of kerosene as the english channel now a silver squiggle receded far below them the three cells disappeared in cloud the navigator on ebony one already going over his trace with the electronic warfare officer who would have to coordinate his jammer pod against any groundtoair missile batteries that protected the mobile sites around turpan reading the coordinates from the computer the navigator drew as manual backup the intersect lines with his protractor the ewo circled in the last reported satellite digital photo relay showing the missile shelters around turpan but there were now seven additional tents showing up on the computerenhanced photo are they more css ted the radar navigator asked or sams dont know the ewo replied all i know is that were going to have to drop our load from as high as we can and ill be using every jammer weve got are we spot on the track charlie the ewo asked the navigator no sweat the navigator answered giving their position over the bay of biscay as they were heading over spain for turkey iran and iraq their flight taking them over the bay because as with the american raid on qaddafis libya they were not allowed to fly over french soil also ac thompson wanted to keep as far away as possible from the triggerhappy new soviet republics hence the southern crescentshaped detour also time had to be allowed for phantomg wild weasels to go in just ahead of the bombers to jam as much chicom groundtoair communications and radar as possible in freemans airland battle opening up all along the amur front first the mediumrange bombers and fighters went in shooting up everything in sight including superbly camouflaged oillampheated dugouts which their infrared targeted as tanks in defilade position even so the chinese were struck by the ferocity of the american offensive colonel soong north of manzhouli had his troops well dug in atop a but was paid a return visit by a c spectre gunship whose crews infrared nightvision capacity enabled it to pour down a deadly rain of fire but whereas during an attack on a earlier in the war a c had finally fallen prey to a surfacetoair missile this time the sam sites had been raked by f eagles each eagle dropped sixteen thousand pounds of smart ordnance from its underfuselage and underwing hard points so that the c was left unthreatened save for smallarms fire as it continued in its devastating counterclockwise spiral spewing out its deadly fire if any of the chinese troops lifted a rifle or rpg or any other weapon in a desperate attempt to down it they were immediately sighted on the infrared screens and targeted from fuyuan in the east near khabarovsk to manzhouli in the west the night was rent by fire in fuyuan the americans received unexpected help from the jewish underground in the nearby jewish autonomous oblast and actually succeeded in pushing the chinese four miles back across a frozen section of the river the advance general c clay reported was getting out of hand one of the most aggressive groups was a jewish contingent led by alexsandra malof the woman who had been tortured by siberian and chinese alike and who was determined to help the americans it was she who with other jewish women had been forced to fraternize who had been the poprosili the requested ones for the pleasure of the siberian fliers in khabarovsk before the americans came aleksandra had been a favorite of the ace sergei marchenko but she was only one and so many had scores to settle against both sibirs as they called them and the chinese that general clay had to order a slowdown in order for his logistical tail to catch up with his forward troops in the rugged ravines of the manchurian fastness up around never and skovorodino sites of one of freemans fiercestfought battles earlier in the war the chinese gave as good as they got the chicom regulars wouldnt yield even to the marines ms whose mm guns atop the tortoiselike appearance of the tanks caused by blocks of reactive armor all over them blasted pla infantry positions across the river salvos of expensive at least for the chinese rpgs were fired at the ms but the reactive armor blowing up as it was struck neutralized the chinese attack in the main and the ms kept up a deafening fire that resounded like thunder through the stillsnowdusted hills and along the flats of the river at the foot of clefthewn mountains cheng could tolerate the situation so far but what he was asking his aides for was any reports coming in from around manzhouli to the west on his left flank where chinese positions stretched along the wall of genghis khan and beyond to the south where the country became flatter and would be much more suitable for the american abrams fortyfivemileperhour main battle tank nothing general what do you mean nothing cheng asked though his voice was subdued and surprisingly calm only static general the american wild weasels electronic interceptors are jamming all radio communications we dont know whats going on anywhere another said theyre attacking on so many points we dont know where their main concentration lies freemans no fool cheng said he knows better than to spread his forces that thinly from manzhouli to khabarovsk over a mile front no army in the world can attack equally along such a lengthy front if our radios are jammed well have to rely on our motorcycle couriers but general it would take them hours in some cases days before they could reach not to us here in beijing you fool i mean between regimental commands we have good men up there they will use their initiative indeed they were one motorbike signal company already moving couriers out along the narrow roads through the mountainous cold they might as well have been carrying a neon sign however saying here we are for the fs and fs while they didnt kill all of them in the narrow defiles did get most of them as the pave low banked aussie felt his bergen pack shift despite its tight rigging and now they were coming into the darkness of manzhouli the rail lines ribbons of steely light beneath the moon running east of the wall which was now being breached by the pave lows bloody great orb aussie said cursing the break in the clouds might as well send up a flare the pave low took a whack and seemed to skid in midair but it was shrapnel from aa fire hitting the second chopper and perhaps the third second choppers going down someone said the red light went to green and they felt the icy rush of air go and one by one they went down the rope the big pave in a clearing not a quarter mile north of the railway station the choppers would return in fortyfive minutes aussie felt the heat through his black gloves as he descended on the rope and fell back into gritty snow within a minute he had the mm heckler koch mpk in one hand shucking the chute with the other then joined the other nineteen men from the three paves the chopper that had been hit had landed albeit bumpily and discharged its six sasd men but was now unable to take off the other two choppers already up and away right david brentwood called out to the crew of the damaged chopper youre with us keep in the center there was a chance just a chance that the pave lows some of the best napoftheearth fliers in me world had come in so low via their groundsensing radar that despite the aa fire that could well have been directed at the helos sound none of the chicom guards atop the wall several hundred yards in front of them or at the railway complex a quarter mile ahead of them had actually seen the choppers then again if the chicoms had been trying to make regular radio calls to units up along the genghis khan wall they would have quickly realized that the static jamming their lines was so intense as to be more than merely atmospheric in origin in fact the whole garrison of chinese troops at manzhouli was alerted having seen one of the pave lows pass like a bulky chariot across me moon and the garrisons commander an unafraid twentythreeyearold captain ko made the eminently sensible decision to go out straight away to meet his attackers head on rather than do half the job for them by staying bottled up in the railway station surprise was to be met by surprise to begin with the small town of manzhouli had been evacuated by all its citizens and only the military remained chapter forty the navigator in ebony one informed air commander thompson the pilot of ebony one were coming up on büyuk agridome otherwise known to you peasants as mount ararat which one the radar navigator asked crammed in next to him there are two peaks the big one dummy the navigator replied the dome is a sixteenthousandfoot massif the twelvethousandfoot twin is four miles to the southeast four point two to be exact iraq and iran to your right how far to target ebonys captain asked as he glanced out to try to pick up the two arrowhead formations of purple and gold assuming they were carrying out precisely the same computations but not absolutely sure as all cells were on interplane radio silence the only conversations allowed being those within each aircraft damn thompson said whats up his copilot asked the captain was looking out the port side they were out of cloud though mountainous cumulonimbus was all around them the captain indicating the long contrails that in the moonlight had taken on a sheen that could be seen for miles as the three cells progressed in perfect formation should be cloud pretty soon the copilot said reassuringly hed barely finished speaking when the entire wave was swallowed up by more cumulonimbus as they approached the mountains of northern iraq and iran whatd i tell you cap yep gods on our side captain cut in murphy at the rear gun controls never mind that murphy thompson responded keep your eyes peeled radar nav anything on the scope just our eight compadres captain a milk run right thompson said encouraged by the esprit de corps after his concern about the contrails as air commander as well as captain he shouldnt have said anything about the vapor trails that might have induced anxiety in his crew but this was his third combat tour and sometimes he just felt jumpier than others besides like the other fiftythree men in the wave he had an abiding hatred and fear of the religious fanatics who inhabited so many of the islamic countries over or near which they would be flying one of the most vivid memories of his childhood was the nightly broadcasts of the iranianheld american hostages and even though he was too young then to fully understand what was going on he well understood the humiliation of the blindfolded and tortured americans as they were daily taunted and paraded before the world his greatgrandfather had told him the iranian fanatics reminded him of hitlers ss they werent simply fanatical but were fierce fighters and their hatred of america knew no bounds so intense were the crews feelings about falling into the hands of muslim fundamentalists that everyone aboard ebony one had opted to carry the pill in his firstaid kit just in case hey murphy said from the rear barbette control above and aft of the swivelmounted cannon ara whatsit ararat the navigator told him ive heard that somewhere before murphy said the electronics warfare officer leaned forward over his plot shifting his canvasholstered service revolver further around on his belt to keep it from digging into his pelvis yeah murphy said eagerly ararat isnt that where they had some winter olympics the navigator drew a line on his plastic overlay from ararat to the hindu kush and from there to the turpan depression a red circle the size of a dime on ararat olympics the gunner responded not unless noah was a hotdogger noah gunner murphy said noah who for chrissake the copilot chuckled you know murph the radio nav cut in noah raiders of the lost ark i saw that murphy triumphantly said i dont remember any noah you jerkin us off murphy the copilot asked what no murphy said why hes jerking us off the ewo said right murph freeman waited for word that cheng had fallen for the bait and was now moving the shenyang army and other northern reserves up to the amur front once this happened if it happened freeman could launch his armored attacks south across the chinese nose that poked into mongolia then across the eighteen miles that comprised the mongolian toe of land that likewise stuck into manchuria and then onto me semidesert plains of the gobi and chinas inner mongolia with the bs having taken off from lakenheath and traveling around six hundred miles per hour depending on the altitude it would take them seven and a half hours before they hit turpan and freeman knew that if he was to take advantage of faking out cheng by his amur front deception he might have to order his armor south before the missiles at turpan were taken out what was it the british had said to him during the battle of ratmanov island between alaska and siberia that it might be a near run thing but before it could be anything cheng had to take the bait chapter fortyone aussie brentwood whispered hoarsely you got the bag got it aussie answered referring to the plastic bag of wolf dung hes full of it salvini joked brentwood ignored him choir you there im here salvini here it was in that order that if aussie was hit the wolf dung would be passed it was not to be lit before dawn about a half an hour away and in freemans words god help the son of a bitch who doesnt keep it dry the advantage of the chicoms having seen the pave lows come down was offset now by the fact that as the pla company spewed out across the rail line and briskly made its way toward the areas where it thought the three choppers had landed the sasd teams were invisible in their black uniforms against the dark forest and the chicoms were making the mistake of bunching up a natural tendency of men facing danger and their harder cruder boots made more noise on the ties david brentwood his ear to the rail having picked up the first movement of men coming toward him quickly had the sasd team fan out left and right of the tracks the natural move for him was to have his commandos melt into the woods either side of the track but he resisted the temptation because it would mean the danger of them crossfiring into their own men and so they went to ground instead and stayed there those closest to the rails packing c charges against the rails wherever they could waiting then everything went wrong they heard the whoosh night became day the line of sasd men exposed in flare light showing up like slugs against the patches of snow immediately the rattle of aks filled the air snow flicking up like a swarm of white insects the trees brentwood shouted and as he did so crushed the acid timer ampoule for the nearest c plastique charge the bravery of neither the chicoms nor the sasd troops was in question but captain kos decision with an advantage of six to one that offense was in this case the best form of defense overlooked a vital component that once in the trees the sasd commandos became the defenders and kos men were exposed in order for kos men to uproot the commandos who as well as having the natural defense of the woods were still making their way through the woods either side of the railway up to the rail yard and control hut kos men would have to go in after them scopes only brentwood yelled and a burst of ak fire erupted in his direction shredding some pine bark it was an order that referred only to those sasd troops who had longer rather than shorter range submachine guns the longer range weapons having been allocated infrared nightvision scopes with only scopes firing blue on blue or in other words being shot by your own men in the dark could be avoided it was a classic case of the americans adapting to new circumstances quickly and in the process suddenly turning a dangerous situation to their advantage right salvini muttered here we go and with that he rested his ais rifle against a low pine the accuracy of the international supermagnum sniper rifle came from its kigre kn f nightvision image intensifier through the scope he could see a pla cap and torso crouching he squeezed the trigger and the torso was lost amid an explosion of green flecks as the depleteduranium bullet tore right through him and kicked up the snow back of him within seven seconds salvini had felled three more chicoms in the green circle of his night scope and he could hear the single whacks of the heckler koch mpk submachine gun and an occasional quick rip of it set on threeround bursts which meant that some of the chicoms were reaching the edge of the wood and could still be seen in the fading flare light so as to be easily targeted without nightvision optics the last thing ko wanted was another flare light now hed seen his strategy backfire on him but brentwood yelled choir flare choir lifted his m grenade launcher that was attached to his m so that its skyward flare shot would not come back at him from overhanging branches screaming aloft instead well clear of the timber there was a quick sound like the belch of a sinkhole emptying and moonlight went to daylight again as the magnesium sun floated slowly down ko ordered his men into the woods and the chinese about fifty yards on either side of the snow clearing charged into the woods to fight it out man to man there was a roar of fire aks aks bayonetequipped type chinese carbines rype and mm chicom submachine guns and from the woods either side the eruption of the sasds heckler koch mm parabellums streaming out at over eight hundred rounds a minute the crash of grenades and the terrible whistling of fléchettes these steel darts fired by the sasd winchester shotgun twenty darts for each shot drove through chicom helmets at a hundred yards as if they were butter those without helmets falling their heads exploding spraying blood everywhere ko was not to know that the enemy was the sasd elite otherwise he might have elected to withdraw but closeencounter warfare was what the sasd called a specialty of the house for the sas this meant the cqb close quarter battle practiced at the house in hereford england and what the delta men referred to as the shooting house at fort bragg both houses training the commandos for everything there was to know about cqb adding to this the varo flipupflipdown nightvision goggles supplied to the sasd men helped reduce what had been a sixtoone chicom advantage to a threetoone advantage during the firefight and now the fight being closer in sasd cold steel found bone ripping the chicoms to pieces kos contingent fought bravely and it wasnt until the first light of dawn after the c charges had blown injuring two sasd men with shrapnel that the full extent of the carnage could be gauged the snow pocked red with the dead the wounded and the dying the victory for the sasd was somewhat hollow however when it was discovered that as well as four sasd men killed all of the pave lows crewmen had died despite the best efforts of the sasd men to protect them damn david brentwood said with an uncharacteristic vehemence i should have told them to wait with the chopper ah rats aussie said none of us knew whether the chinese would find the chopper and commandos were now setting charges in the railway control boxes and on other lines with radios unable to get through the jamming of freemans wild weasels the sas lit orange and purple flares for pickup the wall of genghis khan had clearly been breached by the sasd team but to make it official two sasd men salvini and aussie were dispatched to light the wolf dung fire by the base of one of the watchtowers atop the old wall what the fucks all this about salvini asked aussie dont ask me sport daveys the only one that knows and hes apparently under orders to keep it mum till were out of here the arrival of the pave lows was interrupted for a minute or so by a chinese sniper hiding out in the woods but he was taken out by a scopemounted m and the helos came down and took aboard the living and the dead so aussie yelled as the pave low rose with the dawn heading away from the tall but distinctly graywhite trail of wolf dung smoke whats all this business with me wolf shit wait till we get a few hundred feet brentwood said his face still grim after the loss of the crew from the pave low which they had blown to pieces with a c charge before takeoff denying any of the helos weapons or electronics to the chicoms why aussie began and then he and all the other commandos saw it all along the front for as far as they could see spirals of the same grayish smoke could be seen rising straight high into the dawning sky whats the idea salvini asked its the traditional chinese signal brentwood explained for some reason the chemical composition of wolf dung makes it burn thick and go straight up straighter than any other kind of smoke yeah but signal for what salvini pressed the wall chinas defenses being breached i get it aussie said cheng and his buddies cant get squat info from his radios so with the smoke signal theyll think weve broken through all along the line we have brentwood said but what they dont know is for how long hopefully chengll be rushing fresh troops all his reserves up north instead of westward while freemans armored spearhead heads south salvini said brilliant meanwhile we go back to base i love it that crafty bastard aussie said and everyone knew he meant freeman the wolf dung smoke trails could be seen along the entire length of the black dragon river by the chinese reserve battalions miles back from the front but already moving northward to counter what they saw as the enemys penetration of the black dragon line cheng was not completely sold on the reports slow in coming because of the radio jamming that the wall had been breached everywhere he guessed there must be some copycat panic down the line but what sold him was the intelligence reports further south of the front amid the villages and towns along the few roads that snaked through the manchurian vastness while all chicom military targets at least those not camouflaged well enough had been hit not one single town or village on the sparse roadways through manchuria had been destroyed this was not cheng believed because of any humanitarian gesture on freemans part not to bomb civilians but because bombedout villages and towns in such mountainous terrain caused so much rubble on the narrow roads that it would be a major impediment to any armored columns snaking through the steep valleys and indeed would bunch up armor making it much more vulnerable to attack by small guerrilla bands ironically while the high columns of wolf dung smoke had alarmed other commanders along the line it was the care that freeman had taken not to create such rubble rather than the wolf dung that convinced cheng it was an allout deep attack by freemans army against chinas northern defenses by now freemans armor was well underway west and south of manzhouli his ma tanks leading his bradley infantry vehicles following at times on the flank reports kept coming in to freeman that chinese troops were still taking the bait and on the move northward in manchuria from shenyang toward the amur or black dragon river by god dick freeman told norton exuberantly weve done it wolf dung norton how about that for high tech by god weve done it and so they had until as the position became clearer to the northernmost chinese commanders a very low tech carrier pigeon arrived at shenyang hq informing the plas northern command that the ferocity of the american attacks that had been assumed to be a major offensive now appeared to be no more than wellcoordinated probing actions cheng was about to order the northern bound troops westward but this would take time especially with rail links like that of manzhouli now broken instead he ordered the reserves to reverse direction and head south back down out of manchuria as fast as possible and then westward into inner mongolia and the gobi so cheng thought the great american general believed he had outwitted the pla suddenly the ewo in ebony one saw an amber blip on his screen ac he said notifying the air commander unidentified aircraft two oclock high fifty miles the captain acknowledged stay with them murphy must be one of our harrier escorts got him in the cone skipper countermeasures ready the captain asked as a precaution ready sir the ewo confirmed four seconds had elapsed since the first radar contact range the captain asked fortynine miles speed mach one point eight which meant that whatever it was was traveling in excess of nine hundred miles per hour most probably a fighter all right but not a harrier the captain banked left beginning evasive action hoping that purples and golds ewos would have seen either the contact on their screens or his radio silence evasive maneuver hopefully they had seen both beneath them the great peaks of the hindu kush rose majestically in a sea of moonlit white peaks range fortyeight miles closing mach one point three three others joining him the first fourthousandmile east wind which western experts thought had been discarded in favor of the longer eightthousandmilerange csx landed on the right flank of freemans armored column racing south of manzhouli it did no more damage than blow up enormous blocks of ice from the twentymilewide lake hulun which still mostly frozen was providing freemans armored columns with a shortcut south the second and third missiles however hit the ice in the middle of the column and an m tank and bradley fighting vehicle rolled at speed and disappeared immediately freeman in the lead tank saw other columns slow full bore he yelled into the radio keep moving damn it and everyone stay buttoned up the clang of cupolas and hatches shutting could be heard echoing along the ice as the tracked vehicles continued to throw up a curtain of fine white ice particles that glinted beautifully in the early dawn where the hell are those bs freeman mused while looking through his commanders periscope for sign of any enemy activity in the manchurian foothills far off to his left his tanks remarkably quiet gas turbine blowing the snow aft of him like castor sugar over the hindu kush it was not yet dawn as the nine bs adjusted their course northeastward for turpan the mountains snowy peaks like the bs themselves were still moonlit with some clouds bunching up shifting in from the west as the four chicom fighters shenyang jcs wings swept back nose intake reminiscent of older migs were swooping down at mach from thirtysix thousand feet toward the bs two of the fighters armed with four airtoair missiles the other two with eight inch rockets together with their deadly nrmm cannon the electronics warfare officer in ebony one and those in the other eight bombers that made up ebony gold and purple were watching their own radars each planes quad millimeter machine guns in the rear barbettes shifting with the bogeys approach but the chicom fighters were still too far away beyond the effective onekilometer range of the guns the three bs of purple were now in thick stratus their exhaust heat signal weakened by the clouds moisture the shenyangs shifting their attack to the six planes of ebony and gold it told ebonys captain that he could expect heatseekers so that when he saw the pinpricks of light from the shenyangs he yelled release flares knowing the bs could not turn in time even if the six bs did manage to swing toward the chicom fighters denying the bs engine heat to the rearentry infraredseeking missiles the bombers guns their only external antiaircraft weapons would be facing away from the shenyangs the sky was suddenly aglow with phosphorus flares like shooting stars the chicoms four pound soviettype aphid missiles streaking toward ebony and gold at over meters per second to reach the bs in seconds murphy controlling the rear barbette of ebony one his heart thumping so loudly it was the only thing he could hear cheered as he saw the chicom missiles curving off into the thickets of burning flares aft of ebony and disintegrating but now another four rockets were streaking toward the bs active active ebonys ewo yelled indicating these werent aphids heatseekers but were emitting radar beams using the reflections of these from the bs to home in on chaff ebony ones captain yelled his order as he was also air commander of the wing immediately obeyed by gold and purple so that now the sky twinkled in the dying light of the flares the millions of strips of aluminum cut to various wavelengths to cover the band fuzzing the chicoms radarhoming missiles ha you bastards murphy called elated by the chineses failure to sucker the bs into thinking the second set of missiles was heatseekers instead of radarhoming airtoair apexes which though heavier at seven hundred pounds were one and a half times faster these four missiles began curving away but unlike the heatseekers before them each missiles flight path wasnt so much a single curve but rather a series of jerky movements crisscrossing one anothers smoky trails like hounds confused by the foxs scent tearing into the chaff clouds at over one thousand meters per second foiled by foil you fools murphy shouted then he heard a rapid thudding noise one of the shenyangs nrmm cannon raking ebony ones port side but the big plane had seen worse than this its upgraded wet that is fuelcarrying wing having a remarkable ability to soak up selfsealing punctures created by the chicoms machine gun fire the shenyang swept past going into a tight turn the bs were in cloud out of it then in again then as quickly as they appeared the bogeys were gone obviously on bingo fuel or because there were sam sites ahead that might not distinguish between friend or foe murphy was ecstatic but not so air commander thompson they had yet to reach the target and get back again and where in hell were the harriers freemans lead division of five hundred and forty tanks was advancing in column broken up into three brigades of ma and m tanks each and the brigades in turn were broken down into three battalions of sixty tanks companies of fifteen tanks each and finally platoons of five tanks the lead tank had two aerials instead of one one for intertank communication the other for air strikes if necessary and was followed in column by the second tank covering an arc of fire on the right side of the column the third tank covering the left side and so on down the column once over the ice and onto land the visibility was still good on the low flat country but not as open as it was on the lake freeman moved to wedge formations the lead tank of each platoon as the point the others flanking it left and right a hundred yards apart to form the triangular advance the dust trails it was hoped would be dampened somewhat by the still scantily snowcovered terrain and by the early morning dew but in the fragile ecosystem of the semidesert around the gobi the dust rose like mustardcolored flour forming an enormous cloud south of lake hulun and freemans ma leading the way cruising at thirtyfive to forty miles per hour was followed not only by the remainder of his ma and m tanks but by scores of bradley infantry fighting vehicles the bradleys diesels were in a high whine as opposed to the more muffled lowertoned roar from the gas turbines of the mas the bradleys turrets mounted with mm chain guns with a roundperminute capacity run by crews of three they also carried a deuce of tow tubelaunched optically tracked wireguided antitank missiles the twentyfiveton fortyonemilesperhour amphibious vehicles carried nine infantry men with port firing automatic weapons riding it out in the armorprotected cabin out forward of the main armored force relays of three lightly armed but fast kiowa warrior reconnaissance choppers were darting about like dragonflies searching for any sign of impediment either enemy troops or natural barriers that might have to be dealt with as map references could not always be relied upon in the gobi the shapes of dunes could change overnight following a storm from the west and in selected sites not yet on the maps forests had been planted and watered on the deserts edge in a desperate attempt to stop the everencroaching sand behind the bell twoseater kiowas and in support of the armor were the tankkilling apaches ready to shoot forward and kill with either laserguided hellfire missiles rockets or their belowthenosemounted mm cannon which could deal with any enemy tanks or other targets of opportunity pointed out to them by the kiowa spotters incoming the warning came as another east wind with conventional warhead exploded overhead taking out three tanks and a bradley over twenty men and over twenty million dollars worth of equipment lost in a few seconds freeman knew he couldnt take this too much longer before his force was decimated and standing up in the cupola he lifted his tenpower binoculars looking for possible revetment areas in some hilly country off to his left a continuation of semidesert and dune everyone was asking where the hell the bs were some were yelling in their tanks that the old man should have waited before moving but other voices countered by arguing freemans point that to keep the initiative he had to drive south quickly if he was to outflank the manchurian reserves the manchurians reserves in particular shenyangs sixteenth group army of fiftytwo thousand men were moving faster than freeman had anticipated in part it was because they had been bored and no matter what the danger soldiers of any army welcome some activity after long dull hours at the rear besides in the sparse grasslands and semidesert the plas motorcycle and sidecar battalions could move at speed each pinion seat carrying another soldier in addition to the rider and the machine gunner or antitank missile operator in the sidecar simultaneously all trains and civilian traffic had been commandeered by cheng who was using freemans deliberate policy of not bombing the villages and towns to his chengs advantage by using every route that led south and west to erenhot because of the absence of serviceable roads leading west out of manchuria cheng knew and he knew that freeman must know that no substantial pla flank action could be mounted against freemans southwardheaded column until he got further south cheng would have to stop him further down in the gobis dunes around the railhead of erenhot and so it was to erenhot the railhead on the border of chinas inner mongolia and mongolia that many of the reserves from beijings sixtyfifth army group were now being sent the shenyang armies including towed artillery were able to reach the dunes faster by being able to cut directly west through chifeng and duolun meanwhile cheng was receiving the news that freemans armored division was being pounded by the missiles from turpan anticipating the coming battle cheng allowed himself a rare smile of satisfaction did the american general think he was the only one who read sun tzu and understood how all war is deception did the american think that he cheng was asleep chapter fortytwo unfazed by the nonappearance of the harriers keeping the big planes on course ebony leader now that his flight had been attacked switched from inplane to intercell radio it was and there was a strong headwind against them ebony leader to gold and purple air commander thompson called will start togo count at one hundred twenty seconds before ert at ohsevenfivesix plus twentyone seconds i will release bombs at end of radar navs fifteensecond count and on his weve been hit a surprised voice came over the intercom thompson ignoring it carrying on his tone tense but controlled targeting radars out the same voice cut in again the ac kept talking refusing to be interrupted even as he took account of what hed just heard well be visible bombing then he instructed the other two cells drop on my pickle signal acknowledge bogeys three oclock coming in high mach one point two new bandits configurations migs repeat migs gold leader to ebony leader acknowledge the lone plane in purple also acknowledged radar nav ebony leader called you read me we drop on your call and your call only okay affirmative skipper but the air commander had difficulty hearing him over the thundering of the engines and more hammering as the bandits cannon tore into several of the other bs the latter continuing to jettison flares radaremitting dummies and chaff to foil the migs heat or radarseeking missiles bogeys closing ebony ones electronics warfare officer yelled splitting two for our nose two for the tail get em murphy the tails of six of the remaining seven bs seemed to explode tracers arcing out from them in long easy orange curves the curves closer now in a cone of fire against the oncoming chicoms one barbette out of action its gunner dead then the bombers were out of cloud again angels five oclock angels five oclock harriers bout fucking time far below the pilots could see the rugged deep defiles of the tien shan mountains crookededge wedges of black fringed with ice cream snow the silver streaks of streams seen one moment lost the next then flat mustardcolored desert terrain far to the northwest around turpan the four migs making another turn at plus eleven seconds the sam missile radarstwenty miles away around turpan were picked up by ebonys ewo the fighters were coming in from the starboard side from a distance of four miles firing airtoair missiles the slower but higher harriers coming down to meet them ebony ones copilot took over chaff and flare control thompson as air commander keeping ebony one steady leading the rest of his wing flashes of light all about him and the powerful stench of sweat at plus sixteen seconds ebony ones navigator informed the radar navigator final gpi counters are good roger the navigator checked his indicators a half mile off jack pilot make fivedegree s turn to right roger navigator thompson acknowledged taking five degrees s turn right they felt the plane suddenly buffeted momentarily rising in a gust and thought theyd been hit but it was the shock wave of the explosion of ebony three hit by an aphid the flares it had dropped for decoy degenerating in the cold fleeting cloud either that or the flares had malfunctioned that left six planes out of the original nine fci is centered thompson advised his voice vibrating along with the rest of ebony one the aircraft having been hit somewhere on the starboard tail plane near the actuators stand by for initial point call the navigator announced there was a burst of orange light a harrier gone ebony ones navigator had the infrared scope on the area just south of turpan where the missiles were supposed to be for a moment he thought they werent there but the next second saw them coming within range spread out over a wider area than the israeli satellite photos had indicated but still in the target grid that was two miles long by a quarter the navigator waited waited then centered for the initial point call ip now crew ebony ones navigator grabbed the stopwatch index finger resting on the stop button as he heard the air commander stand by timing crew ready ready ready hack the radar navigator pressed the button on the stopwatch the navigator trying to keep his voice as calm as possible reporting watches running a computer could suddenly go on the fritz in the melee of electronic war a stopwatch was preferred it was time till release three minutes twenty seconds captain to nav understand three minutes twenty seconds cross hairs going out to target area the radar navigator advised watching the cross hairs of his sight flicking in and out then in in in closing over the target area like a rapid slide show each slide showing more detail as ebony one still shaking closed distance south of turpan the desert around the turpan depression being held at bay here and there by orderly oases of irrigated reforestation they heard a muffled explosion nearby their cockpit momentarily lit up as brilliantly as if a flashbulb had gone off the captain made a mental note to check out why the flares and chaff hadnt worked as well the second time around though he suspected that it was due to the four migs probably the only four fulcrums in all western china coming in behind the bs engines exhaust risking the mm fire from the barbettes in hopes of getting a lockon with heatseekers there were five bs remaining and no matter what the migs did thompson had irrevocably committed all remaining bs to the bomb run the only good thing he thought was that thered be no sams coming his way as long as he had the fighters mixing it up trying to bring the five bombers down then again sixty seconds gone he announced target area the radar navigator reported at zero one niner degrees twentyeight point one miles a scream all but jolted thompson out of his seat but by the time hed intuitively grabbed for his volume control the scream had gone and in its wake he could hear the crackling of fire aboard the stricken b off to his right and through the headphones a dull persistent hammering of mm raking it before the fighter was over them already a mile off to the port side murphy trying without success to nail him looks good direct the captains voice came to the radar navigator it was plus fortyeight seconds ninetythree seconds still remaining until the air commander could give the tg to go signal at plus twentyone suddenly they had lost the fighters you bastards murphy yelled excitedly too good for ya but nobody paid him any attention and three seconds later they saw the first white trails of the telephone poles becoming silvery in the moonlight the first of the sams climbing toward them now the fighters had gone earlier the wild weasels fg phantoms had taken out their share of sam radar sites but there were too many clustered about turpan for the phantoms shrike airtoground missiles to get all of them besides which the phantoms were now mixing it with the chicom migs getting the worst of it so much so that soon all four phantoms were gone either blown up in midair or crashed no chutes visible the two wingmen of the four remaining bs started to rail away one to starboard one to port amid a staticbroken stream of orders the other two bs above going into sharp banks one to the right the other to the left below ebony one they didnt bank too quickly otherwise the sams would have time to change course and not too slowly or the sams would hit but in any case both of them acting as bait for the chicoms surfacetoair a missiles four of which pairing were streaking up for the lowest aircraft ebony ones radar navigator reported im inbomb now pilot center the fci he meant the aircrafttobomb site director system roger fci centered in a sudden gust ebony one yawed then slipped to port before thompson got it back on track the radar navigator was now speaking to the navigator disconnect release circuits suddenly thompson saw the tents the missile silos bright as day lit up by one of the two flaming bs as it exploded without sound over fifteen thousand feet below release circuits disconnected the radar navigator confirmed connected light on on light on now they heard the noise of the exploded b reaching them bomb door control valve lights the navigator asked off the radar navigator said the electronics warfare officer ready to drop more flares should the bandits return to go thompson called driving one two oh seconds the navigator was checking me doppler as the plane rose slightly then settled down the radar navigator waiting anxiously till zero minus fifteen when he would take up the final count he heard thompson counting one one five to go one hundred tg seventyfive tg sixty tg fifty tg thirty tg fci centered bomb doors coming open the navigator called me radar navigator now hunched over the visible sight oblivious to me buffeting of increasing aa fire and taking up the count fifteen seconds thirteen twelve eleven the plane rose sharply again this time the result of a wind gust in the bomb bay nine seven thompson flicked up the safety cover on the bomb button hearing the navigator four two thompson pressed the button pickle pickle pickle there was another explosion as a sam its electronics successfully interfered with by ebonys ewo detonated somewhere off to their left even as thompson heard his counterpart in the remaining b releasing his load the bombs released ebony one rose like a thing suddenly freed from bondage the bay door closing it was only several minutes later that they could see the roiling fires and enormous shock waves moving through the explosions that made the land look as if it were boiling along with destroying a line of missiles the bombs had more importantly for freemans second army also wiped out the turpan missile control center but as the two huge bombers turned the three remaining harriers above them they knew that the chicoms might yet come after them or would it be that because fuel was so precious to the chicoms they wouldnt waste it on a pursuit the two ewos scanned their scopes all they could see was the three harriers and each other they thought they might escape any further enemy interdiction chapter fortythree la roche wanted francine and fast he rang down to the d trovatore bar get up to the penthouse he told her im wanted upstairs jimmy she informed the barman be a good girl he said what he meant was do as youre told if you dont want trouble when she arrived the air was cloying with the perfume of roses as if a bucket of it had been spilled and he was already in his robe flashy gold silk with dragons rampant wordlessly roughly he walked up to her pulled off the tight black blouse and taking the knife from his private bar he cut the bra off her the first time hed done it shed frozen in panic but now she knew it was part of the ritual you bitch he told her pulling the bra off and throwing it to the floor youre all the same right you all want it go on it was her cue and wordlessly she slapped her hands beneath the folds of his robe grabbing it firmly pulling him gently toward her her tongue wetting her lips thats enough he commanded and told her to get into the bedroom where she could see the strap and photograph of his estranged wife lana brentwood on the side table francine hated this part but she feared la roche more she doubled the strap over and almost lethargically smacked his buttocks she would have to wait until he told her to do it harder more he commanded lying facedown on the chinese brocade bedspread his hands clenching and unclenching as her whipping aroused him come on he called urgently come on quickly she dropped the strap and felt under him now he told her and she brushed her hair quickly aside as he rolled over on his back and she went down on him her tongue flicking back and forth then sucking and flicking back and forth again and all the time him gasping lanalanauntil his back arched and fell arched again and again in spasm his whole body shaking until he was satiated he lay there exhausted arms out staring at the ceiling get me a beer he ordered then clean me up as he held the beer francine in order to complete the routine had to take off her panties and lick him dry a new deal she ventured shed been with him long enough to know that the routine his fantasy of being back with lana brentwood was always triggered by some financial orgasm hed had but shed never asked him anything until after otherwise he wouldnt pay her the five hundred on top of her weekly take at the bar a new deal he said no sweetie its an old order that was renewed three hours ago were rushing it in from hong kong to my benefactor mr cheng jesus three million just like that for what she asked idly for what hey francine what are you fucking cub reporter no i was just wondering well dont itll hurt that pretty little head of yours he took another long pull at the beer then arched his back again in the ecstasy of her tongue between his legs darting in and out like a snake it wasnt just the money she did it for francine liked the sense of power however transitory it gave her chengs gonna have a big surprise for that fucking freeman i can tell you that she didnt press for details besides shed learn about whatever it was when the time was right the la roche tabloid chain would spread the word from coast to coast and overseas of any great american defeat she had asked him one time when she was a little drunk whether it bothered him that what he did was against the law fuck the law thats why ive got lawyers no shed said i mean against you know against our boys against our country fuck the country whats it done for me when are you gonna learn francine that you have to look after number one hed paused a slatternly look on his face as hed raised himself on his elbows from the bed in your case that means looking after me right she had nodded obediently now he ordered give me the donut nice and slippery she rounded her lips into the shape of an o and worked it back and forth on him careful that her teeth didnt touch oh christ thats good youre a good kid francine he reached down and tousled her hair by midmorning freemans advance column his logistical tail following was seventy miles south of lake nur having now crossed the blunt arrowhead of manchuria that sticks out into mongolia taking the vital sixtytoseventymile shortcut across the mongolian territory swinging to his right southwest toward the desert regions of the gobi rather than due south which would have led the columns into the swamps of huolin gol on their left flank the only report freeman received that morning apart from washingtons insistence which he ignored that he not be at the head of his troops but back at headquarters where he belonged was an intelligence report that the jewish underground led by the woman alexsandra malof in the jewish autonomous oblast near khabarovsk had been waging a pitched battle with chicom regulars they were trying to sabotage their own flatcars near khabarovsk so as to deny freeman transfer of the hundreds of lighter automaticloader block ma tanks en route from the united states but held up because of the ss southern stars delaying tactics of having mined the seas off the west coasts bases hows this malof lady doing freeman asked norton who had come up alongside in a bradley ifv sometimes freemans phrasesthis malof ladyconjured up an old world charm that seemed strangely arcane coming from a general of high tech ordnance norton liked it pretty well general you remember shes one tough lady remember freeman asked nonplussed his face now a mustard color from the fine dust yes sir she was the woman the siberians arrested in khabarovsk early in the war and shipped out to baikal when we hit baikal before the ceasefire she escaped wound up in harbin for a while where she got the message through to us about cheng moving everything over the nanking bridge ah freeman said in happy admiration i remember we decorated her yes norton confirmed but i d have thought that after what they did to her at baikal then at harbin she would have had enough woman after my own heart freeman said his goggles now completely coated by dust so that he had to take them off the dirt caked about his mouth and eyebrows only his gentian blue eyes seemed visible onward and upward right norton yes sir well tell our boys to give her underground lot what support we can and tell that new logistics wizard whitely at chita that no matter how many tanks get through to chita i want them shipped down via borzna and manzhouli asap yes general norton freeman added keep close liaison with all those logistic boys ill need uptotheminute estimates of just how far back our tail is i dont want it too stretched out and have to do what the damn siberians do follow their supplies we dont go to our supplies they come to us understood i want our ammo to be near my tanks wherever the tanks are yes sir norton yelled out from the cupola of the bradley ill tell them make sure that whitely knows he mightnt get enough flatbeds coming from khabarovsk if the jewish underground cant stop the chinese sabotaging those flatbeds hes to use his initiative will do sir how about those light fast attack vehicles freeman asked the favs are three miles back general with the sasd teams if we need them as nortons bradley fell back to convey the generals orders freeman began coattailing sending a dozen twentythreeton bradleys running out at thirtyfive to forty miles per hour either side of the main column creating a huge dust wail like a smokescreen certain to obscure the column and creating the impression of having much more armor than they actually had no chinese had been spotted so far indeed there was nothing ahead but the long pebbled semidesert taking on a brief luxuriant green color here and there from the spring runoff but beneath the light cover of grass the dirt was like talc powder and the further south they would go the hotter it would get everything seemed to be going well and it made dick norton nervous there were no chicom fighters attacking the remaining two b bombers on their return flight that is until they reached shache at the edge of the vast taklimakan shamo or desert of southwestern sinkiang the great dunes east of shache looking like some vast undulating brown sea glimpsed beneath flitting cloud bogeys four six oclock the ewo called mach one point three on your tail murphy it meant that the four migs had gone back to base refueled and come back to kill the two remaining bs three harriers led by squadron leader jean williams entered the fray and now murphy saw something few men or women outside of war games pilots and test pilots would see and it happened so quickly that murphy and the ewo watching the dogfight on the scope barely had time to notice on paper there should have been no contest the supersonic mig mach against a pedestrian harrier whose top speed was mach a cheetah running a dog to death the lead mig piloted by sergei marchenko getting on the tail of williams her wingman yelling on your tail on your tail she went into a right turn marchenko turned with her got into her cone and fired a pound aphid heatseeker she had already released flares and with the harriers vectored thrust viffedsuddenly dropping like a stone three hundred feet the mig flashing by overhead and turning left she rose and saw the fulcrum going into its worldrenowned flipup when the plane in a virtual tailslide is raised up and marchenko was ready to fire straight into williamss gut with his thrusttoweight ratio so good he actually increased speed in the straightupthewall vertical climb but this time the harrier moved abruptly to left dropped again as if punched by some unseen force and turned slowly compared to the fulcrum but with the turn much tighter shirers harrier had caught up and was behind marchenko he heard his sidewinder missile growl showing he could lock on and shoot but then marchenko went to afterburner for a split second rising high above and off to the right shirer and his harrier worked their magic the harrier viffing its vectored thrust slamming it to the right for a split second in the fulcrums cone and he fired his two mm aden underfuselage cannon the mig gave off a lick of flame from the exhaust which rapidly spread briefly showing the yankee killer motif painted in black forward of the port boxintake shirer saw two things simultaneously marchenko ejecting and another mig taking fire from williamss harrier exploding into marchenko swallowing him up in its own flame due in no small measure to williamss having been in the right place at the right time splash one shirer yelled triumphantly splash two williamss voice came the other two migs flying welded wing almost touching and so flown by inexperienced chicom pilots immediately broke off nice shooting major williamss sweet voice came your assist on mine shirer answered thanks dont mention it man murphy said excitedly did you see that sam gainful five thousand the ewo cut in it meant that there was a twentyfoot fourinchlong pound surfacetoair type missile with a warhead of pounds streaking toward them and no matter how high they tried to go the sams thirtysevenmile range could outreach their envelope with no foil or chaff left to scramble the missiles radar guidance the air commander in ebony one and the pilot of the other b had to take whatever evasive action they could but now the second ewo announced there were more telephone poles coming at them and suddenly there was an explosion a hundred meters to the right of ebony one and a sound like hail as the shrapnel from the sam now struck ebony one the plane was shuddering violently whether hed only been clipped by missile debris or by aa fire he wasnt sure and didnt care he only knew that everything was vibrating so badly he could hear the ping of rivets coming out and could no longer talk to his copilot on the intercom warning lights dancing madly in front of him thompson fought the yoke with all he could barely managing to keep the plane aloft losing hydraulic fluid and knowing one of the wing tanks had been hit he did a magnificent job of keeping her aloft as long as he did but he knew he was losing the battle his altimeter needle telling him the end was near it was just beyond tabriz in the far northwestern corner where iran meets iraq that thompson knew he could no longer control ebony one its yoke now fighting him like a thing possessed thompson thought of his wife and two youngsters ages two and four back in toledo ohio everyone out he yelled indicating the top hatch to the copilot the copilot unstrapped and stepping below holding the radars console for support yelled with all his strength at the navigator radar nav ewo and murphy to get out both thompson and the copilot ejected down out of the nose hatch after them came murphy the ewo radar nav and navigator the copilot hit the fuselage of the remaining b behind and to the right of them traveling at miles per hour they knew this because his head had penetrated the aluminum sheeting on the port side of one of the eight pratt and whitney engines intakes the fan decapitating him thompson tried to work his chute but wind drift took him into the long tongue of fire now licking the starboard side his chute becoming a roman candle within seconds as he disappeared into the swirling gray abyss beneath the navigator radar navigator and ewo also drifted into the inferno their chutes torched long before their bodies like blackened matchsticks disappeared from view as murphy the gunner descended his chute intact he felt frantically for his survival pack and his service revolver and all he could think of was the pictures hed seen as a child of the american hostages and hearing parts of the tape the iranians had sent to the cia with the screams of an american on it whom the iranians had slowly methodically tortured to death he had absolutely no doubt theyd see him coming down under the burning inferno of the aircraft its flames casting enormous shadows off low clouds as he passed through them drifting downwind in the overcast dawn over a thousand miles east the sun had already risen and the inner mongolian sky was as blue as lapis lazuli but turning mustard as a moving wall of dust twenty miles wide proceeded south like the great invasions of the khans centuries ago with no enemy in sight and his bradleys still coattailing back and forth to create the impression of a bigger force than he had freeman his columns no longer falling victim to turpans rocket offensive felt the tension ease and was giving a running commentary to his tank crew whether they liked it or not on the tactics of the great khans as his body fell through the cold darkness of heavy cloud and his feet hit the dry dirt of the kurdistan foothills murphy heard another explosion to the north behind him and wondered if it was the last b caught by aa fire or downed by one of the sam batteries quickly he punched for the release clip the chute dragging him along over the dusty stony terrain but he missed and succeeded only in winding himself he smacked at it again and felt himself slow as he scrambled out of the harness and began to walk back toward the billowing canopy of silk rolling it up as he went falling over stones the size of baseballs skinning himself he began cursing but not too loudly lest anyone hear him though he seemed to have landed in a remote area there being no sign of village lights of the kind hed seen sprinkled below the bomber as best he could figure it he guessed the b had been struck well south of what the navigator had earlier told him was kvoy one of the ancient cities in kurdistan region whose unofficial borders had moved back and forth in the towering mountains of eastern turkey and iraq to the west and in irans northwestern frontier the towering bulk of the mountains great bastions shrouded in fog frightened murphy the wildness and vastness of them unimaginable twentyfour hours before before hed ever heard of mount ararat let alone about these mountains that seemed to cover the world for as far as he could see bundling up the parachute he began to scrape a shallow trench with his knife to bury the chute but the ground was unbelievably hard like baked clay on the utah salt flats and he was worried about making too much noise he stopped and listened heard nothing aware only of the sound of dry cold wind sweeping down from the mountains moments later he heard running water and as his eyes grew more accustomed to the gray dawn he could make out a small ditch possibly an irrigation channel only ten feet or so away from him thinking that it might mean a village nearby murphy drew his the handle frigid and made his way cautiously toward the stream when he reached it he stopped listened again and stared into the fog to see whether there were any buildings nearby he could see nothing hear nothing but the water he scooped up a handful it had a surprisingly metallic taste and he guessed it was artesian water rather than runoff from the snowcaps befarmaid please murphy swung about but the pistol was knocked from his hands the iranian an officer of the third corps was a short thick man like the four other soldiers now surrounding murphy their rifles pressed hard against his chest when the officer shone the flashlight directly into his eyes murphy instinctively put up his hands and saw his right hand was bleeding from where theyd kicked the pistol out of it the officer gave an order and one of the men a faded picture of what looked like an ayatollah on the butt of his kalashnikov bent down and retrieved the the officer laughed you are idiot he told murphy safety strap is not released he meant the safety catch but murphy was in no mood to correct him where did you come from the officer asked his tone sharp bullying the sky murphy said ingenuously but the officer took it as sarcasm whipping the revolver across murphys face there was a crunch of bone and murphy tasted blood like warm aluminum running over his lips there was a shot the officer pitching forward knocking murphy over another shot a flare there were several more sharper rifle shots two of the soldiers near him dropped the other two taking off a submachine gun chattered followed by a scream out of the grayness beyond the fringe of flare light one of the two soldiers who had run off was returning or rather was being led back hunched over begging for mercy the stillfalling flare revealing the fiercest looking man murphy had ever seen dragging the soldier by the ear he was a giant of a man in a white turban not the kind murphy had seen worn by east indians but a turban like those hed seen among afghans the man was wearing a rough dark green lambswool vest over a loosefitting khaki smock his khaki trousers wrapped about the ankles with puttees chest crisscrossed with bandoleers his eyes ebony black his beard and mustache as white as his turban as he pointed his kalashnikov to the sky his other hand holding the prisoners ear flexed forcing the iranian soldier to the ground plane he asked murphy his gun still pointing at the sky american murphy knew he was supposed to give only his name rank and serial number but right now he was willing to give the tall man his instabank access number and anything else he wanted yes murphy said americ his voice gave out the effort to speak creating a searing cramp from his lower jaw up to his nose where the revolver had struck him when he tried to peg his nose with his ringers to staunch the flow of blood he felt a mulch of skin and smashed bone the strange thing being that it was the rest of his face rather than his nose that ached indescribably what remained of the nose felt numb the man in the turban flung the cowering iranian soldier to the ground next to the dead iranian officer and offered murphy his kalashnikov while spitting on the soldier murphy waved the rifle off not sure he could stay on his feet if the pain didnt ease up the kurd drew his dagger the iranian now scrambling backward like an upturned crab but unable to turn over quickly enough to get up and run the kurd muttering an oath barked out an order and the man stood up with one slash the kurd disemboweled him then kneeling and with a few more quick strokes the dagger flashing in the dying flare light castrated the stillscreaming iranian the next moment stuffing the genitals in the nowdead mans mouth and returning murphys to him murphy had heard now and then of kurdish rebels the bane of the iraqis and iranians alike who like the afghans far to the east had never given an inch in their fierce determination to keep the mountains as their own americans the kurd said friends stingers murphy thought he must mean stinger airtoair missiles which the united states had given the afghans years ago after the russian invasion friends the kurd declared again with the same kind of ferocity with which hed killed the iranian friends yeah murphy said still holding his nose his voice nasal very glad he tried desperately to think of something else to say but couldnt instead he sat or rather collapsed to the ground dimly aware of other figures kurds moving in toward him as he fumbled in his emergency kit with the insane idea that he must get out his phrase book instead his head weaving like that of a drunkard he began holding the hershey bar out to them and offered his to the fierce one who smiled holding the aloft as treasure he said something but to murphy though he knew the man was very close the kurds voice seemed far off lost in a swirling vortex of explosions and the air commander telling him screaming at him to bail out murphy thought he saw the tall warrior once more holding up the strip of three condoms from the kit then blacked out chapter fortyfour freeman had kept his word with cheng having violated the ceasefire the american general had unflinchingly struck back now it was kuangs moment turpan had been destroyed and late the next day the taiwanese admiral gave the order at hours the moonless night wreathed in mist admiral kuangs roc republic of china task force on radio silence set out from kuangs home port of kaohsiung on the far southwest coast of taiwan steering a course on a northern tack into the formosa strait as if the battle group of one helicopter carrier two cruisers two destroyers and four frigates were following routine maneuvers up the milelong west coast of taiwan the task force proceeded under the electronic umbrella of two grumman ecs earlywarning patrol planes the battle group steamed twentytwo miles northnorthwest before kuang after being joined by one hundred invasion craft that were waiting under camouflage nets off the mouth of the river hsilo midway up the taiwanese coast would steam due west past the pescadores twentynine miles off the coast if all went well this course would take the task force toward the mainland where the landings would take place on the peninsula north of xiamen dao or amoy island the invasion would be supported by other roc regiments already dug in on quemoy island which had long been part of the republic of china and which lay less than ten miles from the chinese mainland and which chiang kaishek had festooned with highexplosive cannon the roc cannon on quemoy would lay down heavy artillery barrages on mainland chinas near shore islands less than two miles to the west of quemoy for so long kuang mused so many people in the world had seen taiwan as the permanent home of the kuomintang after they had been pushed out by the forces of mao zedong in but through the mist of the hundredmilewide formosa strait chiang kaishek had fled the mainland to taiwan to carry on the fight it was here that the next asian miracle occurred when taiwan joined japan and south korea as the three most prosperous countries in all of asia admiral lin kuang a onetime captain of a guidedmissile frigate did not remember this time of the economic miracle so much as the stories told by his greatgrandfather stories of how taiwan was not to be viewed as home never could be but was an island garrison that through the blessings of matsu the sea goddess had been given to the kuomintang on the condition that one day they would return leaving the indigenous taiwanese who resented them so much behind and reclaim their beloved homeland it was not enough kuangs father grandfather and greatgrandfather told him to be content with the luxuries the kuomintang had wrought from their industry and the labor of the indigenous taiwanese and the wealth the millions of chinese émigrés had produced nor was it sufficient to dwell on the fabulous wealth of the treasures they had brought with themplundered the red chinese said from beijings forbidden city such treasures must one day return to china or else how could the spirits of their ancestors who had borne such travail ever rest in peace lin kuang remembered how his greatgrandfather recalled the humiliation of having been driven into the sea by maos forces and of everyone in the world sounding the death knell of the kuomintang as the beleaguered refugees clambered ashore on taiwan even the americans who had given them so much aid finally did not believe they would ever see the kuomintang on mainland china again but then when the north koreans had invaded the south the american response to the invasion resulted in beijing suddenly having to shift its military away from taiwan in order to meet the threat of the americans in korea and quite suddenly made the old kuomintang dream realizable not only were the descendants of the kuomintang keen to act but all those who suddenly saw the vast prize of china before them and to carry out the promise the superbly equipped republic of china forces were ever ready and now poised to attack the communists eastern flank across the straits with freeman in the west and the roc in the east cheng would find himself in a twofront war a threefront war if you counted the stalemate along the amur to the north the communist chinese navy was primarily a coastal defense force and did not have big ordnance or the superior training of the americantutored taiwanese navy nor could the communists shenyang fs updated versions of the old migs pose any real threat hawkeye radar report sir unidentified vessel bearing two seven zero range seven zero miles proceeding south any others admiral kuang asked the officer of the watch nothing yet sir when we rendezvous with our landing craft off hsilo river we will know meanwhile tell me if the unidentified turns possible hostile the operator said receiving the hawkeye feed hostile confirmed type kuang asked huangfen missile attack boat two hundred tons speed twenty knots four hy surfacetosurface two twin mms one forward one aft radar capability kuang asked it cannot be more than twenty miles less than six sir and theres a haze he wont have us on passive sonar either unless he stops his three diesels are twelve thousand horsepower each that would wash out any of our sound the admiral nodded quite so if all went well he knew they would be off the mainland peninsula an hour before dawn then it would be no longer possible to conceal themselves unless the goddess matsu was still with them and kept the curtain of mist wrapped about them kuang prayed fervently he held fast to his vision his private vision of him personally on behalf of the roc accepting the red chinese surrender at the wars end he would go to the beautiful city of hangchow the home of his ancestors his dream to be consummated the moment his limousine drove through the gardensurrounded gates of maos villa on the west lake whereupon he would alight in triumph to personally remove the stain of maos house from the earth chapter fortyfive the first sign was a hazing over of the sun so that only a dull purplish corona of it showed through the mounting turbulence it was one of the great gobi storms without rain one of the terrible gritty and blinding storms borne westward in the desert this time of year april being the worst month and added to by the sandpregnant winds out of the tien shan mountains in chinas westernmost province of sinkiang where the line of the mustard sky could be seen eating up the blue before the banshee howling and the pebblehailing assault enveloped all cheng was pleased he had prepared without the hope of a storm though he knew it was the time of the year for them but now he could see the massive storm gathering he welcomed it it would make his trap so much more terrible for the americans oh the americans had done well in the desert in iraq cheng told his subordinates and the incompetent hussein helped them by being such a fool of a tactician besides cheng reminded his commanders the pla had had time months years to prepare for any invasion from the north down the corridor between the great sandy desert to the west and the harder semidesert to the east the corridor freeman was heading for about ten miles in width and twentythree in depth you must understand comrades cheng reassured his hq staff that the vietnamese defeated the americans because they realized the falseness of an american adage that the jungle was neutral that it was equally difficult for the americans and north vietnamese alike this of course was an incorrect assumption because the vietnamese used the jungle as their friend as we will use the desert remember we are on home soil and have had more time to prepare than iraq he paused is everyone in position his commanders assured him that they were if anyone breaks camouflage he is to be shot immediately understood they did each platoon officer having been supplied with a noise suppressor on his revolver so that such a shot would not be heard driving south freeman planned to take the path of least resistance between the great sand dunes around qagan nur or qagan lake and the salt lakes south of it the corridor extending from the dunes on his left or eastern flank to the railhead of erenhot on the chinesemongolian border freemans objective was the capture of the rail spur line that stuck twentythree miles out northward from the eastwest main line and which stopped at the small settlement of qagan lake even though me town was actually ninetyfive miles south of the lake it was named after chengs strategy owed something not only to the vietnamese whom the chinese detested but also to the egyptians highly successful foxhole strategy against the israeli tanks in the yom kippur war and he had elaborated upon it not with a tactic from sun tzu but from the turks of world war i there had been no way to gain satellite reconnaissance during the dust storms that cheng had used as cover during the weeks of the ceasefire no way for us or any other satellites for that matter to discover that beneath this corridor the most obvious funnel to the south he general cheng had used only a fraction of his threemillionstrong army to dig a vast interlocking system of reinforced tunnels unlike the viet cong tunnels they were not elaborately built insofar as they were not elbow or sshaped nor did they have the misleading culdesacs or sudden angular changes in elevation that in the darkness might trip any enemy brave or foolish enough to descend into them rather it was a honeycomb of tunnels that led to hundreds of foxholes easily concealed and manned by an elite infantry division from shenyangs military district group army and some elements of the infamous beijing military districts thirtyeighth army of tiananmen massacre fame after firing an antitank missile from one foxhole a pla team could quickly remove itself to another and in most cases the angle of depression of the m or m tanks big gun would be useless against them at any close range only the tanks machine guns could effectively come into play son of a bitch commented the pilot of one of freemans kiowa scout choppers which had come low behind the protection of boulders the size of bungalows cant see a friggin thing the choppers copilot pushed the button that raised the periscopelike twoeyed mastmounted sight still higher above the rock still nothing they were in the fog of war wherein even the best commanders become confused by a lack of information or too much conflicting information the chopper went higher but they still couldnt see through the dust the choppers intake filters in danger of clogging when they began getting radar blips which were duly reported to freeman but which could not be identified freeman ordered the kiowas forward and already minedetector equipment and antimine blades and flails on mineclearing tanks were called up from the columns as he ordered them to go into single file formation no mines were reported but one kiowa came in with a report of dozens of what its crew believed but could not be sure were red arrow antitankmissiletracked vehicles a small screen in freemans command tank selected the red arrow from the computers threat library telling him that the vehicle had an effective range of three thousand meters a rate of fire of two to three missiles per minute warhead diameter mm hit probability greater than percent but they were still a good six thousand meters off then there came sitreps situation reports from another kiowa of what they thought were tii main battle tanks equipped with laser range finder though the dust should render the laser useless in the storm freeman realized that the chinese probably could not see him either but the noise of the kiowa scouts alone must certainly have alerted the chinese to his presence no doubt cheng like the americans wasnt going to fight blind it would be a matter of who would be seen first by whom and freemans tanks could outreach the ts by three thousand yards and the ts by two hundred yards as they had in the iraqi desert standing back beyond the range of the enemys t mm and t mm cannon while using their own mm to deadly effect but in the midst of the blinding storm that was still not anywhere near its zenith freeman was haunted again by what had befallen his tanks along the neverskovorodino road earlier in the war when second army had fallen into a trap baited in the taiga by dummy tanks inflatables that looked like the real thing from only a hundred yards away and with cheap oil lanterns in each to give off enough heat for an infrared signature when hed sent in the apaches the siberians had unleashed their vams vertical area mines whose sensors were triggered by the sound of the approaching rotors and lifted off spewing up submunitions that cost him a third of his apaches and their crews slow to ten miles per hour he told the driver slow to ten sitting there in the turret the gunner seated just below him the loader to his left and the driver well forward beyond the turret wall down under the mm gun and coaxial mm machine gun freeman wanted to send apaches forward but the dust storm was so thick it was unlikely theyd get a clear shot at anything besides if they were so close to the chinese only a matter of a mile or so there was always the danger of a blue on blue when you could easily mistake the outline of one of your own tanks for one of theirs any visible insignia in this case a black arrow stenciled on the mas cupola sides front and back would be almost impossible to see in the sandstorm he could not afford to go ahead blind and so ordered several apaches in to try to find and blast a hole through the chinese armor which was still nowhere in sight the air however was now thick with smoke as well as dust the smoke additive just one of the items purchased through la roche chemicals and something cheng had paid particular attention to after remembering schwarzkopfs boasting about how the americans could see through the dust much better than the ts but we saw through this crap in iraq freeman said not the same crap general the gunner replied theyve somehow made it so thick that we just cant pick up anything infrared or laser were running blind well so are they freeman said but he was right only up to a point the flail tanks had as yet reported no mines there was a string of profanity followed by back up back up what the fuck over his radio network freeman could hear the gas turbine of a flail tank roaring we struck some kind of berm or the next minute freemans ears were ringing he couldnt hear anything for the explosion transmitted by the radio of the flail tank before it went dead in an instant freeman made his decision ordering the entire armored column which prudence had just made him form a single file to withdraw dont deviate a millimeter from your incoming tracks he ordered of course this was impossible as most of the tank tracks were blown over or already half filled with sand but each tank commander and driver knew what he meant turn your tank on its own radius and get the hell out of here the full realization of what might have happened had all his tanks been aligned for a frontal attack now hit him that every one or certainly most would have suffered the fate of the flail tank that had crashed through what appeared to be some kind of tank trap the chains from the flail tank digging up the sand deep enough before it crashed through in what freeman now realized might be a tunnelstrewn corridor each one of them allowing twoman rpg mm type antitank grenade launcher teams to take on his tanks he was wrong the tunnel had in fact been dug so as to bear the weight of the m not to collapse as had happened in this case and to allow access warrens for rpg teams during freemans hasty retreat several more tanks were lost to teams who realizing the american column had failed to take the bait at the last minute had come out of their holes prematurely most of them being killed at such close range by the ms brownings nevertheless two of freemans tanks were lost to rpg teams the tanks fourman crews cut to pieces by the chinese as they tried to exit the burning vehicles at the very least the chinese had mauled freemans column and caused him to give the uncharacteristic order to pull back cheng was furious that freeman had not come on in a frontal battle charge but the storm had brought caution to the americans tactics and confusion to both sides very well cheng said now he retreats where does he go he must either come through the corridor or go eastward to the dunes that border the corridor his aide suggested cheng uttered an ancient oath with the corridor mined as well as honeycombed by tunnels there was only one place freeman could go toward the dunes but it was impossible to tunnel the dunes sand had the insistent habit of falling in on you the moment you tried to dig a foxhole in it very well cheng thought returning to sun tzus axiom the military has no constant form just as water has no constant shape adapt as you face the enemy it must adapt freeman had and so would he colonel cheng ordered get me shenyang air army hq immediately the drop he had in mind would be a little haphazard and it would have to be done in execrable conditions but it was the only way to stop the americans besides it gave cheng a sense of perverse satisfaction to know that the very weapons hed be using against freeman had been provided by an american la roche out of warsaw pact surplus cheng recalled how hard he had to fight the central committee for the allocation funds to buy the weapons now he would be vindicated if there was one thing freeman hated it was retreat and already a cbn reporter well in the rear of me logistical tail of the armored column hearing that freemans armored spearhead was withdrawing was in immediate contact with his tokyo affiliate via his four wire satellite dish phone within the hour the la roche tabloids around me world were spewing forth freeman on the run freeman was flipping over the leaves of his satchelsize operational map pad assuring himself that you either went through the corridor between the dunes to the east and the mongolian border to the west where satrecon in one photo out of fifty had peeked through a brief clearing in the storm and spotted hundreds of heavy chicom field batteries or you could try a fast end run across the dunes on his extreme left then wheel about southwest in the sand but if he knew this he knew that cheng must know it too so if you were cheng youd try to stop the americans at the dunes or better still try to take them out before they reached the dunes freeman knew his mas had a distinct advantage over the chinese ts and ts in that the m was much faster then he got the bad news that the most forward of his tanks which were now withdrawing from the antitank tunnel corridor and swinging east toward the dunes were already reported as being under attack by swarms of chicom motorcycle and sidecar battalions many equipped with sagger optically controlled antitank missiles it was difficult enough to deal with antitank ordnance normally which is why freeman had ordered the withdrawal from the tunnelhoneycombed corridor but mobile sagger antitank teams were a much more dangerous threat even though freeman knew it would probably be as difficult for the chicom sidecar units to spot his tanks in the blinding dust storm as it was for the tanks to see them despite the blinding sandstorm however the quick turning ability of the motorcycle sidecar units was a distinct advantage for the chicoms there was the muffled crump of yet another tank as the explosion of fifty rounds of its ammo went up and for a minutemm tracers from its machine gun ammunition could be seen flying madly in all directions as faint orange streaks in the dustchoked battlefield it was at that point that freeman realized from the reports of two drivers from the knockedout tanks that it wasnt mines that were planted in the corridor but the much more dangerous mobile antitank rpg units that had stopped them the general immediately ordered a battalion of his tanks to race at maximum speed for the sands and the bulk of tanks to reform for an echelon attack five tanks to an echelon fortyone echelons in all heading forward again toward the tunneled corridor but not until he ordered his three squadrons of sasd men men to race ahead of the tanks in their seventy threeman favs or fast attack vehiclesdune buggies built for war the battalion of american tanks racing for the dunes on freemans left flank were told not to enter the dunes the moment freeman had received a report from the forwardmost tank that aircraft could be heard there above the dust storm you sure theyre not our apaches trying to get a look see positive definitely fixedwing aircraft general right freeman acknowledged then we must assume the chicoms are dropping mines thousands of them onto the dunes it left him with no choice he would either have to retreat fully or hope his favs as outriders could somehow navigate a safe passage through the corridor as he reformed the tanks for another attempt on the corridor the first favs appeared the lead vehicle being manned by aussie lewis as driver david brentwood as codriver and machine gunner with another sasd trooper on the back raised seat behind the tow missile tube brentwood ordered the seventy favs to spread across the tenmilewide twentythreemiledeep corridor this meant that there were approximately seven favs to a mile of front but while they tried their best to keep no more man a yard spacing between them it was impossible to be sure because of the visibility being no more than twenty feet what the hells he doing now a cbn reporter demanded of norton attacking norton replied tersely uncharacteristically adding what the hells it look like well were too far back to see exactly norton commented didnt report that to your paper did you that freeman was in a lead tank but right now the cbn reporter was more alarmed than insulted but jesus hes trying to drive through the corridor before the chinks turn their big guns from the mongolia border on him shouldnt take them long to tow them into position no norton said its a race all right hes running for gold and theyre coming in from the flank jesus christ itll be nip and tuck wont it norton waved over a fav yes sir you fellas got room for an observer sure in the back said salvini who was driving with another sasd man on the machine gun in the codrivers position and choir williams in back manning the tow next to choir you can get a grip on the roll bar ah listen the reporter said if you guys are pushed for space norton had his sand goggles up and winked at salvini who waved encouragingly at the la roche reporter hell no trouble man always glad to help the press the reporter hesitated dont want me to tell the new york office youre chicken do you norton pressed only halfjoking the cbn reporter smiled weakly no right off you go then and within thirty seconds they were gone choir williams advising the reporter against the sound of the wind and the whine of the ninetyfourhorsepower engine you hang on boyo when we get to those holes itll be bloody murder what holes them bloody manholes that cheng has popped here and there atop his nest of runnels throw you clear off if youre not careful you just get a grip on the roll bar here like mr salvini says okay the fear in the reporters eyes was hidden by the goggles well be testing for mines choir informed him having to shout over the favs engine testing aye freeman doesnt know if the chinks ave mined the corridor as well as tunneled it we doubt it but the chicoms sure as hell are having mines dropped on the dunes now that cheng thinks were taking the dune route on our left until he sees us the reporter said coming back to the corridor aye choir said but hell be getting reports of our tanks over by the dunes and hell have to decide where he wants to concentrate his strength why cant the tanks test the mines dont be daft laddie m costs four million dollars fast attack vehicle comes in around twentyfive thousand thanks the reporter shouted that makes me feel better oh its a fine dune buggy is the fav your readers might be interested choir said thirteen and a half feet long five foot high six foot wide tubular steel frame can negotiate almost any terrain and faster than a bloody tank seventy mile an hour attack speed boyo is there someplace i can get off the reporter asked choir smacked the newsman goodnaturedly on the shoulder ah youre a cool one boyo standup comic we have here lads but salvini and his machine gunner couldnt hear him in the wild banshee sound of the storm the next minute they were airborne at fifty miles an hour the reporters legs off the steel floor his knuckles bone white on the roll bar choir pulled him down salvini saw a blur on the enormous blur of the mustardcolored dust storm the blur seemed to be turning or rather spinning and looked about the size of a baseball sagger he yelled yanking the wheel hard left while his codriver manning a machine gun fired in the general direction of the sagger he couldnt see the man firing it but knew that the operator had to remain in line of sight of his target in order to guide the russianmade antitank weapon to its target and the us soldiers had learned from pows taken before the ceasefire that machine gun fire coming in your direction had a way of unsettling your concentration on the sagger control toggle the sagger kept coming toward them and salvini turned hard right the sagger couldnt make the acute turn and passed them by a quarter mile on brentwood saw another saggers backflash two oclock he yelled at aussie a hundred yards the fav was doing fiftyfive and aussie pressed his boot to the floor the twoman sagger team though they needed only one man to guide the missile was scrambling back into the manhole the first one made it aussie braked hard to prevent engine damage and hit the second man full on rolling him under the car fast like a big soft log aussie backed up to make sure and david fired a long burst into the manhole cover its sandy wooden top flying apart like cardboard then he dropped in two grenades and they were off again no mines so far aussie told brentwood no brentwood said but were only five miles into the corridor another bumpy seven straight ahead the next two miles were not the hardbaked semidesert terrain that theyd been bouncing through so far but a milewide spill of sand and in this the fav was superb up one side of a dune and down the other in its natural element aussies fav was still in the lead when he slowed and pointed off to his left tmd shit the response came from the usually moderate brentwood what is it the sasd man behind them on the tow asked woodencased mine bloody worst so metal detectors wouldnt pick it up the man on the tow said right aussie answered and were only running on seventy pounds overpressure which is why we mightnt have set off any if we ran over them they could be the tmdb type only go off under a main battle tank wont waste them as antipersonnel need something really heavy to detonate them a buggy probably wouldnt do it how can we be sure david said everybody out aussie said im in command here aussie ill do it brentwood said fuck off this is an order brentwood said get unbuckled ill drive im the fucking driver im not moving till youre out david looked up at the man on the tow how about you stansfield i cant get out he lied somethings wrong with my buckle you stupid bastards aussie said all right hang on with that aussie drove through the howling spitting wind directly at the cm woodencased mine as he saw it looming up he shifted uneasily in his seat and driving over it cupped his left hand under his genitals and closed his eyes nothing happened he put the fav quickly in reverse and ran over it again then he pulled the pin on a fivesecond grenade dropped it by the mine and put his boot to the accelerator a hundred feet from it the explosion sent out a shock wave through the sand that was like a ripple through water well aussie said we know theyre not dummies bastards are genuine enough but they wont be set off by a favs overpressure thats something anyway brentwood grabbed the radio phone to tell freeman he could again have to slow his advance to single file or as many files as he had flail tanks that could go ahead whipping the ground with their heavy chains to detonate the mines he asked freeman what they should do next though he and aussie and everyone on the fav radio network guessed it already boys freeman said to tank crew and fav alike were slowing down and our tanksll have to get behind as many flails as we can chengs going to have time to move his guns across from the right flank maybe directly in front of us theres a ridge at the end of the corridor where it narrows theyll use this high ground for their artillery ms range is damn good at three thousand meters but it cant overtake their thirteenmilerange artillery you boys in the favs are going to go in ahead of us holy cow a fav driver said if an m tank cant outshoot chengs artillery how the hell are we going to freeman knew well enough they were in a tight spot made worse by the lack of attention paid to detail by his new logistics whiz whitely up in chita whitely had been through every detail from the size of every bolt to water decontamination pills but hed assumed that the rail gauge of the transsiberian which the americans had to use when supplies were unloaded at the port of rudnaya pristan would be the same as that of china it wasnt and to change troops and their equipment from one train to another was infinitely more complex than the average person realized or could ever imagine to move tanks especially those fitted with flails and so vitally needed down south was a logistical nightmare whitely had no contingency plan for how to get us cargo moved quickly from transsiberian gauge to chinese gauge freeman had fired him as soon as hed found out but that didnt change the situation what would change it was freemans knowledge of the minutiae of war that yet again would contribute to the freeman legend it was nothing mysterious and quite simple once explained to any soldier or civilian for that matter and it had to do with angles of fire now listen up freeman said to the favs quickly now we dont know exactly where chengs guns are at the moment freeman had no way of knowing it in the blinding hell of the gobi storm but cheng was about to let him know with the biggest artillery salvo since the sinosoviet wars of the sixties it would be the opening barrage over two hundred guns of what was to become known as the battle for orgon tal or big dick as it was known to freemans second army the tiny settlement of orgon tal being near the railhead freeman hoped to capture midcorridor and so sever chengs supply line from the east cheng nonplussed by reports of sightings of freemans forces attacking both at the dunes to the east and regrouping in the tunneled area had to decide now whether to rush down more troops from the northern armies on the manchurian front this attack of freemans might well be a feint like that used against hussein in with the main body of the uss second armys airland battle strategy yet to strike all across the manchurian border as freeman had done before shifting his attack south it was then that cheng decided he needed more uptodate intelligence and the truth was general cheng believed that no one could deduce more from interrogation than he could this malof woman for example the russian jewess who had led the underground resistance in the jewish autonomous region on the manchurian border and who had just been recaptured north of harbin after several months of freedom following the ceasefire she had been a great help to the americans with her band of jewish bandits harassing china border traffic all along the black dragon whether or not this harassment was itself part of a larger set piece in the americans overall battle plan would tell cheng a great deal about freemans strategy cheng knew that they also had in beijing jail an american sasd trooper smythe who might be of use as well knowing how the sasd worked as auxiliaries to main attacking forces accordingly he ordered them both rushed to the orgon tal railhead with any other prisoners who had been captured within the last week or two by four pm he should have at least sixteen pows mostly chinese june or democracy movement members and saboteurs caught around harbin including the russian jewess meanwhile he assumed freeman was attacking on two fronts locally upon the dunes to the east of orgon tal and through the sandstormblasted corridor and accordingly gave the order that his heavy guns especially the towed m mm with its elevenmilerange pound shells his threemilerange attila mk multiple rocket launchers and his d mm seventeenmile gun with its rate of fire of six to seven rounds per minute be moved as fast as possible into the middle of the southern end of the corridor chengs troops positioned the guns on an eastwest axis atop a hundredfoot tongue of clay that ran east to west for several thousand yards a few miles north of orgon tal railhead so that the artillery and the railhead line formed a rough t the artillery in effect protecting the railhead cheng envisaged his trap now as a dragons mouth the teeth would be the mine fields atop the network of tunnels that the american tanks would have to negotiate first while at the back of the dragons mouth came the flame of the artillery the latters mobile dish radars sitting like clumps of high ears atop the ridge not visible beyond thirty feet in the dust storm cheng entered the orgon tal railway stations waiting room as bare of human comfort as anyone could imagine looking more like a barrack that had been opened to the searing breath of the gobi but at least it afforded some shelter from the storm the sixteen prisoners were told to stand they ranged from a small wiry student shaking so much cheng could actually hear his teeth chattering to an old man in his seventies his face creased like leather its hot in here cheng told the student contemptuously why are you shaking im cold said the boy about fourteen years old youre guilty cheng said his arm and hand rigid fully extended tapping the boys shoulder with such singleminded and increasing force that the boy looked as if he would collapse the boy had already wet himself in fear you are all guilty cheng said looking about like an angry schoolmaster in his experience it was the best possible way to break down a prisoners resistance criminal or not everybody was guilty of something all the way from murder to petty theft as a child to sexual fantasies they could not possibly confess to those they loved to resentment of the party yes they were all guilty you cheng said to a man in his midforties a worker in a fading blue mao suit what instructions do you get from the americans none comrade general cheng looked at him and believed him but it didnt matter often they knew more than they realized cheng was still unsure if this corridor attack was merely a feint to hide the fact of a massive us attack south from the amur to grab all manchuria he walked behind the prisoners look to your front a major bellowed there was a shot a workers face exploding like a melon parts of his grayish brain scattered on the sandy wooden floor one prisoner the boy gave a moan and collapsed cheng pushed him gently with his boot wake up get up the major kicked the boy get no cheng told the major dont hurt him help him to his feet the boy tried to get up but dryretched and stayed on his knees looking strangely like a wet cat there was another shot and the boys torso crumpled and seemed to melt into his arms before he fell sideways with a bump into a pool of his blood it was imperative to cheng to be unpredictable in such circumstances this held more fear than most people could bear i will return in a half hour i want to know what your orders were from the americans tell the major word for word if you tell the truth you will receive reduced prison sentences whatever you say will be carefully checked and if it is found that the information you have given is incorrect you will die more slowly than these two he indicated the worker and the student as cheng walked out he told the major i want those reports in half an hour yes comrade general the major had only four guards and so asked who of the prisoners could read or write a man in his late fifties though he looked much older and alexsandra malof indicated they could very well he said to alexsandra you take half the group the old man the other six take their statements including your own i have no pen or paper the old man said neither have i alexsandra said the major ordered one of the guards to go to the nearest hq tent along the rail line and get pen and paper major alexsandra asked forcing a smile despite the grim circumstances may i confer with the old man as to how we might no the major looked at her the hostility in his eyes so intense that she fully expected him to slap her you think that i am an idiot no she said feigning surprise you are awarded the medal of freedom by the americans and you think this will protect you he asked bitterly no i just thought it might be helpful if you thought the major said that you could influence the old man and the others no i be quiet the major strode out of the room quickly looking for the guard hed sent alexsandra coughed and tried to say something to the next prisoner but her beauty her dark silken hair dark eyes and a figure whose curves not even a mao suit could hide intimidated the prisoner another young male student all four of the guards were staring gawking at her nimen hui shuo yingwen ma you speak english she asked them pleasantly they shook their heads still looking at them she made a writing motion against her hand but she was talking to the prisoners either side of her this is the only american attack they wont attack along the amur she said still looking and smiling at the guards this is the real attack here if anyone in the line speaks english pass the message down the americans arent going to attack from the amur this is the real attack one guard started to wave at her shaking his head censoriously side to side another getting the same idea jabbed ineffectually at the air in front of him with his bayonet their message was clear and they could see the major coming back but by then the prisoners had been whispering among themselves barely audible in the wind the guards moving toward them threateningly yelling at them an jing yi xia be quiet the major and the guard accompanying him had two sheets of paper and pencils and immediately gave them to alexsandra and the old man the old man thanked the major but said in broken but very clear english i do not think we know so much comrade talk in chinese the major yelled at him and get on with it backfiring the fav leapt into the air at an acute angle and for a moment aussie brentwood and the tow operator thought theyd been hit did you fart aussie yelled over at brentwood who ignored him davids eyes looking hard through the goggles for any enemy movement up ahead he saw another mine directed aussie to it where they dumped a grenade and took off again followed by the unusual hollow sound audible even above the wind which betrayed the existence of a tunnel exit near the detonated mine aussie made a quick uturn saw a manhole half exposed like a trapdoor spiders web and braked the fav as david gave the manhole several bursts of machine gun fire until it was perforated like the top of an old beer barrel given to the ax they dropped two flash grenades and following their boomp tossed in their skip antipersonnel mines these steelspringlegged spiderylooking mines were preset to go off when approached filling the air with enough shrapnel to kill anyone up to ninety feet away in the tunnel it would be even more devastating no more diversions brentwood ordered aussie let the guys in the tanks deal with the manholes besides they can follow our tracks freeman wants us up front fast i know aussie said his lips stung by the sand just didnt want any bastards popping up behind us ill keep watch the tow operator shouted you watch your front brentwood corrected him youve got the extra height i want you to see the guns before they see us bloody charge of the light brigade aussie called out recalling the famous and doomed charge of the british cavalry against the russian guns at balaclava favs better than a horse brentwood retorted and we have sagger the tow operator yelled eleven oclock low it was coming at them like a curdling spinning glob of gray spit through the mustardcolored air and aussie began his evasive driving willing his nerves to hold till the last possible moment before going into a turn that hopefully would be too acute for the sagger but brentwood got lucky a bullet or two from the long burst of his machine gun hit the sagger there was an explosion like molten egg yolk a stream of blackish white smoke and the whistling of shrapnel one piece hitting the favs front bumper aussie felt his left thigh was wet and feared one of the jerricans of gas had been hit but the cans were all right oh christ it was brentwood stop david downshifted and braked and an even denser cloud of dust enveloped them from behind as the vehicle shuddered and slewed to a halt brentwood was looking back the tow operator still clung to the shoulderheight roll bar but his head was gone the shrapnel having decapitated him his torso a fountain of warm spurting blood they only had time to unbuckle him his dog tags were gone and lay him on the sand aussie got back into the drivers seat while brentwood used two standardissue condoms to tie down the browning for the rough ride ahead and then mounted the wet bloody seat of the tow operator and buckled up without a word aussie set off again down the corridor four miles to go and only god knew what lay ahead he was struck again by the sheer bloody confusion of war at this moment neither he nor he suspected any of the other favs bradleys or ms knew whether they were winning or not now the scream of chengs salvos passed overhead to create havoc amid freemans columns well major cheng asked what have you found out the major handed him the sheaf of interrogation papers its a jumble of patriotic assurances the major said but several of them said that this attack of the americans around orgon tal here is the major attack this means the americans actions along the black dragon are only diversions to keep our troops up there that they will not attack any further along the amur cheng looked at the four reports that made more or less the same point where are the prisoners now in their cells the major responded what he meant was that they were in fourfootsquare fourfootdeep holes in the desert earth covered with spiked bamboo grates weighed down by rail ties so that the prisoner not allowed to sit could not stand properly either the guards watched three or four cells each and could do so at one glance already there was the smell of human excrement coming from some of the holes as cheng waited for the major to play the small cigarettesize cassette tape recorder that had been given to one of the guards he turned the volume up but the sound of the storm was too powerful like a fryingfish noise covering the conversation or whatever the jewess had said to the guards the major pushed rewind and slid the little volume stick back to the mid position now they could hear her not well but enough to make out that it was she telling the others to say that this attack against orgon tal was the full airland attack the major saw cheng smile at the information even a neophyte in intelligence listening to the tape could tell what she was up to she knew that everyone would give up sooner or later under torture and most would give up much sooner man that she was a veteran and so shed concocted the idea that this assault against orgon tal was the only attack in the hopes of persuading him cheng to move his northern armies south away from the river she had asked the guards whether they had spoken english which none of them did then shed proceeded to tell the others what to confess but not all of them just enough four hopefully to convince cheng that this was the real attack shes been too clever by half cheng said with a smile of deep satisfaction the americans obviously have a plan to attack from the north the incidents along the black river and amur and around a have not been diversionary shes told us precisely what freeman is up to major the americans are going to do exactly the opposite of what she told them to tell us there will be an attack from the north and so we must reroute some of our southern divisions northward there was a tone of urgency when cheng asked the major is our towed artillery in place he meant had there been time to move the artillery that had been sent to the dunes east of them back to orgon tal they should be ready within the heavy thumps of chicom pepperpots the long muzzlebraked mm howitzers gave him the answer with their seventeenmilerange twohundredpound shells tearing through the sandstorm above the us tanks because there was no reliable radar guidance for me pepperpots due to the storm clutter it was strictly harassment fire but soon chengs underground tunnel troops could hear the ma abrams approaching and could give the approximate quadrant as the fiftyton tanks proceeded slowly overhead behind the terrible din of chain flails setting off the mines but soon cheng knew when all of the tanks became visible to manhole positions quadrant vectors would be much more precise and his artillery would cut the americans to pieces it was all a race against time but the chicoms could afford to wait for me mas to come forward the ms effective range being three thousand meters the americans mm howitzers sevenmile range hopelessly outreached by the six giant seventeenmilerange pepperpots to be on the safe side cheng had kept his armor well back behind the rail line spur at orgon tal to be deployed only should any of freemans armor break through the artillerypounded corridor to further bolster his confidence there was the fact that his t and t main battle tanks outnumbered the americans four to one and as hed told his superiors were manned by chinas best not by demoralized iraqis what about the prisoners the major asked cheng shoot them cheng shrugged now or later but id prefer the americans to do it the major was puzzled keep them in the cages for now cheng instructed yes general cheng they said had a use for everything in a winter campaign against the siberians many years ago he had used the frozen corpses of his own dead strapped together to make up sleds so as to pull more ammunition and supplies across the frozen lakes and through the snow reports were coming in that some of the light american fastattack vehicles were in advance of the tanks saggers had hit three or four but they were still coming cheng was perplexed it was so unamerican why on earth was freeman sacrificing relatively lightly armed vehicles compared to the m tanks he had at the front another one of freemans feints perhaps but if these buggies get through to the guns the major suggested worriedly they could cause havoc with our gun crews cheng looked at the major as if he were mad our pepperpots would blow them to kingdom come before they got anywhere near us major if we could see them the major began and if all right cheng said well surprise them with that he gave the order for all tunnel troops to exit to forget about the tanks which could be dealt with by the big guns to exit and make their priority targets the american dune buggies then one of the american fav drivers said it was as if god had suddenly intervened on the chinese side the storm suddenly began to abate making the chicom infantry and the american favs more visible and allowing the dish antennae of the chicoms radar to start picking up some of the favs take them out brentwood yelled above the storm into the fav radio net fast with needles quivering on their rpm dials the chenowth fast attack vehicles souped up to hit seventyfive miles per hour in battle conditions hadnt been seen before by the chinese troops the favs had extraordinary firepower with an m machine gun fore and aft and assault rifle for each of the three men strapped into the vehicle a mm grenade launcher laser target designator and an antitank missile launcher with steelwebbed side compartments for casualty litters if necessary or for extra ammo and boxes of explosive they were moving much fester than the tanks the aircooled fav engine was well muffled and rear mounted its cooling fins low down so that its infrared signature would be low to the enemy ahead the chinese poured out of the tunnels and for the first time in the newspaper reports the phrase swarms of attacking chinese was appropriate there was no doubt that the chicoms with their red arrow antitank missiles and machine guns would take out at least a third of the favs others already starting to be attacked by saturation mortar bombardments the buggies were often picked up off the ground by the concussion only to disappear in explosions marked by oily orange smudges in a rain of dust it was not known whether the chinese would have time to stop all of them one fav came up over a rise at forty miles an hour and ran down five chicoms just as they were emerging from their tunnel exit another fav its engine hit stalled in the sand became a magnet to a platoon of chicom infantry like ants encircling a piece of meat the three americans were cut to pieces but there was no longer a chinese platoon of thirty men only half of them remained to claim a passing victory and several of these were fatally wounded back further an m abrams stopped its front right track spinning off under the blow of shrapnel from a pepperpot highexplosive shell hitting the earth only yards away then coming from the south through the gaps in their artillery at the chinese end of the corridor came several companies of chicom motorcycle and machinegunmounted sidecars every fifth motorcycle and sidecar unit carrying a sagger one oclock in the dip aussie yelled to brentwood his face creasing momentarily from the sickly sweet stench of burning bodies but even as he spoke he felt the hot rush of superheated air from the tows backblast the pinion occupants of the motorcycle and sidecar unit were firing frantically and in the sidecar another chicom was working the toggle on his sagger when the motorcyclist still on his bike was lifted skyward and in a somersault was aflame the sidecar no more than a hunk of burning metal sixty yards away from where the burning motorcyclist landed and broke in half his body shriveled black pieces of him peeling off in the high wind like sheets of burned newspaper driving with his left hand his right firing his assault rifle which he had braced against the passengers side m aussie was heading for another motorbike and sidecar coming straight at him the sidecar machine gunner having only a ninety degree fronttoleft arc in which to fire otherwise there was danger of him shooting his driver aussie pulled the fav hard left giving the machine gunner on the sidecar even less of an angle as brentwood popped off four mm grenades from their launcher none actually hit the motorcycle and sidecar unit but the shrapnel cut into the motorcyclist who looked down saw blood and for a second lost concentration the front wheel of the bike jackknifed and they were over the sidecar man crawling out drawing his sidearm keep going brentwood shouted conscious that it was still a race to the chinese guns before the storm cleared enough for the chicom radars to be effective against the mas there was the zing of smallarms fire off the cage of the favs roll bar frame cheeky bastard aussie yelled i oughta go back and run im over keep going brentwood shouted yes sir righto sir already everything was mustard looking visibility twenty feet maximum jesus were doing sixty faster the sandblasted desert was now taking on the aspect of a moonscape caused by everything from the explosions of the big pla mm mm and the mm mortars to the huge pepperpots their he shells screaming overhead louder than normal because of sand blown onto hot metal the sense of a hot moonscape added to by the explosions of sasd tow missiles though brentwood could be heard yelling above the sandstorm on the fav radio network that they should conserve tow rounds for heavier targets he meant pla armored personnel carriers type and multiple rocket launchers mounted atop type apcs as well as the hongjian missiles carried by the type apcs as he repeated the order a pic stick or stick grenade bounced off the spare tire and exploded ten feet behind the fav another chinese twenty yards ahead of them pulled a cord fuse of another pic grenade but it blew up instantly taking his hand off david brentwood didnt know why but the chicoms had a fixation about picric acid it had cost them quite a few hands the acidpacked grenade becoming dangerously unstable if any moisture was allowed to accumulate in the grenade boxes but then picric acid was cheap and the pla had three million men to arm cheng probably figured the odd hand was worth it the castiron shrapnel from the stick grenade when it worked had been the cause of many american casualties in southeast asia american medevac choppers being called in to carry out the wounded whenever the americans were hit they had the habit of stopping until their wounded were taken care of to wound an american seriously in chengs view was better than killing him for it tied up at least a dozen men from firstaid types to chopper crews who could have been more useful carrying the battle forward indeed freeman was already ordering troopcarrying hueys blackhawks up forward not in an evac role but to see whether it was yet feasible to use them in an offensive role in the storm but napoftheearth flying was wellnigh impossible because of the ground clutter caused by the bouncing of millions of pieces of silica the sand reflecting radar rays in a dancing static besides banks of pla type and w mm aa machine guns were radar linked and once the helos rose above twenty or thirty feet some of them were coming under fire for at this height they were out of the radar clutter that prevented them from flying napoftheearth but it took them high enough to be picked up on the most powerful of the chicoms radar freeman ordered them to land and wait till the high winds and sandstorm abated enough to reduce the bounceback clutter on their own radars it was a mistake chinese infantry streaming out of the holes had taken out four of freemans helos with corncobs the name given by the americans to the conical shape of the mm type antitank grenade round freeman quickly ordered the helos to get airborne at least those that were not shot up too much to return to their hover positions behind the tanks four miles back freeman cursed himself for such a dumb move which the la roche tabloids would have called brilliant and daring if it had worked out and opened a hole in the chicom defenses but which even now was being described by one of cbns fourwire phonein rear observers as freeman reeling before pla the only bit of good news freeman got that day was that admiral kuang true to his word was apparently en route to the chinese mainland off fukien province and so freeman hoped was effectively bottling up the plas army group one and group twelve in the nanjing military district that served fukien province freeman had already lost fourteen mas and most of their crews to the pepperpot harassment fire it was to be expected under such odds and he was confident that once out of the corridor bounded by high dunes right and left of him hed have room to move and then hed show cheng what the ms free of a mine field could do but against this he had a morale problem his troops earlier enthusiasm already hemorrhaging with the loss of fourteen tanks and their crews and he knew that if they broke through to the end of the corridor they would still be facing four to five tanks for each of the ms and that those odds would go higher every time freeman lost another m while being forced to proceed in column behind the flail and other antimine grader tanks yet to retreat would be to suffer the same kind of attrition among his tanks as the pepperpots would not let up problem is he told dick norton who was now aboard a bradley apc running close alongside him in the lee of one of the grader tanks our guys got a bit spoiled with saddam insane for all our smart bombs duly reported by a tightly controlled press you know percent of all bombs dropped failed completely to hit their targets norton nodded actually the general was wrong it was even worse over percent of all bombs had missed their targets in iraq but the army had controlled the press in a way it had never been able to in vietnam and the few spectacular successes with the smart bombs made the whole iraqi campaign seem a walkover that freeman and others should be able to duplicate and theyre wondering why im not sending in the air force freeman thundered christ theres already been four choppers taken out in this pea soup this isnt iraq its a damn sight tougher the general closed his eyes took off his goggles wiped them clean and put them on again announcing to norton well if huang gets to fukien hell keep them bottled up in the south yes sir met boys say the storm will pretty much die down in an hour or so thats what they told me an hour ago by god wheres harvey simmet hes the only weatherman who knows anything get him up here yes sir harvey simmet the meteorological officer for freemans hq was a man whose patience and dedication had been sorely tried by freeman in earlier arctic battles freeman calling on him halfhourly sometimes every five minutes in the heat of the battle everyone thought freeman had been acting strangely but he knew that once the temperature hit minus sixty the waxes in the poorquality siberian lubrication oils would settle out and clog the hydraulics stopping the siberian tanks in their tracks then he could counterattack and he did where the hells simmet freeman demanded were having him brought up the line soon as we can sir freeman grunted this damn storm has been sent to try us norton its hellsent yes sir norton wasnt about to contradict the general who had very specific ideas about hell and often viewed the vicissitudes of nature as heavensent omens in this the general was as superstitious as the chinese fellas neither salvini nor choir could hear the cbn reporter as choir was busy blazing away at a motorcycle and sidecar unit with his m salvini using his m on anything that moved in the dark day of the sand fellas the reporter repeated lets head back there was no answer look the reporter said a thousand bucks okay youve been very good ive seen enough no no boyo choir yelled without turning his head starting a new belt for the m you havent seen the big stuff laddie e as to see that now hasnt he sal oh definitely salvini agreed whats that the reporter asked ashen faced in his goggles the goggles giving him a mad look pepperpots choir explained biggest fucking gun in the world boyo it wasnt but it was big and choir knew that with its sheer size it would be an awesome sight if they reached the guns alive sal shifted down as they went up a small hill changing up as soon as he felt the two rear wrangler tires grip the reporter was holding a fistful of notes you keep your money chief sal said when you see those pepperpots you might need some toilet paper youre both mad the reporter yelled sas is fucking insane hang on salvini yelled then hit a series of deep potholes the fav sounding like a junk shop amid an earthquake out of the original seventy favs only thirty now remained and not one had failed mechanically then salvini saw another go up in flame hit by a sagger twentynine now said salvini cutting in on the fav network freeman informed brentwood and the remaining favs that a kiowa helos mast radar had picked up a high stationary blob on his screen before returning to hover position over the mas his explanation a high radar tower that once the storm died could give the exact positions of the ms thats your second job freeman ordered the favs through brentwood the reporter with salvini and choir sallow with fear asked what the first job was to follow aussie under the guns salvini said havent you ever heard of that under the gun i thought it meant you know having a gun on you the reporter said nervously salvini shook his head not here chief freeman got us all together back there and told us the pepperpots have an elevation of plus fiftyfive and a down angle from the horizontal of minus two you see he knows they cant lower their barrels beyond minus two so once we get into their noshoot zones under the guns like the cavalry used to that is beneath me lowest angle of their dangle they cant use the artillery on us anymore so what will you do are you serious salvini yelled shifting down again shoot the fuckers the gun crews think were out here for a picnic there was a loud bang the right front tire the fav skewed in the clay or rather in what seemed to be hard soil much like clay salvini was out and unstrapping a sparechoir covering him with the m before the la roche reporter knew what was going on in the distance a half mile to their left there was a terrific salvo hitting and shaking the earth and four more favs were gone only twentyfive remained by now some favs had taken more than twenty prisoners and returned them to the head of freemans column where me general himself directed the interrogation ask them who are party members there was no response though clearly several of the prisoners were frightened is it a shame to be a party member freeman pressed through the interpreter is there no honor after a few seconds one of the chinese pows raised his hand wo shi dang yuan wo wei ci er gan daojiao ao i am a party member and proud of it another man then another raised their hands signifying that they too were party members it was a surprise to the humvee driver whod driven freeman back from his m to the mobile apc interrogation unit like so many american soldiers he didnt understand that the actual membership in the party in china as in the cis was no more than to percent of the entire population most of the population in china merely obeyed because to do otherwise was to risk prison torture or death beheading now reintroduced by cheng and the central committee as a much cheaper alternative than wasting expensive bullets freeman had the communist party members removed from the apc one of them glowered back threateningly at the others freemans calfgloved hand shot out his forefinger jammed hard against the mans forehead now dont worry about it jack its none of your business outside the apc a grunt was puzzled asking another how come freeman called the prisoner jack always does when hes mad at you the older veteran replied where we got to take them the first grunt asked take them down the line and give them an mre he meant one of the prepacked meals ready to eat constitution says we cant do that the other grunt complained why the hell not its cruel and unusual punishment one taste of that crap and they all flattened beneath the scream of incoming the explosion of a pepperpots shell seventy yards off creating a crater and a rain of sand back in the apc freeman took his gloves and helmet off the close atmosphere thick with the smell of oil sweat and cordite everyone was perspiring in the cramped quarters including the general but he looked fresher and suddenly became more informal which helped ease the tension between him the interpreter norton and the pows looking directly at the remaining prisoners he nevertheless spoke quickly to the interpreter the echo of his voice fairly booming inside the apc tell them i admire the chinese people magnificent fighters for thousands of years some men showed no emotion looking impassively at him others had their faces down one unable to wipe his nose properly because of the plastic strip that cuffed his hands behind him was wiping his nose on the shoulder of his loosefitting olive green pajamas freeman ordered norton to cut the plastic cuffs off them i like the chinese freeman repeated but i hate the party the party exploits the people a man needs more than an iron rice bowl nearly all of the prisoners now looked up at him because he knew of maos promise of the iron rice bowl a promise of a strong agricultural revolution that would feed all china a rice bowl is good freeman went on his hands resting in front of him in a relaxed yet authoritative manner but is this all a man and his kin desire why can you not get into the foreigners hotels the luxurious friendship stores serving foreigners while you must work to make goods you cannot buy even if you had the yuan which you dont why is this no one answered but he had their undivided attention it is freeman told them because the party keeps everything for itself while you slave they sit in their baths at the zhongnanhai and dine on succulent delicacies and their chauffeurs drive them in red flags while you ride a bicycle the general paused he knew they knew he spoke the truth there must be another revolution against the party he added if you are to be free but now you are like the cormorants who fish on the yangtze with the rings about their necks so they can catch fish but are not allowed to swallow them do you wish to have the ring about your throat all your life the interpreter finished but there was no answer with that freeman took a large manila envelope from norton tore it open and tipped it upside down bundles of hundreddollar bills spilling out on the bottom of the apc we suspect freeman said that the party has a large radar tower and complex immediately to the south of us we need to know its position because the storm hides it from us he put a thousanddollar bundle in front of each man he did not expect anyone to take it but merely wished to whet their appetites but as he was putting his helmet and gloves back on a hand dashed out and took a thousand the mans expression defiant he spit and yelled what did he say freeman asked its a little indelicate general whatd he say god damn it he said fuck the party by god freeman said sitting fully up and grinning looking like george c scott i like that by god i do he extended his hand in friendship and the pla soldier took it take the particulars from him norton once youve got the grid references another man took a thousand then another and another soon only one bundle was left and the last man the others all looking at him shrugged then took the bundle before him when you have the references norton freeman repeated give them to the fav leader i want those towers and whatever buildings are around them taken out and fast before this storm stops if the favs get through the guns sir if they dont freeman said lowering his head to get out from the apcs rear door ill kick ass from here to kentucky and norton yes sir once outside freeman indicated the two of them should keep walking freeman pulled his gloves on tightly then squinting while adjusting his sand goggles told norton tell those dirty little rats in there that if the information they give you doesnt jibe if we dont find a goddamn tower where they tell us theres one ill shoot every one of the sons of bitches personally general may i say something off the record go sir what youve already done contravenes the geneva convention paying taxpayers money to and what about shooting them norton couldnt tell whether freeman was bluffing couldnt see his eyes clearly enough through the goggles but the general was just unpredictable enough thatd be murder general freeman leaned over his voice barely audible above the storm yes but they dont know that there was a trace of a grin but then it was gone the general saying soldiers ratting like that on their own men deserve shooting i thought you didnt like the party either i dont but to risk their own mens lives by telling us i dont go for that thats despicable but norton said as the general mounted his m and stepped into the cupola youre glad they did as freeman stood his head out of the cupola binoculars raised in the hope of seeing something in this forlorn wasteland he rapped on the tank for the m to start off there was a subdued growl from the gas turbine engine im a general norton not a fool you get those coordinates to brentwood or if his favs gone give them to the next in command but it has to be done or well have us a massacre out here once it clears and their radar starts working by last report we only have twentyfour favs left general get it done dick freeman yelled back norton was incorrect for as they spoke there were only eighteen favs left out of the original seventy harvey simmet arrived and told freeman that the met forecast was actually wrong freeman was delighted thinking that the storm would last until he could get past the chinese guns no harvey simmet said the storm is about to abate it meant the favs had less time to take the guns and to do anything about the radar complex damn it harvey what kind of forecast is that i cant change the weather general im not god freeman suddenly remembered pattons relief of bastogne when bad weather had delayed him until he ordered a prayer for good weather and got it freeman sent for the padre and told him to get rid of this appalling bitch of a sandstorm harvey simmet and norton exchanged glances but said nothing by god freeman thundered we have to start killing chinese soon as we can aussie watched the needle on the rpm dial quivering his right foot jammed so hard down on the accelerator he thought hed push it right through the floor as the wranglers tires gripped and kicked up sand on a thirtydegree slope hauling the twothousandpound vehicle and exerting pounds per square inch as its ninetyfourhorsepower engine gave all it had it mounted the summit of a dune and was immediately taking fire from no more than thirty yards away brentwood responded with a long burst of tracer from his frontmounted mm machine gun there was an explosion a burst of lemoncolored light in the dust storm only now did he see he had committed a blue on bluefired on a friendly fav the latter rearing up like some wounded metallic monster its cage engulfed in flame its tow controller already afire the driver still strapped into his seat as it came down with a thump the rightseated gunner brentwoods opposite number having released his seatbelt and been thrown clear there was no time to mourn everyone knew blue on blue was a high danger in the dust storm and was the very reason freeman could not yet commit airtac to the battle aussie drove toward the burning vehicle the flame giving the afflicted fav the appearance more of a skeletal tubular frame than the fighting vehicle it had been seconds before brentwood was out of his fav before aussie had brought it to a complete stop and was rolling the burning tow operator over and over in the sand extinguishing the flames the gunner who had been thrown free and only slightly wounded trying with aussie to douse the driver with the extinguisher but soon the foam was exhausted the driver dead the tow operator had been saved but the man was horribly burned his face looking as if half of it had simply melted and slid away it immediately reminded david brentwood of the seemingly endless plastic surgery that had had to be performed on his brother ray who had received third degree burns aboard a perryclass guided frigate at the beginning of the war david turned his attention to the gunner how about you okay yes sir sorry sir we thought you were a chicom motorcyclesidecar coming over the rise and never mind brentwood said stay with your buddy ill radio your gps position back to the main column for medics yes he hadnt even got the sir out before brentwood was back in his seat and aussie was driving off brentwood realizing hed killed two of bis own men his silence now infused with tension they fired first mate aussie said moving the fav from zero to forty miles per hour despite the poor visibility i know that damn it two other favs were lost in other blueonblue engagements as they passed from the big guns killing range into the zone where because of the declination of the guns being only minus two degrees and because the guns themselves were on the clay ridge the shells could no longer bother them the remaining fifteen favs as freeman had hoped like those horsemen in the last great cavalry charge in history the australian light horse at beersheba in were under the guns the fifteen favs racing up toward the looming enormities that were the chicoms pepperpot batteries chicom infantry and apcs came out to meet them but here the sheer mobility of the favs with their relative lightness and stunningly accurate tow missiles took a deadly toll of the slower chinese personnel carriers and the much heavier firepower of the favs was creating a hosing fire that ignited one apc after another go for the gun crews brentwood shouted on the fav network the gun crews he repeated then go to the flanks repeat gun crews then the flanks do not engage their tanks conscious that flank might sound like tank in the confusion of static and explosions david repeated first the gun crews then find the radar repeat first the salvini swung hard right and there were two sudden bumps and screams as he ran down two chicom infantry exiting one of the manholes his tow operator exhilarated by having taken out three apcs and now pissed off in his own words that they had to stick to the original plan to take out the gun crews first choir yelled back at the la roche reporter lively enough for you boyo the reporter didnt answer couldnt answer his tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth dry as leather his grip on the roll bar so hard that his body was rigid despite the swaying motion of the fav as it went over several corrugations of sand where a dune flattened out before the incline to the guns what the aussie began but brentwood had already seen it a dozen or so civilian prisoners and captured american soldiers lashed to the wheels of the big guns aussie could see that one was a woman somebody came on the air wondering what they should do take out the crews for chrissake brentwood shouted and the favs now only fourteen remaining drove resolutely toward the guns the chicom infantry firing from behind them every time a gun went off the prisoners ran around on their rope tethers like crazed rats in a cage unable to get away from the crashing thunder of the guns unable like the gun crews to block their ears from the earthshattering sound smoke brentwood ordered as aussie began a weaving pattern to throw off the chinese smallarms fire soon all along the line the smoke from the mm canisters being fired from the favs rearmounted gun was so thick that the fav drivers had to gear down then go quickly for the gaps created by the outpressure of the guns still firing on freemans advancing tanks two miles behind the favs wheeled around behind the guns taking out the crew with machine gun and in a few cases tow fire half the hostages died as a result of either american or chicom fire it was a chaotic battle lasting only minutes the favs rear gunners often literally throwing fragmentation grenades down a pepperpot barrel or otherwise spiking the big guns so that they could no longer be used against freemans main battle tanks there was a stomachchurning rumbling sound like an earthquake and the noise of the fav chicom infantry battle was pierced by the hightoned squeak of metal on metal as the first echelons of chengs main battle tanks now lurched forward starting their advance toward the overrun pepperpot artillery this side of the mines that had slowed freemans echelons which were now turning into right and left refused formation three of the five tanks in an echelon having their guns aimed straight ahead the remaining two to one side chengs mbts contained everything from lasersight upgunned ts to ts two of the favs were turned back by brentwood with only a driver and gunner the rear cage section with the spare wheel and the side compartments that normally carried ammo and other supplies now used to hold those few civilians who had survived the attack on the guns one of them being alexsandra malof jesus murphy aussie said as the fav carrying her and others passed him would i ever like to mount all right brentwood snapped turn to the right flank and stay well out of range of their mbts i cant fucking well see the mbts aussie replied you will soon enough there were only ten favs remaining freeman knew that now the big chicom artillery batteries had been silenced he would soon be engaging chengs main battle tanks and he knew that while the laserranging ma with a top speed of fifty miles per hour and mm cannon was considered the best mbt in the world this was not enough to win the american mbts of world war ii had been as inferior to the nazis tiger and panther mbts as the chicom t was to the american ma but the then inferior us tanks had won the day through their sheer weight of numbers ironically validating the soviet maxim that quantity has a quality all its own it was not clear enough yet for satrecon to see how many chinese tanks were now aligned against freeman following the collapse of the pepperpot line and the padres weather prayer though stated clearly had done no good at all freeman estimated cheng would have had time to marshal at least a threetoone mbt advantage and if the radar station could not be found and taken out quickly enough to render the chicoms triple aa defenses ineffective against the slower but deadly usa thunderbolt and apache tank killers cheng could still quickly overwhelm the americans further once the chicom and american echelons mixed it up it would be near dark and iff identifying friend or foe would become increasingly difficult the mbts of both sides would be so close in the dustchurned night that even with friend or foe recognition not being a problem the danger of blueonblue fire on the ground and from the air would become a certainty yet only tacair could help redress the odds against the americans and so it was imperative that the ten remaining sasd favs take out the radar that would otherwise identify the incoming american planes once the weather cleared freemans lead tank identifiable by its two aerials rather than one received a burstcoded message of the latest intelligence estimate out of khabarovsk of the enemy mbt strength based upon rail movements along the southern manchurian mainlines and from beijing to erenhot what are the odds sir the loader asked i was wrong the general said its not a threetoone advantage after all thats good its five to one freeman said visibilitys increasing to fifty yards sir the driver reported dust storm seems to be falling off a little huh freeman grunted maybe well just pass one another eh lawson like two ships in the night unlikely general damned unlikely son anyway you wouldnt want to miss it would you no sir lied lawson who was now berating himself for all the times hed been grumpy at having to put his two kids to bed at night and knowing now hed give anything to be doing that at this moment and if he died would god if there was a god forgive him visibility increasing he said sixty yards a minute later he reported that the dust had closed in again visibility back down to forty yards the other bad news was that freemans earlier hope that the chicom radar complex was a fixed installation which once the weather cleared might be an ideal smart bomb target was dashed by a recent burst of radar waves from the chicom side that came in on a different vector this meant that the radar unit was mobile yet another reason why an air strike would yield nothing in a sky through which the american pilots couldnt see a reconnaissance kiowa had been sent out to test infrared visibility through the dust but no radar target could be found which puzzled freemans hq in any event even if the weather had cleared in time freeman was remembering how most ordnance dropped in the gulf war missed its targets what the public saw on cbn were the relatively few hits he knew it was up to brentwood and his favs to take out the chicom radar if they didnt freeman would lose any tacair advantage he might otherwise have chapter fortysix his private jet approaching dutch harbor from anchorage alaska jay la roche was reclining in his spanish calfskin chair a bevy of gofers attending his every need he had lost only one deal in his life and her name was lana née brentwood now in his view wasting herself in some berg of an island playing at nurse as he derisively put it hed kicked her out in shanghai years ago he told francine and anyone who would listen and for the kind of money la roche had a lot of people did he neglected to tell the whole truth that in lanas case she had been the one to leave him when in a frenzy of his orgiastic sadism hed beaten and choked her till she was near death the climax of his sexual passion often as francine could attest to being to urinate and defecate on his partner at those moments he was uncontrollable but he consistently viewed such forays as occasional lapses a selfdeception that even now allowed him to think he could get his wife to come back to him he had tried through congressman hailey to get her transferred out of dutch harbor nearer to new york hailey had tried but failed even though urged on by la roches color stills of the elected officials dalliances with several congressional page boys what happened to him francine had asked trying to be nonchalant but remembering the congressmans name had been mentioned once or twice to her by il trovatores barman as a warning about never crossing la roche had an accident la roche explained gun went off in his mouth what disturbed francine wasnt so much the story of the suicide shed seen enough of those in her time but the way jay told it he enjoyed it a lot and she knew what was bugging him about lana though francine had never met her only knowing what she looked like from the photo he kept in the new york penthouse and from some of the old magazine photos of the wedding before the war francine figured it was lanas very resistance to la roche that drew him to her she was the only piece of ass next to his male secretary la roche had told francine who had been stupid enough to run away from him by stupid francine knew jay meant lana had been the only woman whod had the guts to try to run from him but to an ego like jays the very fact that somewhere in the world in this case in dutch harbor there was somebody anybody especially a woman whom he couldnt own tittotoe and right through as he delicately put it wasnt merely galling it was intolerable now he was telling the stories of how hed beaten uncle sam how though he was the largest supplier of chemical warfare agents to the united states he was also the sole supplier of gb sarin and vx nerve gas to asia chinese north koreans vietnamese japanese la roche didnt care who he sold it to and when the congress passed legislation forbidding us citizens to trade with the enemy la roches army of lawyers had gone on the march as he gloatingly explained it finding jay boasted to francine as many loopholes as chickens in a barnyard if la roches metaphors were mixed as he told the story everyone on his private jet knew that chickens meant child prostitutes of either sex whom jay frequently used as dawn breakers just as his lawyers had found a way out of congresss restrictive legislation by the use of front nonenemy asian companies primarily in burma through which to ship the poisongasproducing liquids to iraq north korea and china so too had the lawyers protected him from the slightest whiff of chicken scandal the lawyers hands were strengthened by la roches ownership of his tabloid chain in north america and western europe if a decent paper went up against la roche as his wife had once done when she told him shed sue for divorce they would soon find themselves as she had up against not only la roches battery of experts but against threatened tabloid exposes of their families lana had been so naive at first la roche boasted to francine that she actually believed that if the stories hed threatened to publish about her parents werent true the papers couldnt print them how about this for a headline hed threatened her retired admiral brentwood denies he is homosexual occasionally hed told francine someone like that fool hailey who couldnt use his influence in congress to have lana transferred would snuff it rather than have his family smeared across the tabloids but usually it worked thats enough he said pushing the hair dryer away checking the back and sides of his lean darkly handsome face in the mirror pulling out his gold mouthwash nebulizer squirting it rolling his tongue around and showing off his immaculate white teeth as the plane began to descend francines sulkiness increased till now shed been under the illusion that she was what he called his number one pussywith all the lavish goodies and status that attached itself to the scrum of sycophants surrounding him moment we land in this burg he instructed his flunkies i want lots of pictures in that army px you know the kind of crap corporate sponsor visits to thank our boys and gals at the front the fasten seatbelts sign was on but jay ignored it you got it la roche chemicals pays tribute to our brave boys wounded in battle pile it on and francine keep your fanny off the corporate gifts there there was loud raucous laughter and for chrissake cross your legs i dont want to see your beaver all over the new york times there were more loud guffaws how about in the investigator mr la roche it was one of the la roche tabloids hey now youre talking legs wide apart francine there was another snorting snuffling run of laughter francine watched him as he bent low slightly off balance looking out the window if she knew anything he was on something not booze nothing you could smell shed seen him like it often enough before hed hand her the strap for her to play mommy maybe lanas on duty someone said la roche turned around his face thin stone hey joker this little soiree i told you to fix up with our gallant boys in the sticks is costing me change i told the army the navy the fucking air force i wanted to meet all the nurses if she isnt there joker im gonna throw someone outta the fucking plane the laughter died after the lear touched down on the rainslashed runway droplets streaming against the perspex the plane taxiing toward the small but obviously busy terminal francine saw a row of heavy khaki overcoats and navy blue uniforms she recognized lana before the plane came to a stop you could spot her at once francine thought one of those women who looked beautiful even if you draped them in a sack gorgeous figure that was flattered not flattened by the navy waves dark blue uniform and the spiffy little white hat with the snappy upturned brim made francine sick and lanas dark hair that was the last straw whipped with rain and it just sat there full and behaving itself ten minutes in that weather and francine knew her own hair would be a wet mop francine slipped on her sirenred coat but despite the cold she left enough of it open so thered be no mistake about her cleavage hell she had to do something she followed jay out he shook hands with the base commander but ignored the rest of the staff particularly lana as he and his party were ushered into the waiting uso army cars with lana left back on the tarmac francine was starting to feel better already colonel rodin the commanding officer of dutch harbor loathed la roche and his ilk but he was a professional and he wasnt a fool la roche had splashed a lot of money and publicity around and god knew the men posted in americas siberia deserved a little attention besides if la roche wasnt happy and leaned hard enough on the alaska congressman for dutch harbor and environs there was a very good chance the co could find something he loathed even more than la roche pushing a pen back in washington even so he afforded la roche professional military hospitality but no more after the photo session during which a bunch of reporters from anchorage including a photographer and reporter from stars and stripes got their shots of the multinational financier shaking the cos hand colonel rodin excused himself in the crowded px he sought lana out and told her that washington had requested that they be as cooperative as possible to la roche chemicals a major military contractor id prefer not to colonel lana said rather grimly i understand lieutenant im merely conveying washingtons wishes tell you he hesitated but said it anyway none of my business but i dont blame you they dont look my sort of people either must be at least six guys there of draft age health exemptions lana said knowingly fourf colonel rodin grunted i guess well please yourself lieutenant whatever you do is okay by me walk out if you want thank you colonel i appreciate that but she knew she had to at least say hello or some toady back in washington was going to get paid to complain to the pentagon about colonel rodins unhelpfulness as she walked over toward him through the crowd la roche didnt turn around but kept talking to francine she coming he asked yes francine said lahdedah if you ask me i didnt jay he swung around lana francine wanted to throw up but as instructed moved off swiping another drink from a tray passing by its bearer a gi all but losing his eyeballs to the wonders of her chest how are you sweetie jay asked lana fine you terrific terrific what you think of my little party she could hardly hear herself in the buzz of the px commotion very nice yeah something for the boys at the front and you gals too of course he laughed easily get you something to drink no thank you he lowered his voice still smiling hey loosen up babe muhammad comes to the mountain right isnt that enough for what he reached out and took another soft drink see no booze on the wagon he downed the pop in one go want you to come back babe miss you hey hey before you say anything i want to say im sorry mea culpa okay he moved to touch her arm she withdrew it hey swear to god lana checked in with a shrink the whole bit cost me a bundle but im straightened out im glad it was the first thing shed said to him that she had meant god but youre beautiful she said nothing unmoved lana this stinking war he glimpsed francine watching them sipping her diet coke changed everything right none of us are the same people for a moment neither of them spoke look honey you want the divorce you can have it she looked up at him yeah i mean it thats what i came to tell you but i want to do it civilly you know sit down figure out a little something for your folks theyre all right you know what i mean your brother ray all those bums i know a few people who rays doing fine jay hes all okay okay im sorry look ill level with you i wanted to see you thats the truth were also opening up a new plant in anchorage perfume he laughed that easy gentle goodlooking laugh that had been the first thing that had attracted her to him it seemed inconceivable now so long ago how she could have fallen crazy isnt it he said whole damn worlds at war and people want to buy more perfume yes she replied well not really i suppose she stopped what dyou say you come into anchorage for a day or two well settle it there ill have the papers drawn up anything you dont like hey were two reasonable people right are we sure we are look you dont have to worry i know about shirer she felt the involuntary chill of a threat pass through her but said nothing thats fine he went on ive got no problem with him thats why i came up i dont expect you to come back i he looked thoughtfully down at his empty glass hes making it up she thought hes making it up as he goes along i know i havent been any good for you lana he suddenly brightened on the other hand if it wasnt for me youd never have met this guy and hell dont make it hard babe all im saying is i know i gave you a rotten deal a rotten deal i cant go back and fix that but i can try to make amends he looked down at her and spoke softly its partly selfish but i need to wipe the slate clean i need to talk lana just you and me sit down

bucks it has to do with the board too lana la roche chemicals the agreement you sign has got to be well final they need to see it tell us what we can and cant change hell he said you try to tell them to do it through the mail she recognized the relentless legality of it theres a small hotel cum cafédavy jones she said its not very fancy but we could meet there i suppose he shrugged fine eight oclock all right she turned to go lana when she looked at him both arms were dangling by his side in a way shed never seen him before he looked defeated ill send a driver if you want dont bother she said ill get a base cab i still love you babe i only wanted to see you is that so terrible when la roches entourage moved out of the px francine could tell something had happened to him a young reporter his id press badge reading anchorage spectator tried eagerly to get a few words from him my names johnson mr la roche anchorage spectator i was wondering if youd care to say a few words about fuck off la roche told him what are we doing mr la roche one of the flunkies asked theres some rathole in this place called the davy jones make reservations for dinner if they know what that is eight oclock for two and a room for me were booked into the excelsior mr la roche nice little hotel overlooking the well go there and draw up divorce papers divorce papers the lawyer said but we didnt bring

right away mr la roche have them ready for me by eight oclock so i can take em with me to that davy joint and marvin yes mr laroche tell francine to get her ass over to that hotel room now chapter fortyseven aussies fav was halfway down a dune when they heard the bang and felt the vehicle shuddering aussie steering hard into the skid beneath the vehicle an avalanche of slowmoving sand and stones followed the stones as big as a mans fist within seconds aussie and david brentwood were out their new tow man swiveling in his seat to make sure he could cover them for the full degrees while aussie grabbed the jack and david hit the wing nut that held down the spare brentwood hoped that outflanking the chicom tanks would be easy given the speed of the fav but he knew he couldnt be sure until the chicom mbts got their first glimpse of a fav would they break and go after the favs or stay in echelon whatever its configuration might be i can hear them the tow operator said can you see em aussie said tightening the last bolt on the spare tire while brentwood finished putting the emergency patch on the flat no well thats no bloody use is it i can hear them too every fucker within a mile can hear they intuitively ducked the sound of ordnance passing overhead with that peculiar chuffing sound like a locomotive shunting at high speed made louder by the air duck with particles of sand they quickly put the repaired tire back on the spare rack right were off aussie said im the first one to spot a chow five to one on any takers david brentwood said nothing peering hard through goggles the sound of sand striking them like fine hail the tow operator took aussies bet for he could already see two blurs too big to be motorcycle and sidecar units youre on the tow operator said ten bucks done aussie said i see two of em eleven oclock what aussie said but now brentwood could see them too and flecks of tracers told him the blur whether it was an mbt or not was firing at them aussie swung hard left into a dip between two small dunes and stopped the engine in high rev you ready tow ready go never mind brentwood interjected go out to the flank its the radar we want swearing aussie dropped it into low gear and followed the line of the gully away from the tanks or perhaps they had been apcs tow aussie said you saw those tanks or whatever they are before you made the bet no lying bastard hope your prick falls off thanks aussie but you owe me fifty bucks they followed the line of the gully for two hundred yards or so then came up again there was a sudden break in the dust storm or was it the end of the storm then they came across a terrifying sight from the left to right as far as they could see a brigade of mbts between and tanks ts and ts was making its way down an enormous dune in the strange half light the tanks looking like a plague of huge dark moles crawling down some enormous fleshcolored back there was a streak of light and a more diffuse backblast from a tow missile fired from a fav somewhere to aussies left and a flash of red and yellow dame as the tow round hit a t brentwood was furious and on the phone network within seconds telling the favs to get out to the flanks to forget the tanks i say again forget the tanks his voice was all but drowned out by fire from the forward five tanks in the column which were breaking up going into ajin ru you fang tixin rong an echelon right wherein each tank of the fivetank platoon broke off so that the lead tank and two others slightly behind him and to the right had their mm and in some of the upgunned tanks their mm guns pointed to the front the two rearmost tanks having their guns pointed to the right almost at the same time another one of the columnsthere were fifteen tanks in it all began moving to echelon right it was the chicoms weakest point a legacy of having been trained like the chicom fighter pilots by the russians who were wedded to the doctrine of central control allowing individual commanders little flexibility unless central control released them of course central control was necessary to some degree in the us army as well but the release to individual decisions as in freemans leaving the fav tactics up to brentwood and the other fav crews was not as freely given to the chicoms and the degree to which cheng and freeman would maintain central command would become crucial if it came to a night fight should this occur cheng knew the americans were better with more experience in freeing individual tank commanders to exercise tactical flexibility giving the americans the edge when it came to tanks in an eyeballtoeyeball confrontation fixing a flat the fav just chewed out by brentwood reported couldnt avoid firing a towwere taking tracers now aussie swung the fav up out of the gully to the sharp sandy edge and he could no longer see the tanks the weather closing in again as they heard the clanking of the chicom armor far off to the left brentwood requested an update on the radar vector the kiowas were plotting it was the same the mobile unit hadnt moved and brentwoods magellan handheld global positioning system put them only three miles away at thirty miles per hour a nearreckless speed given the fifteentotwentyyard visibility it was estimated the favs on both flanks skirting the chinese armor should reach the radar site within ten minutes unless it moved again the motorcycle sidecar unit came out of nowhere from behind them the tow operator saw it at the last minute swung his weapon around on the swivel mount but the burst from the chicoms mm pks hit him in the chest and face blood pouring out of him aussie quickly turned left his foot to the floor the sidecar unit couldnt turn fast enough and aussie hit it full on the favs double crash bar now bent back to the lights the chinese motorcyclist flung off his machine and brentwood mowing him down then turning the weapon on the upturned sidecar giving it two good bursts the chinese gunner inside screaming over the rattle of the ricocheting bullets aussie and david brentwood cut the tow operator out of his harness snapped off his dog tags and went on ill blow that fucking radar so fucking high if we find it brentwood said adding hopefully should be there in ten minutes in those ten minutes admiral kuang was receiving the message from his forward awacs the airborne warning and control systems that a hurricane force five more powerful than those that had hit southern florida and the hawaiian islands in with winds in excess of miles an hour born in the marianas was now heading for taiwan and the hundredmilewide strait between it and the chinese mainland reluctantly with great sadness he ordered the fleet to turn about and head back toward taiwan in order to meet the hurricane headon and hopefully ride it out as practical a man as he was kuang was also deeply religious and he saw in the hurricanes attack a clear message that the hurricane was saving him from a crushing defeat a clear warning to wait for a more propitious time in any case he couldnt possibly make landings in a hurricane aussie a cry came from somewhere in front it was salvini choir and the news reporter who was standing up in the stilled fav like a mummy frozen to the roll bar beside them were two chicom motorcyclesidecar units looking the worse for their collision with the fav had a prang i see aussie said cheekily yeah salvini answered both hit me at once ah bullshit aussie said you guys from brooklyn cant drive a fucking grocery cart shoulda outmaneuvered em like we did david added looking at aussie the one we hit that was on purpose aussie responded okay hop in choir you with the tow your matehe meant me reporterin the back too what about me salvini asked you can fucking hoof it sal only a couple of miles fuck you sal said ill ride in one of your side litter trays wheres your tow man choir asked bought it a way back aussie said his tone losing its jocular vulgarity as he looked ahead the visibility up to forty yards asking david for a gps vector to the target steer one seven three and hope theyre still there choir said aussie had the fav up to thirty miles an hour within a few seconds then jammed on the brake the vehicle skidding sideways ploughing into the sand what dyou see david asked nothing ive got an idea he backed up to where the two chicom motorcycle and sidecar units were lying sal you try the one over there ill try the one nearest what for see if they still rucking work after you hitting em ones front wheel was bent beyond hope while the other had its gas tank so shot up that it too was finished the sound of armor fighting armor now drowned out aussies voice several thousand yards back in the mustard fog of dust and smoke freemans first echelon had come within sight of the chicoms aussie took off again in the fav david his legs braced against the floor taking a firm hold of the m machine gun for a second the fav was engulfed with the stench of excrement dont worry about it boyo choir said to the la roche newsman it was salvini aussie said as salvini lay on his side gripping the metal lattice work of the litter for support his head bumping on a pillow of c charges whats up with you you australian stop choir yelled target one oclock as the fav came to an abrupt halt in the loose sugary sand choir fired his secondtolast tow its backblast lighting up the fav the fav in its most vulnerable position still giving choir time to guide the optically tracked wireguided missile the motorcycle and sidecar unit that hed aimed at dipped over a dune the tow blowing the top of the dune off like the flying spray of some enormous brown wave next second the sidecar unit was coming back at them out of the fold between the dunes in which it had temporarily disappeared the chicom in the sidecar pointing a shapedcharge rpg at them cheeky bastard aussie said and was already into a series of s curves and dips the rpg fired a hot sliver of shrapnel slicing open the front left tire like butter amputating two inches or so from the footlong pack of c plastique ending up taking a chip out of the stock of the winchester riot shotgun that was strapped to the cage brentwood was still firing the machine gun and saw the chicom driver shaking as if he were some kind of machine coining apart falling away the long burst of machine gun fire literally chopping him to pieces the motorcycle jackknifed and was over on its side shit it was aussie two flats in one day aussie can it it was david looking suddenly older than his years anyone hurt no he turned back toward the la roche reporter who shook his head like a child on the verge of tears accused of something he didnt do all right david said now listen up all of you salvini was already changing tires in the lead ma general freeman watched through his viewer while the gunner below and immediately in front of him scanned his thermalimaging sight freeman was confident that with so much dust and now smoke from smoke grenades in the air it would be the americans who would have the edge able to see through the polluted air in the same way that schwarzkopf had reported how the american sights had been able to better see through the hot fog of war than had the iraqi tanks the concussion from the explosion of a bradley armored personnel carrier behind him off to his left could be felt not so much by any impact or discernible earth tremor but by the sudden surge in the mas air conditioner and ventilation system the inside pressure now rising not to keep out poison gas though it could do that too but rather the thick dust caused by the bradleys sudden demise it was a shock as much to freeman as his other three crewmen if they couldnt see through the smoke curtain then how could chengs tanks have seen the bradley unless the smoke laid by the chicom armor was particle infused that is thickened to make it harder for the thermal and nightvision viewers on the ma to penetrate there was only one way freeman saw to counter such a possibility close the gap between him and them as fast as possible freeman ordered a fullspeed attack in wedge formations his two hundred tanks moved from refused right and refused left configurations to the arrowheadshaped wedge formations wherein the lead tank pointed its mm gun and coaxial machine gun straight ahead the two tanks to the left and two slightly back and to the right covering the flanks by having their main guns pointing left and right respectively and if necessary all would be able to fire straight ahead without hitting one another must be using highparticle smoke the gunner said the reclined driver flexing his wrist on the handlebar control his lineofsight responsibility being the front the loader on freemans left responsible for the left side freeman responsible for the right and the allround view and with the capability of overriding his gunner well wait till the bastards get a taste of this highratio gearbox freeman said and with that the mas moved quickly and efficiently over the sand main gun steady chassis undulating as if on a gimbals mounting into the dense smoke ahead the round hunkered down domes of upgunned ts and ts were dimly then more clearly discerned the weak sun no brighter than the moon as it sank over the desert the driver picked up the first t gave its position and the gunner readied his mm the heat or high explosive antitank round streaking out of the barrel a split second later one oclock three hundred yards freeman shouted as the first t exploded from the molten jet that cut through its thick steel in sight the gunner confirmed the loader already shoving another heat round into pussy as the breech was affectionately called the round now en route to another t the round striking its mmthick glacis plate the firecontrol computer aboard the ma was already making minor adjustments for barrel drift the gunner using the coaxial machine bursts so that his thermal imager picked up the tracer dots more easily in the smoke and dust aligning the gun for the third shot in fourteen seconds when a deafening bang then a ringing noise shook the ma as if some giant had hit it with a mallet the blow had come from a chicom infantryfired rpg its shapedcharge round going instantly into a molten jet but the jet of steel was prevented from penetrating the sloped armor of the ma because of the tanks reactive armor pack which blew up upon the impact of me rpg diffusing the molten jet there had been much debate in the pentagon about the pluses and minuses of reactive armor but for the men in freemans tank it had worked admirably the moment the chicoms rpg hit the ma another hesh round had left the abrams and another t exploded but did not stop its buckled tracks still somehow grinding forward keeping the tank rolling down a dune albeit arthritically while it continued to disintegrate as a chain reaction was set off like some massive string of firecrackers its crew having no time to escape but one of them the driver visible as a charred torso dangling from the drivers exit beyond the turret the air was pungent with diesel and gasoline fumes mixed in with the hot stench of burning skin melting into the sand some of which was fused into glass by the molten jet of shaped charges three down the loader exulted his voice a fusion of excitement and terror freeman said nothing conscious that even with a threetoone kill ratio he might yet be unable to defeat the chinese if they outnumbered him by more than three to one which they did freemans driver acutely aware that the mas fuel tank was immediately to his left started up from his nearly fully reclined position when he heard the tattoo of light machine gun fire raking the metal only inches from his ear goddamn infantry freeman shouted run the bastards over for some inexplicable reason the driver started to laugh and couldnt stop the loader hearing him on the intercom also started cackling freeman glowered as the loader only with difficulty thrust another round home but couldnt stop laughing it was like a child being chased full of fear and excitement the vision of every ma breaking formation frantically taking off after individual chinese having struck the crew as insanely funny what in hells the matter with you freeman said while pressing the thumb traverse control and hearing the rattle of machine gun bullets hitting the cupola the loader was laughing so hard hunched over by the shell racks he was afraid he might have to urinate into his helmet it was a kind of hysterical terror that only tankers and submariners know several miles southward beyond the chicom tanks the dust was thinning out as aussies fav stopped just below the crest of a dune aussie and brentwood crawling on their bellies to the crest looked down between two giant hills of sand on a sight so unexpected that it literally took their breath away a forest so ordered and alien in its sudden appearance that they knew at once it was like the massive windbreaks of forests around turpan a reforestation project with menggulu or mongolian willow forming the outer acres like a moat there was also some shaji or seabuck thorn among them most of the forest however that looked to be about a mile wide and through the scopes about five miles deep was made up of huyang chinese poplars an island of green amid a sea of brown dunes well ill be buggered aussie said so now what dwe do over there brentwood said pointing to a dune about two hundred yards off to their left theres one it was a chicom mobile radar van whose rectangular dish the size of a collapsible bridge table and housing set atop a hydrauliclegged chicom truck resembled a us tpq type so much that aussie suspected it was an american unit probably bought despite us law forbidding it through chinese front companies in hong kong he was right jay la roche had bought ten used units supposedly on sale for taiwan and instead delivered them to china by diverting the cargo through hong kong not far behind and below the radar unit on a wide stony flat nearer the closer or northern end of the reforested area between the dunes there was what looked like a long refrigeration truck on stout hydraulic legs beneath a webbed camouflage netting possibly an ramc a radar management center where the radar inputs from the various mobile sites would be collated and from where the deadly aa fire network would be operated and in a flash david brentwood realized that if the ramc unit could be taken out then no matter how many mobile radars there were freemans intelligence now suspected five on the move destruction of the ramc would be killing the brain of the whole radar network the dust was clearing and the sun sinking fast david brentwood yearned for more smoke and dust cover long enough for the attack use the tow he ordered choir williams yes aussie put in but for chrissake dont miss i wont boyo choir said as he aligned the weapon he tried to fire it again still nothing its circuit was dead all right david said now listen well have to go in with the fav straight for the ramc choir you and ill hit the ramc see those two doors midway along it it looked like a long camper yes you take the left ill take the right aussie keeps the motor running he said nothing to the la roche reporter who was sitting down next to choir his eyes glazed in a terrified stare salvini you cover us got it got it aussie cut in you have the fun while i sit on my ass you and salvini take out any guards stupid enough to try and stop us i dont see any aussie said thats good brentwood said come on lets go the fav mounted the crest they heard a motorcyclesidecar unit starting up and aussie put the fav into reverse darkness had fallen but with their sasissue litton night goggles that in the daytime converted to binoculars they could see clearly between the dunes but were still at a loss to know precisely where the noise was coming from choir couldnt tell as his ears were still ringing from the thunderous sound of the titanic tank battle not far off between the dunes to the right somewhere aussie proffered david brentwood had his mm machine gun mounted on the dash pointed in the direction of the noise aussie reached over for the haskins rifle strapped to the right seat strut choir unclipping it for him let me have a go with the suppressor quickly then brentwood said aussie had cut the engine and was out in a second and at the crest looking down the dunes both ways the dust was thinning but it was still falling like pepper in the nightvision goggles soon through this curtain he could see a high rooster feather of dust the motorcycle and sidecar unit now just a dot four hundred yards away and moving along the flat skirting the ramc or whatever it was and climbing up toward the dune and coming in the general direction of the sasd group if he didnt have to he wouldnt shoot at them and would let them pass but if they kept coming up over the dune toward the fav hed have no choice they sure as hell were taking their time bloody puttputting along as his father would have said four thousand miles to the northeast in the aleutian islands a bitterly cold wind howled across dutch harbor as lana brentwood her parka hood dusted in fine white snow made her way quickly from the motor pools shuttle bus into the warmth of the davy jones restaurant as she entered cnn was interrupting a pretaped senior citizens pro golf tournament in new orleans with news of the massive tank battle now taking place in china some three hundred miles north of beijing and only miles from the great wall bad weather apparently preventing the effective use of the tankkilling american a thunderbolts jay la roche had been the only one who complaining where are we here hicksville had objected to the tv being turned on in the first place conspicuously not watching it while most of the other patrons in the dimly lit booths had paused to hear the news flash he sat desultorily stirring the manhattan in front of him having complained to the waitress that hed ordered on the rocks not a fucking iceberg the young ruddyfaced reporter from the anchorage spectator came in spotted jay and once again tried eagerly to get a few words from him fuck off la roche told the boy who acutely embarrassed started to apologize profusely but la roche wasnt interested he saw lana taking off her parka by the door and hanging it up immediately his expression of surly discontent vanished and he rose smiling moving out of the booth she knew he was going to try to kiss her quickly she slid into the opposite side of the booth sorry im late quite a flap on at the base were part of the logistical tail for freemans tooth he takes quite a bite no sweat he said i could wait for you all day weather over theres been lousy she said some huge dust storm or other coming out of the gobi desert and the chinese are apparently using some us radar equipment against us and are trying to hey no shop talk okay he sat back spreading his arms imploringly she shrugged all right where are the papers i thought we were going to have dinner first i never said that she answered you had dinner no well then im not hungry jay sure you are you could do with a few more pounds theyre workin you too no thanks she took her wave hat off and put it businesslike beside her you told me youd have the divorce papers ready for signing hey lana i thought wed agreed on a civil goodbye i came all this way is that too much to ask she paused with a private lear jet and all his connections lana knew it hadnt exactly been a chore for jay to come all this way as he put it after what you put me through jay not to mention your threatening to smear my parents in your gutter press yes i would say its too much to ask dinner with you is too much i agreed to meet thats all hey he said easily thats fine she moved her head away from him her hair catching the golden sheen of the candlelight she turned back angrily and looked across the table at him jay i have no interest in you i dont want to see you anymore ever theres no point in all the smooth talk or the smutty innuendos that your whores probably think are so cute have you brought divorce papers or not well need a witness yes ive got one of my staff xeroxing the damn set for you now he looked uncomfortable jabbing at the crushed ice with his swizzle stick hey im sorry all right i didnt want to screw this up but i guess with you and me its oil and water now yes she said solemnly i guess it is okay he raised his glass beckoning her to pick up hers she hesitated dont tell me i got that wrong too he said smiling give me a break you havent gone off martinis used to be your favorite poison she loathed him now and couldnt hide it her stare seemed an eternity to him whats wrong he asked now youre not gonna drink with me was i that bad to you quickly he held up his hands okay i was if you dont want to drink with me fine but its well its kind of petty isnt it christ im going to give you a fair settlement babe a lot of bucks believe me she was still staring at him i remember she said in shanghai one time you slipped me a drink all friendly loveydovey jesus lana is that what youre on about paranoid want to switch drinks unless he jibed sarcastically you think i got some venereal disease besides i havent touched it been waiting for you for my old flame she said nothing cheers he said ignoring her raising his glass reluctantly she lifted her glass and let his clink against hers and took a sip the truth was she was thirsty and would have killed for a manhattan after a long shift at the base and another day of worrying about frank where he was wondering when next theyd see one another if ever she couldnt bear the possibility of him being killed the sound of the patrol motorcycle and sidecar was muted its rattle absorbed by the enormous walls of sand that rose on either side of the gully between the dunes a whirligig twisting along a crest throwing the fine sand up like brown sugar then the rider turned up toward the crest not fast and not at a steep angle but making a gradual unhurried approach at no more than ten miles an hour it gave aussie no choice he flicked up the sand guard on the haskinss scope fixed the machine gunner in the sidecar in the cross hairs inhaled let out half his breath held it and squeezed the suppressor kept the noise to a quick bump sound the machine gunners head and arms flying back like a rag dolls against the white smear of the infraredsighted exhaust the driver made a quick uturn but aussie had the cross hairs on him and squeezed again the bike coughed once or twice like some animal and fell over on its right side the wheel of its sidecar still spinning aussie made his way quickly back to the fav the sound of the tank battle roaring unabated in the distance whether freeman was winning or losing he had no idea every crew was fighting its own war handing salvini the haskins aussie buckled himself in saying quietly that haskins is the best fucking rifle in the army the mfourteen salvini opined balls aussie replied starting the fav up ten to one youre wrong yeah whos to judge aussie slipped me fav into low gear and moved toward the crest we pick two guys each four in all and they fire the haskins and the mfourteen winnerll be the haskins balls salvini said come on you in or out in right aussie whispered as they made the crest going down the other side they were all silent aussie confident that the thunderous reverberations from the tank battle would cover the approach of the fav no windows choir observed looking through his nightvision binoculars at me ramc there will be when we hit it aussie said remember david cautioned the trailer hut now only three hundred yards off you stay in the car aussie yes mother they were at the bottom of the crest where sand gave way to hard cracked earth when a hand clamped aussies shoulder in a viselike grip what the mine it was the first time in the last hour or so that the la roche reporter had said anything no one believed him until choir saw it too poorly laid but a sliver of its black circumference showing the loose soil dug up to cover it had almost completely been blown away hes right boyo choir confirmed antipersonnel jesus aussie said what now must be all around us they hear one of those going off and theyll know he was interrupted by brentwood who was known to be head fast as they called it in the sasd and now showed why back up the dune they wont have laid them there too much shifting sand come on aussie back up aussie did so and when they were back over the crest salvini reminded them that if they didnt knock out the ramc quickly the entire american advance would be incapable of receiving tacair support in time too much longer and the american and chicom tanks would be so close together mixing it up at such close range that not even the a thunderbolts could help aussie brentwood said you get in the sidecar choir you stay here with the fav with the dashboard machine gun salvini you behind me on the pillion seat well retrace their path through the mine field around the ramc okay aussie said lets go and within two minutes aussie taking one of the dead chineses helmets was in the sidecar behind a beltfeed pks mm gun salvini with his heckler koch mm submachine gun slung over his right shoulder sat on the pillion seat behind brentwood who had taken the other chinese helmet and who was now adjusting his nightvision goggles lowering them and blowing grains of dust off the eyepiece before he could pick up the twowheeled track of the motorcycle and sidecar it ran along a fiftyyardwide porous clay gully between the dunes for a hundred yards or so and then turned left through a manmade gap in the dune and on to more clay around what they were certain was a ramc trailer a hundred and fifty yards in front of them the la roche reporter was licking his lips nervously suddenly one of the two sidebyside doors in the long trailer opened and shut in that moment choir had seen the dull bloodred glow from the interior and through the infrared sight could see a hot white stream coming from the man who facing away from the fav was urinating when the chicom turned shaking himself buttoning up his fly he looked over at the motorcycle and sidecar intuitively aussie waved the man waved back and reentered the control center but a second later both doors opened and david could see the orange spit of a submachine gun its bullets chopping up the dirt around them aussie pulled the trigger and gave the longest burst he could remember and bodies were toppling from the trailer they were only fifty yards away now with tracers arcing over from choirs position off to the left ripping and thudding into the trailer until the motorcycle and sidecar were only twenty feet from it but then the door of the mobile radar hut three hundred yards away atop a dune flung open and several troops came out firing choir swung his fire across toward them the door closed but he could see figures moving outside in the dark their bodies warmer than the air giving off an ample heat signature he fired two bursts saw one drop and another two scuttling under the van in the trailer it was chaos men shouting wood and aluminum splintering from aussies and salvinis machine gun fire at what was virtually pointblank range brentwood tossed in two grenades and covered his ears the explosions totaled the trailer fire and smoke causing the remaining chinese about six of them to come out one firing a pistol the other falling another on fire and aussie felt himself slammed back into the sidecar seat his left shoulder warm and wet david could now see the motorcycle and sidecar tracks leading from the ramc to the radar van and within a minute was over by it aussie giving all the weight from his right shoulder to the machine guns stock and spraying the hut one man falling down the stairs dead before he hit the ground another coming out from beneath the hut his hands up frantically yelling salvini kept his heckler koch on him while brentwood tossed in two more grenades the hut boomed and issued forth a rancid electricalfire smell smoke pouring through the shattered door seams salvini told brentwood to take them up close to the radar van then pulled a pin out of the grenade stood back counted one two threw it at the radar mast and quickly dashed under the van there was a bluish purple flash above them and then the mast was nothing more than a forlorn and tangled web of heatfused steel still standing remarkably enough but in no shape for reuse what do we do with him aussie said indicating the chinese soldier his hands still thrust up high in the air standing about six yards from them cant shoot the bastard cant take him back let him go brentwood said vamoose salvini said to the chinese soldier go on aussie added piss off the man took off in panic glanced back briefly and kept running oh shit aussie said but he was too late a mine exploding so powerfully that all aussie could see in his nightvision goggles was a fine spray like a reddish fountain blown awry in the wind it was the mans blood vaporized by a mine that freemans troops called pink mist as they were tracing their way back choir got on the radio network informing freemans hq that mount rushmore is ours repeat mount rushmore no it isnt goddamn it freemans loud reply came were still getting radar signals from the same damn sector maybe so general brentwood reported but theyre not able to send their reports to any ramcenter because goddamn it freeman shouted i called in tacair and weve lost three thunderbolts already it was at that moment that brentwood looking at aussie experienced a sinking feeling jesus aussie said its in the forest that trailer we shot up mustve only been a relay the friggin radar management center is in the bloody forest then freeman shouted take it out with that freeman was off the air and silence reigned over the most embarrassed sasd troopers in all of second army until aussie proclaimed must have land lines youre right brentwood said fiberoptic probably to stop our aircraft jamming their communication theyd have to use land lines running to a central control from that trailer we shot up salvini put in you see any aussie asked anyone there was no answer all right lets go back aussie said youre wounded brentwood said nah just a nick in the shoulder ill be all right you coming with us cbn aussie added i stay here the reporter answered can the bike and sidecar unit carry four of us back there asked choir piece of cake aussie said come on chapter fortyeight so jay said watching lana looking at the crushed ice like a crystal ball turning the glass her mind obviously not with him tell me about this shirer guy hes a pilot she said taking another sip i met him at i know when you met him whats he like kind considerate she touched the glass tracing a line with her finger across the condensation hes nice well jay said with an air of magnanimity i hope it works out thanks to jay hesitated whats his first name franklin she said frank the glasses clinked again sure you dont want anything to eat she was sorely tempted by the lobster cocktail no im she yawned im fine fine youre beautiful if youd have me back babe id he fell silent shed speared the olive with the swizzle stick and he watched her take it to her mouth leaning forward her breasts the more tantalizing for being hidden in the uniform the uniform that carried with it the suggestion of regulations conformity the very things that excited him to violate god but youre beautiful now dont get mad just a compliment im not mad she said taking another sip then sitting back against the plush padded wall of the booth she looked around it was the first time shed been to the davy jones restaurant its not as bad as i thought she said huh oh thought youd been here before no just heard of it navy lieutenants cant afford eating out not in restaurants anyway then have dinner come on relax im not trying to hit on you you believe that i dont know anything about you she said her finger trailing the edge of the glass i thought i did once but i dont she took another sip you think im an animal he said not all the time she looked around the restaurant when are those papers coming any minute before she could ask him any more questions about the papers he rambled on told them to take them up to my room but i can see now theres no way youd come up to sign them lanas smile was a worldly one a world away from the shy virgin that jay had married and debased until shed fought her way back to selfrespect her look now told him come on jay you take me for a fool so he said ill get someone over here from the excelsior if you dont mind a lawyer sitting in why should i she took another sip visibly more relaxed and feeling more in control of the situation okay he said lifting his drink to a civil parting of the ways no hard feelings she sighed and he saw her eyes going out of focus you okay yes she yawned why i dunno you dont look so good i told you they work you too hard at that the thud of her head knocked over the glasses and jay was by her side in two seconds hey babe the barman came over is there anything wrong mr la roche no jay said sarcastically shes fine loves crashing on tables should i call a doctor no shes got low blood pressure happens all the time shell be right in a few minutes a man appeared from one of the booths looking concerned coming over to see if he could help jay was lifting her up putting her over his shoulder better send dinner up to the room he told the maitre dcummanager certainly sir should i ring a doctor no i told you its just a bit of low blood pressure shell be right as rain in a little while you could give us a hand up on the elevator of course the maitre d said marge you clean up the table yes sir up in jays room the manager was still fussing shell be fine jay told him for the third time in as many minutes but listen maybe you should hold off on the meal ill call down when were ready yes mr la roche of course anything not long after the manager had gone jay heard the phone ring it was his lawyer downstairs who had been sitting a few booths away everything okay jay asked no problems mr la roche they cleaned up the booth real nice you switch her glass with mine yes sir mr la roche be through the washing machine in a few minutes anyway fine now i dont want any interruptions for at least half an hour ill call down when i want you when i call get your ass up here quick i want you here when she wakes up right of course mr la roche chapter fortynine when they returned to the dune overlooking the shotup trailer there was an eerie silence due to the wind having dropped considerably in the last quarter hour they found a clump of land lines leading into the reforested area and heard voices coming from the direction of the willows aussie estimated there were about six chicoms and that was the number he tapped out on brentwoods sleeve the sasd withdrew a hundred yards back up the dune and brentwood had his nightvision binoculars resting on the crest for five long minutes he watched as the chicom patrol emerged and walked around the trailer assessing the damage but careful not to go too near the mine field even when chinese whispered it seemed to be at about thirty decibels the sasd group by instinct and training knew what to do follow the patrol back from whence it came brentwood took the point aussie holding back for minute taking the tail end position gave himself a jab of morphine it wouldnt last long but hopefully long enough as the chinese returned to the forest the sas following them the infrared footprints an easy pickup with the sass nightvision goggles not a word was said from here on in through the willow trees and if necessary deeper into the poplar not a sound would be made everything done by feel and by a touch code very much like that used by me seals when they too went incountry brentwood following the fiberoptic line was sure of only one thing and that was that for ease of repair should a break appear in the line the chicoms would not have mined the area either side of the land line as it ran parallel to a line of poplars deeper into the manplanted forest the chicom patrol by aussies reckoning no more than five minutes in front of them the four sasd men did not rush but used their weapons as one would use a stick to sweep either side of the fiberoptic line to make sure there were no trip wires from ankle to neck height had it not been for the infrared goggles that the sasd were equipped with the chicoms would have vanished from view but the residual body heat of the sixman chicom patrol was visible at least for a while and then suddenly all trace of them infrared or otherwise was gone brentwood took out his kbar knife and soon joined by the other three was probing the ground for any unnatural seam that would be formed by a trapdoor or tunnel entrance concentrating on the area where the optic line ended and suddenly plunged underground that the radar management center was immediately below them they had no doubt but where the trapdoor was they still couldnt tell until by virtue of moonlight that had penetrated the dust beyond the great tank battle salvini was able to spot a rather jerky infrared camera ten feet up the poplar as a squiggle in his infrared goggles the heat caused by the friction of the camera moving so often the chinese officer of the day his red armband signifying that he was in charge of the first night watch was watching the four sas men on the video feed from each of the four poplarmounted cameras he saw the sixman patrol come in and asked them were you followed no the nco replied confidently not a sound with that the officer of the day nodded to the video screen the heat lines of the four sas commandos plainly visible on the closed circuit immediately the nco apologized and offered to take his patrol back up take care of them right now oh yes the ood said and what will they be doing in the meantime you go up the steps open the doubleblackout trapdoor i dont want a firefight up there or anything else that will draw any more attention to the forest they picked up radiant heat from down here seeping up through the trapdoor gently noiselessly the sasd team was quickly sliding its knives along the seam of the outer trapdoor the nco had lost face and begged to go very well comrade redeem yourself but i dont want any firing up there the ood insisted we dont know how many other americans could be in the area or if any of freemans bradleys will hear a firefight on the perimeter and come to investigate we risk revealing the whole complex but i confess i dont want that sasd team up there to get back to tell freeman where we are use your knives or bayonets and go through the trapdoor they havent yet discovered remember its about thirty feet away to the east so you should have ample time to come up behind them and kill them all no firing understand yes comrade the ood enjoyed the irony of it as the chicom patrol readied to make its way up again the fact that the very land lines fiberoptic cables that were far less vulnerable to emp or other jamming from the wild weasels etc were american made general cheng had purchased the best cable you could get from la roche industries up above brentwood tapsignaled aussie salvini and choir to back off and having been alerted to the one tv camera by salvini his infrared goggles picked up the other three that made a square and the four sasd men went beyond this square so they were no longer visible to the monitoring eyes on the four poplars that served as markers what the sasd men had no way of knowing was that the alternate entrance and exit to the underground complex was not in the more or less cleared square area bordered by the four poplars but was some twenty to thirty feet deeper in the wood so that despite the sasd precaution of moving beyond the cameras the chinese patrol would nevertheless be coming up behind them but then everything went crazy the earth began to tremble two enormous trapdoors were thrown open from the hydraulic pressure and up from the thirtysquareyard piece of ground bounded by four of the poplars a thing began rising from the forest floor looking for all the world like a great bateared beast four radar dishes atop a steel girder tower ascending into the night below the chinese ood bellowed his orders the american general had launched another tacair over the battlefield a few miles off and cheng had ordered the camouflage mast radar be put up immediately so as to throw up a radar net that could serve the deadly chicom triple a antiaircraft fire which included sams the six chinese rushed forward toward the sasd team but aussie and brentwood were already to ground having heard the chicoms the moment theyd started to run and in a deadly burst of heckler koch nine hundred rounds per minute of mm parabellum aussie and brentwood cut down two of the chinese less than thirty feet from the edge of the radar masts well a boomp erupted from choirs winchester riot gun sending a cloud of perfectly aerodynamically constructed darts or fléchettes cutting through poplar and willow leaves like a scythe and taking out another two attackers aussie take the tower sal you and choir cover him before brentwood had finished speaking there was another boomp from the shotgun and one more member of the chinese patrol fell propelled backward screaming and clasping what remained of his face choir fired yet another fléchette round down into the retractable radar towers well to keep chinese heads down he had the high ground advantage like the other three members of the sasd troop and like two men guarding a narrow bridge they only had to stop a few who were trying to run up from the well on two narrow stone stairways he was reloading when he saw brentwood using his heckler koch as a staff smacking aside a chicom bayonet and clubbing the man in the face with the h ks steel butt it was in moments like these that the sasd mens extraordinarily tough physical training stood them in good stead the man went down but to make sure brentwood gave him a bonecrunching kick in the head come on come on aussie hissed he was talking to the tower willing it up faster so that he could jump one of the girders of the triangular construction he had to wait for the bat ears to go well beyond him before he could step aboard the tower as one would an elevator as it passed your floor the chinese had fired no flares so as not to pinpoint their position for tacair christ it was brentwood looking behind him at the tower still rising what the welshman asked aussies arm i forgot damn it hell be all right boyo shouldve sent sal too late now yes brentwood said anyway lets keep them occupied down there was a splatter of earth against brentwoods uniform as a mm opened up from the well of the tower the tower still going up like a texas windmill no wonder we couldnt find this bastard choir said pumping another three shots into the well there were screams and fierce yelling but the simple fact was that so long as the three men choir brentwood and sal had enough ammunition they could hold down those in the well but sooner or later the ammo would run out and then the chinese could swarm up and take the troop salvini dropped a grenade down more screaming and more yelling than hed heard in a frisco mahjongg game silly fuckers dont know hes on the tower salvini said lets keep it that way brentwood said look out a stick grenade lobbed the lip of the well choir calmly poked it back over with the barrel of his riot gun then he pulled the pin on one of his own grenades made a twosecond count and let it go they wont catch that bastard there was a scream that gave truth to his prediction im almost out of ammo lads choir said ten reloads and thats it come on aussie sal implored in fact aussie lewis could hardly hang on with little or no power in his left arm he could only hold himself up by locking his legs together in a scissor hold and leaning his head forward into the right angle of the girder then he pushed and prodded the playdohlike c plastique into the inside angle formed by two of the girders using the slightly bananashaped magazine from his heckler koch as a tamp for the charge to better direct the blast in toward the beams angle he then crushed the fuses vial of acid which had a tenminute count by then the wire holding the firing pin would dissolve next he put his right arm down then under the girder he was sitting on and his heckler koch slung over his shoulder swung down monkeylike his boots barely touching the next girder he repeated this two more times his right arm now feeling the strain as he molded the second belt of plastique into an angle of steel as he completed packing the second charge in and tamping it he waited for a few seconds looking at his watch and then crushed the fiveminute vial swung down to the next girder and from there jumped fifteen feet down to where the other three were salvini lifted aussies good arm over his shoulder and started off down the land line back toward the fav while choir and brentwood turned in a rear action a hail of mm parabellum shooting forth with the darts as the chicoms began to swarm up me steps go brentwood yelled go salvini wasnt even looking back but aussie was able to run by himself while keeping the left arm tucked in by his side withdraw choir brentwood said not without you boyo withdraw choirs answer was to fire another three fléchetteloaded rounds at the chinese salvini was back with choir cmon you mother he said firing four threeround bursts to keep the chicoms down in the well suddenly he felt something falling on him it was a flutter of leaves a chicom firing too high in his excitement then the earth shook a second time and went into a blur a feral roar of fire erupting about the skeletal radar mast the tower collapsed telescoping in on itself in a reddishorange column of flame then another after which the debris of the crashing radar tower and the fire spilled onto all of those in the well igniting the gasoline and hydraulic fluid that exploded in a final volcanic fury spewing bluish crimson flames hundreds of feet into the sky scorching and setting the poplars afire like giant candles in the night a hundred yards to go to reach the fav and the sidecar began rattling taking a burst from another fav closing in on them a hundred yards to the left a ricochet ripping open david brentwoods left cheek before salvini reached forward around him cut the throttle and got off the pillion seat throwing up his hands dont shoot were americans stay where you fucking are a skeptical voice came mount rushmores ours salvini yelled stay where you fucking are buddy when they were close enough to sort it all out there were apologies aplenty but the apologies didnt do anything for aussies wounded arm or davids face which as choir drove over in the other fav to meet them was being held together by tape until they could get him back to a field hospital chapter fifty cheng now committed his reserve battalions to the battle as freemans line had seemed to falter but freeman had just given orders to slow down his advance as he did not want to start mixing it up at close quarters with chengs armor and troops until tacair now that the sky was clearing somewhat had a chance to inflict maximum damage cheng interpreted the slowing down of freemans armor however as a sign that his chengs advantage of four tanks to one was starting to tell hurriedly he ordered up more reserves as freemans echelons began to slow throwing up a steady barrage of thick white smoke grenades from their launch tubes on both sides of their turrets with the falling off of the dust storm and darkness having already descended the chicoms ts and ts could be picked up by freemans tacair spearheaded by the a thunderbolts with their tankkilling sevenbarrel gatling gun its ammo drum the size of a honda accord the thunderbolts guns poured out seventy of their mm armorpiercing shells per second the planes appearing to be in a near stall as the weakest part of the chinese tanks their cupolas seemed literally to soak up the fire before bursting without their radar and ramc taken out by brentwoods sasd team to pick up the lowflying thunderbolts the chicom tanks were swooped upon in eleven minutes of the most intensive infrared a attacks since and including the iraqi war the chicoms lost fortytwo tanks some of them reserves but the burning chinese tanks added to the smoke and soon the as usefulness impressive as it was was nullified by the chemicalmade fog of the battlefield and dark black exhaust of the chicoms diesel engines as opposed to that of the ms clean gas turbine freeman gave another order to chargenot an order in the manual but one that freeman well knew would cut through static on the radio network soon the chicoms and americans were at close quarters again mixing it up echelon against echelon and finally tank against tank what had been the flanks where the favs had been operating were now quickly being taken over by the combatants as turrets slewing they wheeled skidded and climbed the clay rise and surrounding dunes in high whine the positions of the dozen remaining favs becoming more precarious in what at first sight looked like a vast crazy traffic jam as choir drove aussie slumped in the back holding his shoulder below the tow mounting and next to the la roche reporter while brentwood insisted on manning the dashmounted machine gun until despite the field dressing on his face the blood from his seeping cheek wound soaked through and caught in the slipstream this making it impossible for him to see he reluctantly had to give the machine gun up to salvini while he took salvinis place in the righthand litter ts and ts were using the infrared searchlights on the americans and the americans were using their own nightvision goggles but for all the equipment it was still a confusion with blueonblue mistakes on both sides and strain and cacophony of the battle added to by the almost unbelievable din of machine guns chattering tank cannon roaring and the sound of tanks exploding as the deadly fireworks of magazines blew up in towering multihued flames some mens blood vaporizing in the heat others literally boiling as combinations of hesh heat solid shotdiscarding sabot and apfsds armorpiercing fin stabilized discarding sabot rounds exploded two american commanders frustrated by the inability of their viewers to see well enough through the smoke took up the israeli position that is not staying buttoned up but standing up in the turret for a better view only to be killed almost instantly by the machine gun fire of chinese armored personnel carriers two aerials two aerials chengs commander soong yelled exhorting his men to try to pick out the command tanks but the men of his three battalions of sovietmade ts who had been hunkering down in defilade position behind the dunes crests before the battle knew it would be almost impossible to pick out the twoaerial tanks it was hard enough to see anything before you yourself were seen and at times no one knew what the huge shadow looming in the night was enemy or friend soong glued to his periscope viewer as another round was extracted from the ts autoloaders carousel and rammed home did not know who was winning the massive dogfight among the tanks meanwhile david brentwood and the few remaining favs drove about looking for knockedout motorcycle and sidecar units to siphon off enough gas any hope of reaching their own refueling depots at night a slim chance at best given the vastness of the dunes clay flats and a small dry salt lake bed about them where the armored battle raged in fiercely chaotic duels that would go till dawn the american ma was more than holding its own in fact there would be fewer american tanks remaining in the morning than chinese because of the fourtoone ratio but the chinese took a terrible punishment the victory freeman knew would not go to the side who merely held its own but who could break through the others lines of defense in the end it was freemans bradley armored personnel carriers that turned the tide the twentytwoton american ifv infantry fighting vehicle was markedly superior to the chicoms with its hongjian missile launcher the bradleys speed of fortyone miles per hour was something to behold along with its deadly tows cannon and ball gun ports on either side like the ma the bradley even over the roughest ground could continue firing its tows and cannon atop an independently sprung chassis that was near perfection itself through that night there was another dust storm but this one was completely man made as over a thousand tanks and ifvs slugged it out in the darkness the night illuminated now and then by huge white greenorange flashes filled with the stench of cordite and the headthrobbing smell of burning diesel tracers constantly arcing through the night seeking the right range for the main guns men screamed beneath the tracks of an m or t bearing down on them often their presence unknown by the tank drivers who were pressing for larger game more sand turned to glass as molten metal jets from heat rounds passed through a foot of enemy armor before hitting the sand gradually by about hours the americans gained ground penetrating the chinese defenses and at it was clear that the chinese were withdrawing by there was a sudden dropoff of firing from the chinese by dawn they were in full retreat freeman kept after them and by there were more american than chinese tanks the chicom losses being greatest in the last hour of the rout the bodies of some of the chicom crews of the brokendown and burnedout hulks sitting in grotesque positions freemans victory could not have been claimed for any particular moment but rather the turning point like the end of weeding a garden suddenly happened a few stragglers captured at will in the final hour of the battle eye sockets dark eyes red with fatigue freeman had lost twentyseven tanks the chinese not counting the chinese apcs that had fallen easy victim to the bradleys and none of it would have been possible but for the sasd fav charge against the guns numbed by the excessive battle few thought of what would follow all they yearned for was rest but freeman was exhilarated for him it was as if the battle had injected him with a determination to press on though he knew that in the interest of his men he would at least have to pause and washington was ordering him not merely to pause but to stop and not go a step further even this massive tank battle the largest since iraq was being cheekily described by him to washington as a reconnaissance in force victorious in the gobi and standing on that golden northern plain in the china dawn the southern wind in his face he gazed far to the southeast norton you realize how close we are general washingtonll never go for it two days norton the second army of the united states is only two days from the prize beijing dick beyond that great wall lies the heart of china its within our grasp he turned to norton wild with surmise within striking distance goddamn it sir youve been moving so fast that our supply lines dangerously overextended and admiral kuangs planned invasion hasnt materialized i know i know stopped by a goddamned typhoon hes taking it as a sign general maybe we should too balls freeman said moving his goggles above the peak of his generals cap looking uncannily like rommel in the desert what in hells the matter with you dick his right hand was thrust in the direction of beijing youre talking like one of those fairies in washington ive told you this country isnt a country like ours north and south china are at odds and the controlling clique in beijing is rotten to the core and the people know it its a hundred chinas that want to be rid of those commie bastards then the general used one of maos axioms let a hundred flowers bloom eh dick let a hundred schools of thought contend we show them the way and manyll join us how about the chinese army general thats why we have to strike fast dick before cheng can recover from the beating weve given him here weathers cleared overhead american fighter patrols were now tangling with chinese shenyangs it was no contestthe turkey shoot of organ tal but on the ground cheng still had over two and a half million in arms general if you make a move on beijing washingtonll have you courtmartialed already theyre saying beijing is seeking a ceasefire another yugoslav ceasefire freeman said contemptuously wont last a week if that i dont think so alright norton our supply line is overextended ill say that and we need to consolidate youre right there but you tell me what im supposed to do if admiral kuang attacks in more clement weather now that im this close wed have to check with washington sir cheng would have to defend on two fronts freeman said i dont know general norton said cautiously we were sent here originally to keep the peace not start a war we didnt start a war goddamn commies started it the moment cheng crossed over and slaughtered that japanese defense force were already in the war norton or hadnt you noticed he saw the worry lines creasing nortons face well have those chinese bastards in beijing kept their people down the general answered his own question before norton could utter a word hell those jokersve been asking for it ever since tiananmen norton didnt answer to take beijing it would be one of the fiercest battles in history even the idea of it took nortons breath away and he sought refuge in the logistical situation but you do agree sir that we couldnt move yet even if we wanted to agreed but it wont take us long to get back to full strength dick norton had been told that july and august would be the monsoon months and that the rain would cause freeman further pause it would most commanders but that was the problem freeman wasnt like most commanders hed attacked pyongyang at night and ratmanov island in a blizzard and won by god can you imagine it dick for us the american army to be in tiananmen square to raise the stars and stripes to free china freemans vision was so grand it awed and terrified norton chapter fiftyone at the most forward aid station outside orgon tal where he sat with so many others waiting to be attended to aussie was already comforted by a medic telling him that his injury was a flesh wound that hed lost some blood and the shoulder would be badly bruised for a while but that hed be all right once they stitched him up a half hour later alexsandra malof one of the few prisoners to survive the fav attacks against the guns was ushered in by a corporal aussie instinctively made room for her by him patting the bench someone whose pain had got the better of him asked in a loud voice when they were going to get out of this fucking dump hey aussie shouted the effort hurting his shoulder but he got everyones attention watch the language lads lady present he offered her the rest of his coffee and she accepted must forgive the lads miss aussie said they use a lot of foul language im afraid dont go for it myself he extended his right hand names aussie lewis alexsandra nodded i am alexsandra malof her very breathing excited him and he watched her breasts rise and fall in a unison that mesmerized him finally he told her theyre sending us back to khabarovsk for a bit of r and r rest and recreation oh yes she said so how about you khabarovsk also that a fact look maybe we could have dinner perhaps she liked the soldiers easy friendliness his openness and he did not seem as uncouth as some of the others someone came in swearing about getting fucking sand in my fucking contacts hey hey aussie said enough of that david brentwood shook his head disbelievingly causing his cheek to bleed more i cant stand it he told choir how about olga somebody asked aussie lewis affected complete puzzlement frowning olga olga who a bird in the hand eh aussie another of the wounded sasd troopers said aussie shook his head as if hed been deeply hurt explaining softly to alexsandra malof theyre very uncouth like most soldiers i suppose she said aussie sighed yes im afraid youre right do you think there will be more fighting she asked him all depends i suppose on whether the chinese want to come to terms with the un or not he paused i heard someone say you had a pretty bad run i mean a bad time with the chinese yes she said simply and the siberians but he could tell she didnt want to talk any more about it oh well he told her its over now sandy when we get back to khabarovsk and have that dinner lets not talk about it yes she said warmly that would be wonderful david brentwood was still shaking his head i cant stand it chapter fiftytwo jay told the lawyer to get lost and when he was off the phone jay had disconnected the jack then he walked over slowly toward the bed where lana lay on her back legs draped over the end of the bed jay told himself he mustnt hurry but by the time hed pulled off her panty hose rolled her over undone her bra and rolled her back over again her legs lolling down further over the end of the bed he knew hed have trouble drawing it out but hell that was half the fun and no matter what she said after coming to from the chloral hydrate of the mickey finn hed call the lawyer who would swear blind that mr la roche hadnt touched her no matter how sore she felt or what she said naked himself standing over her he reached down rolled her over again onto her stomach slipped his hands beneath her squeezed her breasts then took one shot with the polaroid to make sure it was working properly let this fucking shirer marry her after this little peep show had done the round of the base already he had the headline for his rags as shed called them wave off base with ace all you could see in this photo was her buttocks but later when he flipped her again finished doing it in her mouth chained her up a bit hed take a mug shot of her franklin would recognize her easy enough then one thing he knew he could count on was that medically shed be clean as a cucumber no vd pushed into her hed been too careful about that and if she started squawking to anyone after hed remind her of what her precious daddy and mommy would look like splashed across the national investigator he spread her buttocks apart and spitting on the soap bar ran it up and down thirteen times thirteen was lucky there was a knock on the door he tried to ignore it but it wouldnt let up quickly he grabbed his chinese robe with the gold brocade dragons rampant on emerald silk the same robe hed used when hed had her in shanghai there was another knock on the door and cursing he went over and looked through the peephole it wasnt the lawyer but the snotnosed junior reporter from the anchorage spectator intent on getting a story from la roche la roche knew the type young persistent dreamed of the pulitzer and a pain in the ass when you wanted a piece of tail and if you told them to scram theyd write fuckin lies about you he opened the door listen he told the kid im busy right now im sorry for the intrusion mr la roche but i just wondered if i could get a few comments on the the kids fervent earnestness was all too familiar to la roche everybody thought that when you were rich you knew some secret whenever you farted they took it to be a prediction of the market hed offer the kid a twenty but he knew the kid wouldnt take it full of integrity and all the other loser philosophy later kid all right come around in the morning about you remember congressman hailey mr la roche what a congressman hailey you know the one you said youd show all those pictures of with other men if he didnt try and transfer a pilot to hey jay said dont you come around here im his son the bullet from the silencer passed straight through the wouldbe newspaper reporters notebook into la roches mouth flinging him hard against the door coming out high up on his neck la roche eyes bulging jawbone quivering violently staggered forward his mouth full of blood pouring down over his robe turning the gold dragons red as he slumped to the hallway carpet james hailey jr shot la roche again pointblank in the face then he put the gun to la roches temple pulled the trigger again and unhurriedly pocketing the firearm walked quickly back down the fire escape stairwell and down by dutch harbor after wiping all prints from the gun grip he tossed it far out into the frigid black water called a cab and told the driver he had to catch a plane in half an hour from dutch harbor to juneau and then on to the lower fortyeight fifteen minutes later a shoe salesman after checking into davys found jay la roche lying across the hallway noting the time and after taking a blood sample from mrs la roche as she lay unconscious on the bed the police could quickly ascertain that she had been completely out of it at the time of the murder the high concentration of chloral hydrate showing up in her blood sample besides which there wasnt a weapon did mr la roche have any enemies the dutch harbor police chief asked la roches lawyer the lawyer said let me count the ways and his gut began jiggling like jelly what dyou mean the police chief asked shall we say sheriff that mr la roche had many competitors and in a big business like his a man makes enemies on the way up people think they were badly done by then he wont be missed the police chief proffered the lawyer had tears in his eyes he couldnt hold in the laughter chapter fiftythree frank shirer became a household word his name splashed all over the british european and american press including la roches tabloids as ace extraordinaire it wasnt that harriers hadnt already proved themselves theyd shot down much faster planes mirages than themselves during the falklands war but this was the first time a harrier had downed a fulcrum after the terrible losses of all nine bs on the successful raid over turpan the harriers victory was welcome news even so lana was more interested in talking to frank in her long distance call to peshawar about when they should have the wedding she would have preferred it to be in june but the feeling of so many young couples was that america was locked into a war with china whether she liked it or not it was more common than not to hear the ceasefire general cheng had successfully gained from washington being described cynically as another yugoslavian agreement that chairman nie and general cheng had cooked up merely to buy time support for this view was fueled by rumors that thousands of troops were being rushed from the southern provinces across the yangtze on anything that would float to beijing military district and there was a powerful feeling within the united states itself with its emergency powers act still on the books that freeman whether washington agreed or not would soon be in the biggest battle so far if shirer got publicity for his victory over the fulcrum it was nothing compared to the lavish praise of freeman and his second army and in particular the sasd commandos whose praises were sung by the onceterrified cbn newsman the press particularly those reporters who were camp followers and too lazy to go find their own stories were only too happy to feed off the cbn reporters eyewitness account of the great tank battle one of the camp followers from the press asked aussie lewis how the cbn reporter had fared under fire he was great aussie said he just hung on in there the la roche tabloids ran fourinch headlines freeman routs reds and now the cbn reporter name frederick f nelson ii was booked for months ahead on every tv talk show from larry king to rush limbaugh and now during any presidential press conferences was sure to get his question attended to but of all the reports of the war or at least the war so far one of the most intriguing was cnns report on the sudden appearance in istanbul turkey of what the cnn reporter called a gunner murphy apparently the only survivor of the b raid on turpan he had a lot to say about the raid and created the distinct impression that hed shot down half the chinese air force before he was so unobligingly shot down himself but what people were more interested in was his vouchedfor rescue by fierce though sympathetic kurdish rebels who as well as getting the american to turkey had performed an operation on his shotup nose that was an old procedure and well known in the region but like acupuncture was as yet unknown in the west the rebels in an ancient surgical practice had drugged the american then using a tree leaf known for its resiliency had placed the leaf over the bridge of me remaining part of the nose using this as a support over which skin from the mans leg had been placed and stitched down into the skin on either side of the nose by the time the leaf had decayed the skin had grafted two small openings being made to serve as nostrils it wasnt something that would enthrall the new england journal of medicine but as gunner murphy had said itll do till i get back to the states it was a story that was told again and again among the families of the lost b crewmen for it was their only tangible link an act of mercy that had been shown to one of their own and from this they took what comfort they could when alexsandra malof invited aussie lewis to her home in the old jewish autonomous region near khabarovsk she introduced him as an australian soldier who as australians often did fought next to his american friends youll be here long her father asked him depends mate aussie said when he got back to camp choir asked him about wedding bells never know do you he said shocking them little beaver for the winter eh aus sal joshed hey hey aussie said enough of that talk sport youre not serious sal said jeez you couldnt go a week without cussing that a bet aussie said sitting down on his bunk what yeah yeah sal said thats a bet im in choir said aussie lowered himself down gingerly on the bunk the shoulder still hurting david how about you ah sorry forgot your cheeks so puffed up you cant talk thumb up for ten bucks david put up two thumbs oh all right aussie said ten bucks for bullfrog face he looked over at choir and sal you guys wouldnt be in on a setup here would you no choir said indignantly fair dinkum sal said it was an australian term aussie had taught them and it meant fair drinking in the gold fields where everyone had to get drunk before playing cardsthen everyone was equal all right aussie said youre on frank and lana agreed on a wedding date in late may and while they were discussing the wedding plans douglas freeman was studying the street plan of beijing
