jeffery deaver a dish served cold a dish served cold we have reason to believe theres a man who wants to cause you some harm sir standing on the hot sidewalk in front of his office building compact muscular stephen york rocked back and forth on his bally shoes cause you some harm the hells that supposed to mean york set down his gym bag the fiftyoneyearold investment banker looked from the scottsdale police department senior detective whod delivered this news to the mans younger partner the cops were easy to tell apart older blond bill lampert was pale as milk as if hed come to scottsdale via minnesota a migration that happened pretty frequently york had learned the other cop juan alvarado undoubtedly had roots in the vicinity who york asked his names raymond trotter york thought about it then shook his head never heard of him he peered at the picture the cop held out from dmv it seemed doesnt look familiar who is he lives here in town runs a landscaping company wait i know the place out off the interstate york thought carole had shopped there yeah the big one lampert wiped his forehead hes got a problem with me what sort york pulled his armani shades on the three pm sun in arizona was like a blowtorch we dont know well what do you know alvarado explained we arrested a day laborer for drugs an illegal hector diaz he wanted to cut a deal on the charge and he told us he had some information about a possible crime seems hes worked for this trotter off and on a few days ago trotter comes to him and offers him a thousand dollars to stop by your house and see if you needed yard work done while he was there he was supposed to check out your alarm system youre kidding nope what was all this about despite the temperature hovering at degrees york felt a chill run through him alarms why all trotter told diaz was he was interested in payback for something you did payback york shook his head in frustration jesus you come and tell me this crap somebodys going to quote cause me some harm and you dont have any idea what its about no sir we were hoping you could tell us well i cant okay well check this trotter out but wed recommend you keep an eye out for anything odd why dont you arrest him he hasnt committed a crime lampert said im afraid that without evidence of an overt act theres nothing we can do cause some harm evidence of an overt act maybe if they stopped talking like sociology professors theyd do some real goddamn police work york came close to telling them this but he guessed the disgusted look on his face was message enough trying to put the encounter with the cops out of his thoughts york drove to the gym man he needed some muscle time hed just come through a grind of a negotiation with two men who owned a small manufacturing company he was trying to buy the old guysd been a lot wilier than hed expected theyd made some savvy demands that were going to cost york big money hed looked them over real condescending and stormed out of their lawyers office let em stew for a day or two before hed probably concede but he wasnt going to let them think theyd bullied him he parked in the health club lot climbed out of the car and walked through the fierce sun to the front door hi mr york youre early today a nod to the daytime desk manager gavin yeah snuck out when nobody was looking york changed clothes and headed for the aerobics room empty at the moment he flopped down on the mats to stretch after ten minutes of limbering up he headed off to the machines pushing hard doing his regular circuit of twenty reps on each before moving on ending up with crunches his job as one of the three partners in a major scottsdale venture capital firm had him doing a lot of entertaining and spending serious time at his desk his belly had been testing the waistband of his slacks lately he didnt like flabby neither did women whatever they told you a platinum amex card lets you get away with a lot but when its bedtime the dolls love solid abs after the crunches he hopped on the treadmill for his run mile one mile two three trying to push the difficult business deal out of his head goddamn it what was with those decrepit farts how could they be so sharp they oughta be in an old folks home running running mile five and who was this raymond trotter payback he scanned his memory again but could come up with no hits on the name he fell into the rhythm of his pounding feet at seven miles he slowed to a walk cooled off and shut the treadmill down york pulled a towel over his neck and ignoring a flirtatious glance from a woman who was pretty but a few years past being worth the risk returned to the locker room there he stripped and grabbed a clean towel then headed for the sauna york liked this part of the club because it was out of the way and very few members came here at this time of day now it was completely deserted york wandered down the tile corridor he heard a noise from around the corner a click then what sounded like footsteps though he couldnt tell for sure was somebody here he got to the junction and looked no the hallway was empty but he paused something was different what he realized the place was unusually dark he glanced up at the light fixtures several bulbs were missing four thousand bucks a year for membership and they couldnt replace the bulbs man hed give gavin some crap for that the murkiness along with a faint snaky hiss from the ventilation made the place eerie he continued to the door of the redwood sauna hanging his towel on a hook and turning the temperature selector to high hed just started inside when a sharp pain shot through into his foot hell he shouted and danced back lifting his sole to see what had stabbed him a wooden splinter was sticking out of the ball of his foot he pulled it out and pressed his hand against the tiny bleeding wound he squinted at the floor where hed stepped and noted several other splinters oh gavin was going to get an earful today but york s anger faded as he glanced down and found what he supposed was the source of the splinters two slim wooden shims hand carved it looked like lying on the floor near the doorway they were like door stops except that the only door here to the sauna was at the top of a twostep stairway the door couldnt be wedged open but the shims could be used to wedge the door closed if somebody pounded them into the jamb when the door was shut theyd fit perfectly but itd be crazy to do that somebody trapped inside would have no way of turning down the temperature or calling for help there were no controls inside the unit and heat in a sauna could kill york and his wife had just seen a local tv story about a phoenix woman whod died in her sauna after shed fainted holding the shims staring down at them a sudden click from nearby made him jump york turned and saw a shadow against the wall like that of a person pausing then it vanished hello york called silence york walked into the hallway he could see nobody then he glanced at the emergency exit door which didnt seem to be closed all the way he looked out the alley was empty turning back he noticed something on the edge of the door somebody had taped the latch down so he could get inside without being seen from anyone in the lobby cause you some harm five minutes later showerless york was hurrying out of the club not bothering to give gavin the lecture he deserved the businessman was carrying the shims and bit of duct tape wrapped in paper towels he was careful like everybody who watched tv nowadays he knew all about the art of preserving fingerprints theyre in here stephen york handed the paper towel to paleskinned detective bill lampert i didnt touch them i used tissues at your health club you said asked the detective looking over the shims and the tape thats right york couldnt resist adding the name of the exclusive place lampert didnt seem impressed he stepped to the doorway and handed the evidence to alvarado prints toolmarks stat the young officer vanished turning back to york but nobody actually tried to detain you in the sauna detain york asked himself wryly you mean lock me inside to roast me to death no he pulled out a cigar you mind theres no smoking in the building lampert replied maybe not technically but theres no smoking in the building york put the stogie away the way i read it trotter found out my routine he got into the club and taped the back door open so he could get in without anybody seeing him from the lobby howd he do that he a member i dont know lampert held up a finger he called the club and had a brief conversation no record of him as a member or a guest in the last month then he had a fake id or something to try a guest membership fake id thats a little complicated isnt it well somehow the asshole got inside he was going to seal me inside but i think i surprised him and he ditched the shims and took off alvarado walked into his bosss office no prints toolmarks arent distinctive but if we find a plane or chisel we might make a match york laughed no prints thats proof of something right there isnt it lampert ignored him he lifted a sheet of paper from his desk and looked it over well weve looked into this trotter fellow seems like any normal guy no police record except for a few traffic tickets but there is something i talked to the veterans administration in phoenix turns out they have a file on him he was in kuwait the first gulf war his unit got hit hard half his men were killed and he was badly wounded after he got discharged he moved here spent a year in counseling the file has his shrinks notes in it thats all privileged doctorpatient and were not supposed to see it but ive got a buddy in the va and he gave me the gist apparently after trotter got out of the service he ended up hanging with a bad crowd here and in albuquerque did some strongarm stuff for hire that was a while ago and he was never arrested but still christ so maybe somebody hired him whove you pissed off bad enough theyd go to this kind of trouble to get even i dont know id have to think about it alvarado said you know that expression revenge is a dish best served cold yeah i think i heard of that might be somebody from your distant past think way back a dish served cold okay but whatre we going to do in the meantime york asked wiping his sweating palms on his pants lets go have a talk with him see what he has to say the detective picked up the phone and placed a call mr trotter please i see could you tell me when thanks no message he hung up he just left for tucson hell be back tomorrow morning arent you going to stop him why maybe hes trying to escape go to mexico lampert shrugged and opened a file from another case then i guess youre off the hook pulling up to their fivemilliondollar minimansion on the edge of the desert york climbed out of his mercedes locked the doors and looked around to make sure he hadnt been followed no sign of anyone still when he walked inside he doublelocked the door behind him hey honey carole joined him in the entryway wearing her workout spandex his third wife was frosted blonde and beautiful you guys give good visuals an associate once said theyd been together three years a former secretary turned personal trainer carole had just the right mix of what york called beingontheball and notgettingit meaning she could carry on a conversation and not be embarrassing but she kept quiet when she knew she was supposed to and didnt ask too many questions about where hed been when he came home late or went on lastminute business trips she glanced at the door whats with that they never used the deadbolt he had to be careful carole needed things explained to her in simple terms and if she didnt understand what he told her shed freak and her brand of hysteria could get ugly hed found that out about stupid people how they lost it when confronted with something they didnt understand so he lied somebody up the street got broken into yesterday i didnt hear about it well they did who i dont remember a faint giggle a habit of hers he found either irritating or sexy depending on his mood you dont know who thats weird todays was an irritating giggle somebody told me i forgot i got a lot on my mind can we go to the club for dinner im wasted baby ill barbecue tonight hows that okay sure he could tell she was disappointed but york knew how to bail out sinking ships he mixed cocktails fast doubles and steered her to the pool where he put on a yanni cd in twenty minutes the liquor and music had dulled her disappointment and she was babbling on about wanting to go visit her family in los angeles in a couple of weeks would he mind baching it whatever he gave it a minute and then sounding casual said im thinking of getting some plants for the office you want me to help no marge is handling it you ever buy anything from that landscaper out by the highway trotters i dont know i think so a while ago they ever deliver anything here no i just bought some houseplants and brought em home why wondering if they have good service now youre into decorating thats wild another giggle he grunted and headed into the kitchen pulled open the fridge smoking a macanudo and drinking his vodka and tonic york grilled some steaks and made a salad and they ate in silence after shed cleared the dishes they moved into the den and watched some tv carole got cuddly normally this meant it was time for the hot tub or bed or sometimes the floor but tonight he said you head on upstairs doll ive got a few numbers to look over aw another pout ill be up soon oh okay she sighed picked up a book and climbed the stairs when he heard the door click shut he walked into his study shut the lights out and peered out at the dark sweep of moonlit desert behind the house shadows rocks cacti stars this was a vista he loved it changed constantly he remained here for five minutes then pouring a tall scotch he kicked his shoes off and stretched out on the couch a sip of smoky liquor another payback and stephen york began a trip through his past looking for some reason that trotter or anyone wanted him dead because he had ditsy carole on his mind he thought first of the women whod been in his life he considered his exwives york had been the one whod ended each of the marriages the first wife vicky had gone off the deep end when hed told her he was leaving the little mouse had cried and begged him to stay even though she knew about the affair hed been having with his secretary but he was adamant about the divorce and soon he cut off all contact with her except for financial matters involving their son randy but would she actually hire a killer to get even with him no way he decided vickys reaction to the breakup was to play victim not vengeful ex besides york had done right by her hed paid alimony and child support promptly and a few years later hadnt contested the custody order that took away his rights to see their son york and his second wife were together only two years shed proved too brittle for him too liberal too npr that breakup was holyfieldtyson pure combat susan a highpowered commercial real estate lawyer walked away with a lot of money more than enough to salve her injured pride york left her for a woman sixteen years younger and twenty pounds slimmer she also took her career too seriously to risk it by doing anything illegal to him she had remarried a military consultant and former army colonel shed met negotiating a contract with the government for her client and york was sure hed fallen off her radar screen exgirlfriends the usual suspects but brother where to start almost too many to count hed broken up badly with some of them used some lied of course york himself had been used and lied to by women on the whole it evened out he figured that was how the game worked nobody sane would hire a hitman to kill a lover just because hed dumped you who else could it be most likely he decided it was somebody hed had business dealings with but there were a lot of fish in that sea too dozens came to mind when hed been a salesman for a pharmaceutical company hed reported one of his fellow detail men for cheating on his expense account york turned him in not out of company loyalty but to pillage the guys territory the man was fired and vowed to get even hed also been involved in the acquisition of dozens of companies over the last ten years hundreds of employees had been fired as a result he recalled one of these in particular a salesman whod come to him in tears after hed been let go begging for a second chance york though stuck to his decision mostly because he didnt like the mans whining a week later the salesman killed himself his note said hed failed as a man because he could no longer take care of his wife and children york could hardly be responsible for crazy behavior like that but his survivors might not feel that way maybe trotter was this mans brother or best friend or been hired by them he recalled another incident the time hed had a private eye check out a rival venture capitalist and found he was gay the client that they were both wooing was a homophobe during dinner one night york subtly dropped the skinny on the rival and the next day york s outfit got the assignment had he found out and hired trotter any other sins oh you bet york thought in disgust reaching into the dim past a dish served cold recalling an incident in college a prank gone wrong a frat hazing that resulting in a pledge getting drunk and stabbing a cop the kid was expelled then disappeared not longer after york couldnt remember his name it couldve been trotter a dozen other incidents flooded into his thoughts two dozen three people ignored and insulted lies told associates cheated his memory spit out not only the serious offenses but the petty ones too rudeness to clerks gouging an elderly woman whod sold him her car laughing when a mans toupee flew off in a heavy wind reliving them all it was exhausting another hit of scotch then another and the next thing he knew the sun was streaming through the window he squinted in pain from the hangover and groggily focused on his watch oh damn it was nine why hadnt carole wakened him she knew he had two deals this morning sometimes that woman just didnt have a goddamn clue york staggered into the kitchen and carole looked up from the phone she smiled breakfasts ready you let me sleep she told her friend shed call back and hung up i figured you were tired and you looked just too cute all cuddled up cute jesus lord york winced in pain his neck was frozen from sleeping in an awkward position i dont have time for breakfast he grumbled my mother always said breakfast is the most important meal of the day so youve told me like a hundred times she went silent then rose and walked into the living room with her coffee and phone baby i didnt mean york sighed like walking on eggshells sometimes he retreated to the bedroom he was fishing for aspirin in the medicine cabinet when the phone rang for you was his wifes cool announcement it was detective bill lampert trotters back in town lets go say hi well pick you up in twenty minutes yes can i help you raymond trotter thats right standing in front of trotter landscaping and nursery a rambling complex of low buildings greenhouses and potting sheds bill lampert and juan alvarado looked over the middleaged man lampert noted that he was in very good shape slim with broad shoulders his brown hair flecked with gray was cut short his squarejawed face shaved perfectly blue jogging outfit immaculate confident eyes the detective wondered if they revealed surprise as he glanced at their shields and maybe a bit more surprise at the sight of stephen york standing behind them trotter set down the large flowering plant he was holding sir we understand you were seeking some personal information about mr york here who good delivery lampert reflected he nodded behind him the gentleman there trotter frowned youre mistaken im afraid i dont know him youre sure yes do you know a man named hector diaz mexican thirtyfive stocky he used to work day labor for you ive hired hundreds of day people i dont know half their names is this an immigration issue my people are supposed to check documentation no sir its not this diaz claimed you asked him about mr yorks security what then trotter squinted knowingly howd this all come up by any chance was diaz arrested for something thats right so he made up something about a former employer to get a shorter sentence doesnt that happen lampert and his partner shared a look whatever else this trotter wasnt stupid sometimes sure well i didnt do what diaz said i did the piercing eyes turned to york alvarado took over were you in the scottsdale health and racquet club yesterday the oh the fancy one no thats not how i spend my money besides i was in tucson before you left for tucson no i have no idea what youre getting at but i dont know this york i dont have any interest in his alarm systems lampert felt alvarado touch his shoulder the young detective was pointing at a pile of wooden boards about the same width and thickness of the shims you mind if we take a couple of those with us you go right ahead soon as you show me a search warrant wed appreciate your cooperation id appreciate a warrant are you worried about what we might find alvarado chimed in im not at all worried its just that weve got this thing in america called the constitution he grinned what makes our country great i play by the rules i guess you should too york sighed loudly trotter looked him over coolly alvarado said if you have nothing to hide then therell be no problem if you have probable cause therell be no problem getting a search warrant so youre telling us you have no intent to endanger mr york in any way trotter laughed thats ridiculous then his face grew icy this is pretty serious what youre suggesting you start spreading rumors like this it could get embarrassing for me and for you i hope you realize that assault and breaking and entering are very serious crimes alvarado said trotter picked up the plant it was impressive a cactus dangerous looking if theres nothing else no theres nothing else thanks for your time lampert nodded to his partner and he and york started back to the cars when they were in the parking lot lampert said hes up to something york nodded i know what you mean that look he gave me it was like he was saying im going to get you i swear look thats not what im talking about didnt you hear him he said he wasnt interested in your alarms i never told him thats what diaz said i only mentioned security that could mean anything makes me believe diaz was telling the truth york was impressed i never noticed it good catch so what do we do now you have that list i wanted of anybody might have a grudge against you he handed over a sheet of paper anything else i should do looking at the list lampert said one thing you might want to think about a bodyguard stan eberhart looked a bit like lampert solid sculpted hair humorless focused as a terrier only with a tan the big man stood in the doorway of york s home the businessman ushered him in morning sir he spoke with a faint drawl and was the epitome of calm eberhart was the head of security for york s company york mcmillanwinston investments after his meeting with the cops and trotter york had called the man into his office and told him the situation eberhart agreed to put together a comprehensive sp thatll take in all contingencies for the situation sounding just like the scottsdale cops not too surprising eberhart had been a detective in phoenix an sp it turned out was a security plan and york figured it would be a good one eberhart was a heavyhitter in corporate security in addition to working homicide in phoenix hed been a federal drug agent and a private eye he was a black or red or some other kickassbelt karate expert and flew helicopters and owned a hundred guns security people york learned did all that outdoor life network crap tough guys york didnt get it if making money golf martinis and women werent involved what was the point alone now in the house carole was at her tennis lesson the men waked into the large sunroom which the security man studied with a face that suggested he wasnt happy why did he think it was too exposed because of the glass hes worried about goddamn snipers york laughed to himself eberhart suggested they go into the kitchen away from the glass windows york shrugged and played along they sat at the kitchen island the man unbuttoned his jacket he always wore a suit and tie whatever the temperature first off let me tell you what ive found out about trotter he was born in new hampshire majored in engineering in boston he got married and went into the army after he was discharged he came back here whatever happened after that the stuff in the va file he seemed to turn his life around started the landscaping company then his wife died died maybe thats the thing he blames me for it what happened eberhart was shaking his head she had cancer and you your company and your clients dont have any connection with the doctors that treated her or the hospital you checked that an sp is only as good as the intelligence behind it the man recited now about his family hes got three kids philip celeste and cindy ages fourteen seventeen and eighteen all in local public schools good kids no trouble with the law he showed candid pictures that looked like they were from school yearbooks a skinny goodlooking boy and two daughters one round and pretty the other lean and athletic you ever hit on the girls god no york was offended he had some standards eberhart didnt ask if his boss had ever made a move on the son if he had york wouldve fired him on the spot trotter was single for a while then last year he remarried nancy stockard real estate broker thirtynine she got divorced about five years ago has a tenyearold son another picture emerged you recognize her york looked at the picture now she was somebody he could definitely go for pretty in a girlnextdoor way great for a onenight stand or two but he reflected no such luck he wouldve remembered eberhart continued now trotter seems like a good guy loves his kids drives em to soccer and swimming and their afterschool jobs model parent model husband and good businessman made a ton of money last year pays his taxes even goes to church sometimes now let me show you what weve come up with for the sp the plan provided for two teams of security specialists one to conduct surveillance on trotter and the other to serve as bodyguards it would be expensive rentacops dont come cheap but frankly i dont think thisll go on for too long sir eberhart said he explained that all seven people he had in mind for the security detail were former cops and knew how to run crime scenes and interview witnesses with all of us on it well build a solid case enough to put him away for a long time well have more people and resources on this than scottsdale homicide and christ the feell probably be the same as their annual budget york gave the man his and caroles general daily routine the stores they shopped at restaurants and bars they went to regularly he added that he wanted the guards to keep their distance he still hadnt shared the story with carole she doesnt know nope probably wouldnt take it too well you know women eberhart didnt seem to know what his boss meant exactly but he said well do the best we can sir york saw the security man to the door thanked him the man pointed out the first team in a tan ford parked two doors down york hadnt even noticed them when hed answered the door which meant they knew what they were doing as the security specialist drove off york s eyes again looked into the back yard at the desert horizon recalling that hed laughed about snipers earlier now the thought wasnt funny york returned inside and pulled closed the drapes on every window that opened onto the beautiful desert vista as the days went by there were no further incidents and york began to relax the guard details watching york and carole remained largely invisible and his wife had no clue that she was being guarded when she went on her vital daily missions to the nail salon the hairdresser the club and the mall the surveillance team kept a close watch on trotter who seemed oblivious to the tail he went about his life a few times the man fell off the surveillance radar but only for short periods and it didnt seem that hed been trying to lose the security people when he disappeared the teams on york and carole stepped up protection and there were no incidents meanwhile lampert and alvarado continued to look into the list of people with grudges from york s past some seemed likely some improbable but in any event none of the leads panned out york decided to get away for a long weekend in santa fe for golf and shopping york chose to leave the bodyguards behind because theyd be too hard to hide from carole eberhart thought this was okay theyd keep a close eye on trotter and if he left scottsdale a team would fly to santa fe to cover york immediately the couple hit the road early the security man told york to take a complicated route out of town then pause at a particular vista east of the city where he could make certain they werent being followed which he did no one was following once away from the city york pointed the car into the dawn sun and eased back in the mercedess leather seat as the slipstream poured into the convertible and tousled their hair put on some music doll he called to carole sure thing what something loud he shouted a moment later led zeppelin chugged from the speakers york punched off the cruise control and pushed the accelerator to the floor sitting in his white surveillance van near ray trotters pink adobe house stan eberhart heard his phone chirp yeah julio one of the rentacops said stan got a problem go on has he left yet york yeah an hour ago hmm whats the matter im at a napa dealer near the landscaping company eberhart had sent people to stores near trotters house and business armed with pictures they were querying clerks about purchases the man mightve made recently the security people were no longer in the law enforcement profession of course but eberhart had learned that twentydollar bills open as many doors as police shields do probably more and two days ago this guy who looked like trotter ordered a copy of a technical manual for mercedes sports cars it came in yesterday and he picked it up the same time he bought a set of metric wrenches and battery acid stan the book was about brakes and that was just around the time we lost trotter for a couple of hours he couldve gotten to york s mercedes you think not likely but possible i think we have to assume he did ill get back to you eberhart hung up and immediately called york a distracted voice answered hi mr york its im not available at the moment please leave a message and ill get back to you as soon as possible eberhart hit disconnect and tried again each of the five times he called the only response was the preoccupied voice on the voicemail york was nudging the mercedes up to a hundred doesnt this rock he called laughing whoa like what carole shouted back the roar of the slipstream and robert plants soaring voice had drowned out his voice its great but she didnt answer she was frowning looking ahead theres like a turn up there she added something else he couldnt hear what uhm maybe you better slow down this baby curves on a dime im fine honey please slow down i know how to drive they were on a straightaway which was about to drop down a steep hill at the bottom the road curved sharply and fed onto a bridge above a deep arroyo slow down honey please look at the turn christ sometimes it just wasnt worth the battle okay he lifted his foot off the gas and then it happened he had no clue exactly what was going on a huge swirl of sand spinning around and around as if the car were caught in the middle of a tornado they lost sight of the sky carole screaming grabbed the dash york gripping the wheel with cramping hands tried desperately to find the road all he could see was sand whipping into his face stinging were going to die were going to die carole was wailing then from somewhere above them a tinny voice crackled york stop your car immediately stop your car he looked up to see the police helicopter thirty feet over his head its rotors downdraft the source of the sandstorm whos that carole screamed whos that the voice continued your brakes are going to fail dont start down that hill son of a bitch he cried he tampered with the brakes who stephen whats going on the helicopter sped forward toward the bridge and landed presumably so the rescue workers could try to save them if the car crashed or plummeted over the cliff save them or collect the bodies he was doing ninety as they started over the crest of the hill the nose of the mercedes dropped and they began to accelerate he pressed the brake pedal the calipers seemed to grip but if he got any farther and the brakes failed hed have nowhere to go but into rock or over the cliff there was no way they could make the turn doing more than thirtyfive at least here there was sand just past the shoulder stephen york gripped the wheel firmly and took a deep breath hold on whatta you mean he swerved off the road suitcases and soda and beer flew from the back seat carole screamed and york fought with all his strength to keep the car on course but it was useless the tires skewed out of control through the sand he just missed a large boulder and plowed into the desert rocks and gravel spattered the body spidering the windshield and peppering the fender and hood like gunshots tumbleweeds and sagebrush pelted their faces the car bounced and shook and pitched twice it nearly flipped over they were slowing but they were still speeding at forty miles an hour straight for a large boulder now though the sand was so deep that he couldnt steer at all jesus jesus jesus carole was sobbing lowering her head to her hands york jammed his foot onto the brake pedal with his left foot shoved the shifter into reverse and then floored the accelerator with his right the engine screamed sand cascaded into the air above them the car came to a stop five feet from the face of the rock york sat forward head against the wheel his heart pounding drenched in sweat he was furious why hadnt they called him what was with the blackhawk down routine then he noticed his phone the screen read missed calls messages marked urgent he hadnt heard the ring the wind and the engine and the goddamn music sobbing and pawing at the sand that covered her white pant suit carole snapped at him what is going on i want to know now and as eberhart and lampert walked toward them from the chopper he told her the whole story no weekend vacation carole announced you like mightve mentioned it up front showing some backbone for a change i didnt want to worry you you mean you didnt want me to ask what you did to somebody to make them want to get even with you i take me home now theyd returned to scottsdale in silence driving in a rental car the mercedes had been towed away by the police to look for evidence of tampering and repairs an hour after walking through their front door carole left again suitcase in hand headed to los angeles early for the family visit york was secretly relieved she was going he couldnt deal both with trotter and his wifes crazy moods he returned inside checked the lock on every door and window and spent the night with a bottle of johnny walker and hbo two days later around five pm york was working out in the gym hed set up in a bedroom he was avoiding the health club and its deadly sauna he heard the doorbell picking up the pistol he now kept in the entryway he peered out it was eberhart three locks and a deadbolt later he gestured the security man in got something you should know about i had two teams on trotter yesterday he went to a multiplex for a matinee at noon so theres a rule anybody under surveillance goes to a movie by himself thats suspicious so the teams compared notes seems that fifteen minutes after he goes in this guy in overalls comes out with a couple of trash bags then about an hour later little over a delivery man in a uniform shows up at the theater carrying a big box but my man talked to the manager the workers there dont usually take the first trash out to the dumpster until five or six at night and there werent any deliveries scheduled that day york grimaced so he dodged you for an hour he could get anywhere in that time he didnt take his car we had it covered and we checked cab companies nobody called for one in that area so he walked someplace yep and were pretty sure where southern states chemical is ten minutes by foot from the multiplex and you know whats interesting he looked at his notes they make acrylonitrile methyl methacrylate and adiponitrile what the hellre those industrial chemicals by themselves theyre not any big deal but what is important is that theyre used to make hydrogen cyanide jesus like the poison like the poison and one of my guys looked over southern states theres no security cans of the chemicals were sitting right out in the open by the loading dock trotter couldve walked up taken enough to make a batch of poison thatd kill a dozen people and nobody wouldve seen him and guess who did the companys landscaping trotter so hed know about the chemicals and where they were kept could anybody make it the cyanide apparently its not that hard and with trotter in the landscaping business youd have to figure he knows chemicals and fertilizers and remember he was in the army too first gulf war a lot of those boys got experience with chemical weapons the businessman slammed his hand down on the counter goddamnit so hes got this poison and ill never know if hes slipped it into what im eating jesus well thats not exactly true eberhart said reasonably your house is secure if you buy packaged food and keep an eye on things at restaurants you can control the risk control the risk disgusted york returned to the hallway snagged the fedex envelope containing a delivery of his cigars which had arrived that morning and ripped it open he stalked into the kitchen unwrapping the cigars i cant even go outside to buy my own smokes im a prisoner thats what i am york rummaged in a drawer for a cigar cutter found one and nipped the end off the macanudo he chomped down angrily on the cigar clicked the flame of a lighter and lifted it to his mouth just at that moment a voice yelled no startled york reached for his gun but before he could reach it he was tackled from behind and tumbled hard to the floor the breath knocked from his lungs gasping in agony he scrabbled back in panic he stared around him and saw no threat he then shouted at the security man whatre you doing breathing heavily eberhart rose and pulled his boss to his feet sorry i had to stop you the cigar the cigar dont touch it the security man grabbed several baggies in one he put the cigars in the other the fedex envelope when i was asking you about stores you go to for the security plan you told me you get your cigars in phoenix right right so what eberhart held up the fedex label these were sent from a postal plus store in the sonora hills strip mall york thought thats near three minutes from trotters company he couldve called the store and found out when you ordered some then bought some himself and doctored em ill get a field test kit and see dont i need i mean dont i need to eat cyanide for it to kill me uhuh the security expert sniffed the bag carefully cyanide smells like almonds he shook his head cant tell maybe the tobaccos covering up the scent almonds york whispered almonds he smelled his fingers and began washing his hands frantically there was a long silence rubbing his skin with paper towels york glanced at eberhart who was lost in thought what the businessman snapped i think its time for a change of plans the next day stephen york parked his leased mercedes in the hot dusty lot of the scottsdale police department he looked around uneasily for trotters car a darkblue lexus sedan theyd learned he didnt see it york climbed out carrying plastic bags containing the fedex envelope cigars and food from his kitchen he carried them into the pds building chill from an overeager air conditioner in a ground floor conference room he found four men the buddy team of lampert and alvarado as well as stan eberhart and a man who was dressed in exactly the same clothes that york wore and who was his same build the man introduced himself as peter billings an undercover cop long as im playing the part of you for a little while mr york was wonderin sokay to use your pool and hot tub my joking there billings said ah york muttered humorlessly and turned to lampert here they are the detective took the bags and tossed them absently on an empty chair none of the cigars or food contained poison according to a test eberhart conducted at york s but bringing them here presumably under the eye of vengeful mr trotter was an important part of their plan they needed to make trotter believe for the next hour or so that they were convinced he was going to poison york after the tests turned out negative eberhart had concluded that trotter was faking the whole cyanide thing he only wanted the police to think he intended to poison york why a diversion of course if the police were confident they knew the intended method of attack theyd prepare for that and not the real one but what was the real one how was trotter actually going to come at york eberhart had taken an extreme step to find out breaking into trotters house while the landscaper his wife and their children were out eberhart had disabled the alarm and surveillance cameras then examined the mans office carefully hidden in the desk were books on sabotage and surveillance two pages were marked with postits marking chapters on turning propane tanks into bombs and on making remote detonators he found another clue as well a note that read rodriguez garden supplies which was where stephen york went every saturday afternoon to exchange his barbecue grills propane tanks eberhart believed that trotters plan was to keep the police focused on a poison attack when he was in fact going to arrange an accidental explosion after york picked up his new propane tank the security man though couldnt go to the police with this information hed be admitting hed committed trespass so he told bill lampert only that hed heard from some sources that trotter was asking about propane tanks and where york shopped there was no evidence for a search warrant but the detective reluctantly agreed to eberharts plan to catch trotter in the act first theyd make it seem that they believed the cyanide threat since trotter probably knew york went to the propane store every saturday around lunchtime the businessman would take the cigars and food to the police apparently for testing which would occupy them for several hours trotter would be following york would then leave and run some errands among them picking up a new propane canister only it wouldnt be stephen york in the car but detective peter billings the lookalike billings would collect a new propane tank from rodriguezs though it would be empty for safetys sake and then stash it in his car hed then return to the store to browse and lampert and his teams would wait for trotter to make his move so wheres our boy lampert asked his partner alvarado explained that trotter had left his house about the same time as york and headed in the same direction theyd lost him in traffic for a time but then picked him up at a whole foods grocery store lot within walking distance of rodriguezs one officer saw him inside lampert called the other players in the setup its going down he announced doing his impersonation of york billings walked outside got into the car and headed into traffic eberhart and york climbed into one of the chase cars and eased after him though well behind so they wouldnt get spotted by trotter if he was in fact trailing billings twenty minutes later the undercover cop pulled up in front of rodriguezs garden supplies and eberhart york beside him parked in a minimall lot a block away lampert and the teams moved into position nearby okay billings radioed through his hidden mike im getting the tank going inside york and eberhart leaned forward to watch what was happening york could just make out his mercedes up the street lampert called over the radio any sign of trotter hasnt come out of whole foods yet sounded through the speaker of the walkie talkie dashboard billings came on a moment later all units ive loaded the fake tank in the car the backseat im going back inside fifteen minutes later york heard a cops voice urgently saying have something guy in a hat and sunglasses could be trotter approaching the mercedes from the east hes got a shopping bag in one hand and something in the other looks like a small computer might be a detonator or the device itself the security specialist nodded at stephen york sitting beside him and said here we go got him on visual another cop said the surveillance officer continued hes looking around hold on okay the suspect just walked by york s car couldnt see for sure but he paused think he mightve dropped something underneath it now hes crossing the street hes going into miguels lampert radioed thatll be where hell detonate the device from all right people lets seal off the street and get an undercover inside miguels to monitor him eberhart lifted an eyebrow to york and smiled this is it hope so was the uneasy response now officers were moving in slowly sticking close to the buildings on either side of miguels bar and grill where trotterd be waiting for york to return to the car detonate the device and burn him to death a new voice came on the radio im inside miguels came a whisper from the second undercover cop i see the subject by the window on a stool looking out no weapons in sight hes opened up what he was carrying before a small computer or something antenna on it he just typed something assume that the device is armed lampert radioed roger were in position three behind miguels two in front the streets been barricaded and rodriguezs is clear we got everybody out the back door were ready for the takedown in eberharts car the security man kept up an irritating drumming with his fingertips on the steering wheel york tried to tune it out wondering would trotter resist maybe hed panic and he jumped as eberharts hand gripped his arm hard the security man was looking in the rearview mirror he was frowning whats that york turned on the trunk was a small shopping bag while theyd been staring at york s mercedes somebody had put it there this is eberhart all units standby lampert asked whats up stan eberhart said breathlessly he made us he didnt plant anything at the mercedes or if he did theres another device on our car its in a whole foods bag a little one were getting out negative negative another voice called over the radio this is grimes with the bomb unit it could have a pressure or rocker switch any movement could set it off stay put well get an officer there eberhart muttered its a double feint he leads us off with the poison and then a fake bomb at the mercedes hes been watching us all along and hes planning to get us here jesus lampert called all units were going into miguels dont let him hit the detonator eberhart covered his face with his jacket stephen york had his doubts that that would provide much protection from an exploding gas tank but he did exactly the same ready lampert whispered to alvarado and the others on the take down team huddled at the back door of miguels nods all around lets do it they crashed through the door fast pistols and machine guns up while other officers charged through the front as soon as he stepped into the bar lampert sighted on trotters head ready to nail him if he made any move toward the detonator but the suspect merely turned alarmed and frowning in curiosity like the other patrons at the sound of the officers hands up you trotter freeze freeze the landscaper stumbled back off the stool eyes wide in shock he lifted his hands an officer from the bomb squad stepped between trotter and the detonator and looked it over carefully as the tac cops threw the man to the floor and cuffed him i didnt do anything what this all about the detective called into his microphone weve got him bomb units one and two proceed with the render safe operation in the car complete silence eberhart and york struggled to remain motionless but york felt as if his pounding heart was going to jiggle the bomb enough so that it would detonate theyd learned that trotter was in custody and couldnt push the detonator button but that didnt mean that the device wasnt set with a hair trigger eberhart had spent the last five minutes lecturing york on how sensitive some bomb detonators could be until york had told him to shut the hell up wrapped in his jacket the businessman peeked out and in the sideview mirror watched the policeman in a green bomb suit approach the car slowly through the radios tinny speaker they heard eberhart york stay completely still sure eberhart said in a throaty whisper his lips barely moving york could see the policeman step closer and peer into the shopping bag he took out a flashlight and pointed it downward examining the contents with a wooden probe like a chopstick he carefully searched the bag through the speaker they heard what sounded like a gasp york cringed but it wasnt the sound was a laugh followed by trash its what the officer pulled his hood off and walked to the front of the car with a shaking hand york rolled the window down trash the man repeated somebodys lunch they had sushi pringles and a yoohoo that chocolate stuff not a meal i myself wouldve picked trash lamperts voice snapped through the speaker that is affirmative the first bomb unit called in a search of the area beneath york s mercedes revealed nothing but a crumpled soda cup which trotter might or might notve thrown there york wiped his face and climbed out of the car leaned against it to steady himself goddamn it hes been yanking our chain lets go talk to that son of a bitch lampert looked up to see eberhart and york angrily walking into miguels the patrons had resumed eating and drinking and were clearly enjoying this reallife law and order show he turned back to the uniformed officer whod just searched trotter wallet keys money nothing else another detective from the bomb squad had carefully examined the detonator and reported that theyd been wrong it was only a small laptop computer as york was mulling this over a plainclothed cop appeared at the door and said we searched trotters car no explosives explosives trotter asked frowning deeply dont get cute lampert snapped but there was an empty propane tank the cop added from rodriguezs trotter added i needed a refill thats where i always go i was going there after lunch he nodded at the bar menu you ever try the tamales here the best in town york muttered you played us like a fish goddamnit making us think your trash was a bomb another cold smile crossed the landscapers face why exactly did you think id have a bomb silence for a moment then lampert turned toward eberhart who avoided everyones eyes trotters nodded at the computer hit the play button what lampert asked the play button lampert paused as he looked over the computer its not a bomb and even if it was would i blow myself up too the detective hit the button oh christ muttered eberhart as a video came on the small screen it showed the security man prowling through an office stan is that you lampert asked i yep its him trotter said hes in my office at home you told us one of your sources said trotter was asking about where york shopped and about propane tanks the security man said nothing trotter offered i was going to stop by the police station after lunch and drop off the cd but since youre here its all yours the officers watched eberhart ransacking trotters desk so whatd that be the landscaper asked breaking and entering trespass too and if you were going to ask yeah i want to press charges what do you guys say to the fullest extent of the law but i the security man stammered you what trotter filled in you shut the power off and the backup too but ive been a little paranoid lately thanks to mr york so i have two battery backups you broke into his house stephen york asked eberhart looking shocked you never told me that you goddamn judas eberhart exploded you knew exactly what i was doing you agreed to it you wanted me to i swear york said this is the first ive heard about it lampert shook his head stan whyd you do it i couldve overlooked some things but a b and e stupid i know i know he said looking down but we were so desperate to get this guy hes dangerous hes got books on sabotage and surveillance please bill can you cut me some slack sorry stan a nod to a uniformed officer who cuffed him take him to booking trotter called after him if youre interested those books about bombs and things i got them for research im trying my hand at a murder mystery everybody seems to be doing it nowadays ive got a couple of chapters on that computer why dont you check it out if you dont believe me youre lying then york turned to lampert you know why he did this dont you its all part of his plan mr york just no no think about it he sets up a sting to get rid of my security man and leave me unprotected and then he does all this with the fake bomb to find out about your procedures the bomb squad how many officers you have who your undercover cops are did you leave a whole foods bag on the trunk of mr eberharts car alvarado asked trotter replied no if you think i did why dont you check for fingerprints york pointed at trotters pocket gloves look there wont be any prints whys he wearing gloves in this heat im a landscaper i usually wear gloves when i work most of us do have to say im getting pretty tired of this whole thing because of what some daylaborer said you got it into your head that im a killer or something well im sick of my house being broken into sick of being watched all the time i think its time to call my lawyer york stepped forward angrily youre lying tell me why youre doing this tell me goddamn it ive looked at everything ive ever done bad in my whole life i mean everything the homeless guy i told to get a job when he asked me for a quarter the clerk i called a stupid pig cause she gave me the wrong order the valet i didnt tip because he couldnt speak english every little goddamn thing ive been going over my life with a microscope i dont know what i did to you tell me tell me his face was red and his veins jutted out his fists were clenched at his sides i dont know what youre talking about trotter lifted his hands the cuffs jingling the detective made a decision take em off a patrol officer unhooked the bracelets sweating york said to lampert no thiss all part of his plot im inclined to believe him i think diaz was making the whole thing up but the sauna york began think about it though nothing happened and there was nothing wrong with the brakes on your mercedes we just got the report york snapped but the repair guide he bought one brakes trotter asked york said you bought a book on mercedes brakes dont deny it why would i deny it call dmv i bought an old mercedes sedan a week ago it needs new brakes and im going to do the work myself sorry york but i think you need professional help no he just bought the car as a cover york raged look at him look at his eyes hes just waiting for a chance to kill me bought a car as cover alvarado asked eying his boss lampert sighed mr york if youre so sure youre in danger then id suggest you hire another babysitter i frankly dont have time for any more of these games he turned to the team come on people lets pack up weve got some real cases to get back to the detective noticed the bartender hovering nearby holding trotters tamales he nodded and the man walked forward and served the landscaper who sat back down unfolded a napkin and smoothed it on his lap good huh he asked trotter the best lampert nodded sorry about this trotter shrugged suddenly his mood seemed to change smiling he turned to york who was heading out the front door and called hey the businessman stopped and stared back good luck to you trotter said and started on his lunch at ten that night ray trotter made the rounds of his house saying goodnight to his children and stepson as he always did a serial goodnighter was how his younger daughter laughingly described him then he showered and climbed into bed waiting for nancy who was finishing the dishes a moment later the lights in the kitchen went out and she passed the doorway his wife smiled at him and continued into the bathroom a moment later he heard the shower he enjoyed the hiss of falling water a desertdweller now yes but ray still had a fondness for the sounds of the damp northeast lying back against a halfdozen thick pillows he reflected on the days events particularly the incident at miguels stephen york face red eyes frightened he was out of control he was as crazed as a lunatic of course he also happened to be one hundred percent right ray trotter had in fact done everything that york accused him of from approaching diaz about the alarms to planting the trash on the trunk of eberharts car sure hed done it all but hed never had any intention of hurting one hair on york s coiffed rogained head hed asked diaz about york s security system but the next day had anonymously turned the worker in for drugs ray had seen him selling pot to other employees at the landscaping company in the hopes that hed spill the information about ray to the cops hed bought the books on sabotage as well as the one about mercedes brakes but would never think about making a bomb or tampering with the businessmans car the shims at the sauna room he was never going to use and the chemicals from southern states hed never planned to use to make cyanide hed sent an order of cigars nice ones by the way and completely poison free even the psychologists reports in the veterans administration file were rays creation hed gone to the vas office requested his own file and pretending to review it had slipped in several sheets of notes apparently taken by a counselor during therapy sessions from years ago documenting his troubled years after the service the report was all a fiction oh yes his heart ached for revenge against stephen a york but the payback wasnt exacting physical revenge it was simply in making the man believe that trotter was going to kill him and guaranteeing that york spent a long long time wallowing in paranoia and misery waiting for the other shoe to drop for yorks car to explode his gas line to start leaking a gunshot to shatter his bedroom window was that just a stomach cramp or the first symptom of arsenic poisoning and the offense that had turned ray into an angel of vengeance i dont know what i did to you tell me tell me tell me to rays astonishment and amusement york himself had actually mentioned the very transgression that afternoon at miguels ray thought back to it now an autumn day two years ago his daughter celeste had returned home from her afterschool job a troubled look on her face whats the matter hed asked the sixteenyearold hadnt answered but had walked immediately to her room closed the door these were the days not long after her mother had passed away occasional moodiness wasnt unusual but hed persisted in drawing her out and that night hed learned the reason she was upset an incident during her shift at mcdonalds celeste confessed that shed accidentally mixed up two orders and given a man a chicken sandwich when hed asked for a big mac hed left not realizing the mistake then returned five minutes later walked up to the counter he looked over the heavyset girl and snapped so youre not only a fat pig youre stupid too i want to see the manager now celeste had tried to be stoic about the incident but as she related it to her father a single tear ran down her cheek ray was heartbroken at the sight the next day hed learned the identity of the customer from the manager and filed away the name stephen york a single tear for some people perhaps not even worth a second thought but because it was his daughters tear ray trotter decided it was payback time he now heard the water stop running then detected a fragrant smell of perfume wafting from the bathroom nancy came to bed laying her head on his chest you seem happy tonight she said do i when i walked past before and saw you staring at the ceiling you looked whats the word content he thought about the word that describes it ray shut the light out and putting his arm around his wife pulled her closer to him im glad youre in my life she whispered me too he replied stretching out ray considered his next steps hed probably give york a month or two of peace then just when the businessman was feeling comfortable hed start up again what would he do maybe an empty medicine vial next to york s car along with a bit of harmless botox on the door handle that had some appeal to it hed have to check if a trace of the cosmetic gave a positive reading for botulism bacteria now that hed convinced the police that he was innocent and york was paranoid the businessman could cry wolf as often as he liked and the cops would tune him out completely the playing field was wide open maybe he could enlist york s wife shed be a willing ally he believed in his surveillance ray had seen how badly the man treated her hed overheard york lose his temper at her once when she kept pressuring him to let her apply to a local college to finish her degree hed yelled as if she were a teenager carole was currently out of town probably with that english professor shed met at arizona state when she was sneaking classes instead of taking tennis lessons the man had transferred to ucla but she was still seeing him theyd meet in la or palm springs ray had also followed her to a lawyers office several times in scottsdale and assumed she was getting ready to divorce york maybe after it was final shed be willing to give him some inside information that he could use another idea occurred to him he could send york an anonymous letter possibly with a cryptic message on it the words wouldnt be important the point would be the smell hed sprinkle the paper with almond extract which gave off the telltale aroma of cyanide after all nobody knew that he hadnt made a batch of poison oh the possibilities were endless he rolled onto his side whispered to his wife that he loved her and in sixty seconds was sound asleep copycat hed never revived a cold case in quite this way detective quentin altman rocked back his chair squealing with the telltale caw of ageing government furniture and eyed the narrow jittery man sitting across from him go on the cop said so i check out this book from the library just for the fun of it i never do that just read a book for the fun of it i mean never i dont get much time off you know altman hadnt known this but he could certainly have deduced it gordon wallace was the greenvilletribunes sole crime reporter and mustve spent sixty seventy hours a week banging out copy to judge by the number of stories appearing under his byline every day and im reading along and what is it youre reading a murder mystery ill get to that im reading along and im irritated the reporter continued because somebodyd circled some passages in a library book altman grunted distractedly he was head of homicide in a burg with a smalltown name but bigcity crime statistics the fiftysomething detective was busy and he didnt have much time for reporters with crackpot theories there were twentytwo folders of current cases on his desk and here wallace was delivering some elliptical message about defaced books i dont pay much attention at first but i go back and reread one of the circled paragraphs it jogs my memory anyway i checked the morgue morgue altman frowned rubbing his wiry red hair which showed not a strand of gray our morgue not yours in the newspaper office all the old stories got it how bout getting to the point i found the articles about the kimberly banning murder altman grew more attentive twentyeightyearold kimberly had been strangled to death a year ago the murder occurred two weeks after a similar killingof a young female grad student the two deaths appeared to be the work of the same person but there were few forensic leads and no motive that anyone could determine the cases prompted a taskforce investigation but eventually the suspects dried up and blew away like maple leaves in october and soon the case grew cold tall and gaunt with tendons and veins rising from his pale skin wallace tried to tone down his intimidating physique and face with brown tweed jackets corduroy slacks and pastel shirts an attempt that was as today completely unsuccessful he asked the cop you remember how the whole town was paranoid after the first girl was killed and how everybody was doublelocking their doors and never letting strangers into their houses altman nodded well look at this the reporter pulled latex gloves out of his pocket and put them on why the gloves wallace the man ignored the question and dug a book out of his battered briefcase altman got a look at the title two deaths in a small town hed never heard of it this was published six months before the first killing he opened the book to a yellow postit tab and pushed it forward read those paragraphs the detective pulled on his cvs drugstore glasses and leaned forward the hunter knew that now that hed killed once the town would be more alert than ever its soul would be edgier its collective nerves would be as tense as an animal traps bluesteel spring women would not stroll the streets alone and those who did would be looking around themselves constantly alert for any risk only a fool would let a stranger into her house and the hunter did not enjoy killing fools so on tuesday night he waited until nearly bedtime eleven pm and then slipped onto maple street there he doused a parked convertibles roof with gasoline and ignited the pungent amber liquid a huge whoosh he hid in the bushes and hypnotized by the tornado of flames and ebony smoke swirling into the night sky above the dying car he waited in ten minutes behemoths of fire trucks roared up the street their wailing sirens drawing people from their homes to find out what the excitement might be among those on the sidewalk was a young demure blonde with a heartshaped face clara steading this was the woman the hunter knew he had to possess possess completely she was love incarnate amore herself she was beauty she was passion and she was also completely ignorant of her role as the object of his demented desire clara shivered in her bathrobe standing on the sidewalk along with a clutch of chattering neighbors as they watched the firemen extinguish the blaze and offered words of sympathy to the dismayed owner of the car who lived a few doors away finally the onlookers grew bored or repulsed by the bitter smell of the burnt rubber and plastic and they returned to their beds or their latenight snacks or their mindnumbing tv but their vigilance didnt flag the moment they stepped inside every one of them locked their doors and windows carefully to make certain that the strangler would not wreak his carnage in their homes though in clara steadings case her diligence in securing the deadbolt and chains had a somewhat different effect locking the hunter inside with her jesus altman muttered thats just what happened in the banning case how the perp got inside he set fire to a car a convertible wallace added and then i went back and found another passage thatd been circled when id read it at first i didnt pay any attention but you know what it said it was how the killer had stalked the first victim by pretending to work for the city and trimming the plants in a park across from her apartment this was just how the first victim of the greenville strangler the pretty grad student had been stalked so the killers a copycat altman murmured he used the novel for research which meant that there could be evidence in the book that might lead to the perp fingerprints ink handwriting altman stared at the brooding cover a drawing of a mans silhouette peering into the window of a house the detective pulled on his own pair of latex gloves and slipped the book into an evidence envelope he nodded at the reporter and said a heartfelt thanks we havent had a lead on this one in over eight months walking into the office next to his that of his assistant a young crewcut detective named josh randall he instructed the man to take the book to the county lab for analysis when he returned wallace was still sitting expectantly in the hard chair across from altmans desk altman wasnt surprised he hadnt left and the quid pro quo the detective asked for your good deed i want an exclusive what else i figured altman didnt mind this in theory cold cases were bad for the departments image and solving cold cases was good for a cops career not to mention that there was still a killer out there hed never liked wallace though who always seemed a little out of control in a spooky way and was as irritating as most crusaders usually are okay youve got an exclusive altman said ill keep you posted he rose and shook the reporters hand waited for him to leave oh im not going anywhere my friend thiss an official investigation and it wouldntve been one without me i want to write this one from the inside out tell my readers how a homicide investigation works from your point of view altman argued some more but in the end he gave in he felt he had no choice he said just dont get in my way if you get in the way youre out of here wouldnt think of it he frowned an eerie look into his long toothy face i might even be helpful maybe it was a joke but there was nothing humorous about the delivery he then looked up expectantly at the detective so whadda we do next well youre going to cool your heels im going to review the case file but relax wallace investigations take time sit back take your jacket off enjoy our wonderful coffee wallace glanced at the closet that served as the police stations canteen he rolled his eyes and the ominous tone of earlier was replaced with a laugh funny i didnt know they still made instant the detective winked and ambled down the hall on his aching bones quentin altman hadnt run the greenville strangler case himself hed worked on it some the whole department had had a piece of the case but the officer in charge had been bob fletcher a sergeant whod been on the force for years fletcher whod never remarried after his wife left him some years before and was childless had devoted his life to his job after the divorce and seemed to take his inability to solve the strangler case hard the softspoken man had actually given up a senior spot in homicide and transferred to robbery altman was now glad for the sergeants sake that there was a chance to nail the killer whod eluded him altman wandered down to robbery with the news about the book and to see if fletcher knew anything about it the sergeant though was out in the field at the moment and so altman left him a message and then dove into the cluttered and oppressively hot records room he found the strangler files easily the folders sported red stripes on the side a harsh reminder that while this mightve been a cold case it was still very much open returning to his office he sat back sipping the yes disgusting instant coffee and read the file trying to ignore wallaces incessant scribbling on his steno pad the scratchy noise irritatingly audible across the office the events of the murders were well documented the perp had broken into two womens apartments and strangled them thered been no rape sexual molestation or postmortem mutilation neither woman had ever been stalked or threatened by former boyfriends and though kimberly had recently purchased some condoms none of her friends knew that shed been dating the other victim becky winthrop her family said hadnt dated for over a year sergeant fletcher had carried out a bythebook investigation but most killings of this sort without witnesses motive or significant trace found at the scene are not solved without the help of an informant often a friend or acquaintance of the perp but despite extensive press coverage of the investigation and pleas on tv by the mayor and fletcher no one had come forward with any information about possible suspects an hour later just as he closed the useless file altmans phone rang a forensic lab tech at the county police told him that they had been through the book page by page and found three passages underlined and starred with large asterisks in addition to the two that wallace had found there was a passage about how the killer had put plastic bags around his shoes to prevent leaving footprints and to keep trace evidence from sloughing off at the crime scene altman gave a short laugh the report that hed just read contained a note that the crimescene searchers hadnt been able to figure out why the perp had left no footprints because the goddamn killer had used a goddamn howto book the detective thought bitterly the tech continued next to two of the underscored passages were several handwritten notations one said check this one out important and the other used distraction brilliant the documents department had blown up images of the handwriting and was prepared to compare these to any samples found elsewhere though until such samples were found they could do nothing more the techs had also checked for any impression evidence to see if the killer had written something on say a postit note on top of one of the pages but found nothing a ninhydrin analysis revealed a total of nearly two hundred latent fingerprints on the three pages on which the paragraphs had been underlined unfortunately many of them were old and were only fragments technicians had located a few that were clear enough to be identified and had run them through the fbis automatic fingerprint identification system in west virginia but all the results had come back negative the cover of the book wrapped in printfriendly cellophane yielded close to four hundred prints but they too were mostly smudges and fragments afis had provided no positive ids for these either frustrated altman thanked the technician as cordially as he could and hung up so what was that about wallace asked looking eagerly at the sheet of paper in front of altman which contained both notes on the conversation hed just had and a series of compulsive doodles he explained to the reporter about the forensic results so no leads wallace summarized dramatically and jotted a note the irritated detective wondering why the reporter had actually found it necessary to write this observation down as he gazed at the reporter an idea occurred to altman and he stood up abruptly lets go where your crime scene mine wallace asked scrambling to follow the detective as he strode out the door the library near gordon wallaces apartment where hed checked out the novel was a small branch in the three pines neighborhood of greenville so named because legend had it that three trees in a park here had miraculously survived the fire of which had destroyed the rest of the town it was a nice place populated mostly by businessmen professionals and educators the college was nearby the same school where the first strangler victim had been a student altman followed wallace inside and the reporter found the head of the branch and introduced her to the detective mrs mcgiver was a trim woman dressed in stylish gray she looked more like a senior executive with a hightech company than a librarian the detective explained the connection between the person whod checked out the book and the murders shock registering on the womans face as she realized that the killer was somebody whod been to her library perhaps even someone she knew id like a list of everybody who checked out that book altman had considered the possibility that the killer might not have checked it out but had looked through it here in the library itself but that meant hed have to underline the passages in public and risk drawing the attention of librarians or patrons he concluded that the only safe way for the strangler to do his homework was at home ill see what i can find she said altman had thought that it might take days to pull together this information but mrs mcgiver was back in minutes altman felt his gut churning with excitement as he gazed at the sheets of paper in her hand relishing the sensations of the thrill of the hunt and pleasure at finding a fruitful lead but as he flipped through the sheets he frowned every one of the thirty or so people checking out two deaths had done so recently within the last six months they needed the names of those whod checked it out before the killings a year ago actually i need to see the list before july tenth of last year he explained oh but we dont have records that far back normally we would but about six months ago our computer was vandalized vandalized she nodded frowning somebody poured battery acid or something into the hard drive ruined it and destroyed all our records backup too somebody from your department handled the case i dont remember who wallace said i didnt hear about it they never found who did it it was very troubling but more of an inconvenience than anything imagine if hed decided to destroy the books themselves altman caught wallaces eye dead end he muttered angrily then he asked the librarian how bout the names of everybody who had a library card then were their names in the computer too prior to six months ago theyre gone too im sorry forcing a smile onto his face he thanked the librarian and walked to the doorway but he stopped so suddenly that wallace nearly slammed into his back what the reporter asked altman ignored him and returned to the desk calling as he did mrs mcgiver hold up there drawing stares and a couple of harsh shhhhs from readers i need to find out where somebody lives ill try but youre the policeman dont you have ways of doing that in this case i have a feeling youd be a better cop than me the author of two deaths in a small town andrew m carter lived in hampton station near albany about two hours away from greenville mrs mcgivers copy of whos who in contemporary mystery writing didnt include addresses or phone numbers but altman called the felonies division of the albany police department and they tracked down carters address and number altmans theory was that carter mightve gotten a fan letter from the killer since one notation called a passage brilliant and the other appeared to be a reminder to do more research on the topic it was possible that the killer had written to carter to praise him or to ask for more information if there was such a letter the county forensic handwriting expert could easily link the notation with the fan who if they were lucky might have signed his real name and included his address mentally crossing his fingers he placed a call to the author a woman answered hello im detective altman with the greenville police department he said id like to speak to andrew carter im his wife she said hes not available the matteroffact tone in her voice suggested that this was her kneejerk response to all such calls when will he be available this is about the murders isnt it thats right maam do you have a suspect i cant really go into that but i would like to talk to your husband a hesitation the thing is her voice lowered and altman suspected that her unavailable husband was in a nearby room he hasnt been well im sorry altman said is it serious you bet its serious she said angrily when andy heard that the killer mightve used his book as a model for the crimes he got very depressed he cut himself off from everybody he stopped writing she hesitated he stopped everything he just gave up mustve been real difficult mrs carter altman said sympathetically i told him it was just a coincidence those women getting killed like he wrote in the book just a weird coincidence but the reporters and well everybody friends neighbors they kept yammering on and on about how andy was to blame altman supposed she wasnt going to like the fact that hed found proof that her husbands book had indeed been the model for the killings she continued hes been getting better lately anything about the case could set him back i do understand that maam but you have to see my situation weve got a possibility of catching the killer and your husband could be real helpful the sound on the other end of the line grew muffled and altman could hear her talking to someone else altman wasnt surprised when she said my husband just got back ill put him on hello came a soft uneasy voice thiss andy carter altman identified himself are you the policeman i talked to last year me no that mightve been the case detective sergeant bob fletcher right that was the name so fletcher had talked to the author last year there was no reference in the case file to it and he supposed that carter hadnt provided any helpful information maybe now after this much time had passed hed be more cooperative though altman soon found that wasnt the case he reiterated to carter what hed told his wife and the man said immediately i cant help you and frankly i dont want to thiss been the worst year of my life i appreciate that sir but that killers still free and but i dont know anything i mean what could i possibly tell you that we have a sample of the killers handwriting we found some of his notes in a copy of your book and wed like to compare it to any letters from fans you mightve received there was a long pause finally the author whispered so he did use my book as a model im afraid he did mr carter altman heard nothing for a moment then a cryptic noise maybe a sigh or maybe the man was crying softly sir are you all right the author cleared his throat im sorry i cant help you i just itd be too much for me altman often told young officers under him that a detectives most important trait is persistence he said in an even voice youre the only one who can help us trace the book back to him he destroyed the library computer so we dont have the names of who checked your book out theres no match on the fingerprints either i want to catch this man real bad and i suspect you do too mr carter dont you now there was no response finally the faint voice continued do you know that strangers sent me clippings about the killings perfect strangers hundreds of them they blamed me they called my book a blueprint for murder i had to go into the hospital for a month afterwards i was so depressed i caused those murders dont you understand that altman looked up at wallace and shook his head the reporter gestured for the phone altman figured why not mr carter theres a person here im going to put on the line id like him to have a word with you who he handed the receiver over and sat back listening to the onesided conversation hello mr carter the reporters gaunt frame hunched over the phone and he gripped the receiver in astonishingly long strong fingers you dont know me my name is gordon wallace im a fan of your book i loved it im the one who found the circled passages no im not with them im a reporter for the tribune here in greenville i got that i understand that my colleagues step over a lot of lines but i dont operate that way and i know youre reluctant to get involved here im sure youve been through a tough time but i just want to say one thing im no great novelist like you im just a hack journalist but i am a writer and if i have any important belief in my life its in the freedom to write whatever moves us now no please mr carter let me finish i heard that you basically stopped writing after the murders well you and your talent were as much a victim of those crimes as those women were you exercised your godgiven right to express yourself and a terrible accident happened thats how id look at this madman an act of god a couple of people got killed and you were injured because of that you cant do anything about those women but you can help yourself and your family to move on and theres something else to consider youre in a position to make sure nobody else ever gets hurt by this guy again altman lifted an impressed eyebrow at the moving sales pitch wallace fell silent and glancing at the detective shrugged he held the receiver to his ear for a moment listening finally he nodded and glanced at altman he wants to talk to you altman took the phone yessir what exactly would you want me to do came the tentative voice through the phone all i need is for you to look through your fan mail see if you can find anything suspicious any fans who mightve written something about these passages in the book he told carter which ones had been circled and then added and look for any letters from people who asked about how you researched the murders particularly from people within say a hundred miles or so of greenville carter protested ive got thousands of letters itd take a couple of days to go through them all thats fine well follow up on other leads as best we can but i have one more request sir whats that can we get those letters in person you want me to come to greenville yessir i do silence the detective persisted depending on what we find it could be real helpful to have you here the cityll pay for the mileage and a room if you stay overnight sir carter said slowly theres not enough money in the universe to get me to come to greenville altman took a breath to set out his argument though before he could speak the man continued but ill come anyway altman started to tell the author how much he appreciated the help but after a moment he realized that the man had hung up and he was listening to dead air andy clark turned out not to resemble either a sinister artist or a glitzy celebrity but rather any one of the hundreds of white middleaged businessmen that populated this region of the northeast thick graying hair neatly trimmed a slight paunch much slighter than altmans own thanks to the cops fondness for his wifes casseroles his outfit wasnt an armpatch sports jacket or any other authorial garb but an ll bean windbreaker polo shirt and corduroy slacks it had been two days since altman had spoken to carter the man now stood uneasily in the detectives office taking the coffee that josh randall offered and nodding greetings to the cops and to gordon wallace he slipped off his windbreaker tossing it on an unoccupied chair the mans only moment of consternation in this initial meeting was when he glanced at the top of altmans desk and blinked as he saw the case file that was headed banning kimberly homicide a brief look of dismay filled his face altman was grateful that hed had the foresight to slip the crimescene photos of the victims body to the bottom of the folder they made small talk for a minute or two and then altman nodded at a large white envelope in the authors hand you find something helpful helpful carter asked rubbing his red eyes i dont know youll have to decide that he handed the envelope to the detective oh i wore gloves when i handled them not fancy ones like yours playtex my wifes from the kitchen good thinking altman opened the envelope and donning his own gloves pulled out what mustve been about fifty or so sheets i looked through the emails from fans too carter said but i didnt find anything that seemed suspicious emails wouldnt help them anyway altman was after a handwriting comparison the ones on top carter continued nodding at the correspondence seemed to be from the most how do i put it the most intense fans the detective led the men into the department conference room and spread the letters out on the table randall joined them some of them were typed or printed out from a computer some were written in cursive some in block letters they were on many different types and sizes of paper and in many colors of ink or pencil crayons too for half an hour they looked over the letters altman finally divided them into two piles one he explained was of letters from fans who were as carter had said intense these notes were eerie nonsensical angry or disturbingly personal come to see us in sioux city if your in town and the wife and me will treat you to our special full body massage out side on the deck behind our trailer ick said josh randall yep definitely icky altman thought but he set that pile aside and explained that they were the discards thosere your typical wackos and i dont think theyre half dangerous its the other ones im worried about he nodded at the second pile theyre reasonable and calm and cautious just like the strangler see hes an organized offender calculating and smart hes not going to give anything away by ranting if he has any questions hes going to ask them politely and carefully hell want some detail but not too much thatd arouse suspicion altman gathered up this stack about ten letters placed them in an evidence envelope and handed them to the young detective over to the county lab stat a man stuck his head in the door bob fletcher the evenkeeled sergeant introduced himself to carter we never met but i spoke to you on the phone last year about the case i remember they shook hands fletcher nodded at altman smiling ruefully hes a better cop than me i never thought that the killer mightve tried to write you the sergeant it turned out had contacted carter not about fan mail but to ask if the author had based the story on any previous true crimes thinking there might be a connection between them and the strangler murders it had been a good thought but carter had explained that the plot for two deaths was a product of his imagination the sergeants eyes took in the stack of letters any luck he asked well have to see what the lab finds altman then nodded toward the author but i have to say that mr carter heres been a huge help wed be stymied for sure it wasnt for him appraising carter carefully fletcher said i have to admit i never got a chance to read your book but i always wanted to meet you an honesttogod famous author dont think ive ever shook ones hand before carter gave an embarrassed laugh not very famous to look at my sales figures well all i know is my girlfriend read your book and she said it was the best thriller shed read in years carter said i appreciate that is she around town i could autograph her copy oh fletcher said well were not going out anymore she left the area but thanks for the offer he headed back to robbery there was now nothing to do but wait for the lab results to come back so wallace suggested coffee at starbucks the men wandered down the street ordered and sat sipping the drinks as wallace pumped carter for information about breaking into fiction writing and altman simply enjoyed the feel of the hot sun on his face the mens recess ended abruptly though fifteen minutes later when altmans phone rang detective came the enthusiastic voice of his youthful assistant weve got a match the handwriting in one of mr carters fan letters matches the notes in the book the inks the same too there were markers in it the detective said please tell me theres a name and address on the letter you bet there is howard desmonds his name and his place is over in warwick a small town fifteen minutes from the sites of both of the greenville stranglers attacks the detective told his assistant to pull together as much information on desmond as he could he snapped the phone shut and grinning announced weve found him weve got our copycat but as it turned out they didnt have him at all single fortytwoyearold howard desmond a veterinary technician had skipped town six months before leaving in a huge hurry one day in april hed called his landlord and announced that he was moving hed left virtually overnight abandoning everything in the apartment but his valuables there was no forwarding address altman had hoped to go through whatever hed left behind but the landlord explained that hed sold everything to make up for the lost rent what didnt sell hed thrown out altman spoke to the vet in whose clinic desmond had worked and the doctors report was similar to the landlords in april desmond had called and quit his job effective immediately saying only that he was moving to oregon to take care of his elderly grandmother he never called back with a forwarding address for his last check as he said he would the vet described desmond as quiet and affectionate to the animals in his care but with little patience for people altman contacted the authorities in oregon and found no record of any howard desmond in the dmv files or on the property or incometax rolls a bit more digging revealed that all of desmonds grandparents his parents too had died years before the story about the move to oregon was apparently a complete lie the few relatives the detective could track down confirmed that hed just disappeared and they didnt know where he might be they echoed his bosss assessment describing the man as intelligent but a recluse one who significantly loved to read and often lost himself in novels appropriately for a killer who took his homicidal inspiration from a book whatd his letter to andy say wallace asked with an okaying nod from altman randall handed it to the reporter who then summarized out loud he asks how mr carter did the research for his book what were the sources he used how did he learn about the most efficient way a murderer would kill someone and hes curious about the mental makeup of a killer why did some people find it easy to kill while others couldnt possibly hurt anyone altman shook his head no clue as to where he mightve gone well get his name into ncic and vicap but hell he could be anywhere south america europe singapore since bob fletchers robbery division wouldve handled the vandalism at the greenville librarys three pines branch which they now knew desmond was responsible for altman sent randall to ask the sergeant if hed found any leads that would be helpful the other men found themselves staring at desmonds fan letter as if it were a corpse at a wake silence surrounding them trying to guess where the killer mightve gone altman glanced up and noticed that andy carter was frowning as he gazed at a large map of greenville county up on the wall the author nodded to himself slowly and then said had a thought go on desmond rented his place right yep well he had a decent job he wasnt a youngster and he was single he had tove had some money why would he rent houses arent that expensive in greenville altman shrugged i dont know what do you make of that my wife and i used to go up to the adirondacks in the summer we looked into buying a place awhile ago but we couldnt afford to own two houses so we ended up renting the detective nodded so youre thinking that one reason a man would rent his main residence was if he owned a house somewhere else a summer house or something just a thought but you checked the county registrar he didnt own any property wallace pointed out to altman but we didnt check other counties the detective replied a vacation place might not be nearby he grabbed his phone and in less than five minutes they had their answer howard desmond did indeed own a house elsewhere on the shore of lake muskegon sixty miles from greenville tucked away into the backwater piney wilderness good thought the detective said to carter thanks you think hes hiding out there wallace asked doubt it altman said hes not stupid i were him id vanish for a couple of years till everybodyd forgotten about the case and i thought it was safe to come back to the area but there could be some leads there to where he did go maybe airline receipts or something josh randall returned to report that sergeant bob fletcher had no helpful information in the library vandalism case but altman said doesnt matter weve got a better lead suit up josh whatre we doing were going for a ride in the country what else on a nice fall day like this lake muskegon is a large but shallow body of water bordered by willow tall grass and ugly pine altman didnt know the place well hed brought his family here for a couple of picnics over the years and he and bob fletcher had come to the lake once on a halfhearted fishing expedition of which altman had only vague memories gray drizzly weather and a nearly empty creel at the end of the day as he and randall drove north through the increasingly deserted landscape he briefed the young man now im ninetynine percent sure desmonds not here but what were going to do first is clear the house i mean closet by closet and then i want you stationed in the front to keep an eye out while i look for evidence okay sure boss they passed desmonds overgrown driveway and pulled off the road then eased into a stand of thick forsythia together the men cautiously made their way down the weedy drive toward the vacation house a dignified term for the tiny shabby cottage sitting in a threefoothigh sea of grass and brush a path had been beaten through the foliage somebody had been here recently but it might not have been desmond altman had been a teenager once himself and knew that nothing attracts adolescent attention like a deserted house they drew their weapons and altman pounded on the door calling police open up silence he hesitated a moment adjusted the grip on his gun and kicked the door in filled with cheap dustcovered furniture buzzing with stuporous fall flies the place appeared completely deserted they checked the four small rooms carefully and found no sign of desmond outside they glanced in the window of the garage and saw that it was empty then altman sent randall to the front of the driveway to hide in the bushes and report anybodys approach he then returned to the house and began to search wondering just how hot the cold case was about to become two hundred yards before the driveway that led to howard desmonds cottage a battered tenyearold toyota pulled onto the shoulder of route and then into the woods out of sight of any drivers along the road a man got out and satisfied that his car was well hidden squinted into the forest getting his bearings he noticed the line of the brown lake to his left and figured the vacation house was in the tenoclock position ahead of him through dense underbrush like this it would take him about fifteen minutes to get to the place he estimated thatd make the time pretty tight hed have to move as quickly as he could and still keep the noise to a minimum the man started forward but then stopped suddenly and patted his pocket hed been in such a hurry to get to the house he couldnt remember if hed taken what he wanted from the glove compartment but yes he had it with him hunched over and picking his way carefully to avoid stepping on noisy branches gordon wallace continued on toward the cabin where he hoped detective altman was lost in police work and would be utterly oblivious to his furtive approach the search of the house revealed virtually nothing that would indicate that desmond had been here recently or where the man might now be altman found some bills and canceled checks but the address on them was desmonds apartment in warwick he decided to check the garage thinking he might come across something helpful that the killer had tossed out of the car and forgotten about directions or a map maybe he found something far more interesting in the decrepit building though howard desmond himself that is to say his corpse the moment altman opened the oldfashioned double doors of the garage he detected the smell of decaying flesh he knew where it had to be coming from a large coal bin in the back steeling himself he flipped up the lid inside were the mostly skeletal remains of a man about six feet tall lying on his back fully clothed hed been dead about six months just around the time desmond disappeared altman recalled dna would tell for certain if this was the killer but altman discovered the mans wallet in his hip pocket and sure enough the drivers license inside was desmonds there wasnt enough face left to be sure but the thatch of hair on the corpses skull and the mans height were the same as indicated on the license he looked briefly through the bin again and found nothing else that would identify the body or whod killed him though he did find the apparent murder weapon a stained oldfashioned military bayonet lifting it out with a kleenex he set the weapon on a workbench so what the hell was going on somebody had murdered the strangler who and why but then altman did one of the things he did best let his mind run free too many detectives get an idea into their heads and cant see past their initial conclusions altman though always fought against this tendency and he now asked himself but what if desmond wasnt the strangler they knew for certain that he was the one whod underlined the passages in the librarys copy of two deaths in a small town but what if hed done so after the killings the letter desmond had written to carter was undated maybe like gordon wallace hed read the book after the murders and been struck by the similarity hed started to investigate the crime himself and the strangler had found out and murdered him but then who was the killer like gordon wallace altman felt another little tap in his farranging mind as fragments of facts lined up for him to consider facts that all had to do with the reporter for instance wallace was physically imposing abrasive temperamental at times he could be threatening scary he was obsessed with crime and he knew police and forensic procedures better than most cops which also meant that he knew how to anticipate investigators moves hed sure blustered his way right into the middle of the reopened case just the other day altman reflected wallace owned a motorola police scanner and wouldve been able to listen in on calls about the victims his apartment was a few blocks from the college where the first victim was killed the detective considered lets say that desmond had read the passages become suspicious and circled them then made a few phone calls to find out more about the case he mightve called wallace who as the tribunes crime reporter would be a logical source for more information desmond had met with the reporter whod then killed him and hid the body here impossible why would he have brought the book to the polices attention then and why would he have killed the two women in the first place what was his motive but altman refused to dismiss the notion of wallaces involvement so quickly he bent down into the shabby impromptu crypt again to search it more carefully trying to unearth answers to those difficult questions gordon wallace caught a glimpse of altman in the garage the reporter had crept up to a spot only thirty feet away and was hiding behind a bush the detective wasnt paying any attention to who might be outside apparently relying on josh randall to alert him to intruders the young detective was at the head of the driveway a good two hundred feet away his back to the garage breathing heavily in the heat the reporter started through the grass in a crouch he stopped beside the building and glanced quickly into the side window noting that altman was standing over a coal bin in the rear of the garage squinting at something in his hand perfect wallace thought and reaching into his pocket eased to the open doorway where his aim would be completely unobstructed the detective had found some papers in desmonds pocket and was staring at one in particular a business card trying to figure it out when he heard the snap of a twig behind him and alarmed turned a silhouette of a figure was standing in the doorway he seemed to be holding his hands at chest level blinded by the glare altman gasped whore a huge flash filled the room the detective stumbled backward groping for his pistol damn came a voice he recognized altman squinted against the backlighting wallace you goddamn son of a bitch what the hellre you doing here the reporter scowled and held up the camera in his hand looking just as unhappy as altman i was trying to get a candid of you on the job but you turned around you ruined it i ruined it youve got no business being here i told you not to get in the way you cant im not in the way the man snapped im nowhere near you how can i be in the way thiss a crime scene well thats why i want the pictures he said petulantly then he frowned whats that smell the camera sagged and the reporter started to breathe in shallow gasps he looked queasy its desmond somebody murdered him hes in the coal bin murdered him so hes not the killer altman lifted his radio and barked to randall weve got visitors back here what were in the garage the young officer showed up a moment later trotting fast a disdainful look at wallace where the hell did you come from howd you let him get past altman snapped not his fault the reporter said shivering at the smell i parked up the road how bout we get some fresh air angry altman took perverse pleasure in the reporters discomfort i oughta throw you in jail wallace held his breath and started for the coal bin raising the camera dont even think about it altman growled and pulled the reporter away who did it randall asked nodding at the body altman didnt share that for a moment hed actually suspected wallace himself just before the photoop incident hed found a stunning clue as to who desmonds and the two womens killer actually was he held up a business card i found this on the body on the card was written detective sergeant robert fletcher greenville police department bob randall whispered in shock i dont want to believe it altman muttered slowly but back at the office he didnt let on he even knew about desmond let alone that theyd met at some point true he didnt say a word and he continued nodding at the bayonet doesnt that look like one of his does yeah randall said bob fletcher collected world war ii memorabilia and weapons the wickedlooking blade was similar to several in his collection altmans heart pounded furiously at the betrayal he now understood what had happened fletcher bobbled the case intentionally because he was the killer probably destroying any evidence that led to him a loner a history of short difficult relationships obsessed with the military and hunting hed lied to them about not reading two deaths and had used it as a model to kill those women then after the killings desmond happened to read the book too underlined the passages and being a good citizen contacted case officer fletcher who was none other than the killer himself the sergeant murdered him dumped the body here and then destroyed the librarys computer and never made any effort to pursue the vandalism investigation altman then had another thought he turned suddenly to the reporter where was fletcher when you left the office did you see him at the station the detectives hand strayed to his pistol as he looked around the tall grass wondering if the sergeant now intended to kill them as well he was in the conference room with andy carter no altman realized that they werent the only ones at risk the author was a witness too and a potential victim of fletchers altman grabbed his cell phone and called the central dispatcher he asked for carter hes not here sir the woman said what it was getting late so he decided to get a hotel room for the night which ones he staying at i think its the sutton inn you have the number i do sure but hes not there right now where is he he went out to dinner i dont know where but if you need to get in touch with him you can call bob fletchers phone they were going together twenty minutes from town driving at ninety altman tried again to call fletcher but the sergeant wasnt answering there wasnt much altman could do except try to reason with the sergeant have him give himself up plead with him not to kill carter too he prayed that the cop hadnt already done so another try still no answer he skidded the squad car through the intersection at route nearly sideswiping one of the ubiquitous dairy tankers in these parts okay that was exciting randall whispered removing his sweaty palm from the dashboard as the trucks horn brayed in angry protest behind them altman was about to call fletchers phone again when a voice clattered over the cars radio all units reports of shots fired on route onetwentyeight just west of ralphs grocery repeat shots fired all units respond you think thats them were three minutes away were about to find out altman pushed the accelerator to the floor and they broke into threedigit speed after a brief harrowing ride the squad car crested a hill randall called breathlessly look altman could see bob fletchers police interceptor half on half off the road he skidded to a stop nearby and the two officers jumped out wallaces car which had been hitching an illegal ride on their light bar and siren braked to a stop fifty feet behind them and the reporter too jumped out ignoring the detectives shout to stay down altman felt randall grip his arm the young officer was pointing at the shoulder about fifty feet away in the dim light they could just make out the form of andrew carter lying facedown in the dust oh no they werent in time the sergeant had added the author to the list of his victims look out for fletcher he whispered to a spooked josh randall hes around here someplace and we know hes armed altman ran toward the authors body as he did he happened to glance to his left and gasped there was bob fletcher on the ground holding a shotgun he shouted to randall look out and dropped flat but as he swung the gun toward fletcher he noted that the sergeant wasnt moving the detective hit the man with his flashlight beam fletchers eyes were glazed over and there were two bullet holes in his chest wallace was crouching over carter the reporter called hes alive the detective rose pulled the scattergun out of fletchers lifeless hands and trotted over to the author the mans face was bloody and streaked with dirt his clothes torn lying on the ground nearby was a black revolver the sort that fletcher had carried are you shot carter winced and blinked andy are you shot in response the author shook his head no but i think i broke my arm i cant feel anything in my fingers theres an ambulance on its way just stay where you are dont try to get up my leg man it hurts just stay still andy dont move tell me what happened gasping carter said fletcher said lets go to dinner we took his car he said if i didnt mind he had to make a stop on the way to the restaurant and he turned down this road then he was talking and he said it was funny this road reminded him of that scene in my book where the hunters waiting for one of the victims ah right carter continued he said he hadnt read it he lied to us that meant he had to be the strangler and he was taking me someplace to kill me carter coughed and laid his head back on the ground a moment later he continued when he slowed down to turn into that side road i grabbed his pistol and jumped out of the car i thought i could run into the forest and hide but i hurt myself landing and couldnt get up fletcher stopped and got the shotgun out of the trunk he came after me and i fired a couple of times and then passed out he looked at the body up the road he whispered i didnt want to kill him i didnt have any choice over a crest in the road altman could see flashing lights and hear sirens growing steadily louder as randall ran toward them gesturing wildly altman collected the weapons he glanced at bob fletchers body murdering howard desmond and trying to murder andy carter well those had been to cover up his original crimes but what had been the sergeants motive for killing the two women in greenville last year maybe the anger at being left by his wife had boiled over maybe hed had a secret affair with one of the victims which had turned sour and hed decided to stage her death as a random act of violence and maybe altman reflected unlike in a mystery novel theyd never know what had driven the man to step over the edge into the dark world of the killers hed once hunted the doctors kept andrew carter in the hospital overnight though it seemed that the flying leap from the car as dramatic and frightening as it probably seemed to him hadnt caused any serious damage the next morning he checked out of greenville memorial and stopped by the police department to say goodbye to altman and randall and to sign a formal statement about the events of the previous night got the latest from forensics altman said and explained that fletchers prints were all over the bayonet and that a search of the sergeants house revealed several items stockings and lingerie that had been taken from the homes of the victims leaving no doubt that fletcher was the greenville strangler most people in town certainly everyone in the police department were shocked at this news but quentin altman had to admit that one of the things hed learned in his twentyplus years of being a cop was that you never really knew what was in anybodys heart but your own he chatted with the author for a few moments but their conversation quickly became merely the superficial exchange between two men whose sole reason for contact no longer existed and carter finally looked at his watch saying that hed better be going altman walked him outside they were leaving the police station when gordon wallace loped up to them hot off the presses he handed a copy of the tribune to carter on the front page was wallaces story about the solving of the greenville strangler case keep that wallace said a souvenir thanking him carter folded the paper up slipped it under his arm and walked to his car altman observed that the author seemed in somewhat better spirits than when hed arrived the melancholy remained in his eyes but the detective sensed that hed found a bit of inner peace by coming to greenville to the site of the terrible killings that he felt responsible for and perhaps making this difficult trip and risking his own life to help bring the killer to justice would ultimately prove to be a godsend unlike many people touched by tragedy carter had had the rare chance to revisit the past and personally confront the demons of guilt that threatened to destroy his life just before the man climbed into his toyota altman called out oh one thing andy hows that book of yours end do the police ever find the hunter carter caught himself as he was about to answer he gave a grin you know detective if you want to find that out im afraid youre just going to have to buy yourself a copy he dropped into the front seat fired the car up and pulled into the street offering a brief wave goodbye at two am the next morning andrew carter slipped out of bed where hed lain wideawake for the past three hours he glanced at the quiescent form of his sleeping wife and went to his closet where he found and pulled on an old pair of faded jeans sneakers and a boston university sweatshirt his goodluck writing clothes which he hadnt donned in well over a year he walked down the hall to his office and went inside turning on the light sitting at his desk he clicked on his computer and stared at the screen for a long moment then suddenly he began to write his keyboarding was clumsy at first his fingers jabbing two keys at once or missing the intended one altogether still as the hours passed his skill as a typist returned and soon the words were pouring from his mind onto the screen flawlessly and fast by the time the sky began to glow with pinkgray light and a birds cellphone trill sounded from the crisp holly bush outside his window hed finished the story completely thirtynine doublespaced pages he moved the cursor to the top of the document thought about an appropriate title and typed copycat then andy carter sat back in his comfortable chair and carefully read his work from start to finish the story opened with a reporter finding a suspense novel that contained several underlined passages which were strikingly similar to two reallife murders that had occurred a year earlier the reporter takes the book to a detective who concludes that the man who circled the paragraphs is the perpetrator a copycat inspired by the novel to kill reviving the case the detective enlists the aid of the novels author who reluctantly agrees to help and brings the police some fan letters one of which leads to the suspected killer but when the police track the suspect to his summer home they find that hes been murdered he wasnt the killer at all and had presumably circled the passages only because he too like the reporter was struck by the similarity between the novel and the reallife crimes then the detective gets a big shock on the fans body he finds clues that prove that a sergeant on the town police force is the real killer the author who happens to be with this very officer at that moment manages to wrestle the sergeants gun away and shoot him in selfdefense case closed or so it seems but andy carter hadnt ended the story there he added yet another twist readers learn at the very end that the sergeant was innocent the real strangler had set him up as a fall guy and who was the strangler none other than the author himself racked by writers block after his first novel was published unable to follow it up with another the man had descended into madness desperate and demented he came to believe that he might jumpstart his writing by actually reenacting scenes from his novel so he stalked and strangled two women just as his fictional villain had done the murders hadnt revived his ability to write however and he slumped further into depression and then even more troubling he heard from the fan whod grown suspicious about the similarities between certain passages in the novel and the real crimes the author had no choice he met with the fan and killed him too hiding the body in the mans lakeside summer cottage he covered up the disappearance by pretending to be the fan and phoning the mans boss and landlord to say that he was leaving town unexpectedly the author now believed he was safe but his contentment didnt last enter the reporter whod found the underlined passages and the investigation started anew when he was asked to help the police the author knew he had to give them a scapegoat so he agreed to meet with the police but in fact hed arrived in town a day early he broke into the police sergeants house planted some incriminating evidence from the first murders and stole one of the cops bayonets and his business card these he planted on the body of the fan at the lake house the next day he showed up at the police station with the fan letter that led ultimately to the cottage where the detective found the leads to the sergeant meanwhile the author alone with the unsuspecting cop grabbed his gun and shot him later claiming selfdefense in the final scene the author returned home to try to resume his writing having literally gotten away with murder carter now finished reading the story his heart thumping hard with pride and excitement true it needed polishing but considering that he hadnt written a word for more than a year it was a glorious accomplishment he was a writer once again the only problem was that he couldnt publish the story he couldnt show it to a living soul not even his wife for the simple reason that it wasnt fiction every word was true andy carter himself was the homicidal author still he thought as he erased the entire story from his computer publishing it didnt matter one bit the important thing was that by writing it hed managed to kill his writers block as ruthlessly and efficiently as hed murdered bob fletcher and howard desmond and the two women in greenville and he knew too how to make sure that the block never rose from the dead from now on hed give up fiction and pursue what hed realized he was destined to write true crime what a perfect solution this was hed never want for ideas again tv news magazines and the papers would provide dozens of story leads he could choose from and he reflected walking downstairs to make a pot of coffee if it turned out that there were no crimes that particularly interested him well andy carter knew that he was fully capable of taking matters into his own hands and whipping up a bit of inspiration all by himself the first day of school indian summer in a small midwestern suburb a hot hot day in early september his heavy book bag slung over his shoulder jim martin slim sandyhaired freckled trudged along the pitted sidewalk at this morning on his way to thomas jefferson middle school he walked slowly enjoying the heat enjoying the spongy feel of his new running shoes enjoying the familiar sights along the route filled with excitement filled with anticipation filled with curiosity nervous too this was after all the first day of school at the bottom of the hill exactly a mile from his house he turned the corner and saw the school in front of him it wasnt really a very nice building single story squat yellowish stone nothing stood out except the tall flagpole that would ring like a clock chime when the rope slapped it on windy days today in the still air the pole was silent taking a shortcut through a hedge jim walked over the football field dew leaping from the toes of his shoes grasshoppers jumping out of his path he glanced to his right and noticed a shaded spot on the field near the home team bleachers and a memory suddenly came back to him a spring day on that very spot he and sam gordon facing each other fists balled up ready to slug it out sam was an th grader a big kid hed been held back a year he dressed in dark clothes that smelled of cigarettes and motor oil and he wore his anger the way some women wear too much costume jewelry for no particular reason hed taken an instant disliking to quiet jim who was a year younger and fifty pounds lighter sam had mercilessly tormented him all year until finally jim had had enough and agreed to sams taunt to fight it out after school the boys circled jim terrified but defiant sam threw the first punch jim blocked it but then the bullys left fist appeared from nowhere and clocked jim in the cheek he went down on his knees and sam leapt on him flailing away jims thin arms helpless to protect him from the stunning blows the big boy then stood and was about to deliver a vicious kick to jims ribs when a mans voice cut through the april air boys thats enough coach labell stepped forward pulled sam away and ordered him to the principals office sneering the boy stalked away the coach then helped jim up and surveyed the damage to his face the man said first the nurse but im afraid youre going to the principal too jim yessir the grizzled crewcut man handed jim a kleenex for the blood and the tears waited a moment and then he said i want to tell you something young man yessir jim asked you want to know what i think the biggest difference is between being a child and being an adult whats that knowing the difference between the times you have to fight and the times you should walk away you know what im saying jim nodded good now go see the nurse get that cut cleaned up as jim walked sullenly toward the door coach labell called oh jim the boy turned yessir about those times you do have to fight the man pointed a stubby finger at jim you better learn to watch out for left hooks or youre gonna lose some teeth ill do that coach now this hot hot first day of school trudging through the dewy grass jim shifted his heavy book bag to the other shoulder and he thought about how the coachs words had really made a difference in the way he looked at life closer to the school now walking past the buses yellow as pollen watching the students and teachers the impatient parents in the car pool lane jim waved hello to a few of the kids but he was still lost in his thoughts he was glancing at a nearby classroom mr carters math class oh jim hated math he did all the homework hed spend hours studying for tests but he could never do better than a c plus at best he now thought of one of mr carters classes early in the semester the teacher had passed out a graded test jimd gotten a c minus after all that work he was so frustrated so discouraged the teacher mustve seen the look in his eyes and called him up after class having some trouble i see jim i just dont get it the boy said i mean i try i do the work but its like its overwhelming i freeze up and you know i panic softspoken mr carter pulled a slip of paper out of his desk and wrote down several names he said thesere math tutors jim i want you and your parents to call one of them i think theyll be a big help okay jim said uncertainly then he took a deep breath and confessed the thing is mr carter i just i mean i just dont like math im never going to like it i know that the teacher smiled at this dont like math he nodded well jim you have to understand something your goal here isnt to learn to like math i dont want to teach you that i dont even care about that you dont no no no i want to teach you to love learning about math thats all he repeated it i want you to love learning whatever it is you study and jim nodded digesting this he took the note home and he and his parents got a tutor and his grades improved a bit not much but he started to get some b minuses the important thing for jim though wasnt the grade but what his teacher had told him and he thought now as he walked through the doorway to thomas jefferson middle on this first day of school about how the math teachers words like coach labells had made a real difference in the way he thought about things walking through the cool halls now jim smelled fresh paint and girls perfume and those weird biology lab smells he got a drink at the fountain and headed for home room as he did he passed another classroom and another memory hit him ah mrs peabodys english class she was a stern older woman the kids called psychic because she magically knew which students had read the real assignment and which had read the cliff notes jim thought about the time mrs peabody had given the class a writing assignment write about summer vacation she said be as creative as you can but the stern woman added as she always did make sure you use proper spelling and grammar well that night jim sat at his desk at home and stared unhappily at a blank sheet of paper he didnt want to write a stupid essay about his summer vacation for one thing itd been a dog a water park two weeks of camp his paper route boring hed actually been happy to get back to school so he gave up on the assignment and wrote what he wanted to not an essay at all but a short story science fiction it was about a distant planet that didnt have summer it was spring all the time and it didnt have vacations either the aliens on the planet worked four hours a day the next morning he handed in the story but that night he lay awake until three am thinking why did i do that i totally ignored the assignment what the heck was i thinking of and here english was his favorite class maybe itd take mrs peabody a few days to grade the essays hed beg her for a chance to write another one the sort she wanted but when he got to class the next morning it turned out that mrs peabody had read and graded the essays and when he saw the way she glanced at him with a strange look in her stern psychic eyes he wished hed stayed home sick the teacher said im going to pass back your summer vacation essays in a minute but i want to say something first when you write when you put your words out for other people to read you have to learn to take criticism you have to remember that a critics words arent attacking you as human beings theyre only an opinion about something youve created no matter how harsh the opinion seems and in this case im afraid ive got some rather harsh words to say im in trouble jim thought blushing already betrayed by his freckles staring at the floor mrs peabody continued almost everyone in class wrote an essay about his or her summer vacation almost everyone thiss bad jim thought im getting an f i know it but the teacher said one student decided he didnt feel like doing that jim glanced up long enough to see her eyes focused on him thiss worse than an f im in notetotheparents territory now then mrs peabody looked away from jim and studied the rest of the class all of your essays read as if they were written in your sleep its clear to me that you didnt take the assignment seriously and none of you spent more than ten minutes on it just one of you had the courage to be as imaginative as i asked you to be jim martin is only one who got an a on the assignment now im going to ask him to come up here and read his story to you as an example of thinking independently and being creative then being mrs peabody she added sternly though he shouldve a little more attention to proper spelling and grammar hands trembling jim walked to the front of the classroom in triumph as if he were climbing to the summit of mount everest or were the first person to step onto the surface of mars what a small thing really he now reflected as he dodged through the crowded hallway just a single assignment but what a difference that moment had made to him strolling into his home room now jim unslung his book bag and sat down as the last of the students filed in he could see that some of them too were filled with excitement some with anticipation some with curiosity and some were nervous just like him on this hot hot indian summer morning in september then the bell rang a jarring noise and eventually silence filled the room silence broken only by the shuffle of papers the click of pens the snapping clasps of purses the students looked toward the teachers desk silence jim took a deep breath paused and he stood he turned around and picked up a marker he wrote on the white board mr jim martin home room and eighthgrade english and he added his office hours beneath his name he turned back and said good morning class and with a smile he looked over his students on this the first day of school and his very first day as a teacher how strange it was he thought to be starting his career here at thomas jefferson the same school where he himself had been a student so many years ago and where hed learned so much like knowing when to fight and when to walk away but always looking out for left hooks and loving learning for itself whatever the subject youre studying even if you only get a c plus and always having the courage to think for yourself and to be creative but making sure you use proper spelling and grammar then he pulled his lesson plan and class roster out of his book bag and as he called the name of each of his students he thought again briefly about coach labell and mr carter and mrs peabody and the teachers here and in the other schools jim had attended throughout his life and he knew that like them he too was going to make a difference about the author jeffery deaver is the author of nine
