atlas shrugged ayn rand part i noncontradiction chapter i the theme who is john galt the light was ebbing and eddie willers could not distinguish the bums face the bum had said it simply without expression but from the sunset far at the end of the street yellow glints caught his eyes and the eyes looked straight at eddie willers mocking and stillas if the question had been addressed to the causeless uneasiness within him why did you say that asked eddie willers his voice tense the bum leaned against the side of the doorway a wedge of broken glass behind him reflected the metal yellow of the sky why does it bother you he asked it doesnt snapped eddie willers he reached hastily into his pocket the bum had stopped him and asked for a dime then had gone on talking as if to kill that moment and postpone the problem of the next pleas for dimes were so frequent in the streets these days that it was not necessary to listen to explanations and he had no desire to hear the details of this bums particular despair go get your cup of coffee he said handing the dime to the shadow that had no face thank you sir said the voice without interest and the face leaned forward for a moment the face was windbrowned cut by lines of weariness and cynical resignation the eyes were intelligent eddie willers walked on wondering why he always felt it at this time of day this sense of dread without reason no he thought not dread theres nothing to fear just an immense diffused apprehension with no source or object he had become accustomed to the feeling but he could find no explanation for it yet the bum had spoken as if he knew that eddie felt it as if he thought that one should feel it and more as if he knew the reason eddie willers pulled his shoulders straight in conscientious selfdiscipline he had to stop this he thought he was beginning to imagine things had he always felt it he was thirtytwo years old he tried to think back no he hadnt but he could not remember when it had started the feeling came to him suddenly at random intervals and now it was coming more often than ever its the twilight he thought i hate the twilight the clouds and the shafts of skyscrapers against them were turning brown like an old painting in oil the color of a fading masterpiece long streaks of grime ran from under the pinnacles down the slender sooteaten walls high on the side of a tower there was a crack in the shape of a motionless lightning the length of ten stories a jagged object cut the sky above the roofs it was half a spire still holding the glow of the sunset the gold leaf had long since peeled off the other half the glow was red and still like the reflection of a fire not an active fire but a dying one which it is too late to stop no thought eddie willers there was nothing disturbing in the sight of the city it looked as it had always looked he walked on reminding himself that he was late in returning to the office he did not like the task which he had to perform on his return but it had to be done so he did not attempt to delay it but made himself walk faster he turned a corner in the narrow space between the dark silhouettes of two buildings as in the crack of a door he saw the page of a gigantic calendar suspended in the sky it was the calendar that the mayor of new york had erected last year on the top of a building so that citizens might tell the day of the month as they told the hours of the day by glancing up at a public tower a white rectangle hung over the city imparting the date to the men in the streets below in the rusty light of this evenings sunset the rectangle said september eddie willers looked away he had never liked the sight of that calendar it disturbed him in a manner he could not explain or define the feeling seemed to blend with his sense of uneasiness it had the same quality he thought suddenly that there was some phrase a kind of quotation that expressed what the calendar seemed to suggest but he could not recall it he walked groping for a sentence that hung in his mind as an empty shape he could neither fill it nor dismiss it he glanced back the white rectangle stood above the roofs saying in immovable finality september eddie willers shifted his glance down to the street to a vegetable pushcart at the stoop of a brownstone house he saw a pile of bright gold carrots and the fresh green of onions he saw a clean white curtain blowing at an open window he saw a bus turning a corner expertly steered he wondered why he felt reassuredand then why he felt the sudden inexplicable wish that these things were not left in the open unprotected against the empty space above when he came to fifth avenue he kept his eyes on the windows of the stores he passed there was nothing he needed or wished to buy but he liked to see the display of good any goods objects made by men to be used by men he enjoyed the sight of a prosperous street not more than every fourth one of the stores was out of business its windows dark and empty he did not know why he suddenly thought of the oak tree nothing had recalled it but he thought of it and of his childhood summers on the taggart estate he had spent most of his childhood with the taggart children and now he worked for them as his father and grandfather had worked for their father and grandfather the great oak tree had stood on a hill over the hudson in a lonely spot of the taggart estate eddie willers aged seven liked to come and look at that tree it had stood there for hundreds of years and he thought it would always stand there its roots clutched the hill like a fist with fingers sunk into the soil and he thought that if a giant were to seize it by the top he would not be able to uproot it but would swing the hill and the whole of the earth with it like a ball at the end of a string he felt safe in the oak trees presence it was a thing that nothing could change or threaten it was his greatest symbol of strength one night lightning struck the oak tree eddie saw it the next morning it lay broken in half and he looked into its trunk as into the mouth of a black tunnel the trunk was only an empty shell its heart had rotted away long ago there was nothing insidejust a thin gray dust that was being dispersed by the whim of the faintest wind the living power had gone and the shape it left had not been able to stand without it years later he heard it said that children should be protected from shock from their first knowledge of death pain or fear but these had never scarred him his shock came when he stood very quietly looking into the black hole of the trunk it was an immense betrayalthe more terrible because he could not grasp what it was that had been betrayed it was not himself he knew nor his trust it was something else he stood there for a while making no sound then he walked back to the house he never spoke about it to anyone then or since eddie willers shook his head as the screech of a rusty mechanism changing a traffic light stopped him on the edge of a curb he felt anger at himself there was no reason that he had to remember the oak tree tonight it meant nothing to him any longer only a faint tinge of sadnessand somewhere within him a drop of pain moving briefly and vanishing like a raindrop on the glass of a window its course in the shape of a question mark he wanted no sadness attached to his childhood he loved its memories any day of it he remembered now seemed flooded by a still brilliant sunlight it seemed to him as if a few rays from it reached into his present not rays more like pinpoint spotlights that gave an occasional moments glitter to his job to his lonely apartment to the quiet scrupulous progression of his existence he thought of a summer day when he was ten years old that day in a clearing of the woods the one precious companion of his childhood told him what they would do when they grew up the words were harsh and glowing like the sunlight he listened in admiration and in wonder when he was asked what he would want to do he answered at once whatever is right and added you ought to do something great i mean the two of us together what she asked he said i dont know thats what we ought to find out not just what you said not just business and earning a living things like winning battles or saving people out of fires or climbing mountains what for she asked he said the minister said last sunday that we must always reach for the best within us what do you suppose is the best within us i dont know well have to find out she did not answer she was looking away up the railroad track eddie willers smiled he had said whatever is right twentytwo years ago he had kept that statement unchallenged ever since the other questions had faded in his mind he had been too busy to ask them but he still thought it selfevident that one had to do what was right he had never learned how people could want to do otherwise he had learned only that they did it still seemed simple and incomprehensible to him simple that things should be right and incomprehensible that they werent he knew that they werent he thought of that as he turned a corner and came to the great building of taggart transcontinental the building stood over the street as its tallest and proudest structure eddie willers always smiled at his first sight of it its long bands of windows were unbroken in contrast to those of its neighbors its rising lines cut the sky with no crumbling corners or worn edges it seemed to stand above the years untouched it would always stand there thought eddie willers whenever he entered the taggart building he felt relief and a sense of security this was a place of competence and power the floors of its hallways were mirrors made of marble the frosted rectangles of its electric fixtures were chips of solid light behind sheets of glass rows of girls sat at typewriters the clicking of their keys like the sound of speeding train wheels and like an answering echo a faint shudder went through the walls at times rising from under the building from the tunnels of the great terminal where trains started out to cross a continent and stopped after crossing it again as they had started and stopped for generation after generation taggart transcontinental thought eddie willers from ocean to oceanthe proud slogan of his childhood so much more shining and holy than any commandment of the bible from ocean to ocean foreverthought eddie willers in the manner of a rededication as he walked through the spotless halls into the heart of the building into the office of james taggart president of taggart transcontinental james taggart sat at his desk he looked like a man approaching fifty who had crossed into age from adolescence without the intermediate stage of youth he had a small petulant mouth and thin hair clinging to a bald forehead his posture had a limp decentralized sloppiness as if in defiance of his tall slender body a body with an elegance of line intended for the confident poise of an aristocrat but transformed into the gawkiness of a lout the flesh of his face was pale and soft his eyes were pale and veiled with a glance that moved slowly never quite stopping gliding off and past things in eternal resentment of their existence he looked obstinate and drained he was thirtynine years old he lifted his head with irritation at the sound of the opening door dont bother me dont bother me dont bother me said james taggart eddie willers walked toward thedesk its important jim he said not raising his voice all right all right what is it eddie willers looked at a map on the wall of the office the maps colors had faded under the glasshe wondered dimly how many taggart presidents had sat before it and for how many years the taggart transcontinental railroad the network of red lines slashing the faded body of the country from new york to san francisco looked like a system of blood vessels it looked as if once long ago the blood had shot down the main artery and under the pressure of its own overabundance had branched out at random points running all over the country one red streak twisted its way from cheyenne wyoming down to el paso texasthe rio norte line of taggart transcontinental new tracing had been added recently and the red streak had been extended south beyond el pasobut eddie willers turned away hastily when his eyes reached that point he looked at james taggart and said its the rio norte line he noticed taggarts glance moving down to a corner of the desk weve had another wreck railroad accidents happen every day did you have to bother me about that you know what im saying jim the rio norte is done for that track is shot down the whole line we are getting a new track eddie willers continued as if there had been no answer that track is shot its no use trying to run trains down there people are giving up trying to use them there is not a railroad in the country it seems to me that doesnt have a few branches running at a deficit were not the only ones its a national conditiona temporary national condition eddie stood looking at him silently what taggart disliked about eddie willers was this habit of looking straight into peoples eyes eddies eyes were blue wide and questioning he had blond hair and a square face unremarkable except for that look of scrupulous attentiveness and open puzzled wonder what do you want snapped taggart i just came to tell you something you had to know because somebody had to tell you that weve had another accident that we cant give up the rio norte line james taggart seldom raised his head when he looked at people he did so by lifting his heavy eyelids and staring upward from under the expanse of his bald forehead whos thinking of giving up the rio norte line he asked theres never been any question of giving it up i resent your saying it i resent it very much but we havent met a schedule for the last six months we havent completed a run without some sort of breakdown major or minor were losing all our shippers one after another how long can we last youre a pessimist eddie you lack faith thats what undermines the morale of an organization you mean that nothings going to be done about the rio norte line i havent said that at all just as soon as we get the new track jim there isnt going to be any new track he watched taggarts eyelids move up slowly ive just come back from the office of associated steel ive spoken to orren boyle what did he say he spoke for an hour and a half and did not give me a single straight answer what did you bother him for i believe the first order of rail wasnt due for delivery until next month and before that it was due for delivery three months ago unforeseen circumstances absolutely beyond orrens control and before that it was due six months earlier jim we have waited for associated steel to deliver that rail for thirteen months what do you want me to do i cant run orren boyles business i want you to understand that we cant wait taggart asked slowly his voice halfmocking halfcautious what did my sister say she wont be back until tomorrow well what do you want me to do thats for you to decide well whatever else you say theres one thing youre not going to mention nextand thats rearden steel eddie did not answer at once then said quietly all right jim i wont mention it orren is my friend he heard no answer i resent your attitude orren boyle will deliver that rail just as soon as its humanly possible so long as he cant deliver it nobody can blame us jim what are you talking about dont you understand that the rio norte line is breaking upwhether anybody blames us or not people would put up with ittheyd have toif it werent for the phoenixdurango he saw eddies face tighten nobody ever complained about the rio norte line until the phoenixdurango came on the scene the phoenixdurango is doing a brilliant job imagine a thing called the phoenixdurango competing with taggart transcontinental it was nothing but a local milk line ten years ago its got most of the freight traffic of arizona new mexico and colorado now taggart did not answer jim we cant lose colorado its our last hope its everybodys last hope if we dont pull ourselves together well lose every big shipper in the state to the phoenixdurango weve lost the wyatt oil fields i dont see why everybody keeps talking about the wyatt oil fields because ellis wyatt is a prodigy who damn ellis wyatt those oil wells eddie thought suddenly didnt they have something in common with the blood vessels on the map wasnt that the way the red stream of taggart transcontinental had shot across the country years ago a feat that seemed incredible now he thought of the oil wells spouting a black stream that ran over a continent almost faster than the trains of the phoenixdurango could carry it that oil field had been only a rocky patch in the mountains of colorado given up as exhausted long ago ellis wyatts father had managed to squeeze an obscure living to the end of his days out of the dying oil wells now it was as if somebody had given a shot of adrenalin to the heart of the mountain the heart had started pumping the black blood had burst through the rocksof course its blood thought eddie willers because blood is supposed to feed to give life and that is what wyatt oil had done it had shocked empty slopes of ground into sudden existence it had brought new towns new power plants new factories to a region nobody had ever noticed on any map new factories thought eddie willers at a time when the freight revenues from all the great old industries were dropping slowly year by year a rich new oil field at a time when the pumps were stopping in one famous field after another a new industrial state where nobody had expected anything but cattle and beets one man had done it and he had done it in eight years this thought eddie willers was like the stories he had read in school books and never quite believed the stories of men who had lived in the days of the countrys youth he wished he could meet ellis wyatt there was a great deal of talk about him but few had ever met him he seldom came to new york they said he was thirtythree years old and had a violent temper he had discovered some way to revive exhausted oil wells and he had proceeded to revive them ellis wyatt is a greedy bastard whos after nothing but money said james taggart it seems to me that there are more important things in life than making money what are you talking about jim what has that got to do with besides hes doublecrossed us we served the wyatt oil fields for years most adequately in the days of old man wyatt we ran a tank train a week these are not the days of old man wyatt jim the phoenixdurango runs two tank trains a day down thereand it runs them on schedule if he had given us time to grow along with him he has no time to waste what does he expect that we drop all our other shippers sacrifice the interests of the whole country and give him all our trains why no he doesnt expect anything he just deals with the phoenixdurango i think hes a destructive unscrupulous ruffian i think hes an irresponsible upstart whos been grossly overrated it was astonishing to hear a sudden emotion in james taggarts lifeless voice im not so sure that his oil fields are such a beneficial achievement it seems to me that hes dislocated the economy of the whole country nobody expected colorado to become an industrial state how can we have any security or plan anything if everything changes all the time good god jim hes yes i know i know hes making money but that is not the standard it seems to me by which one gauges a mans value to society and as for his oil hed come crawling to us and hed wait his turn along with all the other shippers and he wouldnt demand more than his fair share of transportationif it werent for the phoenixdurango we cant help it if were up against destructive competition of that kind nobody can blame us the pressure in his chest and temples thought eddie willers was the strain of the effort he was making he had decided to make the issue clear for once and the issue was so clear he thought that nothing could bar it from taggarts understanding unless it was the failure of his own presentation so he had tried hard but he was failing just as he had always failed in all of their discussions no matter what he said they never seemed to be talking about the same subject jim what are you saying does it matter that nobody blames uswhen the road is falling apart james taggart smiled it was a thin smile amused and cold its touching eddie he said its touchingyour devotion to taggart transcontinental if you dont look out youll turn into one of those real feudal serfs thats what i am jim but may i ask whether it is your job to discuss these matters with me no it isnt then why dont you learn that we have departments to take care of things why dont you report all this to whoevers concerned why dont you cry on my dear sisters shoulder look jim i know its not my place to talk to you but i cant understand whats going on i dont know what it is that your proper advisers tell you or why they cant make you understand so i thought id try to tell you myself i appreciate our childhood friendship eddie but do you think that that should entitle you to walk in here unannounced whenever you wish considering your own rank shouldnt you remember that i am president of taggart transcontinental this was wasted eddie willers looked at him as usual not hurt merely puzzled and asked then you dont intend to do anything about the rio norte line i havent said that i havent said that at all taggart was looking at the map at the red streak south of el paso just as soon as the san sebastian mines get going and our mexican branch begins to pay off dont lets talk about that jim taggart turned startled by the unprecedented phenomenon of an implacable anger in eddies voice whats the matter you know whats the matter your sister said damn my sister said james taggart eddie willers did not move he did not answer he stood looking straight ahead but he did not see james taggart or anything in the office after a moment he bowed and walked out in the anteroom the clerks of james taggarts personal staff were switching off the lights getting ready to leave for the day but pop harper chief clerk still sat at his desk twisting the levers of a halfdismembered typewriter everybody in the company had the impression that pop harper was born in that particular corner at that particular desk and never intended to leave it he had been chief clerk for james taggarts father pop harper glanced up at eddie willers as he came out of the presidents office it was a wise slow glance it seemed to say that he knew that eddies visit to their part of the building meant trouble on the line knew that nothing had come of the visit and was completely indifferent to the knowledge it was the cynical indifference which eddie willers had seen in the eyes of the bum on the street corner say eddie know where i could get some woolen undershirts he asked tried all over town but nobodys got em i dont know said eddie stopping why do you ask me i just ask everybody maybe somebody tell me eddie looked uneasily at the blank emaciated face and white hair its cold in this joint said pop harper its going to be colder this winter what are you doing eddie asked pointing at the pieces of typewriter the damn things busted again no use sending it out took them three months to fix it the last time thought id patch it up myself not for long i guess he let his fist drop down on the keys youre ready for the junk pile old pal your days are numbered eddie started that was the sentence he had tried to remember your days are numbered but he had forgotten in what connection he had tried to remember it its no use eddie said pop harper whats no use nothing anything whats the matter pop im not going to requisition a new typewriter the new ones are made of tin when the old ones go that will be the end of typewriting there was an accident in the subway this morning their brakes wouldnt work you ought to go home eddie turn on the radio and listen to a good dance band forget it boy trouble with you is you never had a hobby somebody stole the electric light bulbs again from off the staircase down where i live ive got a pain in my chest couldnt get any cough drops this morning the drugstore on our corner went bankrupt last week the texaswestern railroad went bankrupt last month they closed the queensborough bridge yesterday for temporary repairs oh well whats the use who is john galt she sat at the window of the train her head thrown back one leg stretched across to the empty seat before her the window frame trembled with the speed of the motion the pane hung over empty darkness and dots of light slashed across the glass as luminous streaks once in a while her leg sculptured by the tight sheen of the stocking its long line running straight over an arched instep to the tip of a foot in a highheeled pump had a feminine elegance that seemed out of place in the dusty train car and oddly incongruous with the rest of her she wore a battered camels hair coat that had been expensive wrapped shapelessly about her slender nervous body the coat collar was raised to the slanting brim of her hat a sweep of brown hair fell back almost touching the line of her shoulders her face was made of angular planes the shape of her mouth clearcut a sensual mouth held closed with inflexible precision she kept her hands in the coat pockets her posture taut as if she resented immobility and unfeminine as if she were unconscious of her own body and that it was a womans body she sat listening to the music it was a symphony of triumph the notes flowed up they spoke of rising and they were the rising itself they were the essence and the form of upward motion they seemed to embody every human act and thought that had ascent as its motive it was a sunburst of sound breaking out of hiding and spreading open it had the freedom of release and the tension of purpose it swept space clean and left nothing but the joy of an unobstructed effort only a faint echo within the sounds spoke of that from which the music had escaped but spoke in laughing astonishment at the discovery that there was no ugliness or pain and there never had had to be it was the song of an immense deliverance she thought for just a few momentswhile this lastsit is all right to surrender completelyto forget everything and just permit yourself to feel she thought let godrop the controlsthis is it somewhere on the edge of her mind under the music she heard the sound of train wheels they knocked in an even rhythm every fourth knock accented as if stressing a conscious purpose she could relax because she heard the wheels she listened to the symphony thinking this is why the wheels have to be kept going and this is where theyre going she had never heard that symphony before but she knew that it was written by richard halley she recognized the violence and the magnificent intensity she recognized the style of the theme it was a clear complex melodyat a time when no one wrote melody any longer she sat looking up at the ceiling of the car but she did not see it and she had forgotten where she was she did not know whether she was hearing a full symphony orchestra or only the theme perhaps she was hearing the orchestration in her own mind she thought dimly that there had been premonitory echoes of this theme in all of richard halleys work through all the years of his long struggle to the day in his middleage when fame struck him suddenly and knocked him out thisshe thought listening to the symphony had been the goal of his struggle she remembered halfhinted attempts in his music phrases that promised it broken bits of melody that started but never quite reached it when richard halley wrote this he she sat up straight when did richard halley write this in the same instant she realized where she was and wondered for the first time where that music came from a few steps away at the end of the car a brakeman was adjusting the controls of the airconditioner he was blond and young he was whistling the theme of the symphony she realized that he had been whistling it for some time and that this was all she had heard she watched him incredulously for a while before she raised her voice to ask tell me please what are you whistling the boy turned to her she met a direct glance and saw an open eager smile as if he were sharing a confidence with a friend she liked his faceits lines were tight and firm it did not have that look of loose muscles evading the responsibility of a shape which she had learned to expect in peoples faces its the halley concerto he answered smiling which one the fifth she let a moment pass before she said slowly and very carefully richard halley wrote only four concertos the boys smile vanished it was as if he were jolted back to reality just as she had been a few moments ago it was as if a shutter were slammed down and what remained was a face without expression impersonal indifferent and empty yes of course he said im wrong i made a mistake then what was it something i heard somewhere what i dont know where did you hear it i dont remember she paused helplessly he was turning away from her without further interest it sounded like a halley theme she said but i know every note hes ever written and he never wrote that there was still no expression only a faint look of attentiveness on the boys face as he turned back to her and asked you like the music of richard halley yes she said i like it very much he considered her for a moment as if hesitating then he turned away she watched the expert efficiency of his movements as he went on working he worked in silence she had not slept for two nights but she could not permit herself to sleep she had too many problems to consider and not much time the train was due in new york early in the morning she needed the time yet she wished the train would go faster but it was the taggart comet the fastest train in the country she tried to think but the music remained on the edge of her mind and she kept hearing it in full chords like the implacable steps of something that could not be stopped she shook her head angrily jerked her hat off and lighted a cigarette she would not sleep she thought she could last until tomorrow night the train wheels clicked in accented rhythm she was so used to them that she did not hear them consciously but the sound became a sense of peace within her when she extinguished her cigarette she knew that she needed another one but thought that she would give herself a minute just a few minutes before she would light it she had fallen asleep and she awakened with a jolt knowing that something was wrong before she knew what it was the wheels had stopped the car stood soundless and dim in the blue glow of the night lamps she glanced at her watch there was no reason for stopping she looked out the window the train stood still in the middle of empty fields she heard someone moving in a seat across the aisle and asked how long have we been standing a mans voice answered indifferently about an hour the man looked after her sleepily astonished because she leaped to her feet and rushed to the door there was a cold wind outside and an empty stretch of land under an empty sky she heard weeds rustling in the darkness far ahead she saw the figures of men standing by the engineand above them hanging detached in the sky the red light of a signal she walked rapidly toward them past the motionless line of wheels no one paid attention to her when she approached the train crew and a few passengers stood clustered under the red light they had stopped talking they seemed to be waiting in placid indifference whats the matter she asked the engineer turned astonished her question had sounded like an order not like the amateur curiosity of a passenger she stood hands in pockets coat collar raised the wind beating her hair in strands across her face red light lady he said pointing up with his thumb how long has it been on an hour were off the main track arent we thats right why i dont know the conductor spoke up i dont think we had any business being sent off on a siding that switch wasnt working right and this things not working at all he jerked his head up at the red light i dont think the signals going to change i think its busted then what are you doing waiting for it to change in her pause of startled anger the fireman chuckled last week the crack special of the atlantic southern got left on a siding for two hoursjust somebodys mistake this is the taggart comet she said the comet has never been late shes the only one in the country that hasnt said the engineer theres always a first time said the fireman you dont know about railroads lady said a passenger theres not a signal system or a dispatcher in the country thats worth a damn she did not turn or notice him but spoke to the engineer if you know that the signal is broken what do you intend to do he did not like her tone of authority and he could not understand why she assumed it so naturally she looked like a young girl only her mouth and eyes showed that she was a woman in her thirties the dark gray eyes were direct and disturbing as if they cut through things throwing the inconsequential out of the way the face seemed faintly familiar to him but he could not recall where he had seen it lady i dont intend to stick my neck out he said he means said the fireman that our jobs to wait for orders your job is to run this train not against a red light if the light says stop we stop a red light means danger lady said the passenger were not taking any chances said the engineer whoevers responsible for it hell switch the blame to us if we move so were not moving till somebody tells us to and if nobody does somebody will turn up sooner or later how long do you propose to wait the engineer shrugged who is john galt he means said the fireman dont ask questions nobody can answer she looked at the red light and at the rail that went off into the black untouched distance she said proceed with caution to the next signal if its in order proceed to the main track then stop at the first open office yeah who says so i do who are you it was only the briefest pause a moment of astonishment at a question she had not expected but the engineer looked more closely at her face and in time with her answer he gasped good god she answered not offensively merely like a person who does not hear the question often dagny taggart well ill be said the fireman and then they all remained silent she went on in the same tone of unstressed authority proceed to the main track and hold the train for me at the first open office yes miss taggart youll have to make up time youve got the rest of the night to do it get the comet in on schedule yes miss taggart she was turning to go when the engineer asked if theres any trouble are you taking the responsibility for it miss taggart i am the conductor followed her as she walked back to her car he was saying bewildered but just a seat in a day coach miss taggart but how come but why didnt you let us know she smiled easily had no time to be formal had my own car attached to number out of chicago but got off at clevelandand number was running late so i let the car go the comet came next and i took it there was no sleepingcar space left the conductor shook his head your brotherhe wouldnt have taken a coach she laughed no he wouldnt have the men by the engine watched her walking away the young brakeman was among them he asked pointing after her who is that thatswho runs taggart transcontinental said the engineer the respect in his voice was genuine thats the vicepresident in charge of operation when the train jolted forward the blast of its whistle dying over the fields she sat by the window lighting another cigarette she thought its cracking to pieces like this all over the country you can expect it anywhere at any moment but she felt no anger or anxiety she had no time to feel this would be just one more issue to be settled along with the others she knew that the superintendent of the ohio division was no good and that he was a friend of james taggart she had not insisted on throwing him out long ago only because she had no better man to put in his place good men were so strangely hard to find but she would have to get rid of him she thought and she would give his post to owen kellogg the young engineer who was doing a brilliant job as one of the assistants to the manager of the taggart terminal in new york it was owen kellogg who ran the terminal she had watched his work for some time she had always looked for sparks of competence like a diamond prospector in an unpromising wasteland kellogg was still too young to be made superintendent of a division she had wanted to give him another year but there was no time to wait she would have to speak to him as soon as she returned the strip of earth faintly visible outside the window was running faster now blending into a gray stream through the dry phrases of calculations in her mind she noticed that she did have time to feel something it was the hard exhilarating pleasure of action with the first whistling rush of air as the comet plunged into the tunnels of the taggart terminal under the city of new york dagny taggart sat up straight she always felt it when the train went undergroundthis sense of eagerness of hope and of secret excitement it was as if normal existence were a photograph of shapeless things in badly printed colors but this was a sketch done in a few sharp strokes that made things seem clean importantand worth doing she watched the tunnels as they flowed past bare walls of concrete a net of pipes and wires a web of rails that went off into black holes where green and red lights hung as distant drops of color there was nothing else nothing to dilute it so that one could admire naked purpose and the ingenuity that had achieved it she thought of the taggart building standing above her head at this moment growing straight to the sky and she thought these are the roots of the building hollow roots twisting under the ground feeding the city when the train stopped when she got off and heard the concrete of the platform under her heels she felt light lifted impelled to action she started off walking fast as if the speed of her steps could give form to the things she felt it was a few moments before she realized that she was whistling a piece of musicand that it was the theme of halleys fifth concerto she felt someone looking at her and turned the young brakeman stood watching her tensely she sat on the arm of the big chair facing james taggarts desk her coat thrown open over a wrinkled traveling suit eddie willers sat across the room making notes once in a while his title was that of special assistant to the vicepresident in charge of operation and his main duty was to be her bodyguard against any waste of time she asked him to be present at interviews of this nature because then she never had to explain anything to him afterwards james taggart sat at his desk his head drawn into his shoulders the rio norte line is a pile of junk from one end to the other she said its much worse than i thought but were going to save it of course said james taggart some of the rail can be salvaged not much and not for long well start laying new rail in the mountain sections colorado first well get the new rail in two months oh did orren boyle say hell ive ordered the rail from rearden steel the slight choked sound from eddie willers was his suppressed desire to cheer james taggart did not answer at once dagny why dont you sit in the chair as one is supposed to he said at last his voice was petulant nobody holds business conferences this way i do she waited he asked his eyes avoiding hers did you say that you have ordered the rail from rearden yesterday evening i phoned him from cleveland but the board hasnt authorized it i havent authorized it you havent consulted me she reached over picked up the receiver of a telephone on his desk and handed it to him call rearden and cancel it she said james taggart moved back in his chair i havent said that he answered angrily i havent said that at all then it stands i havent said that either she turned eddie have them draw up the contract with rearden steel jim will sign it she took a crumpled piece of notepaper from her pocket and tossed it to eddie theres the figures and terms taggart said but the board hasnt the board hasnt anything to do with it they authorized you to buy the rail thirteen months ago where you buy it is up to you i dont think its proper to make such a decision without giving the board a chance to express an opinion and i dont see why i should be made to take the responsibility i am taking it what about the expenditure which rearden is charging less than orren boyles associated steel yes and what about orren boyle ive cancelled the contract we had the right to cancel it six months ago when did you do that yesterday but he hasnt called to have me confirm it he wont taggart sat looking down at his desk she wondered why he resented the necessity of dealing with rearden and why his resentment had such an odd evasive quality rearden steel had been the chief supplier of taggart transcontinental for ten years ever since the first rearden furnace was fired in the days when their father was president of the railroad for ten years most of their rail had come from rearden steel there were not many firms in the country who delivered what was ordered when and as ordered rearden steel was one of them if she were insane thought dagny she would conclude that her brother hated to deal with rearden because rearden did his job with superlative efficiency but she would not conclude it because she thought that such a feeling was not within the humanly possible it isnt fair said james taggart what isnt that we always give all our business to rearden it seems to me we should give somebody else a chance too rearden doesnt need us hes plenty big enough we ought to help the smaller fellows to develop otherwise were just encouraging a monopoly dont talk tripe jim why do we always have to get things from rearden because we always get them i dont like henry rearden i do but what does that matter one way or the other we need rails and hes the only one who can give them to us the human element is very important you have no sense of the human element at all were talking about saving a railroad jim yes of course of course but still you havent any sense of the human element no i havent if we give rearden such a large order for steel rails theyre not going to be steel theyre rearden metal she had always avoided personal reactions but she was forced to break her rule when she saw the expression on taggarts face she burst out laughing rearden metal was a new alloy produced by rearden after ten years of experiments he had placed it on the market recently he had received no orders and had found no customers taggart could not understand the transition from the laughter to the sudden tone of dagnys voice the voice was cold and harsh drop it jim i know everything youre going to say nobodys ever used it before nobody approves of rearden metal nobodys interested in it nobody wants it still our rails are going to be made of rearden metal but said taggart but but nobodys ever used it before he observed with satisfaction that she was silenced by anger he liked to observe emotions they were like red lanterns strung along the dark unknown of anothers personality marking vulnerable points but how one could feel a personal emotion about a metal alloy and what such an emotion indicated was incomprehensible to him so he could make no use of his discovery the consensus of the best metallurgical authorities he said seems to be highly skeptical about rearden metal contending drop it jim well whose opinion did you take i dont ask for opinions what do you go by judgment well whose judgment did you take mine but whom did you consult about it nobody then what on earth do you know about rearden metal that its the greatest thing ever put on the market why because its tougher than steel cheaper than steel and will outlast any hunk of metal in existence but who says so jim i studied engineering in college when i see things i see them what did you see reardens formula and the tests he showed me well if it were any good somebody would have used it and nobody has he saw the flash of anger and went on nervously how can you know its good how can you be sure how can you decide somebody decides such things jim who well i dont see why we have to be the first ones i dont see it at all do you want to save the rio norte line or not he did not answer if the road could afford it i would scrap every piece of rail over the whole system and replace it with rearden metal all of it needs replacing none of it will last much longer but we cant afford it we have to get out of a bad hole first do you want us to pull through or not were still the best railroad in the country the others are doing much worse then do you want us to remain in the hole i havent said that why do you always oversimplify things that way and if youre worried about money i dont see why you want to waste it on the rio norte line when the phoenixdurango has robbed us of all our business down there why spend money when we have no protection against a competitor wholl destroy our investment because the phoenixdurango is an excellent railroad but i intend to make the rio norte line better than that because im going to beat the phoenixdurango if necessaryonly it wont be necessary because there will be room for two or three railroads to make fortunes in colorado because id mortgage the system to build a branch to any district around ellis wyatt im sick of hearing about ellis wyatt he did not like the way her eyes moved to look at him and remained still looking for a moment i dont see any need for immediate action he said he sounded offended just what do you consider so alarming in the present situation of taggart transcontinental the consequences of your policies jim which policies that thirteen months experiment with associated steel for one your mexican catastrophe for another the board approved the associated steel contract he said hastily the board voted to build the san sebastian line besides i dont see why you call it a catastrophe because the mexican government is going to nationalize your line any day now thats a lie his voice was almost a scream thats nothing but vicious rumors i have it on very good inside authority that dont show that youre scared jim she said contemptuously he did not answer its no use getting panicky about it now she said all we can do is try to cushion the blow its going to be a bad blow forty million dollars is a loss from which we wont recover easily but taggart transcontinental has withstood many bad shocks in the past ill see to it that it withstands this one i refuse to consider i absolutely refuse to consider the possibility of the san sebastian line being nationalized all right dont consider it she remained silent he said defensively i dont see why youre so eager to give a chance to ellis wyatt yet you think its wrong to take part in developing an underprivileged country that never had a chance ellis wyatt is not asking anybody to give him a chance and im not in business to give chances im running a railroad thats an extremely narrow view it seems to me i dont see why we should want to help one man instead of a whole nation im not interested in helping anybody i want to make money thats an impractical attitude selfish greed for profit is a thing of the past it has been generally conceded that the interests of society as a whole must always be placed first in any business undertaking which how long do you intend to talk in order to evade the issue jim what issue the order for rearden metal he did not answer he sat studying her silently her slender body about to slump from exhaustion was held erect by the straight line of the shoulders and the shoulders were held by a conscious effort of will few people liked her face the face was too cold the eyes too intense nothing could ever lend her the charm of a soft focus the beautiful legs slanting down from the chairs arm in the center of his vision annoyed him they spoiled the rest of his estimate she remained silent he was forced to ask did you decide to order it just like that on the spur of the moment over a telephone i decided it six months ago i was waiting for hank rearden to get ready to go into production dont call him hank rearden its vulgar thats what everybody calls him dont change the subject why did you have to telephone him last night couldnt reach him sooner why didnt you wait until you got back to new york and because i had seen the rio norte line well i need time to consider it to place the matter before the board to consult the best there is no time you havent given me a chance to form an opinion i dont give a damn about your opinion i am not going to argue with you with your board or with your professors you have a choice to make and youre going to make it now just say yes or no thats a preposterous highhanded arbitrary way of yes or no thats the trouble with you you always make it yes or no things are never absolute like that nothing is absolute metal rails are whether we get them or not is she waited he did not answer well she asked are you taking the responsibility for it i am go ahead he said and added but at your own risk i wont cancel it but i wont commit myself as to what ill say to the board say anything you wish she rose to go he leaned forward across the desk reluctant to end the interview and to end it so decisively you realize of course that a lengthy procedure will be necessary to put this through he said the words sounded almost hopeful it isnt as simple as that oh sure she said ill send you a detailed report which eddie will prepare and which you wont read eddie will help you put it through the works im going to philadelphia tonight to see rearden he and i have a lot of work to do she added its as simple as that jim she had turned to go when he spoke againand what he said seemed bewilderingly irrelevant thats all right for you because youre lucky others cant do it do what other people are human theyre sensitive they cant devote their whole life to metals and engines youre luckyyouve never had any feelings youve never felt anything at all as she looked at him her dark gray eyes went slowly from astonishment to stillness then to a strange expression that resembled a look of weariness except that it seemed to reflect much more than the endurance of this one moment no jim she said quietly i guess ive never felt anything at all eddie willers followed her to her office whenever she returned he felt as if the world became clear simple easy to faceand he forgot his moments of shapeless apprehension he was the only person who found it completely natural that she should be the operating vicepresident of a great railroad even though she was a woman she had told him when he was ten years old that she would run the railroad some day it did not astonish him now just as it had not astonished him that day in a clearing of the woods when they entered her office when he saw her sit down at the desk and glance at the memos he had left for herhe felt as he did in his car when the motor caught on and the wheels could move forward he was about to leave her office when he remembered a matter he had not reported owen kellogg of the terminal division has asked me for an appointment to see you he said she looked up astonished thats funny i was going to send for him have him come up i want to see him eddie she added suddenly before i start tell them to get me ayers of the ayers music publishing company on the phone the music publishing company he repeated incredulously yes theres something i want to ask him when the voice of mr ayers courteously eager inquired of what service he could be to her she asked can you tell me whether richard halley has written a new piano concerto the fifth a fifth concerto miss taggart why no of course he hasnt are you sure quite sure miss taggart he has not written anything for eight years is he still alive why yesthat is i cant say for certain he has dropped out of public life entirelybut im sure we would have heard of it if he had died if he wrote anything would you know about it of course we would be the first to know we publish all of his work but he has stopped writing i see thank you when owen kellogg entered her office she looked at him with satisfaction she was glad to see that she had been right in her vague recollection of his appearancehis face had the same quality as that of the young brakeman on the train the face of the kind of man with whom she could deal sit down mr kellogg she said but he remained standing in front of her desk you had asked me once to let you know if i ever decided to change my employment miss taggart he said so i came to tell you that i am quitting she had expected anything but that it took her a moment before she asked quietly why for a personal reason were you dissatisfied here no have you received a better offer no what railroad are you going to im not going to any railroad miss taggart then what job are you taking i have not decided that yet she studied him feeling slightly uneasy there was no hostility in his face he looked straight at her he answered simply directly he spoke like one who has nothing to hide or to show the face was polite and empty then why should you wish to quit its a personal matter are you ill is it a question of your health no are you leaving the city no have you inherited money that permits you to retire no do you intend to continue working for a living yes but you do not wish to work for taggart transcontinental no in that case something must have happened here to cause your decision what nothing miss taggart i wish youd tell me i have a reason for wanting to know would you take my word for it miss taggart yes no person matter or event connected with my job here had any bearing upon my decision you have no specific complaint against taggart transcontinental none then i think you might reconsider when you hear what i have to offer you im sorry miss taggart i cant may i tell you what i have in mind yes if you wish would you take my word for it that i decided to offer you the post im going to offer before you asked to see me i want you to know that i will always take your word miss taggart its the post of superintendent of the ohio division its yours if you want it his face showed no reaction as if the words had no more significance for him than for a savage who had never heard of railroads i dont want it miss taggart he answered after a moment she said her voice tight write your own ticket kellogg name your price i want you to stay i can match anything any other railroad offers you i am not going to work for any other railroad i thought you loved your work this was the first sign of emotion in him just a slight widening of his eyes and an oddly quiet emphasis in his voice when he answered i do then tell me what it is that i should say in order to hold you it had been involuntary and so obviously frank that he looked at her as if it had reached him perhaps i am being unfair by coming here to tell you that im quitting miss taggart i know that you asked me to tell you because you wanted to have a chance to make me a counteroffer so if i came it looks as if im open to a deal but im not i came only because i i wanted to keep my word to you that one break in his voice was like a sudden flash that told her how much her interest and her request had meant to him and that his decision had not been an easy one to make kellogg is there nothing i can offer you she asked nothing miss taggart nothing on earth he turned to go for the first time in her life she felt helpless and beaten why she asked not addressing him he stopped he shrugged and smiledhe was alive for a moment and it was the strangest smile she had ever seen it held secret amusement and heartbreak and an infinite bitterness he answered who is john galt chapter ii the chain it began with a few lights as a train of the taggart line rolled toward philadelphia a few brilliant scattered lights appeared in the darkness they seemed purposeless in the empty plain yet too powerful to have no purpose the passengers watched them idly without interest the black shape of a structure came next barely visible against the sky then a big building close to the tracks the building was dark and the reflections of the train lights streaked across the solid glass of its walls an oncoming freight train hid the view filling the windows with a rushing smear of noise in a sudden break above the fiat cars the passengers saw distant structures under a faint reddish glow in the sky the glow moved in irregular spasms as if the structures were breathing when the freight train vanished they saw angular buildings wrapped in coils of steam the rays of a few strong lights cut straight sheafs through the coils the steam was red as the sky the thing that came next did not look like a building but like a shell of checkered glass enclosing girders cranes and trusses in a solid blinding orange spread of flame the passengers could not grasp the complexity of what seemed to be a city stretched for miles active without sign of human presence they saw towers that looked like contorted skyscrapers bridges hanging in midair and sudden wounds spurting fire from out of solid walls they saw a line of glowing cylinders moving through the night the cylinders were redhot metal an office building appeared close to the tracks the big neon sign on its roof lighted the interiors of the coaches as they went by it said rearden steel a passenger who was a professor of economics remarked to his companion of what importance is an individual in the titanic collective achievements of our industrial age another who was a journalist made a note for future use in his column hank rearden is the kind of man who sticks his name on everything he touches you may from this form your own opinion about the character of hank rearden the train was speeding on into the darkness when a red gasp shot to the sky from behind a long structure the passengers paid no attention one more heat of steel being poured was not an event they had been taught to notice it was the first heat for the first order of rearden metal to the men at the taphole of the furnace inside the mills the first break of the liquid metal into the open came as a shocking sensation of morning the narrow streak pouring through space had the pure white color of sunlight black coils of steam were boiling upward streaked with violent red fountains of sparks shot in beating spasms as from broken arteries the air seemed torn to rags reflecting a raging flame that was not there red blotches whirling and running through space as if not to be contained within a manmade structure as if about to consume the columns the girders the bridges of cranes overhead but the liquid metal had no aspect of violence it was a long white curve with the texture of satin and the friendly radiance of a smile it flowed obediently through a spout of clay with two brittle borders to restrain it it fell through twenty feet of space down into a ladle that held two hundred tons a flow of stars hung above the stream leaping out of its placid smoothness looking delicate as lace and innocent as childrens sparklers only at a closer glance could one notice that the white satin was boiling splashes flew out at times and fell to the ground below they were metal and cooling while hitting the soil they burst into flame two hundred tons of a metal which was to be harder than steel running liquid at a temperature of four thousand degrees had the power to annihilate every wall of the structure and every one of the men who worked by the stream but every inch of its course every pound of its pressure and the content of every molecule within it were controlled and made by a conscious intention that had worked upon it for ten years swinging through the darkness of the shed the red glare kept stashing the face of a man who stood in a distant corner he stood leaning against a column watching the glare cut a moments wedge across his eyes which had the color and quality of pale blue icethen across the black web of the metal column and the ashblond strands of his hair then across the belt of his trenchcoat and the pockets where he held his hands his body was tall and gaunt he had always been too tall for those around him his face was cut by prominent cheekbones and by a few sharp lines they were not the lines of age he had always had them this had made him look old at twenty and young now at fortyfive ever since he could remember he had been told that his face was ugly because it was unyielding and cruel because it was expressionless it remained expressionless now as he looked at the metal he was hank rearden the metal came rising to the top of the ladle and went running over with arrogant prodigality then the blinding white trickles turned to glowing brown and in one more instant they were black icicles of metal starting to crumble off the slag was crusting in thick brown ridges that looked like the crust of the earth as the crust grew thicker a few craters broke open with the white liquid still boiling within a man came riding through the air in the cab of a crane overhead he pulled a lever by the casual movement of one hand steel hooks came down on a chain seized the handles of the ladle lifted it smoothly like a bucket of milkand two hundred tons of metal went sailing through space toward a row of molds waiting to be filled hank rearden leaned back closing his eyes he felt the column trembling with the rumble of the crane the job was done he thought a worker saw him and grinned in understanding like a fellow accomplice in a great celebration who knew why that tall blond figure had to be present here tonight rearden smiled in answer it was the only salute he had received then he started back for his office once again a figure with an expressionless face it was late when hank rearden left his office that night to walk from his mills to his house it was a walk of some miles through empty country but he had felt like doing it without conscious reason he walked keeping one hand in his pocket his fingers closed about a bracelet it was made of rearden metal in the shape of a chain his fingers moved feeling its texture once in a while it had taken ten years to make that bracelet ten years he thought is a long time the road was dark edged with trees looking up he could see a few leaves against the stars the leaves were twisted and dry ready to fall there were distant lights in the windows of houses scattered through the countryside but the lights made the road seem lonelier he never felt loneliness except when he was happy he turned once in a while to look back at the red glow of the sky over the mills he did not think of the ten years what remained of them tonight was only a feeling which he could not name except that it was quiet and solemn the feeling was a sum and he did not have to count again the parts that had gone to make it but the parts unrecalled were there within the feeling they were the nights spent at scorching ovens in the research laboratory of the millsthe nights spent in the workshop of his home over sheets of paper which he filled with formulas then tore up in angry failurethe days when the young scientists of the small staff he had chosen to assist him waited for instructions like soldiers ready for a hopeless battle having exhausted their ingenuity still willing but silent with the unspoken sentence hanging in the air mr rearden it cant be donethe meals interrupted and abandoned at the sudden flash of a new thought a thought to be pursued at once to be tried to be tested to be worked on for months and to be discarded as another failurethe moments snatched from conferences from contracts from theduties of running the best steel mills in the country snatched almostguiltily as for a secret lovethe one thought held immovably across a span of ten years undereverything he did and everything he saw the thought held in his mindwhen he looked at the buildings of a city at the track of a railroad atthe light in the windows of a distant farmhouse at the knife in the handsof a beautiful woman cutting a piece of fruit at a banquet the thought ofa metal alloy that would do more than steel had ever done a metal thatwould be to steel what steel had been to ironthe acts of selfracking when he discarded a hope or a samplenot permitting himself to know that he was tired not giving himself timeto feel driving himself through the wringing torture of not good enough still not good enough and going on with no motor save the conviction that it could be done then the day when it was done and its result was called rearden metal these were the things that had come to white heat had melted and fused within him and their alloy was a strange quiet feeling that made him smile at the countryside in the darkness and wonder why happiness could hurt after a while he realized that he was thinking of his past as if certain days of it were spread before him demanding to be seen again he did not want to look at them he despised memories as a pointless indulgence but then he understood that he thought of them tonight in honor of that piece of metal in his pocket then he permitted himself to look he saw the day when he stood on a rocky ledge and felt a thread of sweat running from his temple down his neck he was fourteen years old and it was his first day of work in the iron mines of minnesota he was trying to learn to breathe against the scalding pain in his chest he stood cursing himself because he had made up his mind that he would not be tired after a while he went back to his task he decided that pain was not a valid reason for stopping he saw the day when he stood at the window of his office and looked at the mines he owned them as of that morning he was thirty years old what had gone on in the years between did not matter just as pain had not mattered he had worked in mines in foundries in the steel mills of the north moving toward the purpose he had chosen all he remembered of those jobs was that the men around him had never seemed to know what to do while he had always known he remembered wondering why so many iron mines were closing just as these had been about to close until he took them over he looked at the shelves of rock in the distance workers were putting up a new sign above a gate at the end of a road rearden ore he saw an evening when he sat slumped across his desk in that office it was late and his staff had left so he could lie there alone unwitnessed he was tired it was as if he had run a race against his own body and all the exhaustion of years which he had refused to acknowledge had caught him at once and flattened him against the desk top he felt nothing except the desire not to move he did not have the strength to feelnot even to suffer he had burned everything there was to burn within him he had scattered so many sparks to start so many things and he wondered whether someone could give him now the spark he needed now when he felt unable ever to rise again he asked himself who had started him and kept him going then he raised his head slowly with the greatest effort of his life he made his body rise until he was able to sit upright with only one hand pressed to the desk and a trembling arm to support him he never asked that question again he saw the day when he stood on a hill and looked at a grimy wasteland of structures that had been a steel plant it was closed and given up he had bought it the night before there was a strong wind and a gray light squeezed from among the clouds in that light he saw the brownred of rust like dead blood on the steel of the giant cranesand bright green living weeds like gorged cannibals growing over piles of broken glass at the foot of walls made of empty frames at a gate in the distance he saw the black silhouettes of men they were the unemployed from the rotting hovels of what had once been a prosperous town they stood silently looking at the glittering car he had left at the gate of the mills they wondered whether the man on the hill was the hank rearden that people were talking about and whether it was true that the mills were to be reopened the historical cycle of steelmaking in pennsylvania is obviously running down a newspaper had said and experts agree that henry reardens venture into steel is hopeless you may soon witness the sensational end of the sensational henry rearden that was ten years ago tonight the cold wind on his face felt like the wind of that day he turned to look back the red glow of the mills breathed in the sky a sight as lifegiving as a sunrise these had been his stops the stations which an express had reached and passed he remembered nothing distinct of the years between them the years were blurred like a streak of speed whatever it was he thought whatever the strain and the agony they were worth it because they had made him reach this daythis day when the first heat of the first order of rearden metal had been poured to become rails for taggart transcontinental he touched the bracelet in his pocket he had had it made from that first poured metal it was for his wife as he touched it he realized suddenly that he had thought of an abstraction called his wifenot of the woman to whom he was married he felt a stab of regret wishing he had not made the bracelet then a wave of selfreproach for the regret he shook his head this was not the time for his old doubts he felt that he could forgive anything to anyone because happiness was the greatest agent of purification he felt certain that every living being wished him well tonight he wanted to meet someone to face the first stranger to stand disarmed and open and to say look at me people he thought were as hungry for a sight of joy as he had always beenfor a moments relief from that gray load of suffering which seemed so inexplicable and unnecessary he had never been able to understand why men should be unhappy the dark road had risen imperceptibly to the top of a hill he stopped and turned the red glow was a narrow strip far to the west above it small at a distance of miles the words of a neon sign stood written on the blackness of the sky rearden steel he stood straight as if before a bench of judgment he thought that in the darkness of this night other signs were lighted over the country rearden orerearden coalrearden limestone he thought of the days behind him he wished it were possible to light a neon sign above them saying rearden life he turned sharply and walked on as the road came closer to his house he noticed that his steps were slowing down and that something was ebbing away from his mood he felt a dim reluctance to enter his home which he did not want to feel no he thought not tonight theyll understand it tonight but he did not know he had never defined what it was that he wanted them to understand he saw lights in the windows of the living room when he approached his house the house stood on a hill rising before him like a big white bulk it looked naked with a few semicolonial pillars for reluctant ornament it had the cheerless look of a nudity not worth revealing he was not certain whether his wife noticed him when he entered the living room she sat by the fireplace talking the curve of her arm floating in graceful emphasis of her words he heard a small break in her voice and thought that she had seen him but she did not look up and her sentence went on smoothly he could not be certain but its just that a man of culture is bored with the alleged wonders of purely material ingenuity she was saying he simply refuses to get excited about plumbing then she turned her head looked at rearden in the shadows across the long room and her arms spread gracefully like two swan necks by her sides why darling she said in a bright tone of amusement isnt it too early to come home wasnt there some slag to sweep or tuyeres to polish they all turned to himhis mother his brother philip and paul larkin their old friend im sorry he answered i know im late dont say youre sorry said his mother you could have telephoned he looked at her trying vaguely to remember something you promised to be here for dinner tonight oh thats right i did im sorry but today at the mills we poured he stopped he did not know what made him unable to utter the one thing he had come home to say he added only its just that i forgot thats what mother means said philip oh let him get his bearings hes not quite here yet hes still at the mills his wife said gaily do take your coat off henry paul larkin was looking at him with the devoted eyes of an inhibited dog hello paul said rearden when did you get in oh i just hopped down on the five thirtyfive from new york larkin was smiling in gratitude for the attention trouble who hasnt got trouble these days larkins smile became resigned to indicate that the remark was merely philosophical but no no special trouble this time i just thought id drop in to see you his wife laughed youve disappointed him paul she turned to rearden is it an inferiority complex or a superiority one henry do you believe that nobody can want to see you just for your own sake or do you believe that nobody can get along without your help he wanted to utter an angry denial but she was smiling at him as if this were merely a conversational joke and he had no capacity for the sort of conversations which were not supposed to be meant so he did not answer he stood looking at her wondering about the things he had never been able to understand lillian rearden was generally regarded as a beautiful woman she had a tall graceful body the kind that looked well in highwaisted gowns of the empire style which she made it a practice to wear her exquisite profile belonged to a cameo of the same period its pure proud lines and the lustrous light brown waves of her hair worn with classical simplicity suggested an austere imperial beauty but when she turned fullface people experienced a small shock of disappointment her face was not beautiful the eyes were the flaw they were vaguely pale neither quite gray nor brown lifelessly empty of expression rearden had always wondered since she seemed amused so often why there was no gaiety in her face we have met before dear she said in answer to his silent scrutiny though you dont seem to be sure of it have you had any dinner henry his mother asked there was a reproachful impatience in her voice as if his hunger were a personal insult to her yes no i wasnt hungry id better ring to have them no mother not now it doesnt matter thats the trouble ive always had with you she was not looking at him but reciting words into space its no use trying to do things for you you dont appreciate it i could never make you eat properly henry you work too hard said philip its not good for you rearden laughed i like it thats what you tell yourself its a form of neurosis you know when a man drowns himself in work its because hes trying to escape from something you ought to have a hobby oh phil for christs sake he said and regretted the irritation in his voice philip had always been in precarious health though doctors had found no specific defect in his loose gangling body he was thirtyeight but his chronic weariness made people think at times that he was older than his brother you ought to learn to have some fun said philip otherwise youll become dull and narrow singletracked you know you ought to get out of your little private shell and take a look at the world you dont want to miss life the way youre doing fighting anger rearden told himself that this was philips form of solicitude he told himself that it would be unjust to feel resentment they were all trying to show their concern for himand he wished these were not the things they had chosen for concern i had a pretty good time today phil he answered smilingand wondered why philip did not ask him what it was he wished one of them would ask him he was finding it hard to concentrate the sight of the running metal was still burned into his mind filling his consciousness leaving no room for anything else you might have apologized only i ought to know better than to expect it it was his mothers voice he turned she was looking at him with that injured look which proclaims the longbearing patience of the defenseless mrs beecham was here for dinner she said reproachfully what mrs beecham my friend mrs beecham yes i told you about her i told you many times but you never remember anything i say mrs beecham was so anxious to meet you but she had to leave after dinner she couldnt wait mrs beecham is a very busy person she wanted so much to tell you about the wonderful work were doing in our parish school and about the classes in metal craftsmanship and about the beautiful wroughtiron doorknobs that the little slum children are making all by themselves it took the whole of his sense of consideration to force himself to answer evenly im sorry if i disappointed you mother youre not sorry you couldve been here if youd made the effort but when did you ever make an effort for anybody but yourself youre not interested in any of us or in anything we do you think that if you pay the bills thats enough dont you money thats all you know and all you give us is money have you ever given us any time if this meant that she missed him he thought then it meant affection and if it meant affection then he was unjust to experience a heavy murky feeling which kept him silent lest his voice betray that the feeling was disgust you dont care her voice went halfspitting halfbegging on lillian needed you today for a very important problem but i told her it was no use waiting to discuss it with you oh mother its not important said lillian not to henry he turned to her he stood in the middle of the room with his trenchcoat still on as if he were trapped in an unreality that would not become real to him its not important at all said lillian gaily he could not tell whether her voice was apologetic or boastful its not business its purely noncommercial what is it just a party im planning to give a party oh dont look frightened its not for tomorrow night i know that youre so very busy but its for three months from now and i want it to be a very big very special affair so would you promise me to be here that night and not in minnesota or colorado or california she was looking at him in an odd manner speaking too lightly and too purposefully at once her smile overstressing an air of innocence and suggesting something like a hidden trump card three months from now he said but you know that i cant tell what urgent business might come up to call me out of town oh i know but couldnt i make a formal appointment with you way in advance just like any railroad executive automobile manufacturer or junki mean scrapdealer they say you never miss an appointment of course id let you pick the date to suit your convenience she was looking up at him her glance acquiring some special quality of feminine appeal by being sent from under her lowered forehead up toward his full height she asked a little too casually and too cautiously the date i had in mind was december tenth but would you prefer the ninth or the eleventh it makes no difference to me she said gently december tenth is our wedding anniversary henry they were all watching his face if they expected a look of guilt what they saw instead was a faint smile of amusement she could not have intended this as a trap he thought because he could escape it so easily by refusing to accept any blame for his forgetfulness and by leaving her spurned she knew that his feeling for her was her only weapon her motive he thought was a proudly indirect attempt to test his feeling and to confess her own a party was not his form of celebration but it was hers it meant nothing in his terms in hers it meant the best tribute she could offer to him and to their marriage he had to respect her intention he thought even if he did not share her standards even if he did not know whether he still cared for any tribute from her he had to let her win he thought because she had thrown herself upon his mercy he smiled an open unresentful smile in acknowledgment of her victory all right lillian he said quietly i promise to be here on the night of december tenth thank you dear her smile had a closed mysterious quality he wondered why he had a moments impression that his attitude had disappointed them all if she trusted him he thought if her feeling for him was still alive then he would match her trust he had to say it words were a lens to focus ones mind and he could not use words for anything else tonight im sorry im late lillian but today at the mills we poured the first heat of rearden metal there was a moment of silence then philip said well thats nice the others said nothing he put his hand in his pocket when he touched it the reality of the bracelet swept out everything else he felt as he had felt when the liquid metal had poured through space before him i brought you a present lillian he did not know that he stood straight and that the gesture of his arm was that of a returning crusader offering his trophy to his love when he dropped a small chain of metal into her lap lillian rearden picked it up hooked on the tips of two straight fingers and raised it to the light the links were heavy crudely made the shining metal had an odd tinge it was greenishblue whats that she asked the first thing made from the first heat of the first order of rearden metal you mean she said its fully as valuable as a piece of railroad rails he looked at her blankly she jingled the bracelet making it sparkle under the light henry its perfectly wonderful what originality i shall be the sensation of new york wearing jewelry made of the same stuff as bridge girders truck motors kitchen stoves typewriters andwhat was it you were saying about it the other day darlingsoup kettles god henry but youre conceited said philip lillian laughed hes a sentimentalist all men are but darling i do appreciate it it isnt the gift its the intention i know the intentions plain selfishness if you ask me said reardens mother another man would bring a diamond bracelet if he wanted to give his wife a present because its her pleasure hed think of not his own but henry thinks that just because hes made a new kind of tin why its got to be more precious than diamonds to everybody just because its he thats made it thats the way hes been since he was five years oldthe most conceited brat you ever sawand i knew hed grow up to be the most selfish creature on gods earth no its sweet said lillian its charming she dropped the bracelet down on the table she got up put her hands on reardens shoulders and raising herself on tiptoe kissed him on the cheek saying thank you dear he did not move did not bend his head down to her after a while he turned took off his coat and sat down by the fire apart from the others he felt nothing but an immense exhaustion he did not listen to their talk he heard dimly that lillian was arguing defending him against his mother i know him better than you do his mother was saying hank reardens not interested in man beast or weed unless its tied in some way to himself and his work thats all he cares about ive tried my best to teach him some humility ive tried all my life but ive failed he had offered his mother unlimited means to live as and where she pleased he wondered why she had insisted that she wanted to live with him his success he had thought meant something to her and if it did then it was a bond between them the only kind of bond he recognized if she wanted a place in the home of her successful son he would not deny it to her its no use hoping to make a saint out of henry mother said philip he wasnt meant to be one oh but philip youre wrong said lillian youre so wrong henry has all the makings of a saint thats the trouble what did they seek from himthought reardenwhat were they after he had never asked anything of them it was they who wished to hold him they who pressed a claim on himand the claim seemed to have the form of affection but it was a form which he found harder to endure than any sort of hatred he despised causeless affection just as he despised unearned wealth they professed to love him for some unknown reason and they ignored all the things for which he could wish to be loved he wondered what response they could hope to obtain from him in such mannerif his response was what they wanted and it was he thought else why those constant complaints those unceasing accusations about his indifference why that chronic air of suspicion as if they were waiting to be hurt he had never had a desire to hurt them but he had always felt their defensive reproachful expectation they seemed wounded by anything he said it was not a matter of his words or actions it was almost almost as if they were wounded by the mere fact of his being dont start imagining the insane he told himself severely struggling to face the riddle with the strictest of his ruthless sense of justice he could not condemn them without understanding and he could not understand did he like them no he thought he had wanted to like them which was not the same he had wanted it in the name of some unstated potentiality which he had once expected to see in any human being he felt nothing for them now nothing but the merciless zero of indifference not even the regret of a loss did he need any person as part of his life did he miss the feeling he had wanted to feel no he thought had he ever missed it yes he thought in his youth not any longer his sense of exhaustion was growing he realized that it was boredom he owed them the courtesy of hiding it he thoughtand sat motionless fighting a desire for sleep that was turning into physical pain his eyes were closing when he felt two soft moist fingers touching his hand paul larkin had pulled a chair to his side and was leaning over for a private conversation i dont care what the industry says about it hank youve got a great product in rearden metal a great product it will make a fortune like everything you touch yes said rearden it will i just i just hope you dont run into trouble what trouble oh i dont know the way things are nowadays theres people who but how can we tell anything can happen what trouble larkin sat hunched looking up with his gentle pleading eyes his short plumpish figure always seemed unprotected and incomplete as if he needed a shell to shrink into at the slightest touch his wistful eyes his lost helpless appealing smile served as substitute for the shell the smile was disarming like that of a boy who throws himself at the mercy of an incomprehensible universe he was fiftythree years old your public relations arent any too good hank he said youve always had a bad press so what youre not popular hank i havent heard any complaints from my customers thats not what i mean you ought to hire yourself a good press agent to sell you to the public what for its steel that im selling but you dont want to have the public against you public opinion you knowit can mean a lot i dont think the publics against me and i dont think that it means a damn one way or another the newspapers are against you they have time to waste i havent i dont like it hank its not good what what they write about you what do they write about me well you know the stuff that youre intractable that youre ruthless that you wont allow anyone any voice in the running of your mills that your only goal is to make steel and to make money but that is my only goal but you shouldnt say it why not what is it im supposed to say oh i dont know but your mills theyre my mills arent they yes butbut you shouldnt remind people of that too loudly you know how it is nowadays they think that your attitude is antisocial i dont give a damn what they think paul larkin sighed whats the matter paul what are you driving at nothing nothing in particular only one never knows what can happen in times like these one has to be so careful rearden chuckled youre not trying to worry about me are you its just that im your friend hank im your friend you know how much i admire you paul larkin had always been unlucky nothing he touched ever came off quite well nothing ever quite failed or succeeded he was a businessman but he could not manage to remain for long in any one line of business at the moment he was struggling with a modest plant that manufactured mining equipment he had clung to rearden for years in awed admiration he came for advice he asked for loans at times but not often the loans were modest and were always repaid though not always on time his motive in the relationship seemed to resemble the need of an anemic person who receives a kind of living transfusion from the mere sight of a savagely overabundant vitality watching larkins efforts rearden felt what he did when he watched an ant struggling under the load of a matchstick its so hard for him thought rearden and so easy for me so he gave advice attention and a tactful patient interest whenever he could im your friend hank rearden looked at him inquiringly larkin glanced away as if debating something in his mind after a while he asked cautiously how is your man in washington okay i guess you ought to be sure of it its important he looked up at rearden and repeated with a kind of stressed insistence as if discharging a painful moral duty hank its very important i suppose so in fact thats what i came here to tell you for any special reason larkin considered it and decided that the duty was discharged no he said rearden disliked the subject he knew that it was necessary to have a man to protect him from the legislature all industrialists had to employ such men but he had never given much attention to this aspect of his business he could not quite convince himself that it was necessary an inexplicable kind of distaste part fastidiousness part boredom stopped him whenever he tried to consider it trouble is paul he said thinking aloud that the men one has to pick for that job are such a crummy lot larkin looked away thats life he said damned if i see why can you tell me that whats wrong with the world larkin shrugged sadly why ask useless questions how deep is the ocean how high is the sky who is john galt rearden sat up straight no he said sharply no theres no reason to feel that way he got up his exhaustion had gone while he talked about his business he felt a sudden spurt of rebellion a need to recapture and defiantly to reassert his own view of existence that sense of it which he had held while walking home tonight and which now seemed threatened in some nameless manner he paced the room his energy returning he looked at his family they were bewildered unhappy childrenhe thoughtall of them even his mother and he was foolish to resent their ineptitude it came from their helplessness not from malice it was he who had to make himself learn to understand them since he had so much to give since they could never share his sense of joyous boundless power he glanced at them from across the room his mother and philip were engaged in some eager discussion but he noted that they were not really eager they were nervous philip sat in a low chair his stomach forward his weight on his shoulder blades as if the miserable discomfort of his position were intended to punish the onlookers whats the matter phil rearden asked approaching him you look done in ive had a hard day said philip sullenly youre not the only one who works hard said his mother others have problems tooeven if theyre not billiondollar transsupercontinental problems like yours why thats good i always thought that phil should find some interest of his own good you mean you like to see your brother sweating his health away it amuses you doesnt it i always thought it did why no mother id like to help you dont have to help you dont have to feel anything for any of us rearden had never known what his brother was doing or wished to do he had sent philip through college but philip had not been able to decide on any specific ambition there was something wrong by reardens standards with a man who did not seek any gainful employment but he would not impose his standards on philip he could afford to support his brother and never notice the expense let him take it easy rearden had thought for years let him have a chance to choose his career without the strain of struggling for a livelihood what were you doing today phil he asked patiently it wouldnt interest you it does interest me thats why im asking i had to see twenty different people all over the place from here to redding to wilmington what did you have to see them about i am trying to raise money for friends of global progress rearden had never been able to keep track of the many organizations to which philip belonged nor to get a clear idea of their activities he had heard philip talking vaguely about this one for the last six months it seemed to be devoted to some sort of free lectures on psychology folk music and cooperative farming rearden felt contempt for groups of that kind and saw no reason for a closer inquiry into their nature he remained silent philip added without being prompted we need ten thousand dollars for a vital program but its a martyrs task trying to raise money theres not a speck of social conscience left in people when i think of the kind of bloated moneybags i saw todaywhy they spend more than that on any whim but i couldnt squeeze just a hundred bucks a piece out of them which was all i asked they have no sense of moral duty no what are you laughing at he asked sharply rearden stood before him grinning it was so childishly blatant thought rearden so helplessly crude the hint and the insult offered together it would be so easy to squash philip by returning the insult he thoughtby returning an insult which would be deadly because it would be truethat he could not bring himself to utter it surely he thought the poor fool knows hes at my mercy knows hes opened himself to be hurt so i dont have to do it and my not doing it is my best answer which he wont be able to miss what sort of misery does he really live in to get himself twisted quite so badly and then rearden thought suddenly that he could break through philips chronic wretchedness for once give him a shock of pleasure the unexpected gratification of a hopeless desire he thought what do i care about the nature of his desireits his just as rearden metal was mineit must mean to him what that meant to melets see him happy just once it might teach him somethingdidnt i say that happiness is the agent of purificationim celebrating tonight so let him share in itit will be so much for him and so little for me philip he said smiling call miss ives at my office tomorrow shell have a check for you for ten thousand dollars philip stared at him blankly it was neither shock nor pleasure it was just the empty stare of eyes that looked glassy oh said philip then added well appreciate it very much there was no emotion in his voice not even the simple one of greed rearden could not understand his own feeling it was as if something leaden and empty were collapsing within him he felt both the weight and the emptiness together he knew it was disappointment but he wondered why it was so gray and ugly its very nice of you henry philip said dryly im surprised i didnt expect it of you dont you understand it phil said lillian her voice peculiarly clear and lilting henrys poured his metal today she turned to rearden shall we declare it a national holiday darling youre a good man henry said his mother and added but not often enough rearden stood looking at philip as if waiting philip looked away then raised his eyes and held reardens glance as if engaged in a scrutiny of his own you dont really care about helping the underprivileged do you philip askedand rearden heard unable to believe it that the tone of his voice was reproachful no phil i dont care about it at all i only wanted you to be happy but that money is not for me i am not collecting it for any personal motive i have no selfish interest in the matter whatever his voice was cold with a note of selfconscious virtue rearden turned away he felt a sudden loathing not because the words were hypocrisy but because they were true philip meant them by the way henry philip added do you mind if i ask you to have miss ives give me the money in cash rearden turned back to him puzzled you see friends of global progress are a very progressive group and they have always maintained that you represent the blackest element of social retrogression ha the country so it would embarrass us you know to have your name on our list of contributors because somebody might accuse us of being in the pay of hank rearden he wanted to slap philips face but an almost unendurable contempt made him close his eyes instead all right he said quietly you can have it in cash he walked away to the farthest window of the room and stood looking at the glow of the mills in the distance he heard larkins voice crying after him damn it hank you shouldnt have given it to him then lillians voice came cold and gay but youre wrong paul youre so wrong what would happen to henrys vanity if he didnt have us to throw alms to what would become of his strength if he didnt have weaker people to dominate what would he do with himself if he didnt keep us around as dependents its quite all right really im not criticizing him its just a law of human nature she took the metal bracelet and held it up letting it glitter in the lamplight a chain she said appropriate isnt it its the chain by which he holds us all in bondage chapter iii the top and the bottom the ceiling was that of a cellar so heavy and low that people stooped when crossing the room as if the weight of the vaulting rested on their shoulders the circular booths of dark red leather were built into walls of stone that looked eaten by age and dampness there were no windows only patches of blue light shooting from dents in the masonry the dead blue light proper for use in blackouts the place was entered by way of narrow steps that led down as if descending deep under the ground this was the most expensive barroom in new york and it was built on the roof of a skyscraper four men sat at a table raised sixty floors above the city they did not speak loudly as one speaks from a height in the freedom of air and space they kept their voices low as befitted a cellar conditions and circumstances jim said orren boyle conditions and circumstances absolutely beyond human control we had everything mapped to roll those rails but unforeseen developments set in which nobody could have prevented if youd only given us a chance jim disunity drawled james taggart seems to be the basic cause of all social problems my sister has a certain influence with a certain element among our stockholders their disruptive tactics cannot always be defeated you said it jim disunity thats the trouble its my absolute opinion that in our complex industrial society no business enterprise can succeed without sharing the burden of the problems of other enterprises taggart took a sip of his drink and put it down again i wish theyd fire that bartender he said for instance consider associated steel weve got the most modern plant in the country and the best organization that seems to me to be an indisputable fact because we got the industrial efficiency award of globe magazine last year so we can maintain that weve done our best and nobody can blame us but we cannot help it if the iron ore situation is a national problem we could not get the ore jim taggart said nothing he sat with his elbows spread wide on the table top the table was uncomfortably small and this made it more uncomfortable for his three companions but they did not seem to question his privilege nobody can get ore any longer said boyle natural exhaustion of the mines you know and the wearing out of equipment and shortages of materials and difficulties of transportation and other unavoidable conditions the ore industry is crumbling thats whats killing the mining equipment business said paul larkin its been proved that every business depends upon every other business said orren boyle so everybody ought to share the burdens of everybody else that is i think true said wesley mouch but nobody ever paid any attention to wesley mouch my purpose said orren boyle is the preservation of a free economy its generally conceded that free economy is now on trial unless it proves its social value and assumes its social responsibilities the people wont stand for it if it doesnt develop a public spirit its done for make no mistake about that orren boyle had appeared from nowhere five years ago and had since made the cover of every national news magazine he had started out with a hundred thousand dollars of his own and a twohundred milliondollar loan from the government now he headed an enormous concern which had swallowed many smaller companies this proved he liked to say that individual ability still had a chance to succeed in the world the only justification of private property said orren boyle is public service that is i think indubitable said wesley mouch orren boyle made a noise swallowing his liquor he was a large man with big virile gestures everything about his person was loudly full of life except the small black slits of his eyes jim he said rearden metal seems to be a colossal kind of swindle uhhuh said taggart i hear theres not a single expert whos given a favorable report on it no not one weve been improving steel rails for generations and increasing their weight now is it true that these rearden metal rails are to be lighter than the cheapest grade of steel thats right said taggart lighter but its ridiculous jim its physically impossible for your heavyduty highspeed mainline track thats right but youre just inviting disaster my sister is taggart made the stem of his glass whirl slowly between two fingers there was a moment of silence the national council of metal industries said orren boyle passed a resolution to appoint a committee to study the question of rearden metal inasmuch as its use may be an actual public hazard that is in my opinion wise said wesley mouch when everybody agrees taggarts voice suddenly went shrill when people are unanimous how does one man dare to dissent by what right thats what i want to knowby what right boyles eyes darted to taggarts face but the dim light of the room made it impossible to see faces clearly he saw only a pale bluish smear when we think of the natural resources at a time of critical shortage boyle said softly when we think of the crucial raw materials that are being wasted on an irresponsible private experiment when we think of the ore he did not finish he glanced at taggart again but taggart seemed to know that boyle was waiting and to find the silence enjoyable the public has a vital stake in natural resources jim such as iron ore the public cant remain indifferent to reckless selfish waste by an antisocial individual after all private property is a trusteeship held for the benefit of society as a whole taggart glanced at boyle and smiled the smile was pointed it seemed to say that something in his words was an answer to something in the words of boyle the liquor they serve here is swill i suppose thats the price we have to pay for not being crowded by all kinds of rabble but i do wish theyd recognize that theyre dealing with experts since i hold the purse strings i expect to get my moneys worth and at my pleasure boyle did not answer his face had become sullen listen jim he began heavily taggart smiled what im listening jim you will agree im sure that theres nothing more destructive than a monopoly yes said taggart on the one hand on the other theres the blight of unbridled competition thats true thats very true the proper course is always in my opinion in the middle so it is i think the duty of society to snip the extremes now isnt it yes said taggart it is consider the picture in the ironore business the national output seems to be falling at an ungodly rate it threatens the existence of the whole steel industry steel mills are shutting down all over the country theres only one mining company thats lucky enough not to be affected by the general conditions its output seems to be plentiful and always available on schedule but who gets the benefit of it nobody except its owner would you say that thats fair no said taggart it isnt fair most of us dont own iron mines how can we compete with a man whos got a corner on gods natural resources is it any wonder that he can always deliver steel while we have to struggle and wait and lose our customers and go out of business is it in the public interest to let one man destroy an entire industry no said taggart it isnt it seems to me that the national policy ought to be aimed at the objective of giving everybody a chance at his fair share of iron ore with a view toward the preservation of the industry as a whole dont you think so i think so boyle sighed then he said cautiously but i guess there arent many people in washington capable of understanding a progressive social policy taggart said slowly there are no not many and not easy to approach but there are i might speak to them boyle picked up his drink and swallowed it in one gulp as if he had heard all he had wanted to hear speaking of progressive policies orren said taggart you might ask yourself whether at a time of transportation shortages when so many railroads are going bankrupt and large areas are left without rail service whether it is in the public interest to tolerate wasteful duplication of services and the destructive dogeatdog competition of newcomers in territories where established companies have historical priority well now said boyle pleasantly that seems to be an interesting question to consider i might discuss it with a few friends in the national alliance of railroads friendships said taggart in the tone of an idle abstraction are more valuable than gold unexpectedly he turned to larkin dont you think so paul why yes said larkin astonished yes of course i am counting on yours huh i am counting on your many friendships they all seemed to know why larkin did not answer at once his shoulders seemed to shrink down closer to the table if everybody could pull for a common purpose then nobody would have to be hurt he cried suddenly in a tone of incongruous despair he saw taggart watching him and added pleading i wish we didnt have to hurt anybody that is an antisocial attitude drawled taggart people who are afraid to sacrifice somebody have no business talking about a common purpose but im a student of history said larkin hastily i recognize historical necessity good said taggart i cant be expected to buck the trend of the whole world can i larkin seemed to plead but the plea was not addressed to anyone can i you cant mr larkin said wesley mouch you and i are not to be blamed if we larkin jerked his head away it was almost a shudder he could not bear to look at mouch did you have a good time in mexico orren asked taggart his voice suddenly loud and casual all of them seemed to know that the purpose of their meeting was accomplished and whatever they had come here to understand was understood wonderful place mexico boyle answered cheerfully very stimulating and thoughtprovoking their food rations are something awful though i got sick but theyre working mighty hard to put their country on its feet how are things going down there pretty splendid it seems to me pretty splendid right at the moment however theyre but then what theyre aiming at is the future the peoples state of mexico has a great future theyll beat us all in a few years did you go down to the san sebastian mines the four figures at the table sat up straighter and tighter all of them had invested heavily in the stock of the san sebastian mines boyle did not answer at once so that his voice seemed unexpected and unnaturally loud when it burst forth oh sure certainly thats what i wanted to see most and and what how are things going great great they must certainly have the biggest deposits of copper on earth down inside that mountain did they seem to be busy never saw such a busy place in my life what were they busy doing well you know with the kind of spic superintendent they have down there i couldnt understand half of what he was talking about but theyre certainly busy any trouble of any kind trouble not at san sebastian its private property the last piece of it left in mexico and that does seem to make a difference orren taggart asked cautiously what about those rumors that theyre planning to nationalize the san sebastian mines slander said boyle angrily plain vicious slander i know it for certain i had dinner with the minister of culture and lunches with all the rest of the boys there ought to be a law against irresponsible gossip said taggart sullenly lets have another drink he waved irritably at a waiter there was a small bar in a dark corner of the room where an old wizened bartender stood for long stretches of time without moving when called upon he moved with contemptuous slowness his job was that of servant to mens relaxation and pleasure but his manner was that of an embittered quack ministering to some guilty disease the four men sat in silence until the waiter returned with their drinks the glasses he placed on the table were four spots of faint blue glitter in the semidarkness like four feeble jets of gas flame taggart reached for his glass and smiled suddenly lets drink to the sacrifices to historical necessity he said looking at larkin there was a moments pause in a lighted room it would have been the contest of two men holding each others eyes here they were merely looking at each others eye sockets then larkin picked up his glass its my party boys said taggart as they drank nobody found anything else to say until boyle spoke up with indifferent curiosity say jim i meant to ask you what in hells the matter with your train service down on the san sebastian line why what do you mean what is the matter with it well i dont know but running just one passenger train a day is one train is pretty measly service it seems to me and what a train you must have inherited those coaches from your greatgrandfather and he must have used them pretty hard and where on earth did you get that woodburning locomotive woodburning thats what i said woodburning i never saw one before except in photographs what museum did you drag it out of now dont act as if you didnt know it just tell me whats the gag yes of course i knew it said taggart hastily it was just you just happened to choose the one week when we had a little trouble with our motive powerour new engines are on order but theres been a slight delayyou know what a problem were having with the manufacturers of locomotivesbut its only temporary of course said boyle delays cant be helped its the strangest train i ever rode on though nearly shook my guts out within a few minutes they noticed that taggart had become silent he seemed preoccupied with a problem of his own when he rose abruptly without apology they rose too accepting it as a command larkin muttered smiling too strenuously it was a pleasure jim a pleasure thats how great projects are bornover a drink with friends social reforms are slow said taggart coldly it is advisable to be patient and cautious for the first time he turned to wesley mouch what i like about you mouch is that you dont talk too much wesley mouch was reardens washington man there was still a remnant of sunset light in the sky when taggart and boyle emerged together into the street below the transition was faintly shocking to themthe enclosed barroom led one to expect midnight darkness a tall building stood outlined against the sky sharp and straight like a raised sword in the distance beyond it there hung the calendar taggart fumbled irritably with his coat collar buttoning it against the chill of the streets he had not intended to go back to the office tonight but he had to go back he had to see his sister a difficult undertaking ahead of us jim boyle was saying a difficult undertaking with so many dangers and complications and so much at stake it all depends james taggart answered slowly on knowing the people who make it possible thats what has to be knownwho makes it possible dagny taggart was nine years old when she decided that she would run the taggart transcontinental railroad some day she stated it to herself when she stood alone between the rails looking at the two straight lines of steel that went off into the distance and met in a single point what she felt was an arrogant pleasure at the way the track cut through the woods it did not belong in the midst of ancient trees among green branches that hung down to meet green brush and the lonely spears of wild flowersbut there it was the two steel lines were brilliant in the sun and the black ties were like the rungs of a ladder which she had to climb it was not a sudden decision but only the final seal of words upon something she had known long ago in unspoken understanding as if bound by a vow it had never been necessary to take she and eddie willers had given themselves to the railroad from the first conscious days of their childhood she felt a bored indifference toward the immediate world around her toward other children and adults alike she took it as a regrettable accident to be borne patiently for a while that she happened to be imprisoned among people who were dull she had caught a glimpse of another world and she knew that it existed somewhere the world that had created trains bridges telegraph wires and signal lights winking in the night she had to wait she thought and grow up to that world she never tried to explain why she liked the railroad whatever it was that others felt she knew that this was one emotion for which they had no equivalent and no response she felt the same emotion in school in classes of mathematics the only lessons she liked she felt the excitement of solving problems the insolent delight of taking up a challenge and disposing of it without effort the eagerness to meet another harder test she felt at the same time a growing respect for the adversary for a science that was so clean so strict so luminously rational studying mathematics she felt quite simply and at once how great that men have done this and how wonderful that im so good at it it was the joy of admiration and of ones own ability growing together her feeling for the railroad was the same worship of the skill that had gone to make it of the ingenuity of someones clean reasoning mind worship with a secret smile that said she would know how to make it better some day she hung around the tracks and the roundhouses like a humble student but the humility had a touch of future pride a pride to be earned youre unbearably conceited was one of the two sentences she heard throughout her childhood even though she never spoke of her own ability the other sentence was youre selfish she asked what was meant but never received an answer she looked at the adults wondering how they could imagine that she would feel guilt from an undefined accusation she was twelve years old when she told eddie willers that she would run the railroad when they grew up she was fifteen when it occurred to her for the first time that women did not run railroads and that people might object to hell with that she thoughtand never worried about it again she went to work for taggart transcontinental at the age of sixteen her father permitted it he was amused and a little curious she started as night operator at a small country station she had to work nights for the first few years while attending a college of engineering james taggart began his career on the railroad at the same time he was twentyone he started in the department of public relations dagnys rise among the men who operated taggart transcontinental was swift and uncontested she took positions of responsibility because there was no one else to take them there were a few rare men of talent around her but they were becoming rarer every year her superiors who held the authority seemed afraid to exercise it they spent their time avoiding decisions so she told people what to do and they did it at every step of her rise she did the work long before she was granted the title it was like advancing through empty rooms nobody opposed her yet nobody approved of her progress her father seemed astonished and proud of her but he said nothing and there was sadness in his eyes when he looked at her in the office she was twentynine years old when he died there has always been a taggart to run the railroad was the last thing he said to her he looked at her with an odd glance it had the quality of a salute and of compassion together the controlling stock of taggart transcontinental was left to james taggart he was thirtyfour when he became president of the railroad dagny had expected the board of directors to elect him but she had never been able to understand why they did it so eagerly they talked about tradition the president had always been the eldest son of the taggart family they elected james taggart in the same manner as they refused to walk under a ladder to propitiate the same kind of fear they talked about his gift of making railroads popular his good press his washington ability he seemed unusually skillful at obtaining favors from the legislature dagny knew nothing about the field of washington ability or what such an ability implied but it seemed to be necessary so she dismissed it with the thought that there were many kinds of work which were offensive yet necessary such as cleaning sewers somebody had to do it and jim seemed to like it she had never aspired to the presidency the operating department was her only concern when she went out on the line old railroad men who hated jim said there will always be a taggart to run the railroad looking at her as her father had looked she was armed against jim by the conviction that he was not smart enough to harm the railroad too much and that she would always be able to correct whatever damage he caused at sixteen sitting at her operators desk watching the lighted windows of taggart trains roll past she had thought that she had entered her kind of world in the years since she learned that she hadnt the adversary she found herself forced to fight was not worth matching or beating it was not a superior ability which she would have found honor in challenging it was ineptitudea gray spread of cotton that deemed soft and shapeless that could offer no resistance to anything or anybody yet managed to be a barrier in her way she stood disarmed before the riddle of what made this possible she could find no answer it was only in the first few years that she felt herself screaming silently at times for a glimpse of human ability a single glimpse of clean hard radiant competence she had fits of tortured longing for a friend or an enemy with a mind better than her own but the longing passed she had a job to do she did not have time to feel pain not often the first step of the policy that james taggart brought to the railroad was the construction of the san sebastian line many men were responsible for it but to dagny one name stood written across that venture a name that wiped out all others wherever she saw it it stood across five years of struggle across miles of wasted track across sheets of figures that recorded the losses of taggart transcontinental like a red trickle from a wound which would not healas it stood on the ticker tape of every stock exchange left in the worldas it stood on smokestacks in the red glare of furnaces melting copperas it stood in scandalous headlinesas it stood on parchment pages recording the nobility of the centuriesas it stood on cards attached to flowers in the boudoirs of women scattered through three continents the name was francisco danconia at the age of twentythree when he inherited his fortune francisco danconia had been famous as the copper king of the world now at thirtysix he was famous as the richest man and the most spectacularly worthless playboy on earth he was the last descendant of one of the noblest families of argentina he owned cattle ranches coffee plantations and most of the copper mines of chile he owned half of south america and sundry mines scattered through the united states as small change when francisco danconia suddenly bought miles of bare mountains in mexico news leaked out that he had discovered vast deposits of copper he made no effort to sell stock in his venture the stock was begged out of his hands and he merely chose those whom he wished to favor from among the applicants his financial talent was called phenomenal no one had ever beaten him in any transactionhe added to his incredible fortune with every deal he touched and every step he made when he took the trouble to make it those who censured him most were first to seize the chance of riding on his talent toward a share of his new wealth james taggart orren boyle and their friends were among the heaviest stockholders of the project which francisco danconia had named the san sebastian mines dagny was never able to discover what influences prompted james taggart to build a railroad branch from texas into the wilderness of san sebastian it seemed likely that he did not know it himself like a field without a windbreak he seemed open to any current and the final sum was made by chance a few among the directors of taggart transcontinental objected to the project the company needed all its resources to rebuild the rio norte line it could not do both but james taggart was the roads new president it was the first year of his administration he won the peoples state of mexico was eager to cooperate and signed a contract guaranteeing for two hundred years the property right of taggart transcontinental to its railroad line in a country where no property rights existed francisco danconia had obtained the same guaranty for his mines dagny fought against the building of the san sebastian line she fought by means of whoever would listen to her but she was only an assistant in the operating department too young without authority and nobody listened she was unable then or since to understand the motives of those who decided to build the line sitting as a helpless spectator a minority member at one of the board meetings she felt a strange evasiveness in the air of the room in every speech in every argument as if the real reason of their decision were never stated but clear to everyone except herself they spoke about the future importance of the trade with mexico about a rich stream of freight about the large revenues assured to the exclusive carrier of an inexhaustible supply of copper they proved it by citing francisco danconias past achievements they did not mention any mineralogical facts about the san sebastian mines few facts were available the information which danconia had released was not very specific but they did not seem to need facts they spoke at great length about the poverty of the mexicans and their desperate need of railroads theyve never had a chance it is our duty to help an underprivileged nation to develop a country it seems to me is its neighbors keeper she sat listening and she thought of the many branch lines which taggart transcontinental had had to abandon the revenues of the great railroad had been falling slowly for many years she thought of the ominous need of repairs ominously neglected over the entire system their policy on the problem of maintenance was not a policy but a game they seemed to be playing with a piece of rubber that could be stretched a little then a little more the mexicans it seems to me are a very diligent people crushed by their primitive economy how can they become industrialized if nobody lends them a hand when considering an investment we should in my opinion take a chance on human beings rather than on purely material factors she thought of an engine that lay in a ditch beside the rio norte line because a splice bar had cracked she thought of the five days when all traffic was stopped on the rio norte line because a retaining wall had collapsed pouring tons of rock across the track since a man must think of the good of his brothers before he thinks of his own it seems to me that a nation must think of its neighbors before it thinks of itself she thought of a newcomer called ellis wyatt whom people were beginning to watch because his activity was the first trickle of a torrent of goods about to burst from the dying stretches of colorado the rio norte line was being allowed to run its way to a final collapse just when its fullest efficiency was about to be needed and used material greed isnt everything there are nonmaterial ideals to consider i confess to a feeling of shame when i think that we own a huge network of railways while the mexican people have nothing but one or two inadequate lines the old theory of economic selfsufficiency has been exploded long ago it is impossible for one country to prosper in the midst of a starving world she thought that to make taggart transcontinental what it had been once long before her time every available rail spike and dollar was neededand how desperately little of it was available they spoke also at the same session in the same speeches about the efficiency of the mexican government that held complete control of everything mexico had a great future they said and would become a dangerous competitor in a few years mexicos got discipline the men of the board kept saying with a note of envy in their voices james taggart let it be understoodin unfinished sentences and undefined hintsthat his friends in washington whom he never named wished to see a railroad line built in mexico that such a line would be of great help in matters of international diplomacy that the good will of the public opinion of the world would more than repay taggart transcontinental for its investment they voted to build the san sebastian line at a cost of thirty million dollars when dagny left the board room and walked through the clean cold air of the streets she heard two words repeated clearly insistently in the numbed emptiness of her mind get out get out get out she listened aghast the thought of leaving taggart transcontinental did not belong among the things she could hold as conceivable she felt terror not at the thought but at the question of what had made her think it she shook her head angrily she told herself that taggart transcontinental would now need her more than ever two of the directors resigned so did the vicepresident in charge of operation he was replaced by a friend of james taggart steel rail was laid across the mexican desertwhile orders were issued to reduce the speed of trains on the rio norte line because the track was shot a depot of reinforced concrete with marble columns and mirrors was built amidst the dust of an unpaved square in a mexican villagewhile a train of tank cars carrying oil went hurtling down an embankment and into a blazing junk pile because a rail had split on the rio norte line ellis wyatt did not wait for the court to decide whether the accident was an act of god as james taggart claimed he transferred the shipping of his oil to the phoenixdurango an obscure railroad which was small and struggling but struggling well this was the rocket that sent the phoenixdurango on its way from then on it grew as wyatt oil grew as factories grew in nearby valleys as a band of rails and ties grew at the rate of two miles a month across the scraggly fields of mexican corn dagny was thirtytwo years old when she told james taggart that she would resign she had run the operating department for the past three years without title credit or authority she was defeated by loathing for the hours the days the nights she had to waste circumventing the interference of jims friend who bore the title of vicepresident in charge of operation the man had no policy and any decision he made was always hers but he made it only after he had made every effort to make it impossible what she delivered to her brother was an ultimatum he gasped but dagny youre a woman a woman as operating vicepresident its unheard of the board wont consider it then im through she answered she did not think of what she would do with the rest of her life to face leaving taggart transcontinental was like waiting to have her legs amputated she thought she would let it happen then take up the load of whatever was left she never understood why the board of directors voted unanimously to make her vicepresident in charge of operation it was she who finally gave them their san sebastian line when she took over the construction had been under way for three years one third of its track was laid the cost to date was beyond the authorized total she fired jims friends and found a contractor who completed the job in one year the san sebastian line was now in operation no surge of trade had come across the border nor any trains loaded with copper a few carloads came clattering down the mountains from san sebastian at long intervals the mines said francisco danconia were still in the process of development the drain on taggart transcontinental had not stopped now she sat at the desk in her office as she had sat for many evenings trying to work out the problem of what branches could save the system and in how many years the rio norte line when rebuilt would redeem the rest as she looked at the sheets of figures announcing losses and more losses she did not think of the long senseless agony of the mexican venture she thought of a telephone call hank can you save us can you give us rail on the shortest notice and the longest credit possible a quiet steady voice had answered sure the thought was a point of support she leaned over the sheets of paper on her desk finding it suddenly easier to concentrate there was one thing at least that could be counted upon not to crumble when needed james taggart crossed the anteroom of dagnys office still holding the kind of confidence he had felt among his companions at the barroom half an hour ago when he opened her door the confidence vanished he crossed the room to her desk like a child being dragged to punishment storing the resentment for all his future years he saw a head bent over sheets of paper the light of the desk lamp glistening on strands of disheveled hair a white shirt clinging to her shoulders its loose folds suggesting the thinness of her body what is it jim what are you trying to pull on the san sebastian line she raised her head pull why what sort of schedule are we running down there and what kind of trains she laughed the sound was gay and a little weary you really ought to read the reports sent to the presidents office jim once in a while what do you mean weve been running that schedule and those trains on the san sebastian for the last three months one passenger train a day in the morning and one freight train every other night good god on an important branch like that the important branch cant pay even for those two trams but the mexican people expect real service from us im sure they do they need trains for what for to help them develop local industries how do you expect them to develop if we dont give them transportation i dont expect them to develop thats just your personal opinion i dont see what right you had to take it upon yourself to cut our schedules why the copper traffic alone will pay for everything when he looked at her his face assumed the satisfaction of a person about to utter something that has the power to hurt you dont doubt the success of those copper mines do youwhen its francisco danconia whos running them he stressed the name watching her she said he may be your friend but my friend i thought he was yours she said steadily not for the last ten years thats too bad isnt it still hes one of the smartest operators on earth hes never failed in a venturei mean a business ventureand hes sunk millions of his own money into those mines so we can rely on his judgment when will you realize that francisco danconia has turned into a worthless bum he chuckled i always thought that thats what he wasas far as his personal character is concerned but you didnt share my opinion yours was opposite oh my how opposite surely you remember our quarrels on the subject shall i quote some of the things you said about him i can only surmise as to some of the things you did do you wish to discuss francisco danconia is that what you came here for his face showed the anger of failurebecause hers showed nothing you know damn well what i came here for he snapped ive heard some incredible things about our trains in mexico what things what sort of rolling stock are you using down there the worst i could find you admit that ive stated it on paper in the reports i sent you is it true that youre using woodburning locomotives eddie found them for me in somebodys abandoned roundhouse down in louisiana he couldnt even learn the name of the railroad and thats what youre running as taggart trains yes what in hells the big idea whats going on i want to know whats going on she spoke evenly looking straight at him if you want to know i have left nothing but junk on the san sebastian line and as little of that as possible i have moved everything that could be movedswitch engines shop tools even typewriters and mirrorsout of mexico why in blazes so that the looters wont have too much to loot when they nationalize the line he leaped to his feet you wont get away with that this is one time you wont get away with it to have the nerve to pull such a low unspeakable just because of some vicious rumors when we have a contract for two hundred years and jim she said slowly theres not a car engine or ton of coal that we can spare anywhere on the system i wont permit it i absolutely wont permit such an outrageous policy toward a friendly people who need our help material greed isnt everything after all there are nonmaterial considerations even though you wouldnt understand them she pulled a pad forward and picked up a pencil all right jim how many trains do you wish me to run on the san sebastian line huh which runs do you wish me to cut and on which of our linesin order to get the diesels and the steel coaches i dont want you to cut any runs then where do i get the equipment for mexico thats for you to figure out its your job i am not able to do it you will have to decide thats your usual rotten trickswitching the responsibility to me im waiting for orders jim im not going to let you trap me like that she dropped the pencil then the san sebastian schedule will remain as it is just wait till the board meeting next month ill demand a decision once and for all on how far the operating department is to be permitted to exceed its authority youre going to have to answer for this ill answer for it she was back at her work before the door had closed on james taggart when she finished pushed the papers aside and glanced up the sky was black beyond the window and the city had become a glowing spread of lighted glass without masonry she rose reluctantly she resented the small defeat of being tired but she knew that she was tonight the outer office was dark and empty her staff had gone only eddie willers was still there at his desk in his glasspartitioned enclosure that looked like a cube of light in a comer of the large room she waved to him on her way out she did not take the elevator to the lobby of the building but to the concourse of the taggart terminal she liked to walk through it on her way home she had always felt that the concourse looked like a temple glancing up at the distant ceiling she saw dim vaults supported by giant granite columns and the tops of vast windows glazed by darkness the vaulting held the solemn peace of a cathedral spread in protection high above the rushing activity of men dominating the concourse but ignored by the travelers as a habitual sight stood a statue of nathaniel taggart the founder of the railroad dagny was the only one who remained aware of it and had never been able to take it for granted to look at that statue whenever she crossed the concourse was the only form of prayer she knew nathaniel taggart had been a penniless adventurer who had come from somewhere in new england and built a railroad across a continent in the days of the first steel rails his railroad still stood his battle to build it had dissolved into a legend because people preferred not to understand it or to believe it possible he was a man who had never accepted the creed that others had the right to stop him he set his goal and moved toward it his way as straight as one of his rails he never sought any loans bonds subsidies land grants or legislative favors from the government he obtained money from the men who owned it going from door to doorfrom the mahogany doors of bankers to the clapboard doors of lonely farmhouses he never talked about the public good he merely told people that they would make big profits on his railroad he told them why he expected the profits and he gave his reasons he had good reasons through all the generations that followed taggart transcontinental was one of the few railroads that never went bankrupt and the only one whose controlling stock remained in the hands of the founders descendants in his lifetime the name nat taggart was not famous but notorious it was repeated not in homage but in resentful curiosity and if anyone admired him it was as one admires a successful bandit yet no penny of his wealth had been obtained by force or fraud he was guilty of nothing except that he earned his own fortune and never forgot that it was his many stories were whispered about him it was said that in the wilderness of the middle west he murdered a state legislator who attempted to revoke a charter granted to him to revoke it when his rail was laid halfway across the state some legislators had planned to make a fortune on taggart stockby selling it short nat taggart was indicted for the murder but the charge could never be proved he had no trouble with legislators from then on it was said that nat taggart had staked his life on his railroad many times but once he staked more than his life desperate for funds with the construction of his line suspended he threw down three flights of stairs a distinguished gentleman who offered him a loan from the government then he pledged his wife as security for a loan from a millionaire who hated him and admired her beauty he repaid the loan on time and did not have to surrender his pledge the deal had been made with his wifes consent she was a great beauty from the noblest family of a southern state and she had been disinherited by her family because she eloped with nat taggart when he was only a ragged young adventurer dagny regretted at times that nat taggart was her ancestor what she felt for him did not belong in the category of unchosen family affections she did not want her feeling to be the thing one was supposed to owe an uncle or a grandfather she was incapable of love for any object not of her own choice and she resented anyones demand for it but had it been possible to choose an ancestor she would have chosen nat taggart in voluntary homage and with all of her gratitude nat taggarts statue was copied from an artists sketch of him the only record ever made of his appearance he had lived far into old age but one could never think of him except as he was on that sketch as a young man in her childhood his statue had been dagnys first concept of the exalted when she was sent to church or to school and heard people using that word she thought that she knew what they meant she thought of the statue the statue was of a young man with a tall gaunt body and an angular face he held his head as if he faced a challenge and found joy in his capacity to meet it all that dagny wanted of life was contained in the desire to hold her head as he did tonight she looked at the statue when she walked across the concourse it was a moments rest it was as if a burden she could not name were lightened and as if a faint current of air were touching her forehead in a corner of the concourse by the main entrance there was a small newsstand the owner a quiet courteous old man with an air of breeding had stood behind his counter for twenty years he had owned a cigarette factory once but it had gone bankrupt and he had resigned himself to the lonely obscurity of his little stand in the midst of an eternal whirlpool of strangers he had no family or friends left alive he had a hobby which was his only pleasure he gathered cigarettes from all over the world for his private collection he knew every brand made or that had ever been made dagny liked to stop at his newsstand on her way out he seemed to be part of the taggart terminal like an old watchdog too feeble to protect it but reassuring by the loyalty of his presence he liked to see her coming because it amused him to think that he alone knew the importance of the young woman in a sports coat and a slanting hat who came hurrying anonymously through the crowd she stopped tonight as usual to buy a package of cigarettes how is the collection she asked him any new specimens he smiled sadly shaking his head no miss taggart there arent any new brands made anywhere in the world even the old ones are going one after another theres only five or six kinds left selling now there used to be dozens people arent making anything new any more they will thats only temporary he glanced at her and did not answer then he said i like cigarettes miss taggart i like to think of fire held in a mans hand fire a dangerous force tamed at his fingertips i often wonder about the hours when a man sits alone watching the smoke of a cigarette thinking i wonder what great things have come from such hours when a man thinks there is a spot of fire alive in his mindand it is proper that he should have the burning point of a cigarette as his one expression do they ever think she asked involuntarily and stopped the question was her one personal torture and she did not want to discuss it the old man looked as if he had noticed the sudden stop and understood it but he did not start discussing it he said instead i dont like the thing thats happening to people miss taggart what i dont know but ive watched them here for twenty years and ive seen the change they used to rush through here and it was wonderful to watch it was the hurry of men who knew where they were going and were eager to get there now theyre hurrying because they are afraid its not a purpose that drives them its fear theyre not going anywhere theyre escaping and i dont think they know what it is that they want to escape they dont look at one another they jerk when brushed against they smile too much but its an ugly kind of smiling its not joy its pleading i dont know what it is thats happening to the world he shrugged oh well who is john galt hes just a meaningless phrase she was startled by the sharpness of her own voice and she added in apology i dont like that empty piece of slang what does it mean where did it come from nobody knows he answered slowly why do people keep saying it nobody seems able to explain just what it stands for yet they all use it as if they knew the meaning why does it disturb you he asked i dont like what they seem to mean when they say it i dont either miss taggart eddie willers ate his dinners in the employees cafeteria of the taggart terminal there was a restaurant in the building patronized by taggart executives but he did not like it the cafeteria seemed part of the railroad and he felt more at home the cafeteria lay underground it was a large room with walls of white tile that glittered in the reflections of electric lights and looked like silver brocade it had a high ceiling sparkling counters of glass and chromium a sense of space and light there was a railroad worker whom eddie willers met at times in the cafeteria eddie liked his face they had been drawn into a chance conversation once and then it became their habit to dine together whenever they happened to meet eddie had forgotten whether he had ever asked the workers name or the nature of his job he supposed that the job wasnt much because the mans clothes were rough and greasestained the man was not a person to him but only a silent presence with an enormous intensity of interest in the one thing which was the meaning of his own life in taggart transcontinental tonight coming down late eddie saw the worker at a table in a corner of the halfdeserted room eddie smiled happily waving to him and carried his tray of food to the workers table in the privacy of their corner eddie felt at ease relaxing after the long strain of the day he could talk as he did not talk anywhere else admitting things he would not confess to anyone thinking aloud looking into the attentive eyes of the worker across the table the rio norte line is our last hope said eddie willers but it will save us well have at least one branch in good condition where its needed most and that will help to save the rest its funnyisnt itto speak about a last hope for taggart transcontinental do you take it seriously if somebody tells you that a meteor is going to destroy the earth i dont either from ocean to ocean foreverthats what we heard all through our childhood she and i no they didnt say forever but thats what it meant you know im not any kind of a great man i couldnt have built that railroad if it goes i wont be able to bring it back ill have to go with it dont pay any attention to me i dont know why i should want to say things like that guess im just a little tired tonight yes i worked late she didnt ask me to stay but there was a light under her door long after all the others had gone yes shes gone home now trouble oh theres always trouble in the office but shes not worried she knows she can pull us through of course its bad were having many more accidents than you hear about we lost two diesels again last week onejust from old age the otherin a headon collision yes we have diesels on order at the united locomotive works but weve waited for them for two years i dont know whether well ever get them or not god do we need them motive power you cant imagine how important that is thats the heart of everything what are you smiling at well as i was saying its bad but at least the rio norte line is set the first shipment of rail will get to the site in a few weeks in a year well run the first train on the new track nothings going to stop us this time sure i know whos going to lay the rail mcnamara of cleveland hes the contractor who finished the san sebastian line for us there at least is one man who knows his job so were safe we can count on him there arent many good contractors left were rushed as hell but i like it ive been coming to the office an hour earlier than usual but she beats me to it shes always there first what i dont know what she does at night nothing much i guess no she never goes out with anyone she sits at home mostly and listens to music she plays records what do you care which records richard halley she loves the music of richard halley outside the railroad thats the only thing she loves chapter iv the immovable movers motive powerthought dagny looking up at the taggart building in the twilightwas its first need motive power to keep that building standing movement to keep it immovable it did not rest on piles driven into granite it rested on the engines that rolled across a continent she felt a dim touch of anxiety she was back from a trip to the plant of the united locomotive works in new jersey where she had gone to see the president of the company in person she had learned nothing neither the reason for the delays nor any indication of the date when the diesel engines would be produced the president of the company had talked to her for two hours but none of his answers had connected to any of her questions his manner had conveyed a peculiar note of condescending reproach whenever she attempted to make the conversation specific as if she were giving proof of illbreeding by breaking some unwritten code known to everyone else on her way through the plant she had seen an enormous piece of machinery left abandoned in a corner of the yard it had been a precision machine tool once long ago of a kind that could not be bought anywhere now it had not been worn out it had been rotted by neglect eaten by rust and the black drippings of a dirty oil she had turned her face away from it a sight of that nature always blinded her for an instant by the burst of too violent an anger she did not know why she could not define her own feeling she knew only that there was in her feeling a scream of protest against injustice and that it was a response to something much beyond an old piece of machinery the rest of her staff had gone when she entered the anteroom of her office but eddie willers was still there waiting for her she knew at once that something had happened by the way he looked and the way he followed her silently into her office whats the matter eddie mcnamara quit she looked at him blankly what do you mean quit left retired went out of business mcnamara our contractor yes but thats impossible i know it what happened why nobody knows taking her time deliberately she unbuttoned her coat sat down at her desk started to pull off her gloves then she said begin at the beginning eddie sit down he spoke quietly but he remained standing i talked to his chief engineer long distance the chief engineer called from cleveland to tell us thats all he said he knew nothing else what did he say that mcnamara has closed his business and gone where he doesnt know nobody knows she noticed that she was holding with one hand two empty fingers of the glove of the other the glove halfremoved and forgotten she pulled it off and dropped it on the desk eddie said hes walked out on a pile of contracts that are worth a fortune he had a waiting list of clients for the next three years she said nothing he added his voice low i wouldnt be frightened if i could understand it but a thing that cant have any possible reason she remained silent he was the best contractor in the country they looked at each other what she wanted to say was oh god eddie instead her voice even she said dont worry well find another contractor for the rio norte line it was late when she left her office outside on the sidewalk at the door of the building she paused looking at the streets she felt suddenly empty of energy of purpose of desire as if a motor had crackled and stopped a faint glow streamed from behind the buildings into the sky the reflection of thousands of unknown lights the electric breath of the city she wanted to rest to rest she thought and to find enjoyment somewhere her work was all she had or wanted but there were times like tonight when she felt that sudden peculiar emptiness which was not emptiness but silence not despair but immobility as if nothing within her were destroyed but everything stood still then she felt the wish to find a moments joy outside the wish to be held as a passive spectator by some work or sight of greatness not to make it she thought but to accept not to begin but to respond not to create but to admire i need it to let me go on she thought because joy is ones fuel she had always beenshe closed her eyes with a faint smile of amusement and painthe motive power of her own happiness for once she wanted to feel herself carried by the power of someone elses achievement as men on a dark prairie liked to see the lighted windows of a train going past her achievement the sight of power and purpose that gave them reassurance in the midst of empty miles and night so she wanted to feel it for a moment a brief greeting a single glimpse just to wave her arm and say someone is going somewhere she started walking slowly her hands in the pockets of her coat the shadow of her slanting hat brim across her face the buildings around her rose to such heights that her glance could not find the sky she thought it has taken so much to build this city it should have so much to offer above the door of a shop the black hole of a radio loudspeaker was hurling sounds at the streets they were the sounds of a symphony concert being given somewhere in the city they were a long screech without shape as of cloth and flesh being torn at random they scattered with no melody no harmony no rhythm to hold them if music was emotion and emotion came from thought then this was the scream of chaos of the irrational of the helpless of mans selfabdication she walked on she stopped at the window of a bookstore the window displayed a pyramid of slabs in brownishpurple jackets inscribed the vulture is molting the novel of our century said a placard the penetrating study of a businessmans greed a fearless revelation of mans depravity she walked past a movie theater its lights wiped out half a block leaving only a huge photograph and some letters suspended in blazing midair the photograph was of a smiling young woman looking at her face one felt the weariness of having seen it for years even while seeing it for the first time the letters said in a momentous drama giving the answer to the great problem should a woman tell she walked past the door of a night club a couple came staggering out to a taxicab the girl had blurred eyes a perspiring face an ermine cape and a beautiful evening gown that had slipped off one shoulder like a slovenly housewifes bathrobe revealing too much of her breast not in a manner of daring but in the manner of a drudges indifference her escort steered her gripping her naked arm his face did not have the expression of a man anticipating a romantic adventure but the sly look of a boy out to write obscenities on fences what had she hoped to findshe thought walking on these were the things men lived by the forms of their spirit of their culture of their enjoyment she had seen nothing else anywhere not for many years at the corner of the street where she lived she bought a newspaper and went home her apartment was two rooms on the top floor of a skyscraper the sheets of glass in the corner window of her living room made it look like the prow of a ship in motion and the lights of the city were like phosphorescent sparks on the black waves of steel and stone when she turned on a lamp long triangles of shadow cut the bare walls in a geometrical pattern of light rays broken by a few angular pieces of furniture she stood in the middle of the room alone between sky and city there was only one thing that could give her the feeling she wanted to experience tonight it was the only form of enjoyment she had found she turned to a phonograph and put on a record of the music of richard halley it was his fourth concerto the last work he had written the crash of its opening chords swept the sights of the streets away from her mind the concerto was a great cry of rebellion it was a no flung at some vast process of torture a denial of suffering a denial that held the agony of the struggle to break free the sounds were like a voice saying there is no necessity for painwhy then is the worst pain reserved for those who will not accept its necessitywe who hold the love and the secret of joy to what punishment have we been sentenced for it and by whom the sounds of torture became defiance the statement of agony became a hymn to a distant vision for whose sake anything was worth enduring even this it was the song of rebellionand of a desperate quest she sat still her eyes closed listening no one knew what had happened to richard halley or why the story of his life had been like a summary written to damn greatness by showing the price one pays for it it had been a procession of years spent in garrets and basements years that had taken the gray tinge of the walls imprisoning a man whose music overflowed with violent color it had been the gray of a struggle against long flights of unlighted tenement stairs against frozen plumbing against the price of a sandwich in an illsmelling delicatessen store against the faces of men who listened to music their eyes empty it had been a struggle without the relief of violence without the recognition of finding a conscious enemy with only a deaf wall to batter a wall of the most effective soundproofing indifference that swallowed blows chords and screamsa battle of silence for a man who could give to sounds a greater eloquence than they had ever carriedthe silence of obscurity of loneliness of the nights when some rare orchestra played one of his works and he looked at the darkness knowing that his soul went in trembling widening circles from a radio tower through the air of the city but there were no receivers tuned to hear it the music of richard halley has a quality of the heroic our age has outgrown that stuff said one critic the music of richard halley is out of key with our times it has a tone of ecstasy who cares for ecstasy nowadays said another his life had been a summary of the lives of all the men whose reward is a monument in a public park a hundred years after the time when a reward can matterexcept that richard halley did not die soon enough he lived to see the night which by the accepted laws of history he was not supposed to see he was fortythree years old and it was the opening night of phaethon an opera he had written at the age of twentyfour he had changed the ancient greek myth to his own purpose and meaning phaethon the young son of helios who stole his fathers chariot and in ambitious audacity attempted to drive the sun across the sky did not perish as he perished in the myth in halleys opera phaethon succeeded the opera had been performed then nineteen years ago and had closed after one performance to the sound of booing and catcalls that night richard halley had walked the streets of the city till dawn trying to find an answer to a question which he did not find on the night when the opera was presented again nineteen years later the last sounds of the music crashed into the sounds of the greatest ovation the opera house had ever heard the ancient walls could not contain it the sounds of cheering burst through to the lobbies to the stairs to the streets to the boy who had walked those streets nineteen years ago dagny was in the audience on the night of the ovation she was one of the few who had known the music of richard halley much earlier but she had never seen him she saw him being pushed out on the stage saw him facing the enormous spread of waving arms and cheering heads he stood without moving a tall emaciated man with graying hair he did not bow did not smile he just stood there looking at the crowd his face had the quiet earnest look of a man staring at a question the music of richard halley wrote a critic next morning belongs to mankind it is the product and the expression of the greatness of the people there is an inspiring lesson said a minister in the life of richard halley he has had a terrible struggle but what does that matter it is proper it is noble that he should have endured suffering injustice abuse at the hands of his brothersin order to enrich their lives and teach them to appreciate the beauty of great music on the day after the opening richard halley retired he gave no explanation he merely told his publishers that his career was over he sold them the rights to his works for a modest sum even though he knew that his royalties would now bring him a fortune he went away leaving no address it was eight years ago no one had seen him since dagny listened to the fourth concerto her head thrown back her eyes closed she lay halfstretched across the corner of a couch her body relaxed and still but tension stressed the shape of her mouth on her motionless face a sensual shape drawn in lines of longing after a while she opened her eyes she noticed the newspaper she had thrown down on the couch she reached for it absently to turn the vapid headlines out of sight the paper fell open she saw the photograph of a face she knew and the heading of a story she slammed the pages shut and flung them aside it was the face of francisco danconia the heading said that he had arrived in new york what of itshe thought she would not have to see him she had not seen him for years she sat looking down at the newspaper on the floor dont read it she thought dont look at it but the face she thought had not changed how could a face remain the same when everything else was gone she wished they had not caught a picture of him when he smiled that kind of smile did not belong in the pages of a newspaper it was the smile of a man who is able to see to know and to create the glory of existence it was the mocking challenging smile of a brilliant intelligence dont read it she thought not nownot to that musicoh not to that music she reached for the paper and opened it the story said that senor francisco danconia had granted an interview to the press in his suite at the waynefalkland hotel he said that he had come to new york for two important reasons a hatcheck girl at the cub club and the liverwurst at moes delicatessen on third avenue he had nothing to say about the coming divorce trial of mr and mrs gilbert vail mrs vail a lady of noble breeding and unusual loveliness had taken a shot at her distinguished young husband some months ago publicly declaring that she wished to get rid of him for the sake of her lover francisco danconia she had given to the press a detailed account of her secret romance including a description of the night of last new years eve which she had spent at danconias villa in the andes her husband had survived the shot and had sued for divorce she had countered with a suit for half of her husbands millions and with a recital of his private life which she said made hers look innocent all of that had been splashed over the newspapers for weeks but senor danconia had nothing to say about it when the reporters questioned him would he deny mrs vails story they asked i never deny anything he answered the reporters had been astonished by his sudden arrival in town they had thought that he would not wish to be there just when the worst of the scandal was about to explode on the front pages but they had been wrong francisco danconia added one more comment to the reasons for his arrival i wanted to witness the farce he said dagny let the paper slip to the floor she sat bent over her head on her arms she did not move but the strands of hair hanging down to her knees trembled in sudden jolts once in a while the great chords of halleys music went on filling the room piercing the glass of the windows streaming out over the city she was hearing the music it was her quest her cry james taggart glanced about the living room of his apartment wondering what time it was he did not feel like moving to find his watch he sat in an armchair dressed in wrinkled pajamas barefooted it was too much trouble to look for his slippers the light of the gray sky in the windows hurt his eyes still sticky with sleep he felt inside his skull the nasty heaviness which is about to become a headache he wondered angrily why he had stumbled out into the living room oh yes he remembered to look for the time he slumped sidewise over the arm of the chair and caught sight of a clock on a distant building it was twenty minutes past noon through the open door of the bedroom he heard betty pope washing her teeth in the bathroom beyond her girdle lay on the floor by the side of a chair with the rest of her clothes the girdle was a faded pink with broken strands of rubber hurry up will you he called irritably ive got to dress she did not answer she had left the door of the bathroom open he could hear the sound of gargling why do i do those thingshe thought remembering last night but it was too much trouble to look for an answer betty pope came into the living room dragging the folds of a satin negligee harlequincheckered in orange and purple she looked awful in a negligee thought taggart she was ever so much better in a riding habit in the photographs on the society pages of the newspapers she was a lanky girl all bones and loose joints that did not move smoothly she had a homely face a bad complexion and a look of impertinent condescension derived from the fact that she belonged to one of the very best families aw hell she said at nothing in particular stretching herself to limber up jim where are your nail clippers ive got to trim my toenails i dont know i have a headache do it at home you look unappetizing in the morning she said indifferently you look like a snail why dont you shut up she wandered aimlessly about the room i dont want to go home she said with no particular feeling i hate morning heres another day and nothing to do ive got a tea session on for this afternoon at liz blanes oh well it might be fun because liz is a bitch she picked up a glass and swallowed the stale remnant of a drink why dont you have them repair your airconditioner this place smells are you through in the bathroom he asked i have to dress i have an important engagement today go right in i dont mind ill share the bathroom with you i hate to be rushed while he shaved he saw her dressing in front of the open bathroom door she took a long time twisting herself into her girdle hooking garters to her stockings pulling on an ungainly expensive tweed suit the harlequin negligee picked from an advertisement in the smartest fashion magazine was like a uniform which she knew to be expected on certain occasions which she had worn dutifully for a specified purpose and then discarded the nature of their relationship had the same quality there was no passion in it no desire no actual pleasure not even a sense of shame to them the act of sex was neither joy nor sin it meant nothing they had heard that men and women were supposed to sleep together so they did jim why dont you take me to the armenian restaurant tonight she asked i love shishkebab i cant he answered angrily through the soap lather on his face ive got a busy day ahead why dont you cancel it what whatever it is it is very important my dear it is a meeting of our board of directors oh dont be stuffy about your damn railroad its boring i hate businessmen theyre dull he did not answer she glanced at him slyly and her voice acquired a livelier note when she drawled jock benson said that you have a soft snap on that railroad anyway because its your sister who runs the whole works oh he did did he i think that your sister is awful i think its disgustinga woman acting like a greasemonkey and posing around like a big executive its so unfeminine who does she think she is anyway taggart stepped out to the threshold he leaned against the doorjamb studying betty pope there was a faint smile on his face sarcastic and confident they had he thought a bond in common it might interest you to know my dear he said that im putting the skids under my sister this afternoon no she said interested really and that is why this board meeting is so important are you really going to kick her out no thats not necessary or advisable i shall merely put her in her place its the chance ive been waiting for you got something on her some scandal no no you wouldnt understand its merely that shes gone too far for once and shes going to get slapped down shes pulled an inexcusable sort of stunt without consulting anybody its a serious offense against our mexican neighbors when the board hears about it theyll pass a couple of new rulings on the operating department which will make my sister a little easier to manage youre smart jim she said id better get dressed he sounded pleased he turned back to the washbowl adding cheerfully maybe i will take you out tonight and buy you some shishkebab the telephone rang he lifted the receiver the operator announced a longdistance call from mexico city the hysterical voice that came on the wire was that of his political man in mexico i couldnt help it jim it gulped i couldnt help it we had no warning i swear to god nobody suspected nobody saw it coming ive done my best you cant blame me jim it was a bolt out of the blue the decree came out this morning just five minutes ago they sprang it on us like that without any notice the government of the peoples state of mexico has nationalized the san sebastian mines and the san sebastian railroad and therefore i can assure the gentlemen of the board that there is no occasion for panic the event of this morning is a regrettable development but i have full confidencebased on my knowledge of the inner processes shaping our foreign policy in washingtonthat our government will negotiate an equitable settlement with the government of the peoples state of mexico and that we will receive full and just compensation for our property james taggart stood at the long table addressing the board of directors his voice was precise and monotonous it connoted safety i am glad to report however that i foresaw the possibility of such a turn of events and took every precaution to protect the interests of taggart transcontinental some months ago i instructed our operating department to cut the schedule on the san sebastian line down to a single train a day and to remove from it our best motive power and rolling stock as well as every piece of equipment that could be moved the mexican government was able to seize nothing but a few wooden cars and one superannuated locomotive my decision has saved the company many millions of dollarsi shall have the exact figures computed and submit them to you i do feel however that our stockholders will be justified in expecting that those who bore the major responsibility for this venture should now bear the consequences of their negligence i would suggest therefore that we request the resignation of mr clarence eddington our economic consultant who recommended the construction of the san sebastian line and of mr jules mott our representative in mexico city the men sat around the long table listening they did not think of what they would have to do but of what they would have to say to the men they represented taggarts speech gave them what they needed orren boyle was waiting for him when taggart returned to his office once they were alone taggarts manner changed he leaned against the desk sagging his face loose and white well he asked boyle spread his hands out helplessly ive checked jim he said its straight all right danconias lost fifteen million dollars of his own money in those mines no there wasnt anything phony about that he didnt pull any sort of trick he put up his own cash and now hes lost it well whats he going to do about it thati dont know nobody does hes not going to let himself be robbed is he hes too smart for that he must have something up his sleeve i sure hope so hes outwitted some of the slickest combinations of moneygrubbers on earth is he going to be taken by a bunch of greaser politicians with a decree he must have something on them and hell get the last word and we must be sure to be in on it too thats up to you jim youre his friend friend be damned i hate his guts he pressed a button for his secretary the secretary entered uncertainly looking unhappy he was a young man no longer too young with a bloodless face and the wellbred manner of genteel poverty did you get me an appointment with francisco danconia snapped taggart no sir but god damn it i told you to call the i wasnt able to sir i have tried well try again i mean i wasnt able to obtain the appointment mr taggart why not he declined it you mean he refused to see me yes sir that is what i mean he wouldnt see me no sir he wouldnt did you speak to him in person no sir i spoke to his secretary what did he tell you just what did he say the young man hesitated and looked more unhappy what did he say he said that senior danconia said that you bore him mr taggart the proposal which they passed was known as the antidogeatdog rule when they voted for it the members of the national alliance of railroads sat in a large hall in the deepening twilight of a late autumn evening and did not look at one another the national alliance of railroads was an organization formed it was claimed to protect the welfare of the railroad industry this was to be achieved by developing methods of cooperation for a common purpose this was to be achieved by the pledge of every member to subordinate his own interests to those of the industry as a whole the interests of the industry as a whole were to be determined by a majority vote and every member was committed to abide by any decision the majority chose to make members of the same profession or of the same industry should stick together the organizers of the alliance had said we all have the same problems the same interests the same enemies we waste our energy fighting one another instead of presenting a common front to the world we can all grow and prosper together if we pool our efforts against whom is this alliance being organized a skeptic had asked the answer had been why its not against anybody but if you want to put it that way why its against shippers or supply manufacturers or anyone who might try to take advantage of us against whom is any union organized thats what i wonder about the skeptic had said when the antidogeatdog rule was offered to the vote of the full membership of the national alliance of railroads at its annual meeting it was the first mention of this rule in public but all the members had heard of it it had been discussed privately for a long tune and more insistently in the last few months the men who sat in the large hall of the meeting were the presidents of the railroads they did not like the antidogeatdog rule they had hoped it would never be brought up but when it was brought up they voted for it no railroad was mentioned by name in the speeches that preceded the voting the speeches dealt only with the public welfare it was said that while the public welfare was threatened by shortages of transportation railroads were destroying one another through vicious competition on the brutal policy of dogeatdog while there existed blighted areas where rail service had been discontinued there existed at the same time large regions where two or more railroads were competing for a traffic barely sufficient for one it was said that there were great opportunities for younger railroads in the blighted areas while it was true that such areas offered little economic incentive at present a publicspirited railroad it was said would undertake to provide transportation for the struggling inhabitants since the prime purpose of a railroad was public service not profit then it was said that large established railroad systems were essential to the public welfare and that the collapse of one of them would be a national catastrophe and that if one such system had happened to sustain a crushing loss in a publicspirited attempt to contribute to international good will it was entitled to public support to help it survive the blow no railroad was mentioned by name but when the chairman of the meeting raised his hand as a solemn signal that they were about to vote everybody looked at dan conway president of the phoenixdurango there were only five dissenters who voted against it yet when the chairman announced that the measure had passed there was no cheering no sounds of approval no movement nothing but a heavy silence to the last minute every one of them had hoped that someone would save them from it the antidogeatdog rule was described as a measure of voluntary selfregulation intended the better to enforce the laws long since passed by the countrys legislature the rule provided that the members of the national alliance of railroads were forbidden to engage in practices defined as destructive competition that in regions declared to be restricted no more than one railroad would be permitted to operate that in such regions seniority belonged to the oldest railroad now operating there and that the newcomers who had encroached unfairly upon its territory would suspend operations within nine months after being so ordered that the executive board of the national alliance of railroads was empowered to decide at its sole discretion which regions were to be restricted when the meeting adjourned the men hastened to leave there were no private discussions no friendly loitering the great hall became deserted in an unusually short time nobody spoke to or looked at dan conway in the lobby of the building james taggart met orren boyle they had made no appointment to meet but taggart saw a bulky figure outlined against a marble wall and knew who it was before he saw the face they approached each other and boyle said his smile less soothing than usual ive delivered your turn now jimmie you didnt have to come here why did you said taggart sullenly oh just for the fun of it said boyle dan conway sat alone among rows of empty seats he was still there when the charwoman came to clean the hall when she hailed him he rose obediently and shuffled to the door passing her in the aisle he fumbled in his pocket and handed her a five dollar bill silently meekly not looking at her face he did not seem to know what he was doing he acted as if he thought that he was in some place where generosity demanded that he give a tip before leaving dagny was still at her desk when the door of her office flew open and james taggart rushed in it was the first time he had ever entered in such manner his face looked feverish she had not seen him since the nationalization of the san sebastian line he had not sought to discuss it with her and she had said nothing about it she had been proved right so eloquently she had thought that comments were unnecessary a feeling which was part courtesy part mercy had stopped her from stating to him the conclusion to be drawn from the events in all reason and justice there was but one conclusion he could draw she had heard about his speech to the board of directors she had shrugged contemptuously amused if it served his purpose whatever that was to appropriate her achievements then for his own advantage if for no other reason he would leave her free to achieve from now on so you think youre the only one whos doing anything for this railroad she looked at mm bewildered his voice was shrill he stood in front of her desk tense with excitement so you think that ive ruined the company dont you he yelled and now youre the only one who can save us think i have no way to make up for the mexican loss she asked slowly what do you want i want to tell you some news do you remember the antidogeat dog proposal of the railroad alliance that i told you about months ago you didnt like the idea you didnt like it at all i remember what about it it has been passed what has been passed the antidogeatdog rule just a few minutes ago at the meeting nine months from now theres not going to be any phoenixdurango railroad in colorado a glass ashtray crashed to the floor off the desk as she leaped to her feet you rotten bastards he stood motionless he was smiling she knew that she was shaking open to him without defense and that this was the sight he enjoyed but it did not matter to her then she saw his smileand suddenly the blinding anger vanished she felt nothing she studied that smile with a cold impersonal curiosity they stood facing each other he looked as if for the first time he was not afraid of her he was gloating the event meant something to him much beyond the destruction of a competitor it was not a victory over dan conway but over her she did not know why or in what manner but she felt certain that he knew for the flash of one instant she thought that here before her in james taggart and in that which made him smile was a secret she had never suspected and it was crucially important that she learn to understand it but the thought flashed and vanished she whirled to the door of a closet and seized her coat where are you going taggarts voice had dropped it sounded disappointed and faintly worried she did not answer she rushed out of the office dan you have to fight them ill help you ill fight for you with everything ive got dan conway shook his head he sat at his desk the empty expanse of a faded blotter before him one feeble lamp lighted in a corner of the room dagny had rushed straight to the city office of the phoenixdurango conway was there and he still sat as she had found him he had smiled at her entrance and said funny i thought you would come his voice gentle lifeless they did not know each other well but they had met a few times in colorado no he said its no use do you mean because of that alliance agreement that you signed it wont hold this is plain expropriation no court will uphold it and if jim tries to hide behind the usual looters slogan of public welfare ill go on the stand and swear that taggart transcontinental cant handle the whole traffic of colorado and if any court rules against you you can appeal and keep on appealing for the next ten years yes he said i could im not sure id win but i could try and i could hang onto the railroad for a few years longer but no its not the legal points that im thinking about one way or the other its not that what then i dont want to fight it dagny she looked at him incredulously it was the one sentence which she felt sure he had never uttered before a man could not reverse himself so late in life dan conway was approaching fifty he had the square stolid stubborn face of a tough freight engineer rather than a company president the face of a fighter with a young tanned skin and graying hair he had taken over a shaky little railroad in arizona a road whose net revenue was less than that of a successful grocery store and he had built it into the best railroad of the southwest he spoke little seldom read books had never gone to college the whole sphere of human endeavors with one exception left him blankly indifferent he had no touch of that which people called culture but he knew railroads why dont you want to fight because they had the right to do it dan she asked have you lost your mind ive never gone back on my word in my life he said tonelessly i dont care what the courts decide i promised to obey the majority i have to obey did you expect the majority to do this to you no there was a kind of faint convulsion in the stolid face he spoke softly not looking at her the helpless astonishment still raw within him no i didnt expect it i heard them talking about it for over a year but i didnt believe it even when they were voting i didnt believe it what did you expect i thought they said all of us were to stand for the common good i thought what i had done down there in colorado was good good for everybody oh you damn fool dont you see that thats what youre being punished forbecause it was good he shook his head i dont understand it he said but i see no way out did you promise them to agree to destroy yourself there doesnt seem to be any choice for any of us what do you mean dagny the whole worlds in a terrible state right now i dont know whats wrong with it but somethings very wrong men have to get together and find a way out but whos to decide which way to take unless its the majority i guess thats the only fair method of deciding i dont see any other i suppose somebodys got to be sacrificed if it turned out to be me i have no right to complain the rights on their side men have to get together she made an effort to speak calmly she was trembling with anger if thats the price of getting together then ill be damned if i want to live on the same earth with any human beings if the rest of them can survive only by destroying us then why should we wish them to survive nothing can make selfimmolation proper nothing can give them the right to turn men into sacrificial animals nothing can make it moral to destroy the best one cant be punished for being good one cant be penalized for ability if that is right then wed better start slaughtering one another because there isnt any right at all in the world he did not answer he looked at her helplessly if its that kind of world how can we live in it she asked i dont know he whispered dan do you really think its right in all truth deep down do you think its right he closed his eyes no he said then he looked at her and she saw a look of torture for the first time thats what ive been sitting here trying to understand i know that i ought to think its rightbut i cant its as if my tongue wouldnt turn to say it i keep seeing every tie of the track down there every signal light every bridge every night that i spent when his head dropped down on his arms oh god its so damn unjust dan she said through her teeth fight it he raised his head his eyes were empty no he said it would be wrong im just selfish oh damn that rotten tripe you know better than that i dont know his voice was very tired ive been sitting here trying to think about it i dont know what is right any more he added i dont think i care she knew suddenly that all further words were useless and that dan conway would never be a man of action again she did not know what made her certain of it she said wondering youve never given up in the face of a battle before no i guess i havent he spoke with a quiet indifferent astonishment ive fought storms and floods and rock slides and rail fissure i knew how to do it and i liked doing it but this kind of battleits one i cant fight why i dont know who knows why the world is what it if oh who is john galt she winced then what are you going to do i dont know i mean she stopped he knew what she meant oh theres always something to do he spoke without conviction i guess its only colorado and new mexico that theyre going to declare restricted ill still have the line in arizona to run he added as it was twenty years ago well it will keep me busy im getting tired dagny i didnt take time to notice it but i guess i am she could say nothing im not going to build a line through one of their blighted areas he said in the same indifferent voice thats what they tried to hand me for a consolation prize but i think its just talk you cant build a railroad where theres nothing for hundreds of miles but a couple of farmers whore not growing enough to feed themselves you cant build a road and make it pay if you dont make it pay whos going to it doesnt make sense to me they just didnt know what they were saying oh to hell with their blighted areas its you im thinking about she had to name it what will you do with yourself i dont know well theres a lot of things i havent had time to do fishing for instance ive always liked fishing maybe ill start reading books always meant to guess ill take it easy now guess ill go fishing theres some nice places down in arizona where its peaceful and quiet and you dont have to see a human being for miles he glanced up at her and added forget it why should you worry about me its not about you its dan she said suddenly i hope you know its not for your sake that i wanted to help you fight he smiled it was a faint friendly smile i know he said its not out of pity or charity or any ugly reason like that look i intended to give you the battle of your life down there in colorado i intended to cut into your business and squeeze you to the wall and drive you out if necessary he chuckled faintly it was appreciation you would have made a pretty good try at it too he said only i didnt think it would be necessary i thought there was enough room there for both of us yes he said there was still if i found that there wasnt i would have fought you and if i could make my road better than yours id have broken you and not given a damn about what happened to you but this dan i dont think i want to look at our rio norte line now i oh god dan i dont want to be a looter he looked at her silently for a moment it was an odd look as if from a great distance he said softly you should have been born about a hundred years earlier kid then you would have had a chance to hell with that i intend to make my own chance thats what i intended at your age you succeeded have i she sat still suddenly unable to move he sat up straight and said sharply almost as if he were issuing orders youd better look at that rio norte line of yours and youd better do it fast get it ready before i move out because if you dont that will be the end of ellis wyatt and all the rest of them down there and theyre the best people left in the country you cant let that happen its all on your shoulders now it would be no use trying to explain to your brother that its going to be much tougher for you down there without me to compete with but you and i know it so go to it whatever you do you wont be a looter no looter could run a railroad in that part of the country and last at it whatever you make down there you will have earned it lice like your brother dont count anyway its up to you now she sat looking at him wondering what it was that had defeated a man of this kind she knew that it was not james taggart she saw him looking at her as if he were struggling with a question mark of his own then he smiled and she saw incredulously that the smile held sadness and pity youd better not feel sorry for me he said i think of the two of us its you who have the harder time ahead and i think youre going to get it worse than i did she had telephoned the mills and made an appointment to see hank rearden that afternoon she had just hung up the receiver and was bending over the maps of the rio norte line spread on her desk when the door opened dagny looked up startled she did not expect the door of her office to open without announcement the man who entered was a stranger he was young tall and something about him suggested violence though she could not say what it was because the first trait one grasped about him was a quality of selfcontrol that seemed almost arrogant he had dark eyes disheveled hair and his clothes were expensive but worn as if he did not care or notice what he wore ellis wyatt he said in selfintroduction she leaped to her feet involuntarily she understood why nobody had or could have stopped him in the outer office sit down mr wyatt she said smiling it wont be necessary he did not smile i dont hold long conferences slowly taking her time by conscious intention she sat down and leaned back looking at him well she asked i came to see you because i understand youre the only one whos got any brains in this rotten outfit what can i do for you you can listen to an ultimatum he spoke distinctly giving an unusual clarity to every syllable i expect taggart transcontinental nine months from now to run trains in colorado as my business requires them to be run if the snide stunt you people perpetrated on the phoenixdurango was done for the purpose of saving yourself from the necessity of effort this is to give you notice that you will not get away with it i made no demands on you when you could not give me the kind of service i needed i found someone who could now you wish to force me to deal with you you expect to dictate terms by leaving me no choice you expect me to hold my business down to the level of your incompetence this is to tell you that you have miscalculated she said slowly with effort shall i tell you what i intend to do about our service in colorado no i have no interest in discussions and intentions i expect transportation what you do to furnish it and how you do it is your problem not mine i am merely giving you a warning those who wish to deal with me must do so on my terms or not at all i do not make terms with incompetence if you expect to earn money by carrying the oil i produce you must be as good at your business as i am at mine i wish this to be understood she said quietly i understand i shant waste time proving to you why youd better take my ultimatum seriously if you have the intelligence to keep this corrupt organization functioning at all you have the intelligence to judge this for yourself we both know that if taggart transcontinental runs trains in colorado the way it did five years ago it will ruin me i know that that is what you people intend to do you expect to feed off me while you can and to find another carcass to pick dry after you have finished mine that is the policy of most of mankind today so here is my ultimatum it is now in your power to destroy me i may have to go but if i go ill make sure that i take all the rest of you along with me somewhere within her under the numbness that held her still to receive the lashing she felt a small point of pain hot like the pain of scalding she wanted to tell him of the years she had spent looking for men such as he to work with she wanted to tell him that his enemies were hers that she was fighting the same battle she wanted to cry to him im not one of them but she knew that she could not do it she bore the responsibility for taggart transcontinental and for everything done in its name she had no right to justify herself now sitting straight her glance as steady and open as his she answered evenly you will get the transportation you need mr wyatt she saw a faint hint of astonishment in his face this was not the manner or the answer he had expected perhaps it was what she had not said that astonished him most that she offered no defense no excuses he took a moment to study her silently then he said his voice less sharp all right thank you good day she inclined her head he bowed and left the office thats the story hank i had worked out an almost impossible schedule to complete the rio norte line in twelve months now ill have to do it in nine you were to give us the rail over a period of one year can you give it to us within nine months if theres any human way to do it do it if not ill have to find some other means to finish it rearden sat behind his desk his cold blue eyes made two horizontal cuts across the gaunt planes of his face they remained horizontal impassively halfclosed he said evenly without emphasis ill do it dagny leaned back in her chair the short sentence was a shock it was not merely relief it was the sudden realization that nothing else was necessary to guarantee that it would be done she needed no proofs no questions no explanations a complex problem could rest safely on three syllables pronounced by a man who knew what he was saying dont show that youre relieved his voice was mocking not too obviously his narrowed eyes were watching her with an unrevealing smile i might think that i hold taggart transcontinental in my power you know that anyway i do and i intend to make you pay for it i expect to how much twenty dollars extra per ton on the balance of the order delivered after today pretty steep hank is that the best price you can give me no but thats the one im going to get i could ask twice that and youd pay it yes i would and you could but you wont why wont i because you need to have the rio norte line built its your first showcase for rearden metal he chuckled thats right i like to deal with somebody who has no illusions about getting favors do you know what made me feel relieved when you decided to take advantage of it what that i was dealing for once with somebody who doesnt pretend to give favors his smile had a discernible quality now it was enjoyment you always play it open dont you he asked ive never noticed you doing otherwise i thought i was the only one who could afford to im not broke in that sense hank i think im going to break you some dayin that sense why ive always wanted to dont you have enough cowards around you thats why id enjoy trying itbecause youre the only exception so you think its right that i should squeeze every penny of profit i can out of your emergency certainly im not a fool i dont think youre in business for my convenience dont you wish i were im not a moocher hank arent you going to find it hard to pay thats my problem not yours i want that rail at twenty dollars extra per ton okay hank fine youll get the rail i may get my exorbitant profitor taggart transcontinental may crash before i collect it she said without smiling if i dont get that line built in nine months taggart transcontinental will crash it wont so long as you run it when he did not smile his face looked inanimate only his eyes remained alive active with a cold brilliant clarity of perception but what he was made to feel by the things he perceived no one would be permitted to know she thought perhaps not even himself theyve done their best to make it harder for you havent they he said yes i was counting on colorado to save the taggart system now its up to me to save colorado nine months from now dan conway will close his road if mine isnt ready it wont be any use finishing it you cant leave those men without transportation for a single day let alone a week or a month at the rate theyve been growing you cant stop them dead and then expect them to continue its like slamming brakes on an engine going two hundred miles an hour i know i can run a good railroad i cant run it across a continent of sharecroppers whore not good enough to grow turnips successfully ive got to have men like ellis wyatt to produce something to fill the trains i run so ive got to give him a train and a track nine months from now if i have to blast all the rest of us into hell to do it he smiled amused you feel very strongly about it dont you dont you he would not answer but merely held the smile arent you concerned about it she asked almost angrily no then you dont realize what it means i realize that im going to get the rail rolled and youre going to get the track laid in nine months she smiled relaxing wearily and a little guiltily yes i know we will i know its uselessgetting angry at people like jim and his friends we havent any time for it first i have to undo what theyve done then afterwardsshe stopped wondering shook her head and shruggedafterwards they wont matter thats right they wont when i heard about that antidogeatdog business it made me sick but dont worry about the goddamn bastards the two words sounded shockingly violent because his face and voice remained calm you and i will always be there to save the country from the consequences of their actions he got up he said pacing the office colorado isnt going to be stopped youll pull it through then dan conway will be back and others all that lunacy is temporary t cant last its demented so it has to defeat itself you and i will just have to work a little harder for a while thats all she watched his tall figure moving across the office the office suited him it contained nothing but the few pieces of furniture he needed all of them harshly simplified down to their essential purpose all of them exorbitantly expensive in the quality of materials and the skill of design the room looked like a motora motor held within the glass case of broad windows but she noticed one astonishing detail a vase of jade that stood on top of a filing cabinet the vase was a solid dark green stone carved into plain surfaces the texture of its smooth curves provoked an irresistible desire to touch it it seemed startling in that office incongruous with the sternness of the rest it was a touch of sensuality colorado is a great place he said its going to be the greatest in the country youre not sure that im concerned about it that states becoming one of my best customers as you ought to know if you take time to read the reports on your freight traffic i know i read them ive been thinking of building a plant there in a few years to save them your transportation charges he glanced at her youll lose an awful lot of steel freight if i do go ahead ill be satisfied with carrying your supplies and the groceries for your workers and the freight of the factories that will follow you thereand perhaps i wont have time to notice that ive lost your steel what are you laughing at its wonderful what the way you dont react as everybody else does nowadays still i must admit that for the time being youre the most important single shipper of taggart transcontinental dont you suppose i know it so i cant understand why jim she stopped tries his best to harm my business because your brother jim is a fool he is but its more than that theres something worse than stupidity about it dont waste time trying to figure him out let him spit hes no danger to anyone people like jim taggart just clutter up the world i suppose so incidentally what would you have done if id said i couldnt deliver your rails sooner i would have torn up sidings or closed some branch line any branch line and i would have used the rail to finish the rio norte track on time he chuckled thats why im not worried about taggart transcontinental but you wont have to start getting rail out of old sidings not so long as im in business she thought suddenly that she was wrong about his lack of emotion the hidden undertone of his manner was enjoyment she realized that she had always felt a sense of lighthearted relaxation in his presence and known that he shared it he was the only man she knew to whom she could speak without strain or effort this she thought was a mind she respected an adversary worth matching yet there had always been an odd sense of distance between them the sense of a closed door there was an impersonal quality in his manner something within him that could not be reached he had stopped at the window he stood for a moment looking out do you know that the first load of rail is being delivered to you today he asked of course i know it come here she approached him he pointed silently far in the distance beyond the mill structures she saw a string of gondolas waiting on a siding the bridge of an overhead crane cut the sky above them the crane was moving its huge magnet held a load of rails glued to a disk by the sole power of contact there was no trace of sun in the gray spread of clouds yet the rails glistened as if the metal caught light out of space the metal was a greenishblue the great chain stopped over a car descended jerked in a brief spasm and left the rails in the car the crane moved back in majestic indifference it looked like the giant drawing of a geometrical theorem moving above the men and the earth they stood at the window watching silently intently she did not speak until another load of greenblue metal came moving across the sky then the first words she said were not about rail track or an order completed on time she said as if greeting a new phenomenon of nature rearden metal he noticed that but said nothing he glanced at her then turned back to the window hank this is great yes he said it simply openly there was no flattered pleasure in his voice and no modesty this she knew was a tribute to her the rarest one person could pay another the tribute of feeling free to acknowledge ones own greatness knowing that it is understood she said when i think of what that metal can do what it will make possible hank this is the most important thing happening in the world today and none of them know it we know it they did not look at each other they stood watching the crane on the front of the locomotive in the distance she could distinguish the letters tt she could distinguish the rails of the busiest industrial siding of the taggart system as soon as i can find a plant able to do it she said im going to order diesels made of rearden metal youll need them how fast do you run your trains on the rio norte track now were lucky if we manage to make twenty miles an hour he pointed at the cars when that rail is laid youll be able to run trains at two hundred and fifty if you wish i will in a few years when well have cars of rearden metal which will be half the weight of steel and twice as safe youll have to look out for the air lines were working on a plane of rearden metal it will weigh practically nothing and lift anything youll see the day of longhaul heavyfreight air traffic ive been thinking of what that metal will do for motors any motors and what sort of thing one can design now have you thought of what it will do for chicken wire just plain chickenwire fences made of rearden metal that will cost a few pennies a mile and last two hundred years and kitchenware that will be bought at the dime store and passed on from generation to generation and ocean liners that one wont be able to dent with a torpedo did i tell you that im having tests made of communications wire of rearden metal im making so many tests that ill never get through showing people what can be done with it and how to do it they spoke of the metal and of the possibilities which they could not exhaust it was as if they were standing on a mountain top seeing a limitless plain below and roads open in all directions but they merely spoke of mathematical figures of weights pressures resistances costs she had forgotten her brother and his national alliance she had forgotten every problem person and event behind her they had always been clouded in her sight to be hurried past to be brushed aside never final never quite real this was reality she thought this sense of clear outlines of purpose of lightness of hope this was the way she had expected to liveshe had wanted to spend no hour and take no action that would mean less than this she looked at him in the exact moment when he turned to look at her they stood very close to each other she saw in his eyes that he felt as she did if joy is the aim and the core of existence she thought and if that which has the power to give one joy is always guarded as ones deepest secret then they had seen each other naked in that moment he made a step back and said in a strange tone of dispassionate wonder were a couple of blackguards arent we why we havent any spiritual goals or qualities all were after is material things thats all we care for she looked at him unable to understand but he was looking past her straight ahead at the crane in the distance she wished he had not said it the accusation did not trouble her she never thought of herself in such terms and she was completely incapable of experiencing a feeling of fundamental guilt but she felt a vague apprehension which she could not define the suggestion that there was something of grave consequence in whatever had made him say it something dangerous to him he had not said it casually but there had been no feeling in his voice neither plea nor shame he had said it indifferently as a statement of fact then as she watched him the apprehension vanished he was looking at his mills beyond the window there was no guilt in his face no doubt nothing but the calm of an inviolate selfconfidence dagny he said whatever we are its we who move the world and its we wholl pull it through chapter v the climax of the danconias the newspaper was the first thing she noticed it was clutched tightly in eddies hand as he entered her office she glanced up at his face it was tense and bewildered dagny are you very busy why i know that you dont like to talk about him but theres something here i think you ought to see she extended her hand silently for the newspaper the story on the front page announced that upon taking over the san sebastian mines the government of the peoples state of mexico had discovered that they were worthlessblatantly totally hopelessly worthless there was nothing to justify the five years of work and the millions spent nothing but empty excavations laboriously cut the few traces of copper were not worth the effort of extracting them no great deposits of metal existed or could be expected to exist there and there were no indications that could have permitted anyone to be deluded the government of the peoples state of mexico was holding emergency sessions about their discovery in an uproar of indignation they felt that they had been cheated watching her eddie knew that dagny sat looking at the newspaper long after she had finished reading he knew that he had been right to feel a hint of fear even though he could not tell what frightened him about that story he waited she raised her head she did not look at him her eyes were fixed intent in concentration as if trying to discern something at a great distance he said his voice low francisco is not a fool whatever else he may be no matter what depravity hes sunk toand ive given up trying to figure out whyhe is not a fool he couldnt have made a mistake of this kind it is not possible i dont understand it im beginning to she sat up jolted upright by a sudden movement that ran through her body like a shudder she said phone him at the waynefalkland and tell the bastard that i want to see him dagny he said sadly reproachfully its frisco danconia it was she walked through the early twilight of the city streets to the waynefalkland hotel he says any time you wish eddie had told her the first lights appeared in a few windows high under the clouds the skyscrapers looked like abandoned lighthouses sending feeble dying signals out into an empty sea where no ships moved any longer a few snowflakes came down past the dark windows of empty stores to melt in the mud of the sidewalks a string of red lanterns cut the street going off into the murky distance she wondered why she felt that she wanted to run that she should be running no not down this street down a green hillside in the blazing sun to the road on the edge of the hudson at the foot of the taggart estate that was the way she always ran when eddie yelled its frisco danconia and they both flew down the hill to the car approaching on the road below he was the only guest whose arrival was an event in their childhood their biggest event the running to meet him had become part of a contest among the three of them there was a birch tree on the hillside halfway between the road and the house dagny and eddie tried to get past the tree before francisco could race up the hill to meet them on all the many days of his arrivals in all the many summers they never reached the birch tree francisco reached it first and stopped them when he was way past it francisco always won as he always won everything his parents were old friends of the taggart family he was an only son and he was being brought up all over the world his father it was said wanted him to consider the world as his future domain dagny and eddie could never be certain of where he would spend his winter but once a year every summer a stern south american tutor brought him for a month to the taggart estate francisco found it natural that the taggart children should be chosen as his companions they were the crown heirs of taggart transcontinental as he was of danconia copper we are the only aristocracy left in the worldthe aristocracy of money he said to dagny once when he was fourteen its the only real aristocracy if people understood what it means which they dont he had a caste system of his own to him the taggart children were not jim and dagny but dagny and eddie he seldom volunteered to notice jims existence eddie asked him once francisco youre some kind of very high nobility arent you he answered not yet the reason my family has lasted for such a long lime is that none of us has ever been permitted to think he is born a danconia we are expected to become one he pronounced his name as if he wished his listeners to be struck in the face and knighted by the sound of it sebastian danconia his ancestor had left spain many centuries ago at a time when spain was the most powerful country on earth and his was one of spains proudest figures he left because the lord of the inquisition did not approve of his manner of thinking and suggested at a court banquet that he change it sebastian danconia threw the contents of his wine glass at the face of the lord of the inquisition and escaped before he could be seized he left behind him his fortune his estate his marble palace and the girl he lovedand he sailed to a new world his first estate in argentina was a wooden shack in the foothills of the andes the sun blazed like a beacon on the silver coatofarms of the danconias nailed over the door of the shack while sebastian danconia dug for the copper of his first mine he spent years pickax in hand breaking rock from sunrise till darkness with the help of a few stray derelicts deserters from the armies of his countrymen escaped convicts starving indians fifteen years after he left spain sebastian danconia sent for the girl he loved she had waited for him when she arrived she found the silver coatofarms above the entrance of a marble palace the gardens of a great estate and mountains slashed by pits of red ore in the distance he carried her in his arms across the threshold of his home he looked younger than when she had seen him last my ancestor and yours francisco told dagny would have liked each other through the years of her childhood dagny lived in the futurein the world she expected to find where she would not have to feel contempt or boredom but for one month each year she was free for one month she could live in the present when she raced down the hill to meet francisco danconia it was a release from prison hi slug hi frisco they had both resented the nicknames at first she had asked him angrily what do you think you mean he had answered in case you dont know it slug means a great fire in a locomotive firebox where did you pick that up from the gentlemen along the taggart iron he spoke five languages and he spoke english without a trace of accent a precise cultured english deliberately mixed with slang she had retaliated by calling him frisco he had laughed amused and annoyed if you barbarians had to degrade the name of a great city of yours you could at least refrain from doing it to me but they had grown to like the nicknames it had started in the days of their second summer together when he was twelve years old and she was ten that summer francisco began vanishing every morning for some purpose nobody could discover he went off on his bicycle before dawn and returned in time to appear at the white and crystal table set for lunch on the terrace his manner courteously punctual and a little too innocent he laughed refusing to answer when dagny and eddie questioned him they tried to follow him once through the cold premorning darkness but they gave it up no one could track him when he did not want to be tracked after a while mrs taggart began to worry and decided to investigate she never learned how he had managed to bypass all the childlabor laws but she found francisco workingby an unofficial deal with the dispatcheras a call boy for taggart transcontinental at a division point ten miles away the dispatcher was stupefied by her personal visit he had no idea that his call boy was a house guest of the taggarts the boy was known to the local railroad crews as frankie and mrs taggart preferred not to enlighten them about his full name she merely explained that he was working without his parents permission and had to quit at once the dispatcher was sorry to lose him frankie he said was the best call boy they had ever had id sure like to keep him on maybe we could make a deal with his parents he suggested im afraid not said mrs taggart faintly francisco she asked when she brought him home what would your father say about this if he knew my father would ask whether i was good at the job or not thats all hed want to know come now im serious francisco was looking at her politely his courteous manner suggesting centuries of breeding and drawing rooms but something in his eyes made her feel uncertain about the politeness last winter he answered i shipped out as cabin boy on a cargo steamer that carried danconia copper my father looked for me for three months but thats all he asked me when i came back so thats how you spend your winters said jim taggart jims smile had a touch of triumph the triumph of finding cause to feel contempt that was last winter francisco answered pleasantly with no change in the innocent casual tone of his voice the winter before last i spent in madrid at the home of the duke of alba why did you want to work on a railroad asked dagny they stood looking at each other hers was a glance of admiration his of mockery but it was not the mockery of maliceit was the laughter of a salute to learn what its like slug he answered and to tell you that ive had a job with taggart transcontinental before you did dagny and eddie spent their winters trying to master some new skill in order to astonish francisco and beat him for once they never succeeded when they showed him how to hit a ball with a bat a game he had never played before he watched them for a few minutes then said i think i get the idea let me try he took the bat and sent the ball flying over a line of oak trees far at the end of the field when jim was given a motorboat for his birthday they all stood on the river landing watching the lesson while an instructor showed jim how to run it none of them had ever driven a motorboat before the sparkling white craft shaped like a bullet kept staggering clumsily across the water its wake a long record of shivering its motor choking with hiccoughs while the instructor seated beside him kept seizing the wheel out of jims hands for no apparent reason jim raised his head suddenly and yelled at francisco do you think you can do it any better i can do it try it when the boat came back and its two occupants stepped out francisco slipped behind the wheel wait a moment he said to the instructor who remained on the landing let me take a look at this then before the instructor had time to move the boat shot out to the middle of the river as if fired from a gun it was streaking away before they grasped what they were seeing as it went shrinking into the distance and sunlight dagnys picture of it was three straight lines its wake the long shriek of its motor and the aim of the driver at its wheel she noticed the strange expression of her fathers face as he looked at the vanishing speedboat he said nothing he just stood looking she remembered that she had seen him look that way once before it was when he inspected a complex system of pulleys which francisco aged twelve had erected to make an elevator to the top of a rock he was teaching dagny and eddie to dive from the rock into the hudson franciscos notes of calculation were still scattered about on the ground her father picked them up looked at them then asked francisco how many years of algebra have you had two years who taught you to do this oh thats just something i figured out she did not know that what her father held on the crumpled sheets of paper was the crude version of a differential equation the heirs of sebastian danconia had been an unbroken line of first sons who knew how to bear his name it was a tradition of the family that the man to disgrace them would be the heir who died leaving the danconia fortune no greater than he had received it throughout the generations that disgrace had not come an argentinian legend said that the hand of a danconia had the miraculous power of the saintsonly it was not the power to heal but the power to produce the danconia heirs had been men of unusual ability but none of them could match what francisco danconia promised to become it was as if the centuries had sifted the familys qualities through a fine mesh had discarded the irrelevant the inconsequential the weak and had let nothing through except pure talent as if chance for once had achieved an entity devoid of the accidental francisco could do anything he undertook he could do it better than anyone else and he did it without effort there was no boasting in his manner and consciousness no thought of comparison his attitude was not i can do it better than you but simply i can do it what he meant by doing was doing superlatively no matter what discipline was required of him by his fathers exacting plan for his education no matter what subject he was ordered to study francisco mastered it with effortless amusement his father adored him but concealed it carefully as he concealed the pride of knowing that he was bringing up the most brilliant phenomenon of a brilliant family line francisco it was said was to be the climax of the danconias i dont know what sort of motto the danconias have on their family crest mrs taggart said once but im sure that francisco will change it to what for it was the first question he asked about any activity proposed to himand nothing would make him act if he found no valid answer he flew through the days of his summer month like a rocket but if one stopped him in midflight he could always name the purpose of his every random moment two things were impossible to him to stand still or to move aimlessly lets find out was the motive he gave to dagny and eddie for anything he undertook or lets make it these were his only forms of enjoyment i can do it he said when he was building his elevator clinging to the side of a cliff driving metal wedges into rock his arms moving with an experts rhythm drops of blood slipping unnoticed from under a bandage on his wrist no we cant take turns eddie youre not big enough yet to handle a hammer just cart the weeds off and keep the way clear for me ill do the rest what blood oh thats nothing just a cut i got yesterday dagny run to the house and bring me a clean bandage jim watched them they left him alone but they often saw him standing in the distance watching francisco with a peculiar kind of intensity he seldom spoke in franciscos presence but he would corner dagny and he would smile derisively saying ah those airs you put on pretending that youre an iron woman with a mind of her own youre a spineless dishrag thats all you are its disgusting the way you let that conceited punk order you about he can twist you around his little finger you havent any pride at all the way you run when he whistles and wait on him why dont you shine his shoes because he hasnt told me to she answered francisco could win any game in any local contest he never entered contests he could have ruled the junior country club he never came within sight of their clubhouse ignoring their eager attempts to enroll the most famous heir in the world dagny and eddie were his only friends they could not tell whether they owned him or were owned by him completely it made no difference either concept made them happy the three of them set out every morning on adventures of their own kind once an elderly professor of literature mrs taggarts friend saw them on top of a pile in a junk yard dismantling the carcass of an automobile he stopped shook his head and said to francisco a young man of your position ought to spend his time in libraries absorbing the culture of the world what do you think im doing asked francisco there were no factories in the neighborhood but francisco taught dagny and eddie to steal rides on taggart trains to distant towns where they climbed fences into mill yards or hung on window sills watching machinery as other children watched movies when i run taggart transcontinental dagny would say at times when i run danconia copper said francisco they never had to explain the rest to each other they knew each others goal and motive railroad conductors caught them once in a while then a stationmaster a hundred miles away would telephone mrs taggart weve got three young tramps here who say that they are yes mrs taggart would sigh they are please send them back francisco eddie asked him once as they stood by the tracks of the taggart station youve been just about everywhere in the world whats the most important thing on earth this answered francisco pointing to the emblem tt on the front of an engine he added i wish i could have met nat taggart he noticed dagnys glance at him he said nothing else but minutes later when they went on through the woods down a narrow path of damp earth ferns and sunlight he said dagny ill always bow to a coatofarms ill always worship the symbols of nobility am i not supposed to be an aristocrat only i dont give a damn for motheaten turrets and tenthhand unicorns the coatsofarms of our day are to be found on billboards and in the ads of popular magazines what do you mean asked eddie industrial trademarks eddie he answered francisco was fifteen years old that summer when i run danconia copper im studying mining and mineralogy because i must be ready for the time when i run danconia copper im studying electrical engineering because power companies are the best customers of danconia copper im going to study philosophy because ill need it to protect danconia copper dont you ever think of anything but danconia copper jim asked him once no it seems to me that there are other things in the world let others think about them isnt that a very selfish attitude it is what are you after money dont you have enough in his lifetime every one of my ancestors raised the production of danconia copper by about ten per cent i intend to raise it by one hundred what for jim asked in sarcastic imitation of franciscos voice when i die i hope to go to heavenwhatever the hell that isand i want to be able to afford the price of admission virtue is the price of admission jim said haughtily thats what i mean james so i want to be prepared to claim the greatest virtue of allthat i was a man who made money any grafter can make money james you ought to discover some day that words have an exact meaning francisco smiled it was a smile of radiant mockery watching them dagny thought suddenly of the difference between francisco and her brother jim both of them smiled derisively but francisco seemed to laugh at things because he saw something much greater jim laughed as if he wanted to let nothing remain great she noticed the particular quality of franciscos smile again one night when she sat with him and eddie at a bonfire they had built in the woods the glow of the fire enclosed them within a fence of broken moving strips that held pieces of tree trunks branches and distant stars she felt as if there were nothing beyond that fence nothing but black emptiness with the hint of some breathstopping frightening promise like the future but the future she thought would be like franciscos smile there was the key to it the advance warning of its nature in his face in the firelight under the pine branchesand suddenly she felt an unbearable happiness unbearable because it was too full and she had no way to express it she glanced at eddie he was looking at francisco in some quiet way of his own eddie felt as she did why do you like francisco she asked him weeks later when francisco was gone eddie looked astonished it had never occurred to him that the feeling could be questioned he said he makes me feel safe she said he makes me expect excitement and danger francisco was sixteen next summer the day when she stood alone with him on the summit of a cliff by the river their shorts and shirts torn in their climb to the top they stood looking down the hudson they had heard that on clear days one could see new york in the distance but they saw only a haze made of three different kinds of light merging together the river the sky and the sun she knelt on a rock leaning forward trying to catch some hint of the city the wind blowing her hair across her eyes she glanced back over her shoulderand saw that francisco was not looking at the distance he stood looking at her it was an odd glance intent and unsmiling she remained still for a moment her hands spread flat on the rock her arms tensed to support the weight of her body inexplicably his glance made her aware of her pose of her shoulder showing through the torn shirt of her long scratched sunburned legs slanting from the rock to the ground she stood up angrily and backed away from him and while throwing her head up resentment in her eyes to meet the sternness in his while feeling certain that his was a glance of condemnation and hostility she heard herself asking him a tone of smiling defiance in her voice what do you like about me he laughed she wondered aghast what had made her say it he answered theres what i like about you pointing to the glittering rails of the taggart station in the distance its not mine she said disappointed what i like is that its going to be she smiled conceding his victory by being openly delighted she did not know why he had looked at her so strangely but she felt that he had seen some connection which she could not grasp between her body and something within her that would give her the strength to rule those rails some day he said brusquely lets see if we can see new york and jerked her by the arm to the edge of the cliff she thought that he did not notice that he twisted her arm in a peculiar way holding it down along the length of his side it made her stand pressed against him and she felt the warmth of the sun in the skin of his legs against hers they looked far out into the distance but they saw nothing ahead except a haze of light when francisco left that summer she thought that his departure was like the crossing of a frontier which ended his childhood he was to start college that fall her turn would come next she felt an eager impatience touched by the excitement of fear as if he had leaped into an unknown danger it was like the moment years ago when she had seen him dive first from a rock into the hudson had seen him vanish under the black water and had stood knowing that he would reappear in an instant and that it would then be her turn to follow she dismissed the fear dangers to francisco were merely opportunities for another brilliant performance there were no battles he could lose no enemies to beat him and then she thought of a remark she had heard a few years earlier it was a strange remarkand it was strange that the words had remained in her mind even though she had thought them senseless at the time the man who said it was an old professor of mathematics a friend of her father who came to their country house for just that one visit she liked his face and she could still see the peculiar sadness in his eyes when he said to her father one evening sitting on the terrace in the fading light pointing to franciscos figure in the garden that boy is vulnerable he has too great a capacity for joy what will he do with it in a world where theres so little occasion for it francisco went to a great american school which his father had chosen for him long ago it was the most distinguished institution of learning left in the world the patrick henry university of cleveland he did not come to visit her in new york that winter even though he was only a nights journey away they did not write to each other they had never done it but she knew that he would come back to the country for one summer month there were a few times that winter when she felt an undefined apprehension the professors words kept returning to her mind as a warning which she could not explain she dismissed them when she thought of francisco she felt the steadying assurance that she would have another month as an advance against the future as a proof that the world she saw ahead was real even though it was not the world of those around her hi slug hi frisco standing on the hillside in the first moment of seeing him again she grasped suddenly the nature of that world which they together held against all others it was only an instants pause she felt her cotton skirt beating in the wind against her knees felt the sun on her eyelids and the upward thrust of such an immense relief that she ground her feet into the grass under her sandals because she thought she would rise weightless through the wind it was a sudden sense of freedom and safetybecause she realized that she knew nothing about the events of his life had never known and would never need to know the world of chanceof families meals schools people of aimless people dragging the load of some unknown guiltwas not theirs could not change him could not matter he and she had never spoken of the things that happened to them but only of what they thought and of what they would do she looked at him silently as if a voice within her were saying not the things that are but the things well make we are not to be stopped you and i forgive me the fear if i thought i could lose you to themforgive me the doubt theyll never reach youill never be afraid for you again he too stood looking at her for a momentand it seemed to her that it was not a look of greeting after an absence but the look of someone who had thought of her every day of that year she could not be certain it was only an instant so brief that just as she caught it he was turning to point at the birch tree behind him and saying in the tone of their childhood game i wish youd learn to run faster ill always have to wait for you will you wait for me she asked gaily he answered without smiling always as they went up the hill to the house he spoke to eddie while she walked silently by his side she felt that there was a new reticence between them which strangely was a new kind of intimacy she did not question him about the university days later she asked him only whether he liked it theyre teaching a lot of drivel nowadays he answered but there are a few courses i like have you made any friends there two he told her nothing else jim was approaching his senior year in a college in new york his studies had given him a manner of odd quavering belligerence as if he had found a new weapon he addressed francisco once without provocation stopping him in the middle of the lawn to say in a tone of aggressive selfrighteousness i think that now that youve reached college age you ought to learn something about ideals its time to forget your selfish greed and give some thought to your social responsibilities because i think that all those millions youre going to inherit are not for your personal pleasure they are a trust for the benefit of the underprivileged and the poor because i think that the person who doesnt realize this is the most depraved type of human being francisco answered courteously it is not advisable lames to venture unsolicited opinions you should spare yourself the embarrassing discovery of their exact value to your listener dagny asked him as they walked away are there many men like jim in the world francisco laughed a great many dont you mind it no i dont have to deal with them why do you ask that because i think theyre dangerous in some way i dont know how good god dagny do you expect me to be afraid of an object like james it was days later when they were alone walking through the woods on the shore of the river that she asked francisco whats the most depraved type of human being the man without a purpose she was looking at the straight shafts of the trees that stood against the great sudden shining spread of space beyond the forest was dim and cool but the outer branches caught the hot silver sunrays from the water she wondered why she enjoyed the sight when she had never taken any notice of the country around her why she was so aware of her enjoyment of her movements of her body in the process of walking she did not want to look at francisco she felt that his presence seemed more intensely real when she kept her eyes away from him almost as if the stressed awareness of herself came from him like the sunlight from the water you think youre good dont you he asked i always did she answered defiantly without turning well let me sec you prove it let me see how far youll rise with taggart transcontinental no matter how good you are ill expect you to wring everything youve got trying to be still better and when youve worn yourself out to reach a goal ill expect you to start for another why do you think that i care to prove anything to you she asked want me to answer no she whispered her eyes fixed upon the other shore of the river in the distance she heard him chuckling and after a while he said dagny theres nothing of any importance in lifeexcept how well you do your work nothing only that whatever else you are will come from that its the only measure of human value all the codes of ethics theyll try to ram down your throat are just so much paper money put out by swindlers to fleece people of their virtues the code of competence is the only system of morality thats on a gold standard when you grow up youll know what i mean i know it now but francisco why are you and i the only ones who seem to know it why should you care about the others because i like to understand things and theres something about people that i cant understand what well ive always been unpopular in school and it didnt bother me but now ive discovered the reason its an impossible kind of reason they dislike me not because i do things badly but because i do them well they dislike me because ive always had the best grades in the class i dont even have to study i always get as do you suppose i should try to get ds for a change and become the most popular girl in school francisco stopped looked at her and slapped her face what she felt was contained in a single instant while the ground rocked under her feet in a single blast of emotion within her she knew that she would have killed any other person who struck her she felt the violent fury which would have given her the strength for itand as violent a pleasure that francisco had done it she felt pleasure from the dull hot pain in her cheek and from the taste of blood in the corner of her mouth she felt pleasure in what she suddenly grasped about him about herself and about his motive she braced her feet to stop the dizziness she held her head straight and stood facing him in the consciousness of a new power feeling herself his equal for the first time looking at him with a mocking smile of triumph did i hurt you as much as that she asked he looked astonished the question and the smile were not those of a child he answered yesif it pleases you it does dont ever do that again dont crack jokes of that kind dont be a fool whatever made you think that i cared about being popular when you grow up youll understand what sort of unspeakable thing you said i understand it now he turned abruptly took out his handkerchief and dipped it in the water of the river come here he ordered she laughed stepping back oh no i want to keep it as it is i hope it swells terribly i like it he looked at her for a long moment he said slowly very earnestly dagny youre wonderful i thought that you always thought so she answered her voice insolently casual when she came home she told her mother that she had cut her lip by falling against a rock it was the only lie she ever told she did not do it to protect francisco she did it because she felt for some reason which she could not define that the incident was a secret too precious to share next summer when francisco came she was sixteen she started running down the hill to meet him but stopped abruptly he saw it stopped and they stood for a moment looking at each other across the distance of a long green slope it was he who walked up toward her walked very slowly while she stood waiting when he approached she smiled innocently as if unconscious of any contest intended or won you might like to know she said that i have a job on the railroad night operator at rockdale he laughed all right taggart transcontinental now its a race lets see wholl do greater honor youto nat taggart or ito sebastian danconia that winter she stripped her life down to the bright simplicity of a geometrical drawing a few straight linesto and from the engineering college in the city each day to and from her job at rockdale station each nightand the closed circle of her room a room littered with diagrams of motors blueprints of steel structures and railroad timetables mrs taggart watched her daughter in unhappy bewilderment she could have forgiven all the omissions but one dagny showed no sign of interest in men no romantic inclination whatever mrs taggart did not approve of extremes she had been prepared to contend with an extreme of the opposite kind if necessary she found herself thinking that this was worse she felt embarrassed when she had to admit that her daughter at seventeen did not have a single admirer dagny and francisco danconia she said smiting ruefully in answer to the curiosity of her friends oh no its not a romance its an international industrial cartel of some kind thats all they seem to care about mrs taggart heard james say one evening in the presence of guests a peculiar tone of satisfaction in his voice dagny even though you were named after her you really look more like nat taggart than like that first dagny taggart the famous beauty who was his wife mrs taggart did not know which offended her most that james said it or that dagny accepted it happily as a compliment she would never have a chance thought mrs taggart to form some conception of her own daughter dagny was only a figure hurrying in and out of the apartment a slim figure in a leather jacket with a raised collar a short skirt and long showgirl legs she walked cutting across a room with a masculine straightline abruptness but she had a peculiar grace of motion that was swift tense and oddly challengingly feminine at times catching a glimpse of dagnys face mrs taggart caught an expression which she could not quite define it was much more than gaiety it was the look of such an untouched purity of enjoyment that she found it abnormal too no young girl could be so insensitive as to have discovered no sadness in life her daughter she concluded was incapable of emotion dagny she asked once dont you ever want to have a good time dagny looked at her incredulously and answered what do you think im having the decision to give her daughter a formal debut cost mrs taggart a great deal of anxious thought she did not know whether she was introducing to new york society miss dagny taggart of the social register or the night operator of rockdale station she was inclined to believe it was more truly this last and she felt certain that dagny would reject the idea of such an occasion she was astonished when dagny accepted it with inexplicable eagerness for once like a child she was astonished again when she saw dagny dressed for the party it was the first feminine dress she had ever worna gown of white chiffon with a huge skirt that floated like a cloud mrs taggart had expected her to look like a preposterous contrast dagny looked like a beauty she seemed both older and more radiantly innocent than usual standing in front of a mirror she held her head as nat taggarts wife would have held it dagny mrs taggart said gently reproachfully do you see how beautiful you can be when you want to yes said dagny without any astonishment the ballroom of the waynefalkland hotel had been decorated under mrs taggarts direction she had an artists taste and the setting of that evening was her masterpiece dagny there are things i would like you to learn to notice she said lights colors flowers music they are not as negligible as you might think ive never thought theyre negligible dagny answered happily for once mrs taggart felt a bond between them dagny was looking at her with a childs grateful trust theyre the things that make life beautiful said mrs taggart i want this evening to be very beautiful for you dagny the first ball is the most romantic event of ones life to mrs taggart the greatest surprise was the moment when she saw dagny standing under the lights looking at the ballroom this was not a child not a girl but a woman of such confident dangerous power that mrs taggart stared at her with shocked admiration in an age of casual cynical indifferent routine among people who held themselves as if they were not flesh but meatdagnys bearing seemed almost indecent because this was the way a woman would have faced a ballroom centuries ago when the act of displaying ones halfnaked body for the admiration of men was an act of daring when it had meaning and but one meaning acknowledged by all as a high adventure and thisthought mrs taggart smilingwas the girl she had believed to be devoid of sexual capacity she felt an immense relief and a touch of amusement at the thought that a discovery of this kind should make her feel relieved the relief lasted only for a few hours at the end of the evening she saw dagny in a corner of the ballroom sitting on a balustrade as if it were a fence rail her legs dangling under the chiffon skirt as if she were dressed in slacks she was talking to a couple of helpless young men her face contemptuously empty neither dagny nor mrs taggart said a word when they rode home together but hours later on a sudden impulse mrs taggart went to her daughters room dagny stood by the window still wearing the white evening gown it looked like a cloud supporting a body that now seemed too thin for it a small body with sagging shoulders beyond the window the clouds were gray in the first light of morning when dagny turned mrs taggart saw only puzzled helplessness in her face the face was calm but something about it made mrs taggart wish she had not wished that her daughter should discover sadness mother do they think its exactly in reverse she asked what asked mrs taggart bewildered the things you were talking about the lights and the flowers do they expect those things to make them romantic not the other way around darling what do you mean there wasnt a person there who enjoyed it she said her voice lifeless or who thought or felt anything at all they moved about and they said the same dull things they say anywhere i suppose they thought the lights would make it brilliant darling you take everything too seriously one is not supposed to be intellectual at a ball one is simply supposed to be gay how by being stupid i mean for instance didnt you enjoy meeting the young men what men there wasnt a man there i couldnt squash ten of days later sitting at her desk at rockdale station feeling lightheartedly at home dagny thought of the party and shrugged in contemptuous reproach at her own disappointment she looked up it was spring and there were leaves on the tree branches in the darkness outside the air was still and warm she asked herself what she had expected from that party she did not know but she felt it again here now as she sat slouched over a battered desk looking out into the darkness a sense of expectation without object rising through her body slowly like a warm liquid she slumped forward across the desk lazily feeling neither exhaustion nor desire to work when francisco came that summer she told him about the party and about her disappointment he listened silently looking at her for the first time with that glance of unmoving mockery which he reserved for others a glance that seemed to see too much she felt as if he heard in her words more than she knew she told him she saw the same glance in his eyes on the evening when she left him too early they were alone sitting on the shore of the river she had another hour before she was due at rockdale there were long thin strips of fire in the sky and red sparks floating lazily on the water he had been silent for a long time when she rose abruptly and told him that she had to go he did not try to stop her he leaned back his elbows in the grass and looked at her without moving his glance seemed to say that he knew her motive hurrying angrily up the slope to the house she wondered what had made her leave she did not know it had been a sudden restlessness that came from a feeling she did not identify till now a feeling of expectation each night she drove the five miles from the country house to rockdale she came back at dawn slept a few hours and got up with the rest of the household she felt no desire to sleep undressing for bed in the first rays of the sun she felt a tense joyous causeless impatience to face the day that was starting she saw franciscos mocking glance again across the net of a tennis court she did not remember the beginning of that game they had often played tennis together and he had always won she did not know at what moment she decided that she would win this time when she became aware of it it was no longer a decision or a wish but a quiet fury rising within her she did not know why she had to win she did not know why it seemed so crucially urgently necessary she knew only that she had to and that she would it seemed easy to play it was as if her will had vanished and someones power were playing for her she watched franciscos figure a tall swift figure the suntan of his arms stressed by his short white shirt sleeves she felt an arrogant pleasure in seeing the skill of his movements because this was the thing which she would beat so that his every expert gesture became her victory and the brilliant competence of his body became the triumph of hers she felt the rising pain of exhaustionnot knowing that it was pain feeling it only in sudden stabs that made her aware of some part of her body for an instant to be forgotten in the next her arm sockether shoulder bladesher hips with the white shorts sticking to her skin the muscles of her legs when she leaped to meet the ball but did not remember whether she came down to touch the ground againher eyelids when the sky went dark red and the ball came at her through the darkness like a whirling white flamethe thin hot wire that shot from her ankle up her back and went on shooting straight across the air driving the ball at franciscos figure she felt an exultant pleasurebecause every stab of pain begun in her body had to end in his because he was being exhausted as she waswhat she did to herself she was doing it also to himthis was what he feltthis was what she drove him toit was not her pain that she felt or her body but his in the moments when she saw his face she saw that he was laughing he was looking at her as if he understood he was playing not to win but to make it harder for hersending his shots wild to make her run losing points to see her twist her body in an agonizing backhandstanding still letting her think he would miss only to let his arm shoot out casually at the last moment and send the ball back with such force that she knew she would miss it she felt as if she could not move again not everand it was strange to find herself landing suddenly at the other side of the court smashing the ball in time smashing it as if she wished it to burst to pieces as if she wished it were franciscos face just once more she thought even if the next one would crack the bones of her arm just once more even if the air which she forced down in gasps past her tight swollen throat would be stopped altogether then she felt nothing no pain no muscles only the thought that she had to beat him to see him exhausted to see him collapse and then she would be free to die in the next moment she won perhaps it was his laughing that made him lose for once he walked to the net while she stood still and threw his racket across at her feet as if knowing that this was what she wanted he walked out of the court and fell down on the grass of the lawn collapsing his head on his arm she approached him slowly she stood over him looking down at his body stretched at her feet looking at his sweatdrenched shirt and the strands of his hair spilled across his arm he raised his head his glance moved slowly up the line of her legs to her shorts to her blouse to her eyes it was a mocking glance that seemed to see straight through her clothes and through her mind and it seemed to say that he had won she sat at her desk at rockdale that night alone in the old station building looking at the sky in the window it was the hour she liked best when the top panes of the window grew lighter and the rails of the track outside became threads of blurred silver across the lower panes she turned off her lamp and watched the vast soundless motion of light over a motionless earth things stood still not a leaf trembled on the branches while the sky slowly lost its color and became an expanse that looked like a spread of glowing water her telephone was silent at this hour almost as if movement had stopped everywhere along the system she heard steps approaching outside suddenly close to the door francisco came in he had never come here before but she was not astonished to see him what are you doing up at this hour she asked i didnt feel like sleeping how did you get here i didnt hear your car i walked moments passed before she realized that she had not asked him why he came and that she did not want to ask it he wandered through the room looking at the clusters of waybills that hung on the walls at the calendar with a picture of the taggart comet caught in a proud surge of motion toward the onlooker he seemed casually at home as if he felt that the place belonged to them as they always felt wherever they went together but he did not seem to want to talk he asked a few questions about her job then kept silent as the light grew outside movement grew down on the line and the telephone started ringing in the silence she turned to her work he sat in a corner one leg thrown over the arm of his chair waiting she worked swiftly feeling inordinately clearheaded she found pleasure in the rapid precision of her hands she concentrated on the sharp bright sound of the phone on the figures of train numbers car numbers order numbers she was conscious of nothing else but when a thin sheet of paper fluttered down to the floor and she bent to pick it up she was suddenly as intently conscious of that particular moment of herself and her own movement she noticed her gray linen skirt the rolled sleeve of her gray blouse and her naked arm reaching down for the paper she felt her heart stop causelessly in the kind of gasp one feels in moments of anticipation she picked up the paper and turned back to her desk it was almost full daylight a train went past the station without stopping in the purity of the morning light the long line of car roofs melted into a silver string and the train seemed suspended above the ground not quite touching it going past through the air the floor of the station trembled and glass rattled in the windows she watched the trains flight with a smile of excitement she glanced at francisco he was looking at her with the same smile when the day operator arrived she turned the station over to him and they walked out into the morning air the sun had not yet risen and the air seemed radiant in its stead she felt no exhaustion she felt as if she were just getting up she started toward her car but francisco said lets walk home well come for the car later all right she was not astonished and she did not mind the prospect of walking five miles it seemed natural natural to the moments peculiar reality that was sharply clear but cut off from everything immediate but disconnected like a bright island in a wall of fog the heightened unquestioning reality one feels when one is drunk the road led through the woods they left the highway for an old trail that went twisting among the trees across miles of untouched country there were no traces of human existence around them old ruts overgrown with grass made human presence seem more distant adding the distance of years to the distance of miles a haze of twilight remained over the ground but in the breaks between the tree trunks there were leaves that hung in patches of shining green and seemed to light the forest the leaves hung still they walked alone to move through a motionless world she noticed suddenly that they had not said a word for a long time they came to a clearing it was a small hollow at the bottom of a shaft made of straight rock hillsides a stream cut across the grass and tree branches flowed low to the ground like a curtain of green fluid the sound of the water stressed the silence the distant cut of open sky made the place seem more hidden far above on the crest of a hill one tree caught the first rays of sunlight they stopped and looked at each other she knew only when he did it that she had known he would he seized her she felt her lips in his mouth felt her arms grasping him in violent answer and knew for the first time how much she had wanted him to do it she felt a moments rebellion and a hint of fear he held her pressing the length of his body against hers with a tense purposeful insistence his hand moving over her breasts as if he were learning a proprietors intimacy with her body a shocking intimacy that needed no consent from her no permission she tried to pull herself away but she only leaned back against his arms long enough to see his face and his smile the smile that told her she had given him permission long ago she thought that she must escape instead it was she who pulled his head down to find his mouth again she knew that fear was useless that he would do what he wished that the decision was his that he left nothing possible to her except the thing she wanted mostto submit she had no conscious realization of his purpose her vague knowledge of it was wiped out she had no power to believe it clearly in this moment to believe it about herself she knew only that she was afraidyet what she felt was as if she were crying to him dont ask me for itoh dont ask medo it she braced her feet for an instant to resist but his mouth was pressed to hers and they went down to the ground together never breaking their lips apart she lay stillas the motionless then the quivering object of an act which he did simply unhesitatingly as of right the right of the unendurable pleasure it gave them he named what it meant to both of them in the first words he spoke afterwards he said we had to learn it from each other she looked at his long figure stretched on the grass beside her he wore black slacks and a black shirt her eyes stopped on the belt pulled tight across his slender waistline and she felt the stab of an emotion that was like a gasp of pride pride in her ownership of his body she lay on her back looking up at the sky feeling no desire to move or think or know that there was any time beyond this moment when she came home when she lay in bed naked because her body had become an unfamiliar possession too precious for the touch of a nightgown because it gave her pleasure to feel naked and to feel as if the white sheets of her bed were touched by franciscos bodywhen she thought that she would not sleep because she did not want to rest and lose the most wonderful exhaustion she had ever knownher last thought was of the times when she had wanted to express but found no way to do it an instants knowledge of a feeling greater than happiness the feeling of ones blessing upon the whole of the earth the feeling of being in love with the fact that one exists and in this kind of world she thought that the act she had learned was the way one expressed it if this was a thought of the gravest importance she did not know it nothing could be grave in a universe from which the concept of pain had been wiped out she was not there to weigh her conclusion she was asleep a faint smile on her face in a silent luminous room filled with the light of morning that summer she met him in the woods in hidden corners by the river on the floor of an abandoned shack in the cellar of the house these were the only times when she learned to feel a sense of beautyby looking up at old wooden rafters or at the steel plate of an air conditioning machine that whirred tensely rhythmically above their heads she wore slacks or cotton summer dresses yet she was never so feminine as when she stood beside him sagging in his arms abandoning herself to anything he wished in open acknowledgment of his power to reduce her to helplessness by the pleasure he had the power to give her he taught her every manner of sensuality he could invent isnt it wonderful that our bodies can give us so much pleasure he said to her once quite simply they were happy and radiantly innocent they were both incapable of the conception that joy is sin they kept their secret from the knowledge of others not as a shameful guilt but as a thing that was immaculately theirs beyond anyones right of debate or appraisal she knew the general doctrine on sex held by people in one form or another the doctrine that sex was an ugly weakness of mans lower nature to be condoned regretfully she experienced an emotion of chastity that made her shrink not from the desires of her body but from any contact with the minds who held this doctrine that winter francisco came to see her in new york at unpredictable intervals he would fly down from cleveland without warning twice a week or he would vanish for months she would sit on the floor of her room surrounded by charts and blueprints she would hear a knock at her door and snap im busy then hear a mocking voice ask are you and leap to her feet to throw the door open to find him standing there they would go to an apartment he had rented in the city a small apartment in a quiet neighborhood francisco she asked him once in sudden astonishment im your mistress am i not he laughed thats what you are she felt the pride a woman is supposed to experience at being granted the title of wife in the many months of his absence she never wondered whether he was true to her or not she knew he was she knew even though she was too young to know the reason that indiscriminate desire and unselective indulgence were possible only to those who regarded sex and themselves as evil she knew little about franciscos life it was his last year in college he seldom spoke of it and she never questioned him she suspected that he was working too hard because she saw at times the unnaturally bright look of his face the look of exhilaration that comes from driving ones energy beyond its limit she laughed at him once boasting that she was an old employee of taggart transcontinental while he had not started to work for a living he said my father refuses to let me work for danconia copper until i graduate when did you learn to be obedient i must respect his wishes he is the owner of danconia copper he is not however the owner of all the copper companies in the world there was a hint of secret amusement in his smile she did not learn the story until the next fall when he had graduated and returned to new york after a visit to his father in buenos aires then he told her that he had taken two courses of education during the last four years one at the patrick henry university the other in a copper foundry on the outskirts of cleveland i like to learn things for myself he said he had started working at the foundry as furnace boy when he was sixteenand now at twenty he owned it he acquired his first title of property with the aid of some inaccuracy about his age on the day when he received his university diploma and he sent them both to his father he showed her a photograph of the foundry it was a small grimy place disreputable with age battered by years of a losing struggle above its entrance gate like a new flag on the mast of a derelict hung the sign danconia copper the public relations man of his fathers office in new york had moaned outraged but don francisco you cant do that what will the public think that name on a dump of this kind its my name francisco had answered when he entered his fathers office in buenos aires a large room severe and modern as a laboratory with photographs of the properties of danconia copper as sole ornament on its wallsphotographs of the greatest mines ore docks and foundries in the worldhe saw in the place of honor facing his fathers desk a photograph of the cleveland foundry with the new sign above its gate his fathers eyes moved from the photograph to franciscos face as he stood in front of the desk isnt it a little too soon his father asked i couldnt have stood four years of nothing but lectures where did you get the money for your first payment on that property by playing the new york stock market what who taught you to do that it is not difficult to judge which industrial ventures will succeed and which wont where did you get the money to play with from the allowance you sent me sir and from my wages when did you have time to watch the stock market while i was writing a thesis on the influenceupon subsequent metaphysical systemsof aristotles theory of the immovable mover franciscos stay in new york was brief that fall his father was sending him to montana as assistant superintendent of a danconia mine oh well he said to dagny smiling my father does not think it advisable to let me rise too fast i would not ask him to take me on faith if he wants a factual demonstration i shall comply in the spring francisco came backas head of the new york office of danconia copper she did not see him often in the next two years she never knew where he was in what city or on what continent the day after she had seen him he always came to her unexpectedlyand she liked it because it made him a continuous presence in her life like the ray of a hidden light that could hit her at any moment whenever she saw him in his office she thought of his hands as she had seen them on the wheel of a motorboat he drove his business hi with the same smooth dangerous confidently mastered speed but one small incident remained in her mind as a shock it did not fit him she saw him standing at the window of his office one evening looking at the brown winter twilight of the city he did not move for a long time his face was hard and tight it had the look of an emotion she had never believed possible to him of bitter helpless anger he said theres something wrong in the world theres always been something no one has ever named or explained he would not tell her what it was when she saw him again no trace of that incident remained in his manner it was spring and they stood together on the roof terrace of a restaurant the light silk of her evening gown blowing in the wind against his tall figure in formal black clothes they looked at the city in the dining room behind them the sounds of the music were a concert etude by richard halley halleys name was not known to many but they had discovered it and they loved his music francisco said we dont have to look for skyscrapers in the distance do we weve reached them she smiled and said i think were going past them im almost afraid were on a speeding elevator of some kind sure afraid of what let it speed why should there be a limit he was twentythree when his father died and he went to buenos aires to take over the danconia estate now his she did not see him for three years he wrote to her at first at random intervals he wrote about danconia copper about the world market about issues affecting the interests of taggart transcontinental his letters were brief written by hand usually at night she was not unhappy in his absence she too was making her first steps toward the control of a future kingdom among the leaders of industry her fathers friends she heard it said that one had better watch the young danconia heir if that copper company had been great before it would sweep the world now under what his management promised to become she smiled without astonishment there were moments when she felt a sudden violent longing for him but it was only impatience not pain she dismissed it in the confident knowledge that they were both working toward a future that would bring them everything they wanted including each other then his letters stopped she was twentyfour on that day of spring when the telephone rang on her desk in an office of the taggart building dagny said a voice she recognized at once im at the waynefalkland come to have dinner with me tonight at seven he said it without greeting as if they had parted the day before because it took her a moment to regain the art of breathing she realized for the first time how much that voice meant to her all right francisco she answered they needed to say nothing else she thought replacing the receiver that his return was natural and as she had always expected it to happen except that she had not expected her sudden need to pronounce his name or the stab of happiness she felt while pronouncing it when she entered his hotel room that evening she stopped short he stood in the middle of the room looking at herand she saw a smile that came slowly involuntarily as if he had lost the ability to smile and were astonished that he should regain it he looked at her incredulously not quite believing what she was or what he felt his glance was like a plea like the cry for help of a man who could never cry at her entrance he had started their old salute he had started to say hi but he did not finish it instead after a moment he said youre beautiful dagny he said it as if it hurt him francisco i he shook his head not to let her pronounce the words they had never said to each othereven though they knew that both had said and heard them in that moment he approached he took her in his arms he kissed her mouth and held her for a long time when she looked up at his face he was smiling down at her confidently derisively it was a smile that told her he was in control of himself of her of everything and ordered her to forget what she had seen in that first moment hi slug he said feeling certain of nothing except that she must not ask questions she smiled and said hi frisco she could have understood any change but not the things she saw there was no sparkle of life in his face no hint of amusement the face had become implacable the plea of his first smile had not been a plea of weakness he had acquired an air of determination that seemed merciless he acted like a man who stood straight under the weight of an unendurable burden she saw what she could not have believed possible that there were lines of bitterness in his face and that he looked tortured dagny dont be astonished by anything i do he said or by anything i may ever do in the future that was the only explanation he granted her then proceeded to act as if there were nothing to explain she could feel no more than a faint anxiety it was impossible to feel fear for his fate or in his presence when he laughed she thought they were back in the woods by the hudson he had not changed and never would the dinner was served in his room she found it amusing to face him across a table laid out with the icy formality pertaining to excessive cost in a hotel room designed as a european palace the waynefalkland was the most distinguished hotel left on any continent its style of indolent luxury of velvet drapes sculptured panels and candlelight seemed a deliberate contrast to its function no one could afford its hospitality except men who came to new york on business to settle transactions involving the world she noticed that the manner of the waiters who served their dinner suggested a special deference to this particular guest of the hotel and that francisco did not notice it he was indifferently at home he had long since become accustomed to the fact that he was senor danconia of danconia copper but she thought it strange that he did not speak about his work she had expected it to be his only interest the first thing he would share with her he did not mention it he led her to talk instead about her job her progress and what she felt for taggart transcontinental she spoke of it as she had always spoken to him in the knowledge that he was the only one who could understand her passionate devotion he made no comment but he listened intently a waiter had turned on the radio for dinner music they had paid no attention to it but suddenly a crash of sound jarred the room almost as if a subterranean blast had struck the walls and made them tremble the shock came not from the loudness but from the quality of the sounds it was halleys new concerto recently written the fourth they sat in silence listening to the statement of rebellionthe anthem of the triumph of the great victims who would refuse to accept pain francisco listened looking out at the city without transition or warning he asked his voice oddly unstressed dagny what would you say if i asked you to leave taggart transcontinental and let it go to hell as it will when your brother takes over what would i say if you asked me to consider the idea of committing suicide she answered angrily he remained silent why did you say that she snapped i didnt think youd joke about it its not like you there was no touch of humor in his face he answered quietly gravely no of course i shouldnt she brought herself to question him about his work he answered the questions he volunteered nothing she repeated to him the comments of the industrialists about the brilliant prospects of danconia copper under his management thats true he said his voice lifeless in sudden anxiety not knowing what prompted her she asked francisco why did you come to new york he answered slowly to see a friend who called for me business looking past her as if answering a thought of his own a faint smile of bitter amusement on his face but his voice strangely soft and sad he answered yes it was long past midnight when she awakened in bed by his side no sounds came from the city below the stillness of the room made life seem suspended for a while relaxed in happiness and in complete exhaustion she turned lazily to glance at him he lay on his back half propped by a pillow she saw his profile against the foggy glow of the night sky in the window he was awake his eyes were open he held his mouth closed like a man lying in resignation in unbearable pain bearing it making no attempt to hide it she was too frightened to move he felt her glance and turned to her he shuddered suddenly he threw off the blanket he looked at her naked body then he fell forward and buried his face between her breasts he held her shoulders hanging onto her convulsively she heard the words muffled his mouth pressed to her skin i cant give it up i cant what she whispered you why should and everything why should you give it up dagny help me to remain to refuse even though hes right she asked evenly to refuse what francisco he did not answer only pressed his face harder against her she lay very still conscious of nothing but a supreme need of caution his head on her breast her hand caressing his hair gently steadily she lay looking up at the ceiling of the room at the sculptured garlands faintly visible in the darkness and she waited numb with terror he moaned its right but its so hard to do oh god its so hard after a while he raised his head he sat up he had stopped trembling what is it francisco i cant tell you his voice was simple open without attempt to disguise suffering but it was a voice that obeyed him now youre not ready to hear it i want to help you you cant you said to help you refuse i cant refuse then let me share it with you he shook his head he sat looking down at her as if weighing a question then he shook his head again in answer to himself if im not sure i can stand it he said and the strange new note in his voice was tenderness how could you she said slowly with effort trying to keep herself from screaming francisco i have to know will you forgive me i know youre frightened and its cruel but will you do this for mewill you let it go just let it go and dont ask me anything i thats all you can do for me will you yes francisco dont be afraid for me it was just this once it wont happen to me again it will become much easier later if i could no go to sleep dearest it was the first time he had ever used that word in the morning he faced her openly not avoiding her anxious glance but saying nothing about it she saw both serenity and suffering in the calm of his face an expression like a smile of pain though he was not smiling strangely it made him look younger he did not look like a man bearing torture now but like a man who sees that which makes the torture worth bearing she did not question him before leaving she asked only when will i see you again he answered i dont know dont wait for me dagny next time we meet you will not want to see me i will have a reason for the things ill do but i cant tell you the reason and you will be right to damn me i am not committing the contemptible act of asking you to take me on faith you have to live by your own knowledge and judgment you will damn me you will be hurt try not to let it hurt you too much remember that i told you this and that it was all i could tell you she heard nothing from him or about him for a year when she began to hear gossip and to read newspaper stories she did not believe at first that they referred to francisco danconia after a while she had to believe it she read the story of the party he gave on his yacht in the harbor of valparaiso the guests wore bathing suits and an artificial rain of champagne and flower petals kept falling upon the decks throughout the night she read the story of the party he gave at an algerian desert resort he built a pavilion of thin sheets of ice and presented every woman guest with an ermine wrap as a gift to be worn for the occasion on condition that they remove their wraps then their evening gowns then all the rest in tempo with the melting of the walls she read the accounts of the business ventures he undertook at lengthy intervals the ventures were spectacularly successful and ruined his competitors but he indulged in them as in an occasional sport staging a sudden raid then vanishing from the industrial scene for a year or two leaving danconia copper to the management of his employees she read the interview where he said why should i wish to make money i have enough to permit three generations of descendants to have as good a time as im having she saw him once at a reception given by an ambassador in new york he bowed to her courteously he smiled and he looked at her with a glance in which no past existed she drew him aside she said only francisco why whywhat he asked she turned away i warned you he said she did not try to see him again she survived it she was able to survive it because she did not believe in suffering she faced with astonished indignation the ugly fact of feeling pain and refused to let it matter suffering was a senseless accident it was not part of life as she saw it she would not allow pain to become important she had no name for the kind of resistance she offered for the emotion from which the resistance came but the words that stood as its equivalent in her mind were it does not count it is not to be taken seriously she knew these were the words even in the moments when there was nothing left within her but screaming and she wished she could lose the faculty of consciousness so that it would not tell her that what could not be true was true not to be taken seriouslyan immovable certainty within her kept repeatingpain and ugliness are never to be taken seriously she fought it she recovered years helped her to reach the day when she could face her memories indifferently then the day when she felt no necessity to face them it was finished and of no concern to her any longer there had been no other men in her life she did not know whether this had made her unhappy she had had no time to know she found the clean brilliant sense of life as she wanted itin her work once francisco had given her the same sense a feeling that belonged with her work and in her world the men she had met since were like the men she met at her first ball she had won the battle against her memories but one form of torture remained untouched by the years the torture of the word why whatever the tragedy he met why had francisco taken the ugliest way of escape as ignoble as the way of some cheap alcoholic the boy she had known could not have become a useless coward an incomparable mind could not turn its ingenuity to the invention of melting ballrooms yet he had and did and there was no explanation to make it conceivable and to let her forget him in peace she could not doubt the fact of what he had been she could not doubt the fact of what he had become yet one made the other impossible at times she almost doubted her own rationality or the existence of any rationality anywhere but this was a doubt which she did not permit to anyone yet there was no explanation no reason no clue to any conceivable reason and in all the days of ten years she had found no hint of an answer no she thoughtas she walked through the gray twilight past the windows of abandoned shops to the waynefalkland hotelno there could be no answer she would not seek it it did not matter now the remnant of violence the emotion rising as a thin trembling within her was not for the man she was going to see it was a cry of protest against a sacrilegeagainst the destruction of what had been greatness in a break between buildings she saw the towers of the wayne falkland she felt a slight jolt in her lungs and legs that stopped her for an instant then she walked on evenly by the time she walked through the marble lobby to the elevator then down the wide velvetcarpeted soundless corridors of the wayne falkland she felt nothing but a cold anger that grew colder with every step she was certain of the anger when she knocked at his door she heard his voice answering come in she jerked the door open and entered francisco domingo carlos andres sebastian danconia sat on the floor playing marbles nobody ever wondered whether francisco danconia was goodlooking or not it seemed irrelevant when he entered a room it was impossible to look at anyone else his tall slender figure had an air of distinction too authentic to be modern and he moved as if he had a cape floating behind him in the wind people explained him by saying that he had the vitality of a healthy animal but they knew dimly that that was not correct he had the vitality of a healthy human being a thing so rare that no one could identify it he had the power of certainty nobody described his appearance as latin yet the word applied to him not in its present but in its original sense not pertaining to spain but to ancient rome his body seemed designed as an exercise in consistency of style a style made of gauntness of tight flesh long legs and swift movements his features had the fine precision of sculpture his hair was black and straight swept back the suntan of his skin intensified the startling color of his eyes they were a pure clear blue his face was open its rapid changes of expression reflecting whatever he felt as if he had nothing to hide the blue eyes were still and changeless never giving a hint of what he thought he sat on the floor of his drawing room dressed in sleeping pajamas of thin black silk the marbles spread on the carpet around him were made of the semiprecious stones of his native country carnelian and rock crystal he did not rise when dagny entered he sat looking up at her and a crystal marble fell like a teardrop out of his hand he smiled the unchanged insolent brilliant smile of his childhood hi slug she heard herself answering irresistibly helplessly happily hi frisco she was looking at his face it was the face she had known it bore no mark of the kind of life he had led nor of what she had seen on their last night together there was no sign of tragedy no bitterness no tensiononly the radiant mockery matured and stressed the look of dangerously unpredictable amusement and the great guiltless serenity of spirit but this she thought was impossible this was more shocking than all the rest his eyes were studying her the battered coat thrown open half slipping off her shoulders and the slender body in a gray suit that looked like an office uniform if you came here dressed like this in order not to let me notice how lovely you are he said you miscalculated youre lovely i wish i could tell you what a relief it is to see a face thats intelligent though a womans but you dont want to hear it thats not what you came here for the words were improper in so many ways yet were said so lightly that they brought her back to reality to anger and to the purpose of her visit she remained standing looking down at him her face blank refusing him any recognition of the personal even of its power to offend her she said i came here to ask you a question go ahead when you told those reporters that you came to new york to witness the farce which farce did you mean he laughed aloud like a man who seldom finds a chance to enjoy the unexpected thats what i like about you dagny there are seven million people in the city of new york at present out of seven million people you are the only one to whom it could have occurred that i wasnt talking about the vail divorce scandal what were you talking about what alternative occurred to you the san sebastian disaster thats much more amusing than the vail divorce scandal isnt it she said in the solemn merciless tone of a prosecutor you did it consciously coldbloodedly and with full intention dont you think it would be better if you took your coat off and sat down she knew she had made a mistake by betraying too much intensity she turned coldly removed her coat and threw it aside he did not rise to help her she sat down in an armchair he remained on the floor at some distance but it seemed as if he were sitting at her feet what was it i did with full intention he asked the entire san sebastian swindle what was my full intention that is what i want to know he chuckled as if she had asked him to explain in conversation a complex science requiring a lifetime of study you knew that the san sebastian mines were worthless she said you knew it before you began the whole wretched business then why did i begin it dont start telling me that you gained nothing i know it i know you lost fifteen million dollars of your own money yet it was done on purpose can you think of a motive that would prompt me to do it no its inconceivable is it you assume that i have a great mind a great knowledge and a great productive ability so that anything i undertake must necessarily be successful and then you claim that i had no desire to put out my best effort for the peoples state of mexico inconceivable isnt it you knew before you bought that property that mexico was in the hands of a looters government you didnt have to start a mining project for them no i didnt have to you didnt give a damn about that mexican government one way or another because youre wrong about that because you knew theyd seize those mines sooner or later what you were after is your american stockholders thats true he was looking straight at her he was not smiling his face was earnest he added thats part of the truth whats the rest it was not all i was after what else thats for you to figure out i came here because i wanted you to know that i am beginning to understand your purpose he smiled if you did you wouldnt have come here thats true i dont understand and probably never shall i am merely beginning to see part of it which part you had exhausted every other form of depravity and sought a new thrill by swindling people like jim and his friends in order to watch them squirm i dont know what sort of corruption could make anyone enjoy that but thats what you came to new york to see at the right time they certainly provided a spectacle of squirming on the grand scale your brother james in particular theyre rotten fools but in this case their only crime was that they trusted you they trusted your name and your honor again she saw the look of earnestness and again knew with certainty that it was genuine when he said yes they did i know it and do you find it amusing no i dont find it amusing at all he had continued playing with his marbles absently indifferently taking a shot once in a while she noticed suddenly the faultless accuracy of his aim the skill of his hands he merely flicked his wrist and sent a drop of stone shooting across the carpet to click sharply against another drop she thought of his childhood and of the predictions that anything he did would be done superlatively no he said i dont find it amusing your brother james and his friends knew nothing about the coppermining industry they knew nothing about making money they did not think it necessary to learn they considered knowledge superfluous and judgment inessential they observed that there i was in the world and that i made it my honor to know they thought they could trust my honor one does not betray a trust of this kind does one then you did betray it intentionally thats for you to decide it was you who spoke about their trust and my honor i dont think in such terms any longer he shrugged adding i dont give a damn about your brother james and his friends their theory was not new it has worked for centuries but it wasnt foolproof there is just one point that they overlooked they thought it was safe to ride on my brain because they assumed that the goal of my journey was wealth all their calculations rested on the premise that i wanted to make money what if i didnt if you didnt what did you want they never asked me that not to inquire about my aims motives or desires is an essential part of their theory if you didnt want to make money what possible motive could you have had any number of them for instance to spend it to spend money on a certain total failure how was i to know that those mines were a certain total failure how could you help knowing it quite simply by giving it no thought you started that project without giving it any thought no not exactly but suppose i slipped up im only human i made a mistake i failed i made a bad job of it he flicked his wrist a crystal marble shot sparkling across the floor and cracked violently against a brown one at the other end of the room i dont believe it she said no but havent i the right to be what is now accepted as human should i pay for everybodys mistakes and never be permitted one of my own thats not like you no he stretched himself fulllength on the carpet lazily relaxing did you intend me to notice that if you think i did it on purpose then you still give me credit for having a purpose youre still unable to accept me as a bum she closed her eyes she heard him laughing it was the gayest sound hi the world she opened her eyes hastily but there was no hint of cruelty in his face only pure laughter my motive dagny you dont think that its the simplest one of allthe spur of the moment no she thought no thats not true not if he laughed like that not if he looked as he did the capacity for unclouded enjoyment she thought does not belong to irresponsible fools an inviolate peace of spirit is not the achievement of a drifter to be able to laugh like that is the end result of the most profound most solemn thinking almost dispassionately looking at his figure stretched on the carpet at her feet she observed what memory it brought back to her the black pajamas stressed the long lines of his body the open collar showed a smooth young sunburned skinand she thought of the figure in black slacks and shirt stretched beside her on the grass at sunrise she had felt pride then the pride of knowing that she owned his body she still felt it she remembered suddenly specifically the excessive acts of their intimacy the memory should have been offensive to her now but wasnt it was still pride without regret or hope an emotion that had no power to reach her and that she had no power to destroy unaccountably by an association of feeling that astonished her she remembered what had conveyed to her recently the same sense of consummate joy as his francisco she heard herself saying softly we both loved the music of richard halley i still love it have you ever met him yes why do you happen to know whether he has written a fifth concerto he remained perfectly still she had thought him impervious to shock he wasnt but she could not attempt to guess why of all the things she had said this should be the first to reach him it was only an instant then he asked evenly what makes you think he has well has he you know that there are only four halley concertos yes but i wondered whether he had written another one he has stopped writing i know then what made you ask that just an idle thought what is he doing now where is he i dont know i havent seen him for a long time what made you think that there was a fifth concerto i didnt say there was i merely wondered about it why did you think of richard halley just now becauseshe felt her control cracking a littlebecause my mind cant make the leap from richard halleys music to to mrs gilbert vail he laughed relieved oh that incidentally if youve been following my publicity have you noticed a funny little discrepancy in the story of mrs gilbert vail i dont read the stuff you should she gave such a beautiful description of last new years eve which we spent together in my villa in the andes the moonlight on the mountain peaks and the bloodred flowers hanging on vines in the open windows see anything wrong in the picture she said quietly its i who should ask you that and im not going to oh i see nothing wrongexcept that last new years eve i was in el paso texas presiding at the opening of the san sebastian line of taggart transcontinental as you should remember even if you didnt choose to be present on the occasion i had my picture taken with my arms around your brother james and the senor orren boyle she gasped remembering that this was true remembering also that she had seen mrs vails story in the newspapers francisco what what does that mean he chuckled draw your own conclusions dagnyhis face was seriouswhy did you think of halley writing a fifth concerto why not a new symphony or opera why specifically a concerto why does that disturb you it doesnt he added softly i still love his music dagny then he spoke lightly again but it belonged to another age our age provides a different kind of entertainment he rolled over on his back and lay with his hands crossed under his head looking up as if he were watching the scenes of a movie farce unrolling on the ceiling dagny didnt you enjoy the spectacle of the behavior of the peoples state of mexico in regard to the san sebastian mines did you read their governments speeches and the editorials in their newspapers theyre saying that i am an unscrupulous cheat who has defrauded them they expected to have a successful mining concern to seize i had no right to disappoint them like that did you read about the scabby little bureaucrat who wanted them to sue me he laughed lying flat on his back his arms were thrown wide on the carpet forming a cross with his body he seemed disarmed relaxed and young it was worth whatever its cost me i could afford the price of that show if i had staged it intentionally i would have beaten the record of the emperor nero whats burning a citycompared to tearing the lid off hell and letting men see it he raised himself picked up a few marbles and sat shaking them absently in his hand they clicked with the soft clear sound of good stone she realized suddenly that playing with those marbles was not a deliberate affectation on his part it was restlessness he could not remain inactive for long the government of the peoples state of mexico has issued a proclamation he said asking the people to be patient and put up with hardships just a little longer it seems that the copper fortune of the san sebastian mines was part of the plans of the central planning council it was to raise everybodys standard of living and provide a roast of pork every sunday for every man woman child and abortion in the peoples state of mexico now the planners are asking their people not to blame the government but to blame the depravity of the rich because i turned out to be an irresponsible playboy instead of the greedy capitalist i was expected to be how were they to know theyre asking that i would let them down well true enough how were they to know it she noticed the way he fingered the marbles in his hand he was not conscious of it he was looking off into some grim distance but she felt certain that the action was a relief to him perhaps as a contrast his fingers were moving slowly feeling the texture of the stones with sensual enjoyment instead of finding it crude she found it strangely attractiveas if she thought suddenly as if sensuality were not physical at all but came from a fine discrimination of the spirit and thats not all they didnt know he said theyre in for some more knowledge theres that housing settlement for the workers of san sebastian it cost eight million dollars steelframe houses with plumbing electricity and refrigeration also a school a church a hospital and a movie theater a settlement built for people who had lived in hovels made of driftwood and stray tin cans my reward for building it was to be the privilege of escaping with my skin a special concession due to the accident of my not being a native of the peoples state of mexico that workers settlement was also part of their plans a model example of progressive state housing well those steelframe houses arc mainly cardboard with a coating of good imitation shellac they wont stand another year the plumbing pipesas well as most of our mining equipmentwere purchased from the dealers whose main source of supply are the city dumps of buenos aires and rio de janeiro id give those pipes another five months and the electric system about six the wonderful roads we graded up four thousand feet of rock for the peoples state of mexico will not last beyond a couple of winters theyre cheap cement without foundation and the bracing at the bad turns is just painted clapboard wait for one good mountain slide the church i think will stand theyll need it francisco she whispered did you do it on purpose he raised his head she was startled to see that his face had a look of infinite weariness whether i did it on purpose he said or through neglect or through stupidity dont you understand that that doesnt make any difference the same element was missing she was trembling against all her decisions and control she cried francisco if you see whats happening in the world if you understand all the things you said you cant laugh about it you of all men you should fight them whom the looters and those who make worldlooting possible the mexican planners and their kind his smile had a dangerous edge no my dear its you that i have to fight she looked at him blankly what are you trying to say i am saying that the workers settlement of san sebastian cost eight million dollars he answered with slow emphasis his voice hard the price paid for those cardboard houses was the price that could have bought steel structures so was the price paid for every other item that money went to men who grow rich by such methods such men do not remain rich for long the money will go into channels which will carry it not to the most productive but to the most corrupt by the standards of our time the man who has the least to offer is the man who wins that money will vanish in projects such as the san sebastian mines she asked with effort is that what youre after yes is that what you find amusing yes i am thinking of your name she said while another part of her mind was crying to her that reproaches were useless it was a tradition of your family that a danconia always left a fortune greater than the one he received oh yes my ancestors had a remarkable ability for doing the right thing at the right timeand for making the right investments of course investment is a relative term it depends on what you wish to accomplish for instance look at san sebastian it cost me fifteen million dollars but these fifteen million wiped out forty million belonging to taggart transcontinental thirtyfive million belonging to stockholders such as james taggart and orren boyle and hundreds of millions which will be lost in secondary consequences thats not a bad return on an investment is it dagny she was sitting straight do you realize what youre saying oh fully shall i beat you to it and name the consequences you were going to reproach me for first i dont think that taggart transcontinental will recover from its loss on that preposterous san sebastian line you think it will but it wont second the san sebastian helped your brother james to destroy the phoenixdurango which was about the only good railroad left anywhere you realize all that and a great deal more do youshe did not know why she had to say it except that the memory of the face with the dark violent eyes seemed to stare at her do you know ellis wyatt sure do you know what this might do to him yes hes the one whos going to be wiped out next do you find that amusing much more amusing than the ruin of the mexican planners she stood up she had called him corrupt for years she had feared it she had thought about it she had tried to forget it and never think of it again but she had never suspected how far the corruption had gone she was not looking at him she did not know that she was saying it aloud quoting his words of the past wholl do greater honor youto nat taggart or ito sebastian danconia but didnt you realize that i named those mines in honor of my great ancestor i think it was a tribute which he would have liked it took her a moment to recover her eyesight she had never known what was meant by blasphemy or what one felt on encountering it she knew it now he had risen and stood courteously smiling down at her it was a cold smile impersonal and unrevealing she was trembling but it did not matter she did not care what he saw or guessed or laughed at i came here because i wanted to know the reason for what youve done with your life she said tonelessly without anger i have told you the reason he answered gravely but you dont want to believe it i kept seeing you as you were i couldnt forget it and that you should have become what you arethat does not belong in a rational universe no and the world as you see it around you does you were not the kind of man who gets broken by any kind of world true thenwhy he shrugged who is john galt oh dont use gutter language he glanced at her his lips held the hint of a smile but his eyes were still earnest and for an instant disturbingly perceptive why she repeated he answered as he had answered in the night in this hotel ten years ago youre not ready to hear it he did not follow her to the door she had put her hand on the doorknob when she turnedand stopped he stood across the room looking at her it was a glance directed at her whole person she knew its meaning and it held her motionless i still want to sleep with you he said but i am not a man who is happy enough to do it not happy enough she repeated in complete bewilderment he laughed is it proper that that should be the first thing youd answer he waited but she remained silent you want it too dont you she was about to answer no but realized that the truth was worse than that yes she answered coldly but it doesnt matter to me that i want it he smiled in open appreciation acknowledging the strength she had needed to say it but he was not smiling when he said as she opened the door to leave you have a great deal of courage dagny some day youll have enough of it of what courage but he did not answer chapter vi the noncommercial rearden pressed his forehead to the mirror and tried not to think that was the only way he could go through with it he told himself he concentrated on the relief of the mirrors cooling touch wondering how one went about forcing ones mind into blankness particularly after a lifetime lived on the axiom that the constant clearest most ruthless function of his rational faculty was his foremost duty he wondered why no effort had ever seemed beyond his capacity yet now he could not scrape up the strength to stick a few black pearl studs into his starched white shirt front this was his wedding anniversary and he had known for three months that the party would take place tonight as lillian wished he had promised it to her safe in the knowledge that the party was a long way off and that he would attend to it when the time came as he attended to every duty on his overloaded schedule then during three months of eighteenhour workdays he had forgotten it happilyuntil half an hour ago when long past dinner time his secretary had entered his office and said firmly your party mr rearden he had cried good god leaping to his feet he had hurried home rushed up the stairs started tearing his clothes off and gone through the routine of dressing conscious only of the need to hurry not of the purpose when the full realization of the purpose struck him like a sudden blow he stopped you dont care for anything but business he had heard it all his life pronounced as a verdict of damnation he had always known that business was regarded as some sort of secret shameful cult which one did not impose on innocent laymen that people thought of it as of an ugly necessity to be performed but never mentioned that to talk shop was an offense against higher sensibilities that just as one washed machine grease off ones hands before coming home so one was supposed to wash the stain of business off ones mind before entering a drawing room he had never held that creed but he had accepted it as natural that his family should hold it he took it for grantedwordlessly in the manner of a feeling absorbed in childhood left unquestioned and unnamedthat he had dedicated himself like the martyr of some dark religion to the service of a faith which was his passionate love but which made him an outcast among men whose sympathy he was not to expect he had accepted the tenet that it was his duty to give his wife some form of existence unrelated to business but he had never found the capacity to do it or even to experience a sense of guilt he could neither force himself to change nor blame her if she chose to condemn him he had given lillian none of his time for monthsno he thought for years for the eight years of their marriage he had no interest to spare for her interests not even enough to learn just what they were she had a large circle of friends and he had heard it said that their names represented the heart of the countrys culture but he had never had time to meet them or even to acknowledge their fame by knowing what achievements had earned it he knew only that he often saw their names on the magazine covers on newsstands if lillian resented his attitude he thought she was right if her manner toward him was objectionable he deserved it if his family called him heartless it was true he had never spared himself in any issue when a problem came up at the mills his first concern was to discover what error he had made he did not search for anyones fault but his own it was of himself that he demanded perfection he would grant himself no mercy now he took the blame but at the mills it prompted him to action in an immediate impulse to correct the error now it had no effect just a few more minutes he thought standing against the mirror his eyes closed he could not stop the thing in his mind that went on throwing words at him it was like trying to plug a broken hydrant with his bare hands stinging jets part words part pictures kept shooting at his brain hours of it he thought hours to spend watching the eyes of the guests getting heavy with boredom if they were sober or glazing into an imbecile stare if they werent and pretend that he noticed neither and strain to think of something to say to them when he had nothing to say while he needed hours of inquiry to find a successor for the superintendent of his rolling mills who had resigned suddenly without explanationhe had to do it at oncemen of that sort were so hard to findand if anything happened to break the flow of the rolling millsit was the taggart rail that was being rolled he remembered the silent reproach the look of accusation longbearing patience and scorn which he always saw in the eyes of his family when they caught some evidence of his passion for his businessand the futility of his silence of his hope that they would not think rearden steel meant as much to him as it didlike a drunkard pretending indifference to liquor among people who watch him with the scornful amusement of their full knowledge of his shameful weakness i heard you last night coming home at two in the morning where were you his mother saying to him at the dinner table and lillian answering why at the mills of course as another wife would say at the corner saloon or lillian asking him the hint of a wise halfsmile on her face what were you doing in new york yesterday it was a banquet with the boys business yes of courseand lillian turning away nothing more except the shameful realization that he had almost hoped she would think he had attended some sort of obscene stag party an ore carrier had gone down in a storm on lake michigan with thousands of tons of rearden orethose boats were falling apartif he didnt take it upon himself to help them obtain the replacements they needed the owners of the line would go bankrupt and there was no other line left in operation on lake michigan that nook said lillian pointing to an arrangement of settees and coffee tables in their drawing room why no henry its not new but i suppose i should feel flattered that three weeks is all it took you to notice it its my own adaptation of the morning room of a famous french palace but things like that cant possibly interest you darling theres no stock market quotation on them none whatever the order for copper which he had placed six months ago had not been delivered the promised date had been postponed three tuneswe cant help it mr reardenhe had to find another company to deal with the supply of copper was becoming increasingly uncertain philip did not smile when he looked up in the midst of a speech he was making to some friend of their mothers about some organization he had joined but there was something that suggested a smile of superiority in the loose muscles of his face when he said no you wouldnt care for this its not business henry not business at all its a strictly noncommercial endeavor that contractor in detroit with the job of rebuilding a large factory was considering structural shapes of rearden metal he should fly to detroit and speak to him in personhe should have done it a week agohe could have done it tonight youre not listening said his mother at the breakfast table when his mind wandered to the current coal price index while she was telling him about the dream shed had last night youve never listened to a living soul youre not interested in anything but yourself you dont give a damn about people not about a single human creature on gods earth the typed pages lying on the desk in his office were a report on the tests of an airplane motor made of rearden metalperhaps of all things on earth the one he wanted most at this moment was to read itit had lain on his desk untouched for three days he had had no time for itwhy didnt he do it now and he shook his head violently opening his eyes stepping back from the mirror he tried to reach for the shirt studs he saw his hand reaching instead for the pile of mail on his dresser it was mail picked as urgent it had to be read tonight but he had had no time to read it in the office his secretary had stuffed it into his pocket on his way out he had thrown it there while undressing a newspaper clipping fluttered down to the floor it was an editorial which his secretary had marked with an angry stash in red pencil it was entitled equalization of opportunity he had to read it there had been too much talk about this issue in the last three months ominously too much he read it with the sound of voices and forced laughter coming from downstairs reminding him that the guests were arriving that the party had started and that he would face the bitter reproachful glances of his family when he came down the editorial said that at a time of dwindling production shrinking markets and vanishing opportunities to make a living it was unfair to let one man hoard several business enterprises while others had none it was destructive to let a few corner all the resources leaving others no chance competition was essential to society and it was societys duty to see that no competitor ever rose beyond the range of anybody who wanted to compete with him the editorial predicted the passage of a bill which had been proposed a bill forbidding any person or corporation to own more than one business concern wesley mouch his washington man had told rearden not to worry the fight would be stiff he had said but the bill would be defeated rearden understood nothing about that kind of fight he left it to mouch and his staff he could barely find time to skim through the reports from washington and to sign the checks which mouch requested for the battle rearden did not believe that the bill would pass he was incapable of believing it having dealt with the clean reality of metals technology production all his life he had acquired the conviction that one had to concern oneself with the rational not the insanethat one had to seek that which was right because the right answer always wonthat the senseless the wrong the monstrously unjust could not work could not succeed could do nothing but defeat itself a battle against a thing such as that bill seemed preposterous and faintly embarrassing to him as if he were suddenly asked to compete with a man who calculated steel mixtures by the formulas of numerology he had told himself that the issue was dangerous but the loudest screaming of the most hysterical editorial roused no emotion in himwhile a variation of a decimal point in a laboratory report on a test of rearden metal made him leap to his feet in eagerness or apprehension he had no energy to spare for anything else he crumpled the editorial and threw it into the wastebasket he felt the leaden approach of that exhaustion which he never felt at his job the exhaustion that seemed to wait for him and catch him the moment he turned to other concerns he felt as if he were incapable of any desire except a desperate longing for sleep he told himself that he had to attend the partythat his family had the right to demand it of himthat he had to learn to like their kind of pleasure for their sake not his own he wondered why this was a motive that had no power to impel him throughout his life whenever he became convinced that a course of action was right the desire to follow it had come automatically what was happening to himhe wondered the impossible conflict of feeling reluctance to do that which was rightwasnt it the basic formula of moral corruption to recognize ones guilt yet feel nothing but the coldest most profound indifferencewasnt it a betrayal of that which had been the motor of his lifecourse and of his pride he gave himself no time to seek an answer he finished dressing quickly pitilessly holding himself erect his tall figure moving with the unstressed unhurried confidence of habitual authority the white of a fine handkerchief in the breast pocket of his black dinner jacket he walked slowly down the stairs to the drawing room lookingto the satisfaction of the dowagers who watched himlike the perfect figure of a great industrialist he saw lillian at the foot of the stairs the patrician lines of a lemonyellow empire evening gown stressed her graceful body and she stood like a person proudly in control of her proper background he smiled he liked to see her happy it gave some reasonable justification to the party he approached herand stopped she had always shown good taste in her use of jewelry never wearing too much of it but tonight she wore an ostentatious display a diamond necklace earrings rings and brooches her arms looked conspicuously bare by contrast on her right wrist as sole ornament she wore the bracelet of rearden metal the glittering gems made it look like an ugly piece of dimestore jewelry when he moved his glance from her wrist to her face he found her looking at him her eyes were narrowed and he could not define their expression it was a look that seemed both veiled and purposeful the look of something hidden that flaunted its security from detection he wanted to tear the bracelet off her wrist instead in obedience to her voice gaily pronouncing an introduction he bowed to the dowager who stood beside her his face expressionless man what is man hes just a collection of chemicals with delusions of grandeur said dr pritchett to a group of guests across the room dr pritchett picked a canape off a crystal dish held it speared between two straight fingers and deposited it whole into his mouth mans metaphysical pretensions he said are preposterous a miserable bit of protoplasm full of ugly little concepts and mean little emotionsand it imagines itself important really you know that is the root of all the troubles in the world but which concepts are not ugly or mean professor asked an earnest matron whose husband owned an automobile factory none said dr pritchett none within the range of mans capacity a young man asked hesitantly but if we havent any good concepts how do we know that the ones weve got are ugly i mean by what standard there arent any standards this silenced his audience the philosophers of the past were superficial dr pritchett went on it remained for our century to redefine the purpose of philosophy the purpose of philosophy is not to help men find the meaning of life but to prove to them that there isnt any an attractive young woman whose father owned a coal mine asked indignantly who can tell us that i am trying to said dr pritchett for the last three years he had been head of the department of philosophy at the patrick henry university lillian rearden approached her jewels glittering under the lights the expression on her face was held to the soft hint of a smile set and faintly suggested like the waves of her hair it is this insistence of man upon meaning that makes him so difficult said dr pritchett once he realizes that he is of no importance whatever in the vast scheme of the universe that no possible significance can be attached to his activities that it does not matter whether he lives or dies he will become much more tractable he shrugged and reached for another canape a businessman said uneasily what i asked you about professor was what you thought about the equalization of opportunity bill oh that said dr pritchett but i believe i made it clear that i am in favor of it because i am in favor of a free economy a free economy cannot exist without competition therefore men must be forced to compete therefore we must control men in order to force them to be free but look isnt that sort of a contradiction not in the higher philosophical sense you must learn to see beyond the static definitions of oldfashioned thinking nothing is static in the universe everything is fluid but it stands to reason that if reason my dear fellow is the most naive of all superstitions that at least has been generally conceded in our age but i dont quite understand how we can you suffer from the popular delusion of believing that things can be understood you do not grasp the fact that the universe is a solid contradiction a contradiction of what asked the matron of itself how hows that my dear madam the duty of thinkers is not to explain but to demonstrate that nothing can be explained yes of course only the purpose of philosophy is not to seek knowledge but to prove that knowledge is impossible to man but when we prove it asked the young woman whats going to be left instinct said dr pritchett reverently at the other end of the room a group was listening to balph eubank he sat upright on the edge of an armchair in order to counteract the appearance of his face and figure which had a tendency to spread if relaxed the literature of the past said balph eubank was a shallow fraud it whitewashed life in order to please the money tycoons whom it served morality free will achievement happy endings and man as some sort of heroic beingall that stuff is laughable to us our age has given depth to literature for the first time by exposing the real essence of life a very young girl in a white evening gown asked timidly what is the real essence of life mr eubank suffering said balph eubank defeat and suffering but but why people are happy sometimes arent they that is a delusion of those whose emotions are superficial the girl blushed a wealthy woman who had inherited an oil refinery asked guiltily what should we do to raise the peoples literary taste mr eubank that is a great social problem said balph eubank he was described as the literary leader of the age but had never written a book that sold more than three thousand copies personally i believe that an equalization of opportunity bill applying to literature would be the solution oh do you approve of that bill for industry im not sure i know what to think of it certainly i approve of it our culture has sunk into a bog of materialism men have lost all spiritual values in their pursuit of material production and technological trickery theyre too comfortable they will return to a nobler life if we teach them to bear privations so we ought to place a limit upon their material greed i hadnt thought of it that way said the woman apologetically but how are you going to work an equalization of opportunity bill for literature ralph asked mort liddy thats a new one on me my name is balph said eubank angrily and its a new one on you because its my own idea okay okay im not quarreling am i im just asking mort liddy smiled he spent most of his time smiling nervously he was a composer who wrote oldfashioned scores for motion pictures and modern symphonies for sparse audiences it would work very simply said balph eubank there should be a law limiting the sale of any book to ten thousand copies this would throw the literary market open to new talent fresh ideas and noncommercial writing if people were forbidden to buy a million copies of the same piece of trash they would be forced to buy better books youve got something there said mort liddy but wouldnt it be kinda tough on the writers bank accounts so much the better only those whose motive is not moneymaking should be allowed to write but mr eubank asked the young girl in the white dress what if more than ten thousand people want to buy a certain book ten thousand readers is enough for any book thats not what i mean i mean what if they want it that is irrelevant but if a book has a good story which plot is a primitive vulgarity in literature said balph eubank contemptuously dr pritchett on his way across the room to the bar stopped to say quite so just as logic is a primitive vulgarity in philosophy just as melody is a primitive vulgarity in music said mort liddy whats all this noise asked lillian rearden glittering to a stop beside them lillian my angel balph eubank drawled did i tell you that im dedicating my new novel to you why thank you darling what is the name of your new novel asked the wealthy woman the heart is a milkman what is it about frustration but mr eubank asked the young girl in the white dress blushing desperately if everything is frustration what is there to live for brotherlove said balph eubank grimly bertram scudder stood slouched against the bar his long thin face looked as if it had shrunk inward with the exception of his mouth and eyeballs which were left to protrude as three soft globes he was the editor of a magazine called the future and he had written an article on hank rearden entitled the octopus bertram scudder picked up his empty glass and shoved it silently toward the bartender to be refilled he took a gulp from his fresh drink noticed the empty glass in front of philip rearden who stood beside him and jerked his thumb in a silent command to the bartender he ignored the empty glass in front of betty pope who stood at philips other side look bud said bertram scudder his eyeballs focused approximately in the direction of philip whether you like it or not the equalization of opportunity bill represents a great step forward what made you think that i did not like it mr scudder philip asked humbly well its going to pinch isnt it the long arm of society is going to trim a little off the hors doeuvres bill around here he waved his hand at the bar why do you assume that i object to that you dont bertram scudder asked without curiosity i dont said philip hotly i have always placed the public good above any personal consideration i have contributed my time and money to friends of global progress in their crusade for the equalization of opportunity bill i think it is perfectly unfair that one man should get all the breaks and leave none to others bertram scudder considered him speculatively but without particular interest well thats quite unusually nice of you he said some people do take moral issues seriously mr scudder said philip with a gentle stress of pride in his voice whats he talking about philip asked betty pope we dont know anybody who owns more than one business do we oh pipe down said bertram scudder his voice bored i dont see why theres so much fuss about that equalization of opportunity bill said betty pope aggressively in the tone of an expert on economics i dont see why businessmen object to it its to their own advantage if everybody else is poor they wont have any market for their goods but if they stop being selfish and share the goods theyve hoardedtheyll have a chance to work hard and produce some more i do not see why industrialists should be considered at all said scudder when the masses are destitute and yet there are goods available its idiotic to expect people to be stopped by some scrap of paper called a property deed property rights are a superstition one holds property only by the courtesy of those who do not seize it the people can seize it at any moment if they can why shouldnt they they should said claude slagenhop they need it need is the only consideration if people are in need weve got to seize things first and talk about it afterwards claude slagenhop had approached and managed to squeeze himself between philip and scudder shoving scudder aside imperceptibly slagenhop was not tall or heavy but he had a square compact bulk and a broken nose he was the president of friends of global progress hunger wont wait said claude slagenhop ideas are just hot air an empty belly is a solid fact ive said in all my speeches that its not necessary to talk too much society is suffering for lack of business opportunities at the moment so weve got the right to seize such opportunities as exist right is whatevers good for society he didnt dig that ore singlehanded did he cried philip suddenly his voice shrill he had to employ hundreds of workers they did it why does he think hes so good the two men looked at him scudder lifting an eyebrow slagenhop without expression oh dear me said betty pope remembering hank rearden stood at a window in a dim recess at the end of the drawing room he hoped no one would notice him for a few minutes he had just escaped from a middleaged woman who had been telling him about her psychic experiences he stood looking out far in the distance the red glow of rearden steel moved in the sky he watched it for a moments relief he turned to look at the drawing room he had never liked his house it had been lillians choice but tonight the shifting colors of the evening dresses drowned out the appearance of the room and gave it an air of brilliant gaiety he liked to see people being gay even though he did not understand this particular manner of enjoyment he looked at the flowers at the sparks of light on the crystal glasses at the naked arms and shoulders of women there was a cold wind outside sweeping empty stretches of land he saw the thin branches of a tree being twisted like arms waving in an appeal for help the tree stood against the glow of the mills he could not name his sudden emotion he had no words to state its cause its quality its meaning some part of it was joy but it was solemn like the act of baring ones headhe did not know to whom when he stepped back into the crowd he was smiling but the smile vanished abruptly he saw the entrance of a new guest it was dagny taggart lillian moved forward to meet her studying her with curiosity they had met before on infrequent occasions and she found it strange to see dagny taggart wearing an evening gown it was a black dress with a bodice that fell as a cape over one arm and shoulder leaving the other bare the naked shoulder was the gowns only ornament seeing her in the suits she wore one never thought of dagny taggarts body the black dress seemed excessively revealingbecause it was astonishing to discover that the lines of her shoulder were fragile and beautiful and that the diamond band on the wrist of her naked arm gave her the most feminine of all aspects the look of being chained miss taggart it is such a wonderful surprise to see you here said lillian rearden the muscles of her face performing the motions of a smile i had not really dared to hope that an invitation from me would take you away from your ever so much weightier concerns do permit me to feel flattered james taggart had entered with his sister lillian smiled at him in the manner of a hasty postscript as if noticing him for the first time hello james thats your penalty for being popularone tends to lose sight of you in the surprise of seeing your sister no one can match you in popularity lillian he answered smiling thinly nor ever lose sight of you me oh but i am quite resigned to taking second place in the shadow of my husband i am humbly aware that the wife of a great man has to be contented with reflected glorydont you think so miss taggart no said dagny i dont is this a compliment or a reproach miss taggart but do forgive me if i confess im helpless whom may i present to you im afraid i have nothing but writers and artists to offer and they wouldnt interest you im sure id like to find hank and say hello to him but of course james do you remember you said you wanted to meet balph eubankoh yes hes hereill tell him that i heard you rave about his last novel at mrs whitcombs dinner walking across the room dagny wondered why she had said that she wanted to find hank rearden what had prevented her from admitting that she had seen him the moment she entered rearden stood at the other end of the long room looking at her he watched her as she approached but he did not step forward to meet her hello hank good evening he bowed courteously impersonally the movement of his body matching the distinguished formality of his clothes he did not smile thank you for inviting me tonight she said gaily i cannot claim that i knew you were coming oh then im glad that mrs rearden thought of me i wanted to make an exception an exception i dont go to parties very often i am pleased that you chose this occasion as the exception he did not add miss taggart but it sounded as if he had the formality of his manner was so unexpected that she was unable to adjust to it i wanted to celebrate she said to celebrate my wedding anniversary oh is it your wedding anniversary i didnt know my congratulations hank what did you wish to celebrate i thought id permit myself a rest a celebration of my ownin your honor and mine for what reason she was thinking of the new track on the rocky grades of the colorado mountains growing slowly toward the distant goal of the wyatt oil fields she was seeing the greenishblue glow of the rails on the frozen ground among the dried weeds the naked boulders the rotting shanties of halfstarved settlements in honor of the first sixty miles of rearden metal track she answered i appreciate it the tone of his voice was the one that would have been proper if he had said ive never heard of it she found nothing else to say she felt as if she were speaking to a stranger why miss taggart a cheerful voice broke their silence now this is what i mean when i say that hank rearden can achieve any miracle a businessman whom they knew had approached smiling at her in delighted astonishment the three of them had often held emergency conferences about freight rates and steel deliveries now he looked at her his face an open comment on the change in her appearance the change she thought which rearden had not noticed she laughed answering the mans greeting giving herself no time to recognize the unexpected stab of disappointment the unadmitted thought that she wished she had seen this look on reardens face instead she exchanged a few sentences with the man when she glanced around rearden was gone so that is your famous sister said balph eubank to james taggart looking at dagny across the room i was not aware that my sister was famous said taggart a faint bite in his voice but my good man shes an unusual phenomenon in the field of economics so you must expect people to talk about her your sister is a symptom of the illness of our century a decadent product of the machine age machines have destroyed mans humanity taken him away from the soil robbed him of his natural arts killed his soul and turned him into an insensitive robot theres an example of ita woman who runs a railroad instead of practicing the beautiful craft of the handloom and bearing children rearden moved among the guests trying not to be trapped into conversation he looked at the room he saw no one he wished to approach say hank rearden youre not such a bad fellow at all when seen close up in the lions own den you ought to give us a press conference once in a while youd win us over rearden turned and looked at the speaker incredulously it was a young newspaperman of the seedier sort who worked on a radical tabloid the offensive familiarity of his manner seemed to imply that he chose to be rude to rearden because he knew that rearden should never have permitted himself to associate with a man of his kind rearden would not have allowed him inside the mills but the man was lillians guest he controlled himself he asked dryly what do you want youre not so bad youve got talent technological talent but of course i dont agree with you about rearden metal i havent asked you to agree well bertram scudder said that your policy the man started belligerently pointing toward the bar but stopped as if he had slid farther than he intended rearden looked at the untidy figure slouched against the bar lillian had introduced them but he had paid no attention to the name he turned sharply and walked off in a manner that forbade the young bum to tag him lillian glanced up at his face when rearden approached her in the midst of a group and without a word stepped aside where they could not be heard is that scudder of the future he asked pointing why yes he looked at her silently unable to begin to believe it unable to find the lead of a thought with which to begin to understand her eyes were watching him how could you invite him here he asked now henry dont lets be ridiculous you dont want to be narrow minded do you you must learn to tolerate the opinions of others and respect their right of free speech in my house oh dont be stuffy he did not speak because his consciousness was held not by coherent statements but by two pictures that seemed to glare at him insistently he saw the article the octopus by bertram scudder which was not an expression of ideas but a bucket of slime emptied in publican article that did not contain a single fact not even an invented one but poured a stream of sneers and adjectives in which nothing was clear except the filthy malice of denouncing without considering proof necessary and he saw the lines of lillians profile the proud purity which he had sought in marrying her when he noticed her again he realized that the vision of her profile was in his own mind because she was turned to him fullface watching him in the sudden instant of returning to reality he thought that what he saw in her eyes was enjoyment but in the next instant he reminded himself that he was sane and that this was not possible its the first time youve invited that he used an obscene word with unemotional precision to my house its the last how dare you use such dont argue lillian if you do ill throw him out right now he gave her a moment to answer to object to scream at him if she wished she remained silent not looking at him only her smooth cheeks seemed faintly drawn inward as if deflated moving blindly away through the coils of lights voices and perfume he felt a cold touch of dread he knew that he should think of lillian and find the answer to the riddle of her character because this was a revelation which he could not ignore but he did not think of herand he felt the dread because he knew that the answer had ceased to matter to him long ago the flood of weariness was starting to rise again he felt as if he could almost see it in thickening waves it was not within him but outside spreading through the room for an instant he felt as if he were alone lost in a gray desert needing help and knowing that no help would come he stopped short in the lighted doorway the length of the room between them he saw the tall arrogant figure of a man who had paused for a moment before entering he had never met the man but of all the notorious faces that cluttered the pages of newspapers this was the one he despised it was francisco danconia rearden had never given much thought to men like bertram scudder but with every hour of his life with the strain and the pride of every moment when his muscles or his mind had ached from effort with every step he had taken to rise out of the mines of minnesota and to turn his effort into gold with all of his profound respect for money and for its meaning he despised the squanderer who did not know how to deserve the great gift of inherited wealth there he thought was the most contemptible representative of the species he saw francisco danconia enter bow to lillian then walk into the crowd as if he owned the room which he had never entered before heads turned to watch him as if he pulled them on strings in his wake approaching lillian once more rearden said without anger the contempt becoming amusement in his voice i didnt know you knew that one ive met him at a few parties is he one of your friends too certainly not the sharp resentment was genuine then why did you invite him well you cant give a partynot a party that countswhile hes in this country without inviting him its a nuisance if he comes and a social black mark if he doesnt rearden laughed she was off guard she did not usually admit things of this kind look he said wearily i dont want to spoil your party but keep that man away from me dont come around with introductions i dont want to meet him i dont know how youll work that but youre an expert hostess so work it dagny stood still when she saw francisco approaching he bowed to her as he passed by he did not stop but she knew that he had stopped the moment in his mind she saw him smile faintly in deliberate emphasis of what he understood and did not choose to acknowledge she turned away she hoped to avoid him for the rest of the evening balph eubank had joined the group around dr pritchett and was saying sullenly no you cannot expect people to understand the higher reaches of philosophy culture should be taken out of the hands of the dollarchasers we need a national subsidy for literature it is disgraceful that artists are treated like peddlers and that art works have to be sold like soap you mean your complaint is that they dont sell like soap asked francisco danconia they had not noticed him approach the conversation stopped as if slashed off most of them had never met him but they all recognized him at once i meant balph eubank started angrily and closed his mouth he saw the eager interest on the faces of his audience but it was not interest in philosophy any longer why hello professor said francisco bowing to dr pritchett there was no pleasure in dr pritchetts face when he answered the greeting and performed a few introductions we were just discussing a most interesting subject said the earnest matron dr pritchett was telling us that nothing is anything he should undoubtedly know more than anyone else about that francisco answered gravely i wouldnt have supposed that you knew dr pritchett so well senor danconia she said and wondered why the professor looked displeased by her remark i am an alumnus of the great school that employs dr pritchett at present the patrick henry university but i studied under one of his predecessorshugh akston hugh akston the attractive young woman gasped but you couldnt have senor danconia youre not old enough i thought he was one of those great names of of the last century perhaps in spirit madame not in fact but i thought he died years ago why no he is still alive then why dont we ever hear about him any more he retired nine years ago isnt it odd when a politician or a movie star retires we read front page stories about it but when a philosopher retires people do not even notice it they do eventually a young man said astonished i thought hugh akston was one of those classics that nobody studied any more except in histories of philosophy i read an article recently which referred to him as the last of the great advocates of reason just what did hugh akston teach asked the earnest matron francisco answered he taught that everything is something your loyalty to your teacher is laudable senior danconia said dr pritchett dryly may we take it that you are an example of the practical results of his teaching i am james taggart had approached the group and was waiting to be noticed hello francisco good evening james what a wonderful coincidence seeing you here ive been very anxious to speak to you thats new you havent always been now youre joking just like in the old days taggart was moving slowly as if casually away from the group hoping to draw francisco after him you know that theres not a person in this room who wouldnt love to talk to you really id be inclined to suspect the opposite francisco had followed obediently but stopped within hearing distance of the others i have tried in every possible way to get in touch with you said taggart but but circumstances didnt permit me to succeed are you trying to hide from me the fact that i refused to see you well that is i mean why did you refuse i couldnt imagine what you wanted to speak to me about the san sebastian mines of course taggarts voice rose a little why what about them but now look francisco this is serious its a disaster an unprecedented disasterand nobody can make any sense out of it i dont know what to think i dont understand it at all i have a right to know a right arent you being oldfashioned james but what is it you want to know well first of all that nationalizationwhat are you going to do about it nothing nothing but surely you dont want me to do anything about it my mines and your railroad were seized by the will of the people you wouldnt want me to oppose the will of the people would you francisco this is not a laughing matter i never thought it was im entitled to an explanation you owe your stockholders an account of the whole disgraceful affair why did you pick a worthless mine why did you waste all those millions what sort of rotten swindle was it francisco stood looking at him in polite astonishment why james he said i thought you would approve of it approve i thought you would consider the san sebastian mines as the practical realization of an ideal of the highest moral order remembering that you and i have disagreed so often in the past i thought you would be gratified to see me acting in accordance with your principles what are you talking about francisco shook his head regretfully i dont know why you should call my behavior rotten i thought you would recognize it as an honest effort to practice what the whole world is preaching doesnt everyone believe that it is evil to be selfish i was totally selfless in regard to the san sebastian project isnt it evil to pursue a personal interest i had no personal interest in it whatever isnt it evil to work for profit i did not work for profiti took a loss doesnt everyone agree that the purpose and justification of an industrial enterprise are not production but the livelihood of its employees the san sebastian mines were the most eminently successful venture in industrial history they produced no copper but they provided a livelihood for thousands of men who could not have achieved in a lifetime the equivalent of what they got for one days work which they could not do isnt it generally agreed that an owner is a parasite and an exploiter that it is the employees who do all the work and make the product possible i did not exploit anyone i did not burden the san sebastian mines with my useless presence i left them in the hands of the men who count i did not pass judgment on the value of that property i turned it over to a mining specialist he was not a very good specialist but he needed the job very badly isnt it generally conceded that when you hire a man for a job it is his need that counts not his ability doesnt everyone believe that in order to get the goods all you have to do is need them i have carried out every moral precept of our age i expected gratitude and a citation of honor i do not understand why i am being damned in the silence of those who had listened the sole comment was the shrill sudden giggle of betty pope she had understood nothing but she saw the look of helpless fury on james taggarts face people were looking at taggart expecting an answer they were indifferent to the issue they were merely amused by the spectacle of someones embarrassment taggart achieved a patronizing smile you dont expect me to take this seriously he asked there was a time francisco answered when i did not believe that anyone could take it seriously i was wrong this is outrageous taggarts voice started to rise its perfectly outrageous to treat your public responsibilities with such thoughtless levity he turned to hurry away francisco shrugged spreading his hands you see i didnt think you wanted to speak to me rearden stood alone far at the other end of the room philip noticed him approached and waved to lillian calling her over lillian i dont think that henry is having a good time he said smiling one could not tell whether the mockery of his smile was directed at lillian or at rearden cant we do something about it oh nonsense said rearden i wish i knew what to do about it philip said lillian ive always wished henry would learn to relax hes so grimly serious about everything hes such a rigid puritan ive always wanted to see him drunk just once but ive given up what would you suggest oh i dont know but he shouldnt be standing around all by himself drop it said rearden while thinking dimly that he did not want to hurt their feelings he could not prevent himself from adding you dont know how hard ive tried to be left standing all by myself thereyou see lillian smiled at philip to enjoy life and people is not so simple as pouring a ton of steel intellectual pursuits are not learned in the market place philip chuckled its not intellectual pursuits im worried about how sure are you about that puritan stuff lillian if i were you i wouldnt leave him free to look around there are too many beautiful women here tonight henry entertaining thoughts of infidelity you flatter him philip you overestimate his courage she smiled at rearden coldly for a brief stressed moment then moved away rearden looked at his brother what in hell do you think youre doing oh stop playing the puritan cant you take a joke moving aimlessly through the crowd dagny wondered why she had accepted the invitation to this party the answer astonished her it was because she had wanted to see hank rearden watching him in the crowd she realized the contrast for the first time the faces of the others looked like aggregates of interchangeable features every face oozing to blend into the anonymity of resembling all and all looking as if they were melting reardens face with the sharp planes the pale blue eyes the ashblond hair had the firmness of ice the uncompromising clarity of its lines made it look among the others as if he were moving through a fog hit by a ray of light her eyes kept returning to him involuntarily she never caught him glancing in her direction she could not believe that he was avoiding her intentionally there could be no possible reason for it yet she felt certain that he was she wanted to approach him and convince herself that she was mistaken something stopped her she could not understand her own reluctance rearden bore patiently a conversation with his mother and two ladies whom she wished him to entertain with stories of his youth and his struggle he complied telling himself that she was proud of him in her own way but he felt as if something in her manner kept suggesting that she had nursed him through his struggle and that she was the source of his success he was glad when she let him go then he escaped once more to the recess of the window he stood there for a while leaning on a sense of privacy as if it were a physical support mr rearden said a strangely quiet voice beside him permit me to introduce myself my name is danconia rearden turned startled danconias manner and voice had a quality he had seldom encountered before a tone of authentic respect how do you do he answered his voice was brusque and dry but he had answered i have observed that mrs rearden has been trying to avoid the necessity of presenting me to you and i can guess the reason would you prefer that i leave your house the action of naming an issue instead of evading it was so unlike the usual behavior of all the men he knew it was such a sudden startling relief that rearden remained silent for a moment studying danconias face francisco had said it very simply neither as a reproach nor a plea but in a manner which strangely acknowledged reardens dignity and his own no said rearden whatever else you guessed i did not say that thank you in that case you will allow me to speak to you why should you wish to speak to me my motives cannot interest you at present mine is not the sort of conversation that could interest you at all you are mistaken about one of us mr rearden or both i came to this party solely in order to meet you there had been a faint tone of amusement in reardens voice now it hardened into a hint of contempt you started by playing it straight stick to it i am what did you want to meet me for in order to make me lose money francisco looked straight at him yeseventually what is it this time a gold mine francisco shook his head slowly the conscious deliberation of the movement gave it an air that was almost sadness no he said i dont want to sell you anything as a matter of fact i did not attempt to sell the copper mine to james taggart either he came to me for it you wont rearden chuckled if you understand that much we have at least a sensible basis for conversation proceed on that if you dont have some fancy investment in mind what did you want to meet me for in order to become acquainted with you thats not an answer its just another way of saying the same thing not quite mr rearden unless you meanin order to gain my confidence no i dont like people who speak or think in terms of gaining anybodys confidence if ones actions are honest one does not need the predated confidence of others only their rational perception the person who craves a moral blank check of that kind has dishonest intentions whether he admits it to himself or not reardens startled glance at him was like the involuntary thrust of a hand grasping for support in a desperate need the glance betrayed how much he wanted to find the sort of man he thought he was seeing then rearden lowered his eyes almost closing them slowly shutting out the vision and the need his face was hard it had an expression of severity an inner severity directed at himself it looked austere and lonely all right he said tonelessly what do you want if its not my confidence i want to learn to understand you what for for a reason of my own which need not concern you at present what do you want to understand about me francisco looked silently out at the darkness the fire of the mills was dying down there was only a faint tinge of red left on the edge of the earth just enough to outline the scraps of clouds ripped by the tortured battle of the storm in the sky dim shapes kept sweeping through space and vanishing shapes which were branches but looked as if they were the fury of the wind made visible its a terrible night for any animal caught unprotected on that plain said francisco danconia this is when one should appreciate the meaning of being a man rearden did not answer for a moment then he said as if in answer to himself a tone of wonder in his voice funny what you told me what i was thinking just a while ago you were only i didnt have the words for it shall i tell you the rest of the words go ahead you stood here and watched the storm with the greatest pride one can ever feelbecause you are able to have summer flowers and half naked women in your house on a night like this in demonstration of your victory over that storm and if it werent for you most of those who are here would be left helpless at the mercy of that wind in the middle of some such plain how did you know that in tune with his question rearden realized that it was not his thoughts this man had named but his most hidden most persona emotion and that he who would never confess his emotions to anyone had confessed it in his question he saw the faintest flicker in franciscos eyes as of a smile or a check mark what would you know about a pride of that kind rearden asked sharply as if the contempt of the second question could erase the confidence of the first that is what i felt once when i was young rearden looked at him there was neither mockery nor selfpity in franciscos face the fine sculptured planes and the clear blue eyes held a quiet composure the face was open offered to any blow unflinching why do you want to talk about it rearden asked prompted by a moments reluctant compassion let us sayby way of gratitude mr rearden gratitude to me if you will accept it reardens voice hardened i havent asked for gratitude i dont need it i have not said you needed it but of all those whom you are saving from the storm tonight i am the only one who will offer it after a moments silence rearden asked his voice low with a sound which was almost a threat what are you trying to do i am calling your attention to the nature of those for whom you are working it would take a man whos never done an honest days work in his life to think or say that the contempt in reardens voice had a note of relief he had been disarmed by a doubt of his judgment on the character of his adversary now he felt certain once more you wouldnt understand it if i told you that the man who works works for himself even if he does carry the whole wretched bunch of you along now ill guess what youre thinking go ahead say that its evil that im selfish conceited heartless cruel i am i dont want any part of that tripe about working for others im not for the first time he saw the look of a personal reaction in franciscos eyes the look of something eager and young the only thing thats wrong in what you said francisco answered is that you permit anyone to call it evil in reardens pause of incredulous silence he pointed at the crowd in the drawing room why are you willing to carry them because theyre a bunch of miserable children who struggle to remain alive desperately and very badly while ii dont even notice the burden why dont you tell them that what that youre working for your own sake not theirs they know it oh yes they know it every single one of them here knows it but they dont think you do and the aim of all their efforts is to keep you from knowing it why should i care what they think because its a battle in which one must make ones stand clear a battle what battle i hold the whip hand i dont fight the disarmed are they they have a weapon against you its their only weapon but its a terrible one ask yourself what it is some time where do you see any evidence of it in the unforgivable fact that youre as unhappy as you are rearden could accept any form of reproach abuse damnation anyone chose to throw at him the only human reaction which he would not accept was pity the stab of a coldly rebellious anger brought him back to the full context of the moment he spoke fighting not to acknowledge the nature of the emotion rising within him what sort of effrontery are you indulging in whats your motive let us sayto give you the words you need for the time when youll need them why should you want to speak to me on such a subject in the hope that you will remember it what he felt thought rearden was anger at the incomprehensible fact that he had allowed himself to enjoy this conversation he felt a dim sense of betrayal the hint of an unknown danger do you expect me to forget what you are he asked knowing that this was what he had forgotten i do not expect you to think of me at all under his anger the emotion which rearden would not acknowledge remained unstated and unthought he knew it only as a hint of pain had he faced it he would have known that he still heard franciscos voice saying i am the only one who will offer it if you will accept it he heard the words and the strangely solemn inflection of the quiet voice and an inexplicable answer of his own something within him that wanted to cry yes to accept to tell this man that he accepted that he needed itthough there was no name for what he needed it was not gratitude and he knew that it was not gratitude this man had meant aloud he said i didnt seek to talk to you but youve asked for it and youre going to hear it to me theres only one form of human depravitythe man without a purpose that is true i can forgive all those others theyre not vicious theyre merely helpless but youyoure the kind who cant be forgiven it is against the sin of forgiveness that i wanted to warn you you had the greatest chance in life what have you done with it if you have the mind to understand all the things you said how can you speak to me at all how can you face anyone after the sort of irresponsible destruction youve perpetrated in that mexican business it is your right to condemn me for it if you wish dagny stood by the corner of the window recess listening they did not notice her she had seen them together and she had approached drawn by an impulse she could not explain or resist it seemed crucially important that she know what these two men said to each other she had heard their last few sentences she had never thought it possible that she would see francisco taking a beating he could smash any adversary in any form of encounter yet he stood offering no defense she knew that it was not indifference she knew his face well enough to see the effort his calm cost himshe saw the faint line of a muscle pulled tight across his cheek of all those who live by the ability of others said rearden youre the one real parasite i have given you grounds to think so then what right have you to talk about the meaning of being a man youre the one who has betrayed it i am sorry if i have offended you by what you may rightly consider as a presumption francisco bowed and turned to go rearden said involuntarily not knowing that the question negated his anger that it was a plea to stop this man and hold him what did you want to learn to understand about me francisco turned the expression of his face had not changed it was still a look of gravely courteous respect i have learned it he answered rearden stood watching him as he walked off into the crowd the figures of a butler with a crystal dish and of dr pritchett stooping to choose another canape hid francisco from sight rearden glanced out at the darkness nothing could be seen there but the wind dagny stepped forward when he came out of the recess she smiled openly inviting conversation he stopped it seemed to her that he had stopped reluctantly she spoke hastily to break the silence hank why do you have so many intellectuals of the looter persuasion here i wouldnt have them in my house this was not what she had wanted to say to him but she did not know what she wanted to say never before had she felt herself left wordless in his presence she saw his eyes narrowing like a door being closed i see no reason why one should not invite them to a party he answered coldly oh i didnt mean to criticize your choice of guests but well ive been trying not to learn which one of them is bertram scudder if i do ill slap his face she tried to sound casual i dont want to create a scene but im not sure ill be able to control myself i couldnt believe it when somebody told me that mrs rearden had invited him i invited him but then her voice dropped why i dont attach any importance to occasions of this kind im sorry hank i didnt know you were so tolerant im not he said nothing i know you dont like parties neither do i but sometimes i wonder perhaps were the only ones who were meant to be able to enjoy them i am afraid i have no talent for it not for this but do you think any of these people are enjoying it theyre just straining to be more senseless and aimless than usual to be light and unimportant you know i think that only if one feels immensely important can one feel truly light i wouldnt know its just a thought that disturbs me once in a while i thought it about my first ball i keep thinking that parties are intended to be celebrations and celebrations should be only for those who have something to celebrate i have never thought of it she could not adapt her words to the rigid formality of his manner she could not quite believe it they had always been at ease together in his office now he was like a man in a strait jacket hank look at it if you didnt know any of these people wouldnt it seem beautiful the lights and the clothes and all the imagination that went to make it possible she was looking at the room she did not notice that he had not followed her glance he was looking down at the shadows on her naked shoulder the soft blue shadows made by the light that fell through the strands of her hair why have we left it all to fools it should have been ours in what manner i dont know ive always expected parties to be exciting and brilliant like some rare drink she laughed there was a note of sadness in it but i dont drink either thats just another symbol that doesnt mean what it was intended to mean he was silent she added perhaps theres something that we have missed i am not aware of it in a flash of sudden desolate emptiness she was glad that he had not understood or responded feeling dimly that she had revealed too much yet not knowing what she had revealed she shrugged the movement running through the curve of her shoulder like a faint convulsion its just an old illusion of mine she said indifferently just a mood that comes once every year or two let me see the latest steel price index and ill forget all about it she did not know that his eyes were following her as she walked away from him she moved slowly through the room looking at no one she noticed a small group huddled by the unlighted fireplace the room was not cold but they sat as if they drew comfort from the thought of a nonexistent fire i do not know why but i am growing to be afraid of the dark no not now only when i am alone what frightens me is night night as such the speaker was an elderly spinster with an air of breeding and hopelessness the three women and two men of the group were well dressed the skin of their faces was smoothly well tended but they had a manner of anxious caution that kept their voices one tone lower than normal and blurred the differences of their ages giving them all the same gray look of being spent it was the look one saw in groups of respectable people everywhere dagny stopped and listened but my dear one of them asked why should it frighten you i dont know said the spinster i am not afraid of prowlers or robberies or anything of the sort but i stay awake all night i fall asleep only when i see the sky turning pale it is very odd every evening when it grows dark i get the feeling that this tune it is final that daylight will not return my cousin who lives on the coast of maine wrote me the same thing said one of the women last night said the spinster i stayed awake because of the shooting there were guns going off all night way out at sea there were no flashes there was nothing just those detonations at long intervals somewhere in the fog over the atlantic i read something about it in the paper this morning coast guard target practice why no the spinster said indifferently everybody down on the shore knows what it was it was ragnar danneskjold it was the coast guard trying to catch him ragnar danneskjold in delaware bay a woman gasped oh yes they say it is not the first time did they catch him no nobody can catch him said one of the men the peoples state of norway has offered a milliondollar reward for his head thats an awful lot of money to pay for a pirates head but how are we going to have any order or security or planning in the world with a pirate running loose all over the seven seas do you know what it was that he seized last night said the spinster the big ship with the relief supplies we were sending to the peoples state of france how does he dispose of the goods he seizes ah thatnobody knows i met a sailor once from a ship hed attacked whod seen him in person he said that ragnar danneskjold has the purest gold hair and the most frightening face on earth a face with no sign of any feeling if there ever was a man born without a heart hes itthe sailor said a nephew of mine saw ragnar danneskjolds ship one night off the coast of scotland he wrote me that he couldnt believe his eyes it was a better ship than any in the navy of the peoples state of england they say he hides in one of those norwegian fjords where neither god nor man will ever find him thats where the vikings used to hide in the middle ages theres a reward on his head offered by the peoples state of portugal too and by the peoples state of turkey they say its a national scandal in norway he comes from one of their best families the family lost its money generations ago but the name is of the noblest the ruins of their castle are still in existence his father is a bishop his father has disowned him and excommunicated him but it had no effect did you know that ragnar danneskjold went to school in this country sure the patrick henry university not really oh yes you can look it up what bothers me is you know i dont like it i dont like it that hes now appearing right here in our own waters i thought things like that could happen only in the wastelands only in europe but a bigscale outlaw of that kind operating in delaware in our day and age hes been seen off nantucket too and at bar harbor the newspapers have been asked not to write about it why they dont want people to know that the navy cant cope with him i dont like it it feels funny its like something out of the dark ages dagny glanced up she saw francisco danconia standing a few steps away he was looking at her with a kind of stressed curiosity his eyes were mocking its a strange world were living in said the spinster her voice low i read an article said one of the women tonelessly it said that times of trouble are good for us it is good that people are growing poorer to accept privations is a moral virtue i suppose so said another without conviction we must not worry i heard a speech that said it is useless to worry or to blame anyone nobody can help what he does that is the way things made him there is nothing we can do about anything we must learn to bear it whats the use anyway what is mans fate hasnt it always been to hope but never to achieve the wise man is the one who does not attempt to hope that is the right attitude to take i dont know i dont know what is right any more how can we ever know oh well who is john galt dagny turned brusquely and started away from them one of the women followed her but i do know it said the woman in the soft mysterious tone of sharing a secret you know what i know who is john galt who dagny asked tensely stopping i know a man who knew john galt in person this man is an old friend of a greataunt of mine he was there and he saw it happen do you know the legend of atlantis miss taggart what atlantis why vaguely the isles of the blessed that is what the greeks called it thousands of years ago they said atlantis was a place where herospirits lived in a happiness unknown to the rest of the earth a place which only the spirits of heroes could enter and they reached it without dying because they carried the secret of life within them atlantis was lost to mankind even then but the greeks knew that it had existed they tried to find it some of them said it was underground hidden in the heart of the earth but most of them said it was an island a radiant island in the western ocean perhaps what they were thinking of was america they never found it for centuries afterward men said it was only a legend they did not believe it but they never stopped looking for it because they knew that that was what they had to find well what about john galt he found it dagnys interest was gone who was he john galt was a millionaire a man of inestimable wealth he was sailing his yacht one night in midatlantic fighting the worst storm ever wreaked upon the world when he found it he saw it in the depth where it had sunk to escape the reach of men he saw the towers of atlantis shining on the bottom of the ocean it was a sight of such kind that when one had seen it one could no longer wish to look at the rest of the earth john galt sank his ship and went down with his entire crew they all chose to do it my friend was the only one who survived how interesting my friend saw it with his own eyes said the woman offended it happened many years ago but john galts family hushed up the story and what happened to his fortune dont recall ever hearing of a galt fortune it went down with him she added belligerently you dont have to believe it miss taggart doesnt said francisco danconia i do they turned he had followed them and he stood looking at them with the insolence of exaggerated earnestness have you ever had faith in anything senor danconia the woman asked angrily no madame he chuckled at her brusque departure dagny asked coldly whats the joke the jokes on that fool woman she doesnt know that she was telling you the truth do you expect me to believe that no then what do you find so amusing oh a great many things here dont you no well thats one of the things i find amusing francisco will you leave me alone but i have didnt you notice that you were first to speak to me tonight why do you keep watching me curiosity about what your reaction to the things which you dont find amusing why should you care about my reaction to anything that is my own way of having a good time which incidentally you are not having are you dagny besides youre the only woman worth watching here she stood defiantly still because the way he looked at her demanded an angry escape she stood as she always did straight and taut her head lifted impatiently it was the unfeminine pose of an executive but her naked shoulder betrayed the fragility of the body under the black dress and the pose made her most truly a woman the proud strength became a challenge to someones superior strength and the fragility a reminder that the challenge could be broken she was not conscious of it she had met no one able to see it he said looking down at her body dagny what a magnificent waste she had to turn and escape she felt herself blushing for the first time in years blushing because she knew suddenly that the sentence named what she had felt all evening she ran trying not to think the music stopped her it was a sudden blast from the radio she noticed mort liddy who had turned it on waving his arms to a group of friends yelling thats it thats it i want you to hear it the great burst of sound was the opening chords of halleys fourth concerto it rose in tortured triumph speaking its denial of pain its hymn to a distant vision then the notes broke it was as if a handful of mud and pebbles had been flung at the music and what followed was the sound of the rolling and the dripping it was halleys concerto swung into a popular tune it was halleys melody torn apart its holes stuffed with hiccoughs the great statement of joy had become the giggling of a barroom yet it was still the remnant of halleys melody that gave it form it was the melody that supported it like a spinal cord pretty good mort liddy was smiling at his friends boastfully and nervously pretty good eh best movie score of the year got me a prize got me a longterm contract yeah this was my score for heavens in your backyard dagny stood staring at the room as if one sense could replace another as if sight could wipe out sound she moved her head in a slow circle trying to find an anchor somewhere she saw francisco leaning against a column his arms crossed he was looking straight at her he was laughing dont shake like this she thought get out of here this was the approach of an anger she could not control she thought say nothing walk steadily get out she had started walking cautiously very slowly she heard lillians words and stopped lillian had said it many times this evening in answer to the same question but it was the first time that dagny heard it this lillian was saying extending her arm with the metal bracelet for the inspection of two smartly groomed women why no its not from a hardware store its a very special gift from my husband oh yes of course its hideous but dont you sec its supposed to be priceless of course id exchange it for a common diamond bracelet any time but somehow nobody will offer me one for it even though it is so very very valuable why my dear its the first thing ever made of rearden metal dagny did not see the room she did not hear the music she felt the pressure of dead stillness against her eardrums she did not know the moment that preceded or the moments that were to follow she did not know those involved neither herself nor lillian nor rearden nor the meaning of her own action it was a single instant blasted out of context she had heard she was looking at the bracelet of greenblue metal she felt the movement of something being torn off her wrist and she heard her own voice saying in the great stillness very calmly a voice cold as a skeleton naked of emotion if you are not the coward that i think you are you will exchange it on the palm of her hand she was extending her diamond bracelet to lillian youre not serious miss taggart said a womans voice it was not lillians voice lillians eyes were looking straight at her she saw them lillian knew that she was serious give me that bracelet said dagny lifting her palm higher the diamond band glittering across it this is horrible cried some woman it was strange that the cry stood out so sharply then dagny realized that there were people standing around them and that they all stood in silence she was hearing sounds now even the music it was halleys mangled concerto somewhere far away she saw reardens face it looked as if something within him were mangled like the music she did not know by what he was watching them lillians mouth moved into an upturned crescent it resembled a smile she snapped the metal bracelet open dropped it on dagnys palm and took the diamond band thank you miss taggart she said dagnys fingers closed about the metal she felt that she felt nothing else lillian turned because rearden had approached her he took the diamond bracelet from her hand he clasped it on her wrist raised her hand to his lips and kissed it he did not look at dagny lillian laughed gaily easily attractively bringing the room back to its normal mood you may have it back miss taggart when you change your mind she said dagny had turned away she felt calm and free the pressure was gone the need to get out had vanished she clasped the metal bracelet on her wrist she liked the feel of its weight against her skin inexplicably she felt a touch of feminine vanity the kind she had never experienced before the desire to be seen wearing this particular ornament from a distance she heard snatches of indignant voices the most offensive gesture ive ever seen it was vicious im glad lillian took her up on it serves her right if she feels like throwing a few thousand dollars away for the rest of the evening rearden remained by the side of his wife he shared her conversations he laughed with her friends he was suddenly the devoted attentive admiring husband he was crossing the room carrying a tray with drinks requested by someone in lillians groupan unbecoming act of informality which nobody had ever seen him performwhen dagny approached him she stopped and looked up at him as if they were alone in his office she stood like an executive her head lifted he looked down at her in the line of his glance from the fingertips of her one hand to her face her body was naked but for his metal bracelet im sorry hank she said but i had to do it his eyes remained expressionless yet she was suddenly certain that she knew what he felt he wanted to slap her face it was not necessary he answered coldly and walked on it was very late when rearden entered his wifes bedroom she was still awake a lamp burned on her bedside table she lay in bed propped up on pillows of pale green linen her bed jacket was pale green satin worn with the untouched perfection of a window model its lustrous folds looked as if the crinkle of tissue paper still lingered among them the light shaded to a tone of apple blossoms fell on a table that held a book a glass of fruit juice and toilet accessories of silver glittering like instruments in a surgeons case her arms had a tinge of porcelain there was a touch of pale pink lipstick on her mouth she showed no sign of exhaustion after the partyno sign of life to be exhausted the place was a decorators display of a lady groomed for sleep not to be disturbed he still wore his dress clothes his tie was loose and a strand of hair hung over his face she glanced at him without astonishment as if she knew what the last hour in his room had done to him he looked at her silently he had not entered her room for a long time he stood wishing he had not entered it now isnt it customary to talk henry if you wish i wish youd send one of your brilliant experts from the mills to take a look at our furnace do you know that it went out during the party and simons had a terrible time getting it started again mrs weston says that our best achievement is our cookshe loved the hors doeuvres balph eubank said a very funny thing about you he said youre a crusader with a factorys chimney smoke for a plume im glad you dont like francisco danconia i cant stand him he did not care to explain his presence or to disguise defeat or to admit it by leaving suddenly it did not matter to him what she guessed or felt he walked to the window and stood looking out why had she married himhe thought it was a question he had not asked himself on their wedding day eight years ago since then in tortured loneliness he had asked it many times he had found no answer it was not for position he thought or for money she came from an old family that had both her familys name was not among the most distinguished and their fortune was modest but both were sufficient to let her be included in the top circles of new yorks society where he had met her nine years ago he had appeared in new york like an explosion in the glare of the success of rearden steel a success that had been thought impossible by the citys experts it was his indifference that made him spectacular he did not know that he was expected to attempt to buy his way into society and that they anticipated the pleasure of rejecting him he had no time to notice their disappointment he attended reluctantly a few social occasions to which he was invited by men who sought his favor he did not know but they knew that his courteous politeness was condescension toward the people who had expected to snub him the people who had said that the age of achievement was past it was lillians austerity that attracted himthe conflict between her austerity and her behavior he had never liked anyone or expected to be liked he found himself held by the spectacle of a woman who was obviously pursuing him but with obvious reluctance as if against her own will as if fighting a desire she resented it was she who planned that they should meet then faced him coldly as if not caring that he knew it she spoke little she had an air of mystery that seemed to tell him he would never break through her proud detachment and an air of amusement mocking her own desire and his he had not known many women he had moved toward his goal sweeping aside everything that did not pertain to it in the world and in himself his dedication to his work was like one of the fires he dealt with a fire that burned every lesser element every impurity out of the white stream of a single metal he was incapable of halfway concerns but there were times when he felt a sudden access of desire so violent that it could not be given to a casual encounter he had surrendered to it on a few rare occasions through the years with women he had thought he liked he had been left feeling an angry emptinessbecause he had sought an act of triumph though he had not known of what nature but the response he received was only a womans acceptance of a casual pleasure and he knew too clearly that what he had won had no meaning he was left not with a sense of attainment but with a sense of his own degradation he grew to hate his desire he fought it he came to believe the doctrine that this desire was wholly physical a desire not of consciousness but of matter and he rebelled against the thought that his flesh could be free to choose and that its choice was impervious to the will of his mind he had spent his life in mines and mills shaping matter to his wishes by the power of his brainand he found it intolerable that he should be unable to control the matter of his own body he fought it he had won his every battle against inanimate nature but this was a battle he lost it was the difficulty of the conquest that made him want lillian she seemed to be a woman who expected and deserved a pedestal this made him want to drag her down to his bed to drag her down were the words in his mind they gave him a dark pleasure the sense of a victory worth winning he could not understand whyhe thought it was an obscene conflict the sign of some secret depravity within himwhy he felt at the same time a profound pride at the thought of granting to a woman the title of his wife the feeling was solemn and shining it was almost as if he felt that he wished to honor a woman by the act of possessing her lillian seemed to fit the image he had not known he held had not known he wished to find he saw the grace the pride the purity the rest was in himself he did not know that he was looking at a reflection he remembered the day when lillian came from new york to his office of her own sudden choice and asked him to take her through his mills he heard a soft low breathless tonethe tone of admirationgrowing in her voice as she questioned him about his work and looked at the place around her he looked at her graceful figure moving against the bursts of furnace flame and at the light swift steps of her high heels stumbling through drifts of slag as she walked resolutely by his side the look in her eyes when she watched a heat of steel being poured was like his own feeling for it made visible to him when her eyes moved up to his face he saw the same look but intensified to a degree that seemed to make her helpless and silent it was at dinner that evening that he asked her to marry him it took him some time after his marriage before he admitted to himself that this was torture he still remembered the night when he admitted it when he told himselfthe veins of his wrists pulled tight as he stood by the bed looking down at lillianthat he deserved the torture and that he would endure it lillian was not looking at him she was adjusting her hair may i go to sleep now she asked she had never objected she had never refused him anything she submitted whenever he wished she submitted in the manner of complying with the rule that it was at times her duty to become an inanimate object turned over to her husbands use she did not censure him she made it clear that she took it for granted that men had degrading instincts which constituted the secret ugly part of marriage she was condescendingly tolerant she smiled in amused distaste at the intensity of what he experienced its the most undignified pastime i know of she said to him once but i have never entertained the illusion that men are superior to animals his desire for her had died in the first week of their marriage what remained was only a need which he was unable to destroy he had never entered a whorehouse he thought at times that the selfloathing he would experience there could be no worse than what he felt when he was driven to enter his wifes bedroom he would often find her reading a book she would put it aside with a white ribbon to mark the pages when lie lay exhausted his eyes closed still breathing in gasps she would turn on the light pick up the book and continue her reading he told himself that he deserved the torture because he had wished never to touch her again and was unable to maintain his decision he despised himself for that he despised a need which now held no shred of joy or meaning which had become the mere need of a womans body an anonymous body that belonged to a woman whom he had to forget while he held it he became convinced that the need was depravity he did not condemn lillian he felt a dreary indifferent respect for her his hatred of his own desire had made him accept the doctrine that women were pure and that a pure woman was one incapable of physical pleasure through the quiet agony of the years of his marriage there had been one thought which he would not permit himself to consider the thought of infidelity he had given his word he intended to keep it it was not loyalty to lillian it was not the person of lillian that he wished to protect from dishonorbut the person of his wife he thought of that now standing at the window he had not wanted to enter her room he had fought against it he had fought more fiercely against knowing the particular reason why he would not be able to withstand it tonight then seeing her he had known suddenly that he would not touch her the reason which had driven him here tonight was the reason which made it impossible for him he stood still feeling free of desire feeling the bleak relief of indifference to his body to this room even to his presence here he had turned away from her not to see her lacquered chastity what he thought he should feel was respect what he felt was revulsion but dr pritchett said that our culture is dying because our universities have to depend on the alms of the meat packers the steel puddlers and the purveyors of breakfast cereals why had she married himhe thought that bright crisp voice was not talking at random she knew why he had come here she knew what it would do to him to see her pick up a silver buffer and go on talking gaily polishing her fingernails she was talking about the party but she did not mention bertram scudderor dagny taggart what had she sought in marrying him he felt the presence of some cold driving purpose within herbut found nothing to condemn she had never tried to use him she made no demands on him she found no satisfaction in the prestige of industrial powershe spurned itshe preferred her own circle of friends she was not after moneyshe spent littleshe was indifferent to the kind of extravagance he could have afforded he had no right to accuse her he thought or ever to break the bond she was a woman of honor in their marriage she wanted nothing material from him he turned and looked at her wearily next time you give a party he said stick to your own crowd dont invite what you think are my friends i dont care to meet them socially she laughed startled and pleased i dont blame you darling she said he walked out adding nothing else what did she want from himhe thought what was she after in the universe as he knew it there was no answer chapter vii the exploiters and the exploited the rails rose through the rocks to the oil derricks and the oil derricks rose to the sky dagny stood on the bridge looking up at the crest of the hill where the sun hit a spot of metal on the top of the highest rigging it looked like a white torch lighted over the snow on the ridges of wyatt oil by spring she thought the track would meet the line growing toward it from cheyenne she let her eyes follow the greenblue rails that started from the derricks came down went across the bridge and past her she turned her head to follow them through the miles of clear air as they went on in great curves hung on the sides of the mountains far to the end of the new track where a locomotive crane like an arm of naked bones and nerves moved tensely against the sky a tractor went past her loaded with greenblue bolts the sound of drills came as a steady shudder from far below where men swung on metal cables cutting the straight stone drop of the canyon wall to reinforce the abutments of the bridge down the track she could see men working their arms stiff with the tension of their muscles as they gripped the handles of electric tie tampers muscles miss taggart ben nealy the contractor had said to her musclesthats all it takes to build anything in the world no contractor equal to mcnamara seemed to exist anywhere she had taken the best she could find no engineer on the taggart staff could be trusted to supervise the job all of them were skeptical about the new metal frankly miss taggart her chief engineer had said since it is an experiment that nobody has ever attempted before i do not think its fair that it should be my responsibility its mine she had answered he was a man in his forties who still preserved the breezy manner of the college from which he had graduated once taggart transcontinental had had a chief engineer a silent grayhaired self educated man who could not be matched on any railroad he had resigned five years ago she glanced down over the bridge she was standing on a slender beam of steel above a gorge that had cracked the mountains to a depth of fifteen hundred feet far at the bottom she could distinguish the dim outlines of a dry river bed of piled boulders of trees contorted by centuries she wondered whether boulders tree trunks and muscles could ever bridge that canyon she wondered why she found herself thinking suddenly that cavedwellers had lived naked on the bottom of that canyon for ages she looked up at the wyatt oil fields the track broke into sidings among the wells she saw the small disks of switches dotted against the snow they were metal switches of the kind that were scattered in thousands unnoticed throughout the countrybut these were sparkling in the sun and the sparks were greenishblue what they meant to her was hour upon hour of speaking quietly evenly patiently trying to hit the center less target that was the person of mr mowen president of the amalgamated switch and signal company inc of connecticut but miss taggart my dear miss taggart my company has served your company for generations why your grandfather was the first customer of my grandfather so you cannot doubt our eagerness to do anything you ask butdid you say switches made of rearden metal yes but miss taggart consider what it would mean having to work with that metal do you know that the stuff wont melt under less than four thousand degrees great well maybe thats great for motor manufacturers but what im thinking of is that it means a new type of furnace a new process entirely men to be trained schedules upset work rules shot everything balled up and then god only knows whether it will come out right or not how do you know miss taggart how can you know when its never been done before well i cant say that that metal is good and i cant say that it isnt well no i cant tell whether its a product of genius as you say or just another fraud as a great many people are saying miss taggart a great many well no i cant say that it does matter one way or the other because who am i to take a chance on a job of this kind she had doubled the price of her order rearden had sent two metallurgists to train mowens men to teach to show to explain every step of the process and had paid the salaries of mowens men while they were being trained she looked at the spikes in the rail at her feet they meant the night when she had heard that summit casting of illinois the only company willing to make spikes of rearden metal had gone bankrupt with half of her order undelivered she had flown to chicago that night she had got three lawyers a judge and a state legislator out of bed she had bribed two of them and threatened the others she had obtained a paper that was an emergency permit of a legality no one would ever be able to untangle she had had the padlocked doors of the summit casting plant unlocked and a random halfdressed crew working at the smelters before the windows had turned gray with daylight the crews had remained at work under a taggart engineer and a rearden metallurgist the rebuilding of the rio norte line was not held up she listened to the sound of the drills the work had been held up once when the drilling for the bridge abutments was stepped i couldnt help it miss taggart ben nealy had said offended you know how fast drill heads wear out i had them on order but incorporated tool ran into a little trouble they couldnt help it either associated steel was delayed in delivering the steel to them so theres nothing we can do but wait its no use getting upset miss taggart im doing my best ive hired you to do a job not to do your bestwhatever that is thats a funny thing to say thats an unpopular attitude miss taggart mighty unpopular forget incorporated tool forget the steel order the doll heads made of rearden metal not me ive had enough trouble with the damn stuff in that rail of yours im not going to mess up my own equipment a drill head of rearden metal will outlast three of steel maybe i said order them made whos going to pay for it i am whos going to find somebody to make them she had telephoned rearden he had found an abandoned tool plant long since out of business within an hour he had purchased it from the relatives of its last owner within a day the plant had been reopened within a week drill heads of rearden metal lad been delivered to the bridge in colorado she looked at the bridge it represented a problem badly solved but she had had to accept it the bridge twelve hundred feet of steel across the black gap was built in the days of nat taggarts son it was long past the stage of safety it had been patched with stringers of steel then of iron then of wood it was barely worth the patching she had thought of a new bridge of rearden metal she had asked her chief engineer to submit a design and an estimate of the cost the design he had submitted was the scheme of a steel bridge badly scaled down to the greater strength of the new metal the cost made the project impossible to consider i beg your pardon miss taggart he had said offended i dont know what you mean when you say that i havent made use of the metal this design is an adaptation of the best bridges on record what else did you expect a new method of construction what do you mean a new method i mean that when men got structural steel they did not use it to build steel copies of wooden bridges she had added wearily get me an estimate on what well need to make our old bridge last for another five years yes miss taggart he had said cheerfully if we reinforce it with steel well reinforce it with rearden metal yes miss taggart he had said coldly she looked at the snowcovered mountains her job had seemed hard at times in new york she had stopped for blank moments in the middle of her office paralyzed by despair at the rigidity of time which she could not stretch any furtheron a day when urgent appointments had succeeded one another when she had discussed worn diesels rotting freight cars failing signal systems falling revenues while thinking of the latest emergency on the rio norte construction when she had talked with the vision of two streaks of greenblue metal cutting across her mind when she had interrupted the discussions realizing suddenly why a certain news item had disturbed her and seized the telephone receiver to call longdistance to call her contractor to say where do you get the food from for your men i thought so well barton and jones of denver went bankrupt yesterday better find another supplier at once if you dont want to have a famine on your hands she had been building the line from her desk in new york it had seemed hard but now she was looking at the track it was growing it would be done on time she heard sharp hurried footsteps and turned a man was coming up the track he was tall and young his head of black hair was hatless in the cold wind he wore a workmans leather jacket but he did not look like a workman there was too imperious an assurance in the way he walked she could not recognize the face until he came closer it was ellis wyatt she had not seen him since that one interview in her office he approached stopped looked at her and smiled hello dagny he said in a single shock of emotion she knew everything the two words were intended to tell her it was forgiveness understanding acknowledgment it was a salute she laughed like a child in happiness that things should be as right as that hello she said extending her hand his hand held hers an instant longer than a greeting required it was their signature under a score settled and understood tell nealy to put up new snow fences for a mile and a half on granada pass he said the old ones are rotted they wont stand through another storm send him a rotary plow what hes got is a piece of junk that wouldnt sweep a back yard the big snows are coming any day now she considered him for a moment how often have you been doing this she asked what coming to watch the work every now and then when i have the time why were you here the night when they had the rock slide yes i was surprised how quickly and well they cleared the track when i got the reports about it it made me think that nealy was a better man than i had thought he isnt was it you who organized the system of moving his days supplies down to the line sure his men used to spend half their time hunting for things tell him to watch his water tanks theyll freeze on him one of these nights see if you can get him a new ditcher i dont like the looks of the one hes got check on his wiring system she looked at him for a moment thanks ellis she said he smiled and walked on she watched him as he walked across the bridge as he started up the long rise toward his derricks he thinks he owns the place doesnt he she turned startled ben nealy had approached her his thumb was pointing at ellis wyatt what place the railroad miss taggart your railroad or the whole world maybe thats what he thinks ben nealy was a bulky man with a soft sullen face his eyes were stubborn and blank in die bluish light of the snow his skin had the tinge of butter what does he keep hanging around here for he said as if nobody knew their business but him the snooty showoff who does he think he is god damn you said dagny evenly not raising her voice nealy could never know what had made her say it but some part of him in some way of his own knew it the shocking thing to her was that he was not shocked he said nothing lets go to your quarters she said wearily pointing to an old railway coach on a spur in the distance have somebody there to take notes now about those crossties miss taggart he said hastily as they started mr coleman of your office okayed them he didnt say anything about too much bark i dont see why you think theyre i said youre going to replace them when she came out of the coach exhausted by two hours of effort to be patient to instruct to explainshe saw an automobile parked on the torn dirt road below a black twoseater sparkling and new a new car was an astonishing sight anywhere one did not see them often she glanced around and gasped at the sight of the tall figure standing at the foot of the bridge it was hank rearden she had not expected to find him in colorado he seemed absorbed in calculations pencil and notebook in hand his clothes attracted attention like his car and for the same reason he wore a simple trenchcoat and a hat with a slanting brim but they were of such good quality so flagrantly expensive that they appeared ostentatious among the seedy garments of the crowds everywhere the more ostentatious because worn so naturally she noticed suddenly that she was running toward him she had lost all trace of exhaustion then she remembered that she had not seen him since the party she stopped he saw her he waved to her in a gesture of pleased astonished greeting and he walked forward to meet her he was smiling hello he said your first trip to the job my fifth in three months i didnt know you were here nobody told me i thought youd break down some day break down enough to come and see this theres your metal how do you like it he glanced around if you ever decide to quit the railroad business let me know youd give me a job any time she looked at him for a moment youre only halfkidding hank i think youd like ithaving me ask you for a job having me for an employee instead of a customer giving me orders to obey yes i would she said her face hard dont quit the steel business i wont promise you a job on the railroad he laughed dont try it what to win any battle when i set the terms she did not answer she was struck by what the words made her feel it was not an emotion but a physical sensation of pleasure which she could not name or understand incidentally he said this is not my first trip i was here yesterday you were why oh i came to colorado on some business of my own so i thought id take a look at this what are you after why do you assume that im after anything you wouldnt waste time coming here just to look not twice he laughed true he pointed at the bridge im after that what about it its ready for the scrap heap do you suppose that i dont know it i saw the specifications of your order for rearden metal members for that bridge youre wasting your money the difference between what youre planning to spend on a makeshift that will last a couple of years and the cost of a new rearden metal bridge is comparatively so little that i dont see why you want to bother preserving this museum piece ive thought of a new rearden metal bridge ive had my engineers give me an estimate what did they tell you two million dollars good god what would you say eight hundred thousand she looked at him she knew that he never spoke idly she asked trying to sound calm how like this he showed her his notebook she saw the disjoined notations he had made a great many figures a few rough sketches she understood his scheme before he had finished explaining it she did not notice that they had sat down that they were sitting on a pile of frozen lumber that her legs were pressed to the rough planks and she could feel the cold through her thin stockings they were bent together over a few scraps of paper which could make it possible for thousands of tons of freight to cross a cut of empty space his voice sounded sharp and clear while he explained thrusts pulls loads wind pressures the bridge was to be a single twelvehundredfoot truss span he had devised a new type of truss it had never been made before end could not be made except with members that had the strength and the lightness of rearden metal hank she asked did you invent this in two days hell no i invented it long before i had rearden metal i figured it out while making steel for bridges i wanted a metal with which one would be able to do this among other things i came here just to see your particular problem for myself he chuckled when he saw the slow movement of her hand across her eyes and the line of bitterness in the set of her mouth as if she were trying to wipe out the things against which she had fought such an exhausting cheerless battle this is only a rough scheme he said but i believe you see what can be done i cant tell you all that i see hank dont bother i know it youre saving taggart transcontinental for the second time you used to be a better psychologist than that what do you mean why should i give a damn about saving taggart transcontinental dont you know that i want to have a bridge of rearden metal to show the country yes hank i know it there are too many people yelping that rails of rearden metal are unsafe so i thought id give them something real to yelp about let them see a bridge of rearden metal she looked at him and laughed aloud in simple delight now whats that he asked hank i dont know anyone not anyone in the world whod think of such an answer to people in such circumstancesexcept you what about you would you want to make the answer with me and face the same screaming you knew i would yes i knew it he glanced at her his eyes narrowed he did not laugh as she had but the glance was an equivalent she remembered suddenly their last meeting at the party the memory seemed incredible their ease with each otherthe strange lightheaded feeling which included the knowledge that it was the only sense of ease either of them found anywheremade the thought of hostility impossible yet she knew that the party had taken place he acted as if it had not they walked to the edge of the canyon together they looked at the dark drop at the rise of rock beyond it at the sun high on the derricks of wyatt oil she stood her feet apart on the frozen stones braced firmly against the wind she could feel without touching it the line of his chest behind her shoulder the wind beat her coat against his legs hank do you think we can build it in time there are only six months left sure it will take less time and labor than any other type of bridge let me have my engineers work out the basic scheme and submit it to you no obligation on your part just take a look at it and see for yourself whether youll be able to afford it you will then you can let your college boys work out the details what about the metal ill get the metal rolled if i have to throw every other order out of the mills youll get it rolled on so short a notice have i ever held you up on an order no but the way things are going nowadays you might not be able to help it who do you think youre talking toorren boyle she laughed all right let me have the drawings as soon as possible ill take a look and let you know within fortyeight hours as to my college boys they she stopped frowning hank why is it so hard to find good men for any job nowadays i dont know he looked at the lines of the mountains cut across the sky a thin jet of smoke was rising from a distant valley have you seen the new towns of colorado and the factories he asked yes its great isnt itto see the kind of men theyve gathered here from every corner of the country all of them young all of them starting on a shoestring and moving mountains what mountain have you decided to move why what are you doing in colorado he smiled looking at a mining property what sort copper good god dont you have enough to do i know its a complicated job but the supply of copper is becoming completely unreliable there doesnt seem to be a single firstrate company left in the business in this countryand i dont want to deal with danconia copper i dont trust that playboy i dont blame you she said looking away so if theres no competent person left to do it ill have to mine my own copper as i mine my own iron ore i cant take any chances on being held up by all those failures and shortages i need a great deal of copper for rearden metal have you bought the mine not yet there are a few problems to solve getting the men the equipment the transportation oh she chuckled going to speak to me about building a branch line might theres no limit to whats possible in this state do you know that they have every kind of natural resource here waiting untouched and the way their factories are growing i feel ten years younger when i come here i dont she was looking east past the mountains i think of the contrast all over the rest of the taggart system theres less to carry less tonnage produced each year its as if hank whats wrong with the country i dont know i keep thinking of what they told us in school about the sun losing energy growing colder each year i remember wondering then what it would be like in the last days of the world i think it would be like this growing colder and things stopping i never believed that story i thought by the time the sun was exhausted men would find a substitute you did funny i thought that too he pointed at the column of smoke theres your new sunrise its going to feed the rest if its not stopped do you think it can be stopped she looked at the rail under her feet no she said he smiled he looked down at the rail then let his eyes move along the track up the sides of the mountains to the distant crane she saw two things as if for a moment the two stood alone in her field of vision the lines of his profile and the greenblue cord coiling through space weve done it havent we he said in payment for every effort for every sleepless night for every silent thrust against despair this moment was all she wanted yes we have she looked away noticed an old crane on a siding and thought that its cables were worn and would need replacing this was the great clarity of being beyond emotion after the reward of having felt everything one could feel their achievement she thought and one moment of acknowledging it of possessing it togetherwhat greater intimacy could one share now she was free for the simplest most commonplace concerns of the moment because nothing could be meaningless within her sight she wondered what made her certain that he felt as she did he turned abruptly and started toward his car she followed they did not look at each other im due to leave for the east in an hour he said she pointed at the car where did you get that here its a hammond hammond of coloradotheyre the only people whore still making a good car i just bought it on this trip wonderful job yes isnt it going to drive it back to new york no im having it shipped i flew my plane down here oh you did i drove down from cheyennei had to see the line but im anxious to get home as fast as possible would you take me along can i fly back with you he did not answer at once she noticed the empty moment of a pause im sorry he said she wondered whether she imagined the note of abruptness in his voice im not flying back to new york im going to minnesota oh well then ill try to get on an air liner if i can find one today she watched his car vanish down the winding road she drove to the airport an hour later the place was a small field at the bottom of a break in the desolate chain of mountains there were patches of snow on the hard pitted earth the pole of a beacon stood at one side trailing wires to the ground the other poles had been knocked down by a storm a lonely attendant came to meet her no miss taggart he said regretfully no planes till day after tomorrow theres only one transcontinental liner every two days you know and the one that was due today has been grounded down in arizona engine trouble as usual he added its a pity you didnt get here a bit sooner mr rearden took off for new york in his private plane just a little while ago he wasnt flying to new york was be why yes he said so are you sure he said he had an appointment there tonight she looked at the sky to the east blankly without moving she had no clue to any reason nothing to give her a foothold nothing with which to weigh this or fight it or understand damn these streets said james taggart were going to be late dagny glanced ahead past the back of the chauffeur through the circle made by a windshield wiper on the sleetstreaked glass she saw black worn glistening car tops strung in a motionless line far ahead the smear of a red lantern low over the ground marked a street excavation theres something wrong on every other street said taggart irritably why doesnt somebody fix them she leaned back against the seat tightening the collar of her wrap she felt exhausted at the end of a day she had started at her desk in her office at seven am a day she had broken off uncompleted to rush home and dress because she had promised jim to speak at the dinner of the new york business council they want us to give them a talk about rearden metal he had said you can do it so much better than i its very important that we present a good case theres such a controversy about rearden metal sitting beside him in his car she regretted that she had agreed she looked at the streets of new york and thought of the race between metal and time between the rails of the rio norte line and the passing days she felt as if her nerves were being pulled tight by the stillness of the car by the guilt of wasting an evening when she could not afford to waste an hour with all those attacks on rearden that one hears everywhere said taggart he might need a few friends she glanced at him incredulously you mean you want to stand by him he did not answer at once he asked his voice bleak that report of the special committee of the national council of metal industrieswhat do you think of it you know what i think of it they said rearden metal is a threat to public safety they said its chemical composition is unsound its brittle its decomposing molecularly and it will crack suddenly without warning he stopped as if begging for an answer she did not answer he asked anxiously you havent changed your mind about it have you about what about that metal no jim i have not changed my mind theyre experts though the men on that committee top experts chief metallurgists for the biggest corporations with a string of degrees from universities all over the country he said it unhappily as if he were begging her to make him doubt these men and their verdict she watched him puzzled this was not like him the car jerked forward it moved slowly through a gap in a plank barrier past the hole of a broken water main she saw the new pipe stacked by the excavation the pipe bore a trademark stockton foundry colorado she looked away she wished she were not reminded of colorado i cant understand it said taggart miserably the top experts of the national council of metal industries whos the president of the national council of metal industries jim orren boyle isnt it taggart did not turn to her but his jaw snapped open if that fat slob thinks he can he started but stopped and did not finish she looked up at a street lamp on the corner it was a globe of glass filled with light it hung secure from storm lighting boarded windows and cracked sidewalks as their only guardian at the end of the street across the river against the glow of a factory she saw the thin tracing of a power station a truck went by hiding her view it was the kind of truck that fed the power stationa tank truck its bright new paint impervious to sleet green with white letters wyatt oil colorado dagny have you heard about that discussion at the structural steel workers union meeting in detroit no what discussion it was in all the newspapers they debated whether their members should or should not be permitted to work with rearden metal they didnt reach a decision but that was enough for the contractor who was going to take a chance on rearden metal he cancelled his order but fast what if what if everybody decides against it let them a dot of light was rising in a straight line to the top of an invisible tower it was the elevator of a great hotel the car went past the buildings alley men were moving a heavy crated piece of equipment from a truck into the basement she saw the name on the crate nielsen motors colorado i dont like that resolution passed by the convention of the grade school teachers of new mexico said taggart what resolution they resolved that it was their opinion that children should not be permitted to ride on the new rio norte line of taggart transcontinental when its completed because it is unsafe they said it specifically the new line of taggart transcontinental it was in all the newspapers its terrible publicity for us dagny what do you think we should do to answer them run the first train on the new rio norte line he remained silent for a long time he looked strangely dejected she could not understand it he did not gloat he did not use the opinions of his favorite authorities against her he seemed to be pleading for reassurance a car flashed past them she had a moments glimpse of powera smooth confident motion and a shining body she knew the make of the car hammond colorado dagny are we are we going to have that line built on time it was strange to hear a note of plain emotion in his voice the uncomplicated sound of animal fear god help this city if we dont she answered the car turned a corner above the black roofs of the city she saw the page of the calendar hit by the white glare of a spotlight it said january dan conway is a bastard the words broke out suddenly as if he could not hold them any longer she looked at him bewildered why he refused to sell us the colorado track of the phoenixdurango you didnt she had to stop she started again keeping her voice flat in order not to scream you havent approached him about it of course i have you didnt expect him to sell it to you why not his hysterically belligerent manner was back i offered him more than anybody else did we wouldnt have had the expense of tearing it up and carting it off we could have used it as is and it would have been wonderful publicity for usthat were giving up the rearden metal track in deference to public opinion it would have been worth every penny of it in good will but the son of a bitch refused hes actually declared that not a foot of rail would be sold to taggart transcontinental hes selling it piecemeal to any stray comer to onehorse railroads in arkansas or north dakota selling it at a loss way under what i offered him the bastard doesnt even want to take a profit and you should see those vultures flocking to him they know theyd never have a chance to get rail anywhere else she sat her head bowed she could not bear to look at him i think its contrary to the intent of the antidogcatdog rule he said angrily i think it was the intent and purpose of the national alliance of railroads to protect the essential systems not the jerkwaters of north dakota but i cant get the alliance to vote on it now because theyre all down there outbidding one another for that rail she said slowly as if she wished it were possible to wear gloves to handle the words i see why you want me to defend rearden metal i dont know what youre shut up jim she said quietly he remained silent for a moment then he drew his head back and drawled defiantly youd better do a good job of defending rearden metal because bertram scudder can get pretty sarcastic bertram scudder hes going to be one of the speakers tonight one of the you didnt tell me there were to be other speakers well i what difference does that make youre not afraid of him are you the new york business council and you invite bertram scudder why not dont you think its smart he doesnt have any hard feelings toward businessmen not really hes accepted the invitation we want to be broadminded and hear all sides and maybe win him over well what are you staring at youll be able to beat him wont you to beat him on the air its going to be a radio broadcast youre going to debate with him the question is rearden metal a lethal product of greed she leaned forward she pulled open the glass partition of the front seat ordering stop the car she did not hear what taggart was saying she noticed dimly that his voice rose to screams theyre waiting five hundred people at the dinner and a national hookup you cant do this to me he seized her arm screaming but why you goddamn fool do you think i consider their question debatable the car stopped she leaped out and ran the first tiling she noticed after a while was her slippers she was walking slowly normally and it was strange to feel iced stone under the thin soles of black satin sandals she pushed her hair back off her forehead and felt drops of sleet melting on her palm she was quiet now the blinding anger was gone she felt nothing but a gray weariness her head ached a little she realized that she was hungry and remembered that she was to have had dinner at the business council she walked on she did not want to eat she thought she would get a cup of coffee somewhere then take a cab home she glanced around her there were no cabs in sight she did not know the neighborhood it did not seem to be a good one she saw an empty stretch of space across the street an abandoned park encircled by a jagged line that began as distant skyscrapers and came down to factory chimneys she saw a few lights in the windows of dilapidated houses a few small grimy shops closed for the night and the fog of the east river two blocks away she started back toward the center of the city the black shape of a ruin rose before her it had been an office building long ago she saw the sky through the naked steel skeleton and the angular remnants of the bricks that had crumbled in the shadow of the ruin like a blade of grass fighting to live at the roots of a dead giant there stood a small diner its windows were a bright band of glass and light she went in there was a clean counter inside with a shining strip of chromium at the edges there was a bright metal boiler and the odor of coffee a few derelicts sat at the counter a husky elderly man stood behind it the sleeves of his clean white shirt rolled at the elbows the warm air made her realize in simple gratitude that she had been cold she pulled her black velvet cape tight about her and sat down at the counter a cup of coffee please she said the men looked at her without curiosity they did not seem astonished to see a woman in evening clothes enter a slum diner nothing astonished anyone these days the owner turned impassively to fill her order there was in his stolid indifference the kind of mercifulness that asks no questions she could not tell whether the four at the counter were beggars or working men neither clothes nor manner showed the difference these days the owner placed a mug of coffee before her she closed both hands about it finding enjoyment in its warmth she glanced around her and thought in habitual professional calculation how wonderful it was that one could buy so much for a dime her eyes moved from the stainless steel cylinder of the coffee boiler to the castiron griddle to the glass shelves to the enameled sink to the chromium blades of a mixer the owner was making toast she found pleasure in watching the ingenuity of an open belt that moved slowly carrying slices of bread past glowing electric coils then she saw the name stamped on the toaster marsh colorado her head fell down on her arm on the counter its no use lady said the old bum beside her she had to raise her head she had to smile in amusement at him and at herself it isnt she asked no forget it youre only fooling yourself about what about anything being worth a damn its dust lady all of it dust and blood dont believe the dreams they pump you full of and you wont get hurt what dreams the stories they tell you when youre youngabout the human spirit there isnt any human spirit man is just a lowgrade animal without intellect without soul without virtues or moral values an animal with only two capacities to eat and to reproduce his gaunt face with staring eyes and shrunken features that had been delicate still retained a trace of distinction he looked like the hulk of an evangelist or a professor of esthetics who had spent years in contemplation in obscure museums she wondered what had destroyed him what error on the way could bring a man to this you go through life looking for beauty for greatness for some sublime achievement he said and what do you find a lot of trick machinery for making upholstered cars or innerspring mattresses whats wrong with innerspring mattresses said a man who looked like a truck driver dont mind him lady he likes to hear himself talk he dont mean no harm mans only talent is an ignoble cunning for satisfying the needs of his body said the old bum no intelligence is required for that dont believe the stories about mans mind his spirit his ideals his sense of unlimited ambition i dont said a young boy who sat at the end of the counter he wore a coat ripped across one shoulder his squareshaped mouth seemed formed by the bitterness of a lifetime spirit said the old bum theres no spirit involved in manufacturing or in sex yet these are mans only concerns matterthats all men know or care about as witness our great industriesthe only accomplishment of our alleged civilizationbuilt by vulgar materialists with the aims the interests and the moral sense of hogs it doesnt take any morality to turn out a tenton truck on an assembly line what is morality she asked judgment to distinguish right and wrong vision to see the truth courage to act upon it dedication to that which is good integrity to stand by the good at any price but where does one find it the young boy made a sound that was halfchuckle halfsneer who is john galt she drank the coffee concerned with nothing but the pleasure of feeling as if the hot liquid were reviving the arteries of her body i can tell you said a small shriveled tramp who wore a cap pulled low over his eyes i know nobody heard him or paid any attention the young boy was watching dagny with a kind of fierce purposeless intensity youre not afraid he said to her suddenly without explanation a fiat statement in a brusque lifeless voice that had a note of wonder she looked at him no she said im not i know who is john galt said the tramp its a secret but i know it who she asked without interest an explorer said the tramp the greatest explorer that ever lived the man who found the fountain of youth give me another cup black said the old bum pushing his cup across the counter john galt spent years looking for it he crossed oceans and he crossed deserts and he went down into forgotten mines miles under the earth but he found it on the top of a mountain it took him ten years to climb that mountain it broke every bone in his body it tore the skin off his hands it made him lose his home his name his love but he climbed it he found the fountain of youth which he wanted to bring down to men only he never came back why didnt he she asked because he found that it couldnt be brought down the man who sat in front of reardens desk had vague features and a manner devoid of all emphasis so that one could form no specific image of his face nor detect the driving motive of his person his only mark of distinction seemed to be a bulbous nose a bit too large for the rest of him his manner was meek but it conveyed a preposterous hint the hint of a threat deliberately kept furtive yet intended to be recognized rearden could not understand the purpose of his visit he was dr potter who held some undefined position with the state science institute what do you want rearden asked for the third time it is the social aspect that i am asking you to consider mr rearden the man said softly i urge you to take note of the age were living in our economy is not ready for it for what our economy is in a state of extremely precarious equilibrium we all have to pool our efforts to save it from collapse well what is it you want me to do these are the considerations which i was asked to call to your attention i am from the state science institute mr rearden youve said so before but what did you wish to see me about the state science institute does not hold a favorable opinion of rearden metal youve said that too isnt that a factor which you must take into consideration no the light was growing dim in the broad windows of the office the days were short rearden saw the irregular shadow of the nose on the mans cheek and the pale eyes watching him the glance was vague but its direction purposeful the state science institute represents the best brains of the country mr rearden so im told surely you do not want to pit your own judgment against theirs i do the man looked at rearden as if pleading for help as if rearden had broken an unwritten code which demanded that he should have understood long ago rearden offered no help is this all you wanted to know he asked its only a question of time mr rearden the man said placatingly just a temporary delay just to give our economy a chance to get stabilized if youd only wait for a couple of years rearden chuckled gaily contemptuously so thats what youre after want me to take rearden metal off the market why only for a few years mr rearden only until look said rearden now ill ask you a question did your scientists decide that rearden metal is not what i claim it is we have not committed ourselves as to that did they decide its no good it is the social impact of a product that must be considered we are thinking in terms of the country as a whole we are concerned with the public welfare and the terrible crisis of the present moment which is rearden metal good or not if we view the picture from the angle of the alarming growth of unemployment which at present is rearden metal good at a time of desperate steel shortage we cannot afford to permit the expansion of a steel company which produces too much because it might throw out of business the companies which produce too little thus creating an unbalanced economy which are you going to answer my question the man shrugged questions of value are relative if rearden metal is not good its a physical danger to the public if it is goodits a social danger if you have anything to say to me about the physical danger of rearden metal say it drop the rest of it fast i dont speak that language but surely questions of social welfare drop it the man looked bewildered and lost as if the ground had been cut from under his feet in a moment he asked helplessly but what then is your chief concern the market how do you mean theres a market for rearden metal and i intend to take full advantage of it isnt the market somewhat hypothetical the public response to your metal has not been encouraging except for the order from taggart transcontinental you havent obtained any major well then if you think the public wont go for it what are you worrying about if the public doesnt go for it you will take a heavy loss mr rearden thats my worry not yours whereas if you adopt a more cooperative attitude and agree to wait for a few years why should i wait but i believe i have made it clear that the state science institute does not approve of the appearance of rearden metal on the metallurgical scene at the present time why should i give a damn about that the man sighed you are a very difficult man mr rearden the sky of the late afternoon was growing heavy as if thickening against the glass of the windowpanes the outlines of the mans figure seemed to dissolve into a blob among the sharp straight planes of the furniture i gave you this appointment said rearden because you told me that you wished to discuss something of extreme importance if this is all you had to say you will please excuse me now i am very busy the man settled back in his chair i believe you have spent ten years of research on rearden metal he said how much has it cost you rearden glanced up he could not understand the drift of the question yet there was an undisguised purposefulness in the mans voice the voice had hardened one and a half million dollars said rearden how much will you take for it rearden had to let a moment pass he could not believe it for what he asked his voice low for all rights to rearden metal i think you had better get out of here said rearden there is no call for such an attitude you are a businessman i am offering you a business proposition you may name your own price the rights to rearden metal are not for sale i am in a position to speak of large sums of money government money rearden sat without moving the muscles of his cheeks pulled tight but his glance was indifferent focused only by the faint pull of morbid curiosity you are a businessman mr rearden this is a proposition which you cannot afford to ignore on the one hand you are gambling against great odds you are bucking an unfavorable public opinion you run a good chance of losing every penny you put into rearden metal on the other hand we can relieve you of the risk and the responsibility at an impressive profit an immediate profit much larger than you could hope to realize from the sale of the metal for the next twenty years the state science institute is a scientific establishment not a commercial one said rearden what is it that theyre so afraid of you are using ugly unnecessary words mr rearden i am endeavoring to suggest that we keep the discussion on a friendly plane the matter is serious i am beginning to see that we are offering you a blank check on what is as you realize an unlimited account what else can you want name your price the sale of the rights to rearden metal is not open to discussion if you have anything else to say please say it and leave the man leaned back looked at rearden incredulously and asked what are you after i what do you mean youre in business to make money arent you i am you want to make as big a profit as possible dont you i do then why do you want to struggle for years squeezing out your gains in the form of pennies per tonrather than accept a fortune for rearden metal why because its mine do you understand the word the man sighed and rose to his feet i hope you will not have cause to regret your decision mr rearden he said the tone of his voice was suggesting the opposite good day said rearden i think i must tell you that the state science institute may issue an official statement condemning rearden metal that is their privilege such a statement would make things more difficult for you undoubtedly as to further consequences the man shrugged this is not the day for people who refuse to cooperate in this age one needs friends you are not a popular man mr rearden what are you trying to say surely you understand i dont society is a complex structure there are so many different issues awaiting decision hanging by a thin thread we can never tell when one such issue may he decided and what may be the decisive factor in a delicate balance do i make myself clear no the red flame of poured steel shot through the twilight an orange glow the color of deep gold hit the wall behind reardens desk the glow moved gently across his forehead his face had an unmoving serenity the state science institute is a government organization mr rearden there are certain bills pending in the legislature which may be passed at any moment businessmen are peculiarly vulnerable these days i am sure you understand me rearden rose to his feet he was smiling he looked as if all tension had left him no dr potter he said i dont understand if i did id have to kill you the man walked to the door then stopped and looked at rearden in a way which for once was simple human curiosity rearden stood motionless against the moving glow on the wall he stood casually his hands in his pockets would you tell me the man asked just between us its only my personal curiositywhy are you doing this rearden answered quietly ill tell you you wont understand you see its because rearden metal is good dagny could not understand mr mowens motive the amalgamated switch and signal company had suddenly given notice that they would not complete her order nothing had happened she could find no cause for it and they would give no explanation she had hurried to connecticut to see mr mowen in person but the sole result of the interview was a heavier grayer weight of bewilderment in her mind mr mowen stated that he would not continue to make switches of rearden metal for sole explanation he said avoiding her eyes too many people dont like it what rearden metal or your making the switches both i guess people dont like it i dont want any trouble what kind of trouble any kind have you heard a single thing against rearden metal thats true aw who knows whats true that resolution of the national council of metal industries said look youve worked with metals all your life for the last four months youve worked with rearden metal dont you know that its the greatest thing youve ever handled he did not answer dont you know it he looked away dont you know whats true hell miss taggart im in business im only a little guy i just want to make money how do you think one makes it but she knew that it was useless looking at mr mowens face at the eyes which she could not catch she felt as she had felt once on a lonely section of track when a storm blew down the telephone wires that communications were cut and that words had become sounds which transmitted nothing it was useless to argue she thought and to wonder about people who would neither refute an argument nor accept it sitting restlessly in the train on her way back to new york she told herself that mr mowen did not matter that nothing mattered now except finding somebody else to manufacture the switches she was wrestling with a list of names in her mind wondering who would be easiest to convince to beg or to bribe she knew the moment she entered the anteroom of her office that something had happened she saw the unnatural stillness with the faces of her staff turned to her as if her entrance were the moment they had all waited for hoped for and dreaded eddie willers rose to his feet and started toward the door of her office as if knowing that she would understand and follow she had seen his face no matter what it was she thought she wished it had not hurt him quite so badly the state science institute he said quietly when they were alone in her office has issued a statement warning people against the use of rearden metal he added it was on the radio its in the afternoon papers what did they say dagny they didnt say it they havent really said it yet its thereand it isnt thats whats monstrous about it his effort was focused on keeping his voice quiet he could not control his words the words were forced out of him by the unbelieving bewildered indignation of a child screaming in denial at his first encounter with evil what did they say eddie they youd have to read it he pointed to the newspaper he had left on her desk they havent said that rearden metal is bad they havent said that its unsafe what theyve done is his hands spread and dropped in a gesture of futility she saw at a glance what they had done she saw the sentences it may be possible that after a period of heavy usage a sudden fissure may appear though the length of this period cannot be predicted the possibility of a molecular reaction at present unknown cannot be entirely discounted although the tensile strength of the metal is obviously demonstrable certain questions in regard to its behavior under unusual stress are not to be ruled out although there is no evidence to support the contention that the use of the metal should be prohibited a further study of its properties would be of value we cant fight it it cant be answered eddie was saying slowly we cant demand a retraction we cant show them our tests or prove anything theyve said nothing they havent said a thing that could be refuted and embarrass them professionally its the job of a coward youd expect it from some conman or blackmailer but dagny its the state science institute she nodded silently she stood her eyes fixed on some point beyond the window at the end of a dark street the bulbs of an electric sign kept going on and off as if winking at her maliciously eddie gathered his strength and said in the tone of a military report taggart stock has crashed ben nealy quit the national brotherhood of road and track workers has forbidden its members to work on the rio norte line jim has left town she took her hat and coat off walked across the room and slowly very deliberately sat down at her desk she noticed a large brown envelope lying before her it bore the letterhead of rearden steel that came by special messenger right after you left said eddie she put her hand on the envelope but did not open it she knew what it was the drawings of the bridge after a while she asked who issued that statement eddie glanced at her and smiled briefly bitterly shaking his head no he said i thought of that too i called the institute long distance and asked them no it was issued by the office of dr floyd ferris their coordinator she said nothing but still dr stadler is the head of that institute he is the institute he must have known about it he permitted it if its done its done in his name dr robert stadler do you remember when we were in college how we used to talk about the great names in the world the men of pure intellect and we always chose his name as one of them and he stopped im sorry dagny i know its no use saying anything only she sat her hand pressed to the brown envelope dagny he asked his voice low what is happening to people why did that statement succeed its such an obvious smearjob so obvious and so rotten youd think a decent person would throw it in the gutter how couldhis voice was breaking in gentle desperate rebellious angerhow could they accept it didnt they read it didnt they see dont they think dagny what is it in people that lets them do thisand how can we live with it quiet eddie she said quiet dont be afraid the building of the state science institute stood over a river of new hampshire on a lonely hillside halfway between the river and the sky from a distance it looked like a solitary monument in a virgin forest the trees were carefully planted the roads were laid out as a park the roof tops of a small town could be seen in a valley some miles away but nothing had been allowed to come too close and detract from the buildings austerity the white marble of the walls gave it a classical grandeur the composition of its rectangular masses gave it the cleanliness and beauty of a modern plant it was an inspired structure from across the river people looked at it with reverence and thought of it as a monument to a living man whose character had the nobility of the buildings lines over the entrance a dedication was cut into the marble to the fearless mind to the inviolate truth in a quiet aisle in a bare corridor a small brass plate such as dozens of other name plates on other doors said dr robert stadler at the age of twentyseven dr robert stadler had written a treatise on cosmic rays which demolished most of the theories held by the scientists who preceded him those who followed found his achievement somewhere at the base of any line of inquiry they undertook at the age of thirty he was recognized as the greatest physicist of his time at thirtytwo he became head of the department of physics of the patrick henry university in the days when the great university still deserved its glory it was of dr robert stadler that a writer had said perhaps among the phenomena of the universe which he is studying none is so miraculous as the brain of dr robert stadler himself it was dr robert stadler who had once corrected a student free scientific inquiry the first adjective is redundant at the age of forty dr robert stadler addressed the nation endorsing the establishment of a state science institute set science free of the rule of the dollar he pleaded the issue had hung in the balance an obscure group of scientists had quietly forced a bill through its long way to the floor of the legislature there had been some public hesitation about the bill some doubt an uneasiness no one could define the name of dr robert stadler acted upon the country like the cosmic rays he studied it pierced any barrier the nation built the white marble edifice as a personal present to one of its greatest men dr stadlers office at the institute was a small room that looked like the office of the bookkeeper of an unsuccessful firm there was n cheap desk of ugly yellow oak a filing cabinet two chairs and a blackboard chalked with mathematical formulas sitting on one of the chairs against a blank wall dagny thought that the office had an air of ostentation and elegance together ostentation because it seemed intended to suggest that the owner was great enough to permit himself such a setting elegance because he truly needed nothing else she had met dr stadler on a few occasions at banquets given by leading businessmen or great engineering societies in honor of some solemn cause or another she had attended the occasions as reluctantly as he did and had found that he liked to talk to her miss taggart he had said to her once i never expect to encounter intelligence that i should find it here is such an astonishing relief she had come to his office remembering that sentence she sat watching him in the manner of a scientist assuming nothing discarding emotion seeking only to observe and to understand miss taggart he said gaily im curious about you im curious whenever anything upsets a precedent as a rule visitors are a painful duty to me im frankly astonished that i should feel such a simple pleasure in seeing you here do you know what its like to feel suddenly that one can talk without the strain of trying to force some sort of understanding out of a vacuum he sat on the edge of his desk his manner gaily informal he was not tall and his slenderness gave him an air of youthful energy almost of boyish zest his thin face was ageless it was a homely face but the great forehead and the large gray eyes held such an arresting intelligence that one could notice nothing else there were wrinkles of humor in the corners of the eyes and faint lines of bitterness in the corners of the mouth he did not look like a man in his early fifties the slightly graying hair was his only sign of age tell me more about yourself he said i always meant to ask you what youre doing in such an unlikely career as heavy industry and how you can stand those people i cannot take too much of your time dr stadler she spoke with polite impersonal precision and the matter i came to discuss is extremely important he laughed theres a sign of the businessmanwanting to come to the point at once well by all means but dont worry about my timeits yours now what was it you said you wanted to discuss oh yes rearden metal not exactly one of the subjects on which im best informed but if theres anything i can do for you his hand moved in a gesture of invitation do you know the statement issued by this institute in regard to rearden metal he frowned slightly yes ive heard about it have you read it no it was intended to prevent the use of rearden metal yes yes i gathered that much could you tell me why he spread his hands they were attractive handslong and bony beautiful in their suggestion of nervous energy and strength i really wouldnt know that is the province of dr ferris im sure he had his reasons would you like to speak to dr ferris no are you familiar with the metallurgical nature of rearden metal dr stadler why yes a little but tell me why are you concerned about it a flicker of astonishment rose and died in her eyes she answered without change in the impersonal tone of her voice i am building a branch line with rails of rearden metal which oh but of course i did hear something about it you must forgive me i dont read the newspapers as regularly as i should its your railroad thats building that new branch isnt it the existence of my railroad depends upon the completion of that branchand i think eventually the existence of this country will depend on it as well the wrinkles of amusement deepened about his eyes can you make such a statement with positive assurance miss taggart i couldnt in this case in any case nobody can tell what the course of a countrys future may be it is not a matter of calculable trends but a chaos subject to the rule of the moment in which anything is possible do you think that production is necessary to the existence of a country dr stadler why yes yes of course the building of our branch line has been stopped by the statement of this institute he did not smile and he did not answer does that statement represent your conclusion about the nature of rearden metal she asked i have said that i have not read it there was an edge of sharpness in his voice she opened her bag took out a newspaper clipping and extended it to him would you read it and tell me whether this is a language which science may properly speak he glanced through the clipping smiled contemptuously and tossed it aside with a gesture of distaste disgusting isnt it he said but what can you do when you deal with people she looked at him not understanding you do not approve of that statement he shrugged my approval or disapproval would be irrelevant have you formed a conclusion of your own about rearden metal well metallurgy is not exactlywhat shall we saymy specialty have you examined any data on rearden metal miss taggart i dont see the point of your questions his voice sounded faintly impatient i would like to know your personal verdict on rearden metal for what purpose so that i may give it to the press he got up that is quite impossible she said her voice strained with the effort of trying to force understanding i will submit to you all the information necessary to form a conclusive judgment i cannot issue any public statements about it why not the situation is much too complex to explain in a casual discussion but if you should find that rearden metal is in fact an extremely valuable product which that is beside the point the value of rearden metal is beside the point there are other issues involved besides questions of fact she asked not quite believing that she had heard him right what other issues is science concerned with besides questions of fact the bitter lines of his mouth sharpened into the suggestion of a smile miss taggart you do not understand the problems of scientists she said slowly as if she were seeing it suddenly in time with her words i believe that you do know what rearden metal really is he shrugged yes i know from such information as ive seen it appears to be a remarkable thing quite a brilliant achievementas far as technology is concerned he was pacing impatiently across the office in fact i should like some day to order a special laboratory motor that would stand just such high temperatures as rearden metal can take it would be very valuable in connection with certain phenomena i should like to observe i have found that when particles are accelerated to a speed approaching the speed of light they dr stadler she asked slowly you know the truth yet you will not state it publicly miss taggart you are using an abstract term when we are dealing with a matter of practical reality we are dealing with a matter of science science arent you confusing the standards involved it is only in the realm of pure science that truth is an absolute criterion when we deal with applied science with technologywe deal with people and when we deal with people considerations other than truth enter the question what considerations i am not a technologist miss taggart i have no talent or taste for dealing with people i cannot become involved in socalled practical matters that statement was issued in your name i had nothing to do with it the name of this institute is your responsibility thats a perfectly unwarranted assumption people think that the honor of your name is the guarantee behind any action of this institute i cant help what people thinkif they think at all they accepted your statement it was a lie how can one deal in truth when one deals with the public i dont understand you she said very quietly questions of truth do not enter into social issues no principles have ever had any effect on society what then directs mens actions he shrugged the expediency of the moment dr stadler she said i think i must tell you the meaning and the consequences of the fact that the construction of my branch line is being stopped i am stopped in the name of public safety because i am using the best rail ever produced in six months if i do not complete that line the best industrial section of the country will be left without transportation it will be destroyed because it was the best and there were men who thought it expedient to seize a share of its wealth well that may be vicious unjust calamitousbut such is life in society somebody is always sacrificed as a rule unjustly there is no other way to live among men what can any one person do you can state the truth about rearden metal he did not answer i could beg you to do it in order to save me i could beg you to do it in order to avert a national disaster but i wont these may not be valid reasons there is only one reason you must say it because it is true i was not consulted about that statement the cry broke out involuntarily i wouldnt have allowed it i dont like it any better than you do but i cant issue a public denial you were not consulted then shouldnt you want to find out the reasons behind that statement i cant destroy the institute now shouldnt you want to find out the reasons i know the reasons they wont tell me but i know and i cant say that i blame them either would you tell me ill tell you if you wish its the truth that you want isnt it dr ferris cannot help it if the morons who vote the funds for this institute insist on what they call results they are incapable of conceiving of such a thing as abstract science they can judge it only in terms of the latest gadget it has produced for them i do not know how dr ferris has managed to keep this institute in existence i can only marvel at his practical ability i dont believe he ever was a firstrate scientistbut what a priceless valet of science i know that he has been facing a grave problem lately hes kept me out of it he spares me all that but i do hear rumors people have been criticizing the institute because they say we have not produced enough the public has been demanding economy in times like these when their fat little comforts are threatened you may be sure that science is the first thing men will sacrifice this is the only establishment left there are practically no private research foundations any longer look at the greedy ruffians who run our industries you cannot expect them to support science who is supporting you now she asked her voice low he shrugged society she said with effort you were going to tell me the reasons behind that statement i wouldnt think youd find them hard to deduce if you consider that for thirteen years this institute has had a department of metallurgical research which has cost over twenty million dollars and has produced nothing but a new silver polish and a new anticorrosive preparation which i believe is not so good as the old onesyou can imagine what the public reaction will be if some private individual comes out with a product that revolutionizes the entire science of metallurgy and proves to be sensationally successful her head dropped she said nothing i dont blame our metallurgical department he said angrily i know that results of this kind are not a matter of any predictable time but the public wont understand it what then should we sacrifice an excellent piece of smeltingor the last center of science left on earth and the whole future of human knowledge that is the alternative she sat her head down after a while she said ah right dr stadler i wont argue he saw her groping for her bag as if she were trying to remember the automatic motions necessary to get up miss taggart he said quietly it was almost a plea she looked up her face was composed and empty he came closer he leaned with one hand against the wall above her head almost as if he wished to hold her in the circle of his arm miss taggart he said a tone of gentle bitter persuasiveness in his voice i am older than you believe me there is no other way to live on earth men are not open to truth or reason they cannot be reached by a rational argument the mind is powerless against them yet we have to deal with them if we want to accomplish anything we have to deceive them into letting us accomplish it or force them they understand nothing else we cannot expect their support for any endeavor of the intellect for any goal of the spirit they are nothing but vicious animals they are greedy selfindulgent predatory dollarchasers who i am one of the dollarchasers dr stadler she said her voice low you are an unusual brilliant child who has not seen enough of life to grasp the full measure of human stupidity ive fought it all my life im very tired the sincerity of his voice was genuine he walked slowly away from her there was a time when i looked at the tragic mess theyve made of this earth and i wanted to cry out to beg them to listeni could teach them to live so much better than they didbut there was nobody to hear me they had nothing to hear me with intelligence it is such a rare precarious spark that flashes for a moment somewhere among men and vanishes one cannot tell its nature or its future or its death she made a movement to rise dont go miss taggart id like you to understand she raised her face to him in obedient indifference her face was not pale but its planes stood out with strangely naked precision as if its skin had lost the shadings of color youre young he said at your age i had the same faith in the unlimited power of reason the same brilliant vision of man as a rational being i have seen so much since i have been disillusioned so often id like to tell you just one story he stood at the window of his office it had grown dark outside the darkness seemed to rise from the black cut of the river far below a few lights trembled in the water from among the hills of the other shore the sky was still the intense blue of evening a lonely star low over the earth seemed unnaturally large and made the sky look darker when i was at the patrick henry university he said i had three pupils i have had many bright students in the past but these three were the kind of reward a teacher prays for if ever you could wish to receive the gift of the human mind at its best young and delivered into your hands for guidance they were this gift theirs was the kind of intelligence one expects to see in the future changing the course of the world they came from very different backgrounds but they were inseparable friends they made a strange choice of studies they majored in two subjectsmine and hugh akstons physics and philosophy it is not a combination of interests one encounters nowadays hugh akston was a distinguished man a great mind unlike the incredible creature whom that university has now put in his place akston and i were a little jealous of each other over these three students it was a kind of contest between us a friendly contest because we understood each other i heard akston saying one day that he regarded them as his sons i resented it a little because i thought of them as mine he turned and looked at her the bitter lines of age were visible now cutting across his cheeks he said when i endorsed the establishment of this institute one of these three damned me i have not seen him since it used to disturb me in the first few years i wondered once in a while whether he had been right it has ceased to disturb me long ago he smiled there was nothing but bitterness now in his smile and his face these three men these three who held all the hope which the gift of intelligence ever proffered these three from whom we expected such a magnificent futureone of them was francisco danconia who became a depraved playboy another was ragnar danneskjold who became a plain bandit so much for the promise of the human mind who was the third one she asked he shrugged the third one did not achieve even that sort of notorious distinction he vanished without a traceinto the great unknown of mediocrity he is probably a second assistant bookkeeper somewhere its a lie i didnt run away cried james taggart i came here because i happened to be sick ask dr wilson its a form of flu hell prove it and how did you know that i was here dagny stood in the middle of the room there were melting snowflakes on her coat collar on the brim of her hat she glanced around feeling an emotion that would have been sadness had she had time to acknowledge it it was a room in the house of the old taggart estate on the hudson jim had inherited the place but he seldom came here in their childhood this had been their fathers study now it had the desolate air of a room which is used yet uninhabited there were slipcovers on all but two chairs a cold fireplace and the dismal warmth of an electric heater with a cord twisting across the floor a desk its glass surface empty jim lay on the couch with a towel wrapped for a scarf around his neck she saw a stale filled ashtray on a chair beside him a bottle of whisky a wilted paper cup and twodayold newspapers scattered about the floor a portrait of their grandfather hung over the fireplace full figure with a railroad bridge in the fading background i have no time for arguments jim it was your idea i hope youll admit to the board that it was your idea thats what your goddamn rearden metal has done to us if we had waited for orren boyle his unshaved face was pulled by a twisted scramble of emotions panic hatred a touch of triumph the relief of screaming at a victimand the faint cautious begging look that sees a hope of help he had stopped tentatively but she did not answer she stood watching him her hands in the pockets of her coat theres nothing we can do now he moaned i tried to call washington to get them to seize the phoenixdurango and turn it over to us on the ground of emergency but they wont even discuss it too many people objecting they say afraid of some fool precedent or another i got the national alliance of railroads to suspend the deadline and permit dan conway to operate his road for another year that would have given us timebut hes refused to do it i tried to get ellis wyatt and his bunch of friends in colorado to demand that washington order conway to continue operationsbut all of them wyatt and all the rest of those bastards refused its their skin worse than ours theyre sure to go down the drainbut theyve refused she smiled briefly but made no comment now theres nothing left for us to do were caught we cant give up that branch and we cant complete it we cant stop or go on we have no money nobody will touch us with a tenfoot pole what have we got left without the rio norte line but we cant finish it wed be boycotted wed be blacklisted that union of track workers would sue us they would theres a law about it we cant complete that line christ what are we going to do she waited through jim she asked coldly if you are ill tell you what were going to do he kept silent looking up at her from under his heavy eyelids this is not a proposal jim its an ultimatum just listen and accept i am going to complete the construction of the rio norte line i personally not taggart transcontinental i will take a leave of absence from the job of vicepresident i will form a company in my own name your board will turn the rio none line over to me i will act as my own contractor i will get my own financing i will take full charge and sole responsibility i will complete the line on time after you have seen how the rearden metal rails can take it i will transfer the line back to taggart transcontinental and ill return to my job that is all he was looking at her silently dangling a bedroom slipper on the tip of his foot she had never supposed that hope could look ugly in a mans face but it did it was mixed with cunning she turned her eyes away from him wondering how it was possible that a mans first thought in such a moment could be a search for something to put over on her then preposterously the first thing he said his voice anxious was but who will run taggart transcontinental in the meantime she chuckled the sound astonished her it seemed old in its bitterness she said eddie willers oh no he couldnt she laughed in the same brusque mirthless way i thought you were smarter than i about things of this kind eddie will assume the title of acting vicepresident he will occupy my office and sit at my desk but who do you suppose will run taggart transcontinental but i dont see how i will commute by plane between eddies office and colorado also there are longdistance phones available i will do just what i have been doing nothing will change except the kind of show you will put on for your friends and the fact that it will be a little harder for me what show you understand me jim i have no idea what sort of games youre tangled in you and your board of directors i dont know how many ends youre all playing against the middle and against one another or how many pretenses you have to keep up in how many opposite directions i dont know or care you can all hide behind me if youre all afraid because youve made deals with friends whore threatened by rearden metalwell heres your chance to go through the motions of assuring them that youre not involved that youre not doing thisi am you can help them to curse me and denounce me you can all stay home take no risks and make no enemies just keep out of my way well he said slowly of course the problems involved in the policy of a great railroad system are complex while a small independent company in the name of one person could afford to yes jim yes i know all that the moment you announce that youre turning the rio norte line over to me the taggart stock will rise the bedbugs will stop crawling from out of unlikely corners since they wont have the incentive of a big company to bite before they decide what to do about me i will have the line finished and as for me i dont want to have you and your board to account to to argue with to beg permissions from there isnt any time for that if i am to do the kind of job that has to be done so im going to do it alone and if you fail if i fail ill go down alone you understand that in such case taggart transcontinental wilt not be able to help you in any way i understand you will not count on us no you will cut all official connection with us so that your activities will not reflect upon our reputation yes i think we should agree that in case of failure or public scandal your leave of absence will become permanent that is you will not expect to return to the post of vicepresident she closed her eyes for a moment all right jim in such case i will not return before we transfer the rio norte line to you we must have a written agreement that you will transfer it back to us along with your controlling interest at cost in case the line becomes successful otherwise you might try to squeeze us for a windfall profit since we need that line there was only a brief stab of shock in her eyes then she said indifferently the words sounding as if she were tossing alms by all means jim have that stated in writing now as to your temporary successor yes you dont really want it to be eddie willers do you yes i do but he couldnt even act like a vicepresident he doesnt have the presence the manner the he knows his work and mine he knows what i want i trust him ill be able to work with him dont you think it would be better to pick one of our more distinguished young men somebody from a good family with more social poise and its going to be eddie willers jim he sighed all right only only we must be careful about it we dont want people to suspect that its you whore still running taggart transcontinental nobody must know it everybody will know it jim but since nobody will admit it openly everybody will be satisfied but we must preserve appearances oh certainly you dont have to recognize me on the street if you dont want to you can say youve never seen me before and ill say ive never heard of taggart transcontinental he remained silent trying to think staring down at the floor she turned to look at the grounds beyond the window the sky had the even graywhite pallor of winter far below on the shore of the hudson she saw the road she used to watch for franciscos carshe saw the cliff over the river where they climbed to look for the towers of new yorkand somewhere beyond the woods were the trails that led to rockdale station the earth was snowcovered now and what remained was like the skeleton of the countryside she remembereda thin design of bare branches rising from the snow to the sky it was gray and white like a photograph a dead photograph which one keeps hopefully for remembrance but which has no power to bring back anything what are you going to call it she turned startled what what are you going to call your company oh why the dagny taggart line i guess but do you think thats wise it might be misunderstood the taggart might be taken as well what do you want me to call it she snapped worn down to anger the miss nobody the madam x the john galt she stopped she smiled suddenly a cold bright dangerous smile thats what im going to call it the john galt line good god no yes but its if s just a cheap piece of slang you cant make a joke out of such a serious project you cant be so vulgar and and undignified cant i but for gods sake why because its going to shock all the rest of them just as it shocked you ive never seen you playing for effects i am this time but his voice dropped to an almost superstitious sound look dagny you know its its bad luck what it stands for is he stopped what does it stand for i dont know but the way people use it they always seem to say it out of fear despair futility yes yes thats what it is thats what i want to throw in their faces the bright sparkling anger in her eyes her first look of enjoyment made him understand that he had to keep still draw up all the papers and all the red tape in the name of the john galt line she said he sighed well its your line you bet it is he glanced at her astonished she had dropped the manners and style of a vicepresident she seemed to be relaxing happily to the level of yard crews and construction gangs as to the papers and the legal side of it he said there might be some difficulties we would have to apply for the permission of she whirled to face him something of the bright violent look still remained in her face but it was not gay and she was not smiling the look now had an odd primitive quality when he saw it he hoped he would never have to see it again listen jim she said he had never heard that tone in any human voice there is one thing you can do as your part of the deal and youd better do it keep your washington boys off see to it that they give me all the permissions authorizations charters and other waste paper that their laws require dont let them try to stop me if they try jim people say that our ancestor nat taggart killed a politician who tried to refuse him a permission he should never have had to ask i dont know whether nat taggart did it or not but ill tell you this i know how he felt if he did if he didnti might do the job for him to complete the family legend i mean it jim francisco danconia sat in front of her desk his face was blank it had remained blank while dagny explained to him in the clear impersonal tone of a business interview the formation and purpose of her own railroad company he had listened he had not pronounced a word she had never seen his face wear that look of drained passivity there was no mockery no amusement no antagonism it was as if he did not belong in these particular moments of existence and could not be reached yet his eyes looked at her attentively they seemed to see more than she could suspect they made her think of oneway glass they let all light rays in but none out francisco i asked you to come here because i wanted you to see me in my office youve never seen it it would have meant something to you once his eyes moved slowly to look at the office its walls were bare except for three things a map of taggart transcontinentalthe original drawing of nat taggart that had served as model for his statue and a large railroad calendar in cheerfully crude colors the kind that was distributed each year with a change of its picture to every station along the taggart track the kind that had hung once in her first work place at rockdale he got up he said quietly dagny for your own sake andit was a barely perceptible hesitationand in the name of any pity you might feel for me dont request what youre going to request dont let me go now this was not like him and like nothing she could ever have expected to hear from him after a moment she asked why i cant answer you i cant answer any questions that is one of the reasons why its best not to discuss it you know what i am going to request yes the way she looked at him was such an eloquent desperate question that he had to add i know that i am going to refuse why he smiled mirthlessly spreading his hands out as if to show her that this was what he had predicted and had wanted to avoid she said quietly i have to try francisco i have to make the request thats my part what youll do about it is yours but ill know that ive tried everything he remained standing but he inclined his head a little in assent and said i will listen if that will help you i need fifteen million dollars to complete the rio norte line i have obtained seven million against the taggart stock i own free and clear i can raise nothing else i will issue bonds in the name of my new company in the amount of eight million dollars i called you here to ask you to buy these bonds he did not answer i am simply a beggar francisco and i am begging you for money i had always thought that one did not beg in business i thought that one stood on the merit of what one had to offer and gave value for value this is not so any more though i dont understand how we can act on any other rule and continue to exist judging by every objective fact the rio norte line is to be the best railroad in the country judging by every known standard it is the best investment possible and that is what damns me i cannot raise money by offering people a good business venture the fact that its good makes people reject it there is no bank that would buy the bonds of my company so i cant plead merit i can only plead her voice was pronouncing the words with impersonal precision she stopped waiting for his answer he remained silent i know that i have nothing to offer you she said i cant speak to you in terms of investment you dont care to make money industrial projects have ceased to concern you long ago so i wont pretend that its a fair exchange its just begging she drew her breath and said give me that money as alms because it means nothing to you dont he said his voice low she could not tell whether the strange sound of it was pain or anger his eyes were lowered will you do it francisco no after a moment she said i called you not because i thought you would agree but because you were the only one who could understand what i am saying so i had to try it her voice was dropping lower as if she hoped it would make emotion harder to detect you see i cant believe that youre really gone because i know that youre still able to hear me the way you live is depraved but the way you act is not even the way you speak of it is not i had to try but i cant struggle to understand you any longer ill give you a hint contradictions do not exist whenever you think that you are facing a contradiction check your premises you will find that one of them is wrong francisco she whispered why dont you tell me what it was that happened to you because at this moment the answer would hurt you more than the doubt is it as terrible as that it is an answer which you must reach by yourself she shook her head i dont know what to offer you i dont know what is of value to you any longer dont you see that even a beggar has to give value in return has to offer some reason why you might want to help him well i thought at one time it meant a great deal to yousuccess industrial success remember how we used to talk about it you were very severe you expected a lot from me you told me id better live up to it i have you wondered how far id rise with taggart transcontinental she moved her hand pointing at the office this is how far ive risen so i thought if the memory of what had been your values still has some meaning for you if only as amusement or a moments sadness or just like like putting flowers on a grave you might want to give me the money in the name of that no she said with effort that money would mean nothing to youyouve wasted that much on senseless partiesyouve wasted much more on the san sebastian mines he glanced up he looked straight at her and she saw the first spark of a living response in his eyes a look that was bright pitiless and incredibly proud as if this were an accusation that gave him strength oh yes she said slowly as if answering his thought i realize that ive damned you for those mines ive denounced you ive thrown my contempt at you in every way possible and now i come back to youfor money like jim like any moocher youve ever met i know its a triumph for you i know that you can laugh at me and despise me with full justice wellperhaps i can offer you that if its amusement that you want if you enjoyed seeing jim and the mexican planners crawlwouldnt it amuse you to break me wouldnt it give you pleasure dont you want to hear me acknowledge that im beaten by you dont you want to see me crawling before you tell me what form of it youd like and ill submit he moved so swiftly that she could not notice how he started it only seemed to her that his first movement was a shudder he came around the desk he took her hand and raised it to his lips it began as a gesture of the gravest respect as if its purpose were to give her strength but as he held his lips then his face pressed to her hand she knew that he was seeking strength from it himself he dropped her hand he looked down at her face at the frightened stillness of her eyes he smiled not trying to hide that his smile held suffering anger and tenderness dagny you want to crawl you dont know what the word means and never will one doesnt crawl by acknowledging it as honestly as that dont you suppose i know that your begging me was the bravest thing you could do but dont ask me dagny in the name of anything i ever meant to you she whispered anything left within you in the moment when she thought that she had seen this look before that this was the way he had looked against the night glow of the city when he lay in bed by her side for the last timeshe heard his cry the kind of cry she had never torn from him before my love i cant then as they looked at each other both shocked into silence by astonishment she saw the change in his face it was as crudely abrupt as if he had thrown a switch he laughed he moved away from her and said his voice jarringly offensive by being completely casual please excuse the mixture in styles of expression ive been supposed to say that to so many women but on somewhat different occasions her head dropped she sat huddled tight together not caring that he saw it when she raised her head she looked at him indifferently all right francisco it was a good act i did believe it if that was your own way of having the kind of fun i was offering you you succeeded i wont ask you for anything i warned you i didnt know which side you belonged on it didnt seem possible but its the side of orren boyle and bertram scudder and your old teacher my old teacher he asked sharply dr robert stadler he chuckled relieved oh that one hes the looter who thinks that his end justifies his seizure of my means he added you know dagny id like you to remember which side you said im on some day ill remind you of it and ask you whether youll want to repeat it you wont have to remind me he turned to go he tossed his hand in a casual salute and said if it could be built id wish good luck to the rio norte line its going to be built and its going to be called the john galt line what it was an actual scream she chuckled derisively the john galt line dagny in heavens name why dont you like it how did you happen to choose that it sounds better than mr nemo or mr zero doesnt it dagny why that because it frightens you what do you think it stands for the impossible the unattainable and youre all afraid of my line just as youre afraid of that name he started laughing he laughed not looking at her and she felt strangely certain that he had forgotten her that he was far away that he was laughingin furious gaiety and bitternessat something in which she had no part when he turned to her he said earnestly dagny i wouldnt if i were you she shrugged jim didnt like it either what do you like about it i hate it i hate the doom youre all waiting for the giving up and that senseless question that always sounds like a cry for help im sick of hearing pleas for john galt im going to fight him he said quietly you are im going to build a railroad line for him let him come and claim it he smiled sadly and nodded he will the glow of poured steel streamed across the ceiling and broke against one wall rearden sat at his desk in the light of a single lamp beyond its circle the darkness of the office blended with the darkness outside he felt as if it were empty space where the rays of the furnaces moved at will as if the desk were a raft hanging in midair holding two persons imprisoned in privacy dagny sat in front of his desk she had thrown her coat off and she sat outlined against it a slim tense body in a gray suit leaning diagonally across the wide armchair only her hand lay in the light on the edge of the desk beyond it he saw the pale suggestion of her face the white of a blouse the triangle of an open collar all right hank she said were going ahead with a new rearden metal bridge this is the official order of the official owner of the john galt line he smiled looking down at the drawings of the bridge spread in the light on his desk have you had a chance to examine the scheme we submitted yes you dont need my comments or compliments the order says it very well thank you ill start rolling the metal dont you want to ask whether the john galt line is in a position to place orders or to function i dont need to your coming here says it she smiled true its all set hank i came to tell you that and to discuss the details of the bridge in person all right i am curious who are the bondholders of the john galt line i dont think any of them could afford it all of them have growing enterprises all of them needed their money for their own concerns but they needed the line and they did not ask anyone for help she took a paper out of her bag heres john galt inc she said handing it across the desk he knew most of the names on the list ellis wyatt wyatt oil colorado ted nielsen nielsen motors colorado lawrence hammond hammond cars colorado andrew stockton stockton foundry colorado there were a few from other states he noticed the name kenneth danagger danagger coal pennsylvania the amounts of their subscriptions varied from sums in five figures to six he reached for his fountain pen wrote at the bottom of the list henry rearden rearden steel pennsylvania and tossed the list back to her hank she said quietly i didnt want you in on this youve invested so much in rearden metal that its worse for you than for any of us you cant afford another risk i never accept favors he answered coldly what do you mean i dont ask people to take greater chances on my ventures than i take myself if its a gamble ill match anybodys gambling didnt you say that that track was my first showcase she inclined her head and said gravely all right thank you incidentally i dont expect to lose this money i am aware of the conditions under which these bonds can be converted into stock at my option i therefore expect to make an inordinate profitand youre going to earn it for me she laughed god hank ive spoken to so many yellow fools that theyve almost infected me into thinking of the line as of a hopeless loss thanks for reminding me yes i think ill earn your inordinate profit for you if it werent for the yellow fools there wouldnt be any risk in it at all but we have to beat them we will he reached for two telegrams from among the papers on his desk there are still a few men in existence he extended the telegrams i think youd like to see these one of them read i had intended to undertake it in two years but the statement of the state science institute compels me to proceed at once consider this a commitment for the construction of a inch pipe line of rearden metal miles colorado to kansas city details follow ellis wyatt the other read re our discussion of my order go ahead ken danagger he added in explanation he wasnt prepared to proceed at once either its eight thousand tons of rearden metal structural metal for coal mines they glanced at each other and smiled they needed no further comment he glanced down as she handed the telegrams back to him the skin of her hand looked transparent in the light on the edge of his desk a young girls hand with long thin fingers relaxed for a moment defenseless the stockton foundry in colorado she said is going to finish that order for methe one that the amalgamated switch and signal company ran out on theyre going to get in touch with you about the metal they have already what have you done about the construction crews nealys engineers are staying on the best ones those i need and most of the foremen too it wont be too hard to keep them going nealy wasnt of much use anyway what about labor more applicants than i can hire i dont think the union is going to interfere most of the applicants are giving phony names theyre union members they need the work desperately ill have a few guards on the line but i dont expect any trouble what about your brother jims board of directors theyre all scrambling to get statements into the newspapers to the effect that they have no connection whatever with the john galt line and how reprehensible an undertaking they think it is they agreed to everything i asked the line of her shoulders looked taut yet thrown back easily as if poised for flight tension seemed natural to her not a sign of anxiety but a sign of enjoyment the tension of her whole body under the gray suit halfvisible in the darkness eddie willers has taken over the office of operating vicepresident she said if you need anything get in touch with him im leaving for colorado tonight tonight yes we have to make up time weve lost a week flying your own plane yes ill be back in about ten days i intend to be in new york once or twice a month where will you live out there on the site in my own railway carthat is eddies car which im borrowing will you be safe safe from what then she laughed startled why hank its the first time youve ever thought that i wasnt a man of coarse ill be safe he was not looking at her he was looking at a sheet of figures on his desk ive had my engineers prepare a breakdown of the cost of the bridge he said and an approximate schedule of the construction time required that is what i wanted to discuss with you he extended the papers she settled back to read them a wedge of light fell across her face he saw the firm sensual mouth in sharp outline then she leaned back a little and he saw only a suggestion of its shape and the dark lines of her lowered lashes havent ihe thought havent i thought of it since the first time i saw you havent i thought of nothing else for two years he sat motionless looking at her he heard the words he had never allowed himself to form the words he had felt known yet had not faced had hoped to destroy by never letting them be said within his own mind now it was as sudden and shocking as if he were saying it to her since the first time i saw you nothing but your body that mouth of yours and the way your eyes would look at me if through every sentence i ever said to you through every conference you thought so safe through the importance of all the issues we discussed you trusted me didnt you to recognize your greatness to think of you as you deservedas if you were a man dont you suppose i know how much ive betrayed the only bright encounter of my lifethe only person i respectedthe best businessman i knowmy allymy partner in a desperate battle the lowest of all desiresas my answer to the highest ive met do you know what i am i thought of it because it should have been unthinkable for that degrading need which should never touch you i have never wanted anyone but you i hadnt known what it was like to want it until i saw you for the first time i had thought not i i couldnt be broken by it since then for two years with not a moments respite do you know what its like to want it would you wish to hear what i thought when i looked at you when i lay awake at night when i heard your voice over a telephone wire when i worked but could not drive it away to bring you down to things you cant conceiveand to know that its i who have done it to reduce you to a body to teach you an animals pleasure to see you need it to see you asking me for it to see your wonderful spirit dependent upon the obscenity of your need to watch you as you are as you face the world with your clean proud strengththen to see you in my bed submitting to any infamous whim i may devise to any act which ill perform for the sole purpose of watching your dishonor and to which youll submit for the sake of an unspeakable sensation i want youand may i be damned for it she was reading the papers leaning back in the darknesshe saw the reflection of the fire touching her hair moving to her shoulder down her arm to the naked skin of her wrist do you know what im thinking now in this moment your gray suit and your open collar you look so young so austere so sure of yourself what would you be like if i knocked your head back if i threw you down in that formal suit of yours if i raised your skirt she glanced up at him he looked down at the papers on his desk in a moment he said the actual cost of the bridge is less than our original estimate you will note that the strength of the bridge allows for the eventual addition of a second track which i think that section of the country will justify in a very few years if you spread the cost over a period of he spoke and she looked at his face in the lamplight against the black emptiness of the office the lamp was outside her field of vision and she felt as if it were his face that illuminated the papers on the desk his face she thought and the cold radiant clarity of his voice of his mind of ms drive to a single purpose the face was like his wordsas if the line of a single theme ran from the steady glance of the eyes through the gaunt muscles of the cheeks to the faintly scornful downward curve of the mouththe line of a ruthless asceticism the day began with the news of a disaster a freight train of the atlantic southern had crashed headon into a passenger train in new mexico on a sharp curve in the mountains scattering freight cars all over the slopes the cars carried five thousand tons of copper bound from a mine in arizona to the rearden mills rearden telephoned the general manager of the atlantic southern but the answer he received was oh god mr rearden how can we tell how can anybody tell how long it will take to clear that wreck one of the worst weve ever had i dont know mr rearden there are no other lines anywhere in that section the track is torn for twelve hundred feet theres been a rockslide our wrecking train cant get through i dont know how well ever get those freight cars back on rails or when cant expect it sooner than two weeks three days impossible mr rearden but we cant help it but surely you can tell your customers that its an act of god what if you do hold them up nobody can blame you in a case of this kind in the next two hours with the assistance of his secretary two young engineers from his shipping department a road map and the longdistance telephone rearden arranged for a fleet of trucks to proceed to the scene of the wreck and for a chain of hopper cars to meet them at the nearest station of the atlantic southern the hopper cars had been borrowed from taggart transcontinental the trucks had been recruited from all over new mexico arizona and colorado reardens engineers had hunted by telephone for private truck owners and had offered payments that cut all arguments short it was the third of three shipments of copper that rearden had expected two orders had not been delivered one company had gone out of business the other was still pleading delays that it could not help he had attended to the matter without breaking his chain of appointments without raising his voice without sign of strain uncertainty or apprehension he had acted with the swift precision of a military commander under sudden fireand gwen ives his secretary had acted as his calmest lieutenant she was a girl in her late twenties whose quietly harmonious impenetrable face had a quality matching the best designed office equipment she was one of his most ruthlessly competent employees her manner of performing her duties suggested the kind of rational cleanliness that would consider any element of emotion while at work as an unpardonable immorality when the emergency was over her sole comment was mr rearden i think we should ask all our suppliers to ship via taggart transcontinental im thinking that too he answered then added wire fleming in colorado tell him im taking an option on that copper mine property he was back at his desk speaking to his superintendent on one phone and to his purchasing manager on another checking every date and ton of ore on handhe could not leave to chance or to another person the possibility of a single hours delay in the flow of a furnace it was the last of the rail for the john galt line that was being pouredwhen the buzzer rang and miss ives voice announced that his mother was outside demanding to see him he had asked his family never to come to the mills without appointment he had been glad that they hated the place and seldom appeared in his office what he now felt was a violent impulse to order his mother off the premises instead with a greater effort than the problem of the train wreck had required of him he said quietly all right ask her to come in his mother came in with an air of belligerent defensiveness she looked at his office as if she knew what it meant to him and as if she were declaring her resentment against anything being of greater importance to him than her own person she took a long time settling down in an armchair arranging and rearranging her bag her gloves the folds of her dress while droning its a fine thing when a mother has to wait in an anteroom and ask permission of a stenographer before shes allowed to see her own son who mother is it anything important i am very rushed today youre not the only one whos got problems of course its important do you think id go to the trouble of driving way out here if it wasnt important what is it its about philip yes philip is unhappy well he feels its not right that he should have to depend on your charity and live on handouts and never be able to count on a single dollar of his own well he said with a startled smile ive been waiting for him to realize that it isnt right for a sensitive man to be in such a position it certainly isnt im glad you agree with me so what you have to do is give him a job a what you must give him a job here at the millsbut a nice clean job of course with a desk and an office and a decent salary where he wouldnt have to be among your day laborers and your smelly furnaces he knew that he was hearing it he could not make himself believe it mother youre not serious i certainly am i happen to know that thats what he wants only s too proud to ask you for it but if you offer it to him and make it look like its you whore asking him a favorwhy i know hed be happy to take it thats why i had to come here to talk to youso he wouldnt guess that i put you up to it it was not in the nature of his consciousness to understand the nature of the things he was hearing a single thought cut through his mind like a spotlight making him unable to conceive how any eyes could miss it the thought broke out of him as a cry of bewilderment but he knows nothing about the steel business what has that got to do with it he needs a job but he couldnt do the work he needs to gain selfconfidence and to feel important but he wouldnt be any good whatever he needs to feel that hes wanted here what could i want him for you hire plenty of strangers i hire men who produce what has he got to offer hes your brother isnt he what has that got to do with it she stared incredulously in turn silenced by shock for a moment they sat looking at each other as if across an interplanetary distance hes your brother she said her voice like a phonograph record repeating a magic formula she could not permit herself to doubt he needs a position in the world he needs a salary so that hed feel that hes got money coming to him as his due not as alms as his due but he wouldnt be worth a nickel to me is that what you think of first your profit im asking you to help your brother and youre figuring how to make a nickel on him and you wont help him unless theres money in it for youis that it she saw the expression of his eyes and she looked away but spoke hastily her voice rising yes sure youre helping himlike youd help any stray beggar material helpthats all you know or understand have you thought about his spiritual needs and what his position is doing to his selfrespect he doesnt want to live like a beggar he wants to be independent of you by means of getting from me a salary he cant earn for work he cant do youd never miss it youve got enough people here whore making money for you are you asking me to help him stage a fraud of that kind you dont have to put it that way is it a fraudor isnt it thats why i cant talk to youbecause youre not human you have no pity no feeling for your brother no compassion for his feelings is it a fraud or not you have no mercy for anybody do you think that a fraud of this kind would be just youre the most immoral man livingyou think of nothing but justice you dont feel any love at all he got up his movement abrupt and stressed the movement of ending an interview and ordering a visitor out of his office mother im running a steel plantnot a whorehouse henry the gasp of indignation was at his choice of language nothing more dont ever speak to me again about a job for philip i would not give him the job of a cinder sweeper i would not allow him inside my mills i want you to understand that once and for all you may try to help him in any way you wish but dont ever let me see you thinking of my mills as a means to that end the wrinkles of her soft chin trickled into a shape resembling a sneer what are they your millsa holy temple of some kind why yes he said softly astonished at the thought dont you ever think of people and of your moral duties i dont know what it is that you choose to call morality no i dont think of peopleexcept that if i gave a job to philip i wouldnt be able to face any competent man who needed work and deserved it she got up her head was drawn into her shoulders and the righteous bitterness of her voice seemed to push the words upward at his tall straight figure thats your cruelty thats whats mean and selfish about you if you loved your brother youd give him a job he didnt deserve precisely because he didnt deserve itthat would be true love and kindness and brotherhood else whats love for if a man deserves a job theres no virtue in giving it to him virtue is the giving of the undeserved he was looking at her like a child at an unfamiliar nightmare incredulity preventing it from becoming horror mother he said slowly you dont know what youre saying im not able ever to despise you enough to believe that you mean it the look on her face astonished him more than all the rest it was a look of defeat and yet of an odd sly cynical cunning as if for a moment she held some worldly wisdom that mocked his innocence the memory of that look remained in his mind like a warning signal telling him that he had glimpsed an issue which he had to understand but he could not grapple with it he could not force his mind to accept it as worthy of thought he could find no clue except his dim uneasiness and his revulsionand he had no time to give it he could not think of it now he was facing his next caller seated in front of his deskhe was listening to a man who pleaded for his life the man did not state it in such terms but rearden knew that that was the essence of the case what the man put into words was only a a for five hundred tons of steel he was mr ward of the ward harvester company of minnesota it was an unpretentious company with an unblemished reputation the kind of business concern that seldom grows large but never fails mr ward represented the fourth generation of a family that had owned the plant and had given it the conscientious best of such ability as they possessed he was a man in his fifties with a square stolid face looking at him one knew that he would consider it as indecent to let his face show suffering as to remove his clothes in public he spoke in a dry businesslike manner he explained that he had always dealt as his father had with one of the small steel companies now taken over by orren boyles associated steel he had waited for his last order of steel for a year he had spent the last month struggling to obtain a personal interview with rearden i know that your mills are running at capacity mr rearden he said and i know that you are not in a position to take care of new orders what with your biggest oldest customers having to wait their turn you being the only decenti mean reliablesteel manufacturer left in the country i dont know what reason to offer you as to why you should want to make an exception in my case but there was nothing else for me to do except close the doors of my plant for good and ithere was a slight break in his voicei cant quite see my way to closing the doors as yet so i thought id speak to you even if i didnt have much chance still i had to try everything possible this was language that rearden could understand i wish i could help you out he said but this is the worst possible time for me because of a very large very special order that has to take precedence over everything i know but would you just give me a hearing mr rearden sure if its a question of money ill pay anything you ask if i could make it worth your while that way why charge me any extra you please charge me double the regular price only let me have the steel i wouldnt care if i had to sell the harvester at a loss this year just so i could keep the doors open ive got enough personally to run at a loss for a couple of years if necessary just to hold outbecause i figure things cant go on this way much longer conditions are bound to improve theyve got to or else well he did not finish he said firmly theyve got to they will said rearden the thought of the john galt line ran through his mind like a harmony under the confident sound of his words the john galt line was moving forward the attacks on his metal had ceased he felt as if miles apart across the country he and dagny taggart now stood in empty space their way cleared free to finish the job theyll leave us alone to do it he thought the words were like a battle hymn in his mind theyll leave us alone our plant capacity is one thousand harvesters per year said mr ward last year we put out three hundred i scraped the steel together from bankruptcy sales and begging a few tons here and there from big companies and just going around like a scavenger to all sorts of unlikely placeswell i wont bore you with that only i never thought id live to see the time when id have to do business that way and all the while mr orren boyle was swearing to me that he was going to deliver the steel next week but whatever he managed to pour it went to new customers of his for some reason nobody would mention only i heard it whispered that they were men with some sort of political pull and now i cant even get to mr boyle at all hes in washington been there for over a month and all his office tells me is just that they cant help it because they cant get the ore dont waste your time on them said rearden youll never get anything from that outfit you know mr rearden he said in the tone of a discovery which he could not quite bring himself to believe i think theres something phony about the way mr boyle runs his business i cant understand what hes after theyve got half their furnaces idle but last month there were all those big stories about associated steel in all the newspapers about their output why noabout the wonderful housing project that mr boyles just built for his workers last week it was colored movies that mr boyle sent to all the high schools showing how steel is made and what great service it performs for everybody now mr boyles got a radio program they give talks about the importance of the steel industry to the country and they keep saying that we must preserve the steel industry as a whole i dont understand what he means by it as a whole i do forget it he wont get away with it you know mr rearden i dont like people who talk too much about how everything they do is just for the sake of others its not true and i dont think it would be right if it ever were true so ill say that what i need the steel for is to save my own business because its mine because if i had to close it oh well nobody understands that nowadays i do yes yes i think you would so you see thats my first concern but still there are my customers too theyve dealt with me for years theyre counting on me its just about impossible to get any sort of machinery anywhere do you know what its getting to be like out in minnesota when the farmers cant get tools when machine break down in the middle of the harvest season and there are no parts no replacements nothing but mr orren boyles colored movies about oh well and then there are my workers too some of them have been with us since my fathers time theyve got no other place to go not now it was impossible thought rearden to squeeze more steel out of mills where every furnace every hour and every ton were scheduled in advance for urgent orders for the next six months but the john galt line he thought if he could do that he could do anything he felt as if he wished to undertake ten new problems at once he felt as if this were a world where nothing was impossible to him look he said reaching for the telephone let me check with my superintendent and see just what were pouring in the next few weeks maybe ill find a way to borrow a few tons from some of the orders and mr ward looked quickly away from him but rearden had caught a glimpse of his face its so much for him thought rearden and so little for me he lifted the telephone receiver but he had to drop it because the door of his office flew open and gwen ives rushed in it seemed impossible that miss ives should permit herself a breach of that kind or that the calm of her face should look like an unnatural distortion or that her eyes should seem blinded or that her steps should sound a shred of discipline away from staggering she said excuse me for interrupting mr rearden but he knew that she did not see the office did not see mr ward saw nothing but him i thought i must tell you that the legislature has just passed the equalization of opportunity bill it was the stolid mr ward who screamed oh god no oh nostaring at rearden rearden had leaped to his feet he stood unnaturally bent one shoulder drooping forward it was only an instant then he looked around him as if regaining eyesight said excuse me his glance including both miss ives and mr ward and sat down again we were not informed that the bill had been brought to the floor were we he asked his voice controlled and dry no mr rearden apparently it was a surprise move and it took them just fortyfive minutes have you heard from mouch no mr rearden she stressed the no it was the office boy from the fifth floor who came running in to tell me that hed just heard it on the radio i called the newspapers to verify it i tried to reach mr mouch in washington his office does not answer when did we hear from him last ten days ago mr rearden all right thank you gwen keep trying to get his office yes mr rearden she walked out mr ward was on his feet hat in hand he muttered i guess id better sit down rearden snapped fiercely mr ward obeyed staring at him we had business to transact didnt we said rearden mr ward could not define the emotion that contorted reardens mouth as he spoke mr ward what is it that the foulest bastards on earth denounce us for among other things oh yes for our motto of business as usual wellbusiness as usual mr ward he picked up the telephone receiver and asked for his superintendent say pete what yes ive heard can it well talk about that later what i want to know is could you let me have five hundred tons of steel extra above schedule in the next few weeks yes i know i know its tough give me the dates and the figures he listened rapidly jotting notes down on a sheet of paper then he said right thank you and hung up he studied the figures for a few moments marking some brief calculations on the margin of the sheet then he raised his head all right mr ward he said you will have your steel in ten days when mr ward had gone rearden came out into the anteroom he said to miss ives his voice normal wire fleming in colorado hell know why i have to cancel that option she inclined her head in the manner of a nod signifying obedience she did not look at him he turned to his next caller and said with a gesture of invitation toward his office how do you do come in he would think of it later he thought one moves step by step and one must keep moving for the moment with an unnatural clarity with a brutal simplification that made it almost easy his consciousness contained nothing but one thought it must not stop me the sentence hung alone with no past and no future he did not think of what it was that must not stop him or why this sentence was such a crucial absolute it held him and he obeyed he went step by step he completed his schedule of appointments as scheduled it was late when his last caller departed and he came out of his office the rest of his staff had gone home miss ives sat alone at her desk in an empty room she sat straight and stiff her hands clasped tightly together in her lap her head was not lowered but held rigidly level and her face seemed frozen tears were running down her cheeks with no sound with no facial movement against her resistance beyond control she saw him and said dryly guiltily in apology im sorry mr rearden not attempting the futile pretense of hiding her face he approached her thank you he said gently she looked up at him astonished he smiled but dont you think youre underestimating me gwen isnt it too soon to cry over me i could have taken the rest of it she whispered but theyshe pointed at the newspapers on her desktheyre calling it a victory for antigreed he laughed aloud i can see where such a distortion of the english language would make you furious he said but what else as she looked at him her mouth relaxed a little the victim whom she could not protect was her only point of reassurance in a world dissolving around her he moved his hand gently across her forehead it was an unusual break of formality for him and a silent acknowledgment of the things at which he had not laughed go home gwen i wont need you tonight im going home myself in just a little while no i dont want you to wait it was past midnight when still sitting at his desk bent over blueprints of the bridge for the john galt line he stopped his work abruptly because emotion reached him in a sudden stab not to be escaped any longer as if a curtain of anesthesia had broken he slumped down halfway still holding onto some shred of resistance and sat his chest pressed to the edge of the desk to stop him his head hanging down as if the only achievement still possible to him was not to let his head drop down on the desk he sat that way for a few moments conscious of nothing but pain a screaming pain without content or limithe sat not knowing whether it was in his mind or his body reduced to the terrible ugliness of pain that stopped thought in a few moments it was over he raised his head and sat up straight quietly leaning back against his chair now he saw that in postponing this moment for hours he had not been guilty of evasion he had not thought of it because there was nothing to think thoughthe told himself quietlyis a weapon one uses in order to act no action was possible thought is the tool by which one makes a choice no choice was left to him thought sets ones purpose and the way to reach it in the matter of his life being torn piece by piece out of him he was to have no voice no purpose no way no defense he thought of this in astonishment he saw for the first time that he had never known fear because against any disaster he had held the omnipotent cure of being able to act no he thought not an assurance of victorywho can ever have thatonly the chance to act which is all one needs now he was contemplating impersonally and for the first time the real heart of terror being delivered to destruction with ones hands tied behind ones back well then go on with your hands tied he thought go on in chains go on it must not stop you but another voice was telling him things he did not want to hear while he fought back crying through and against it theres no point in thinking of that theres no use what for leave it alone he could not choke it off he sat still over the drawings of the bridge for the john galt line and heard the things released by a voice that was partsound partsight they decided it without him they did not call for him they did not ask they did not let him speak they were not bound even by the duty to let him knowto let him know that they had slashed part of his life away and that he had to be ready to walk on as a cripple of ah those concerned whoever they were for whichever reason for whatever need he was the one they had not had to consider the sign at the end of a long road said rearden ore it hung over black tiers of metal and over years and nights over a clock ticking drops of his blood away the blood he had given gladly exultantly in payment for a distant day and a sign over a road paid for with his effort his strength his mind his hope destroyed at the whim of some men who sat and voted who knows by what minds who knows whose will had placed them in powerwhat motive moved themwhat was their knowledgewhich one of them unaided could bring a chunk of ore out of the earth destroyed at the whim of men whom he had never seen and who had never seen those tiers of metal destroyed because they so decided by what right he shook his head there are things one must not contemplate he thought there is an obscenity of evil which contaminates the observer there is a limit to what it is proper for a man to see he must not think of this or look within it or try to learn the nature of its roots feeling quiet and empty he told himself that he would be all right tomorrow he would forgive himself the weakness of this night it was like the tears one is permitted at a funeral and then one learns how to live with an open wound or with a crippled factory he got up and walked to the window the mills seemed deserted and still he saw feeble snatches of red above black funnels long coils of steam the webbed diagonals of cranes and bridges he felt a desolate loneliness of a kind he had never known before he thought that gwen ives and mr ward could look to him for hope for relief for renewal of courage to whom could he look for it he too needed it for once he wished he had a friend who could be permitted to see him suffer without pretense or protection on whom he could lean for a moment just to say im very tired and find a moments rest of all the men he knew was there one he wished he had beside him now he heard the answer in his mind immediate and shocking francisco danconia his chuckle of anger brought him back the absurdity of the longing jolted him into calm thats what you get he thought when you indulge yourself in weakness he stood at the window trying not to think but he kept hearing words in his mind rearden ore rearden coal rearden steel rearden metal what was the use why had he done it why should he ever want to do anything again his first day on the ledges of the ore mines the day when he stood in the wind looking down at the ruins of a steel plant the day when he stood here in this office at this window and thought that a bridge could be made to carry incredible loads on just a few bars of metal if one combined a truss with an arch if one built diagonal bracing with the top members curved to he stopped and stood still he had not thought of combining a truss with an arch that day in the next moment he was at his desk bending over it with one knee on the seat of the chair with no time to think of sitting down he was drawing lines curves triangles columns of calculations indiscriminately on the blueprints on the desk blotter on somebodys letters and an hour later he was calling for a longdistance line he was waiting for a phone to ring by a bed in a railway car on a siding he was saying dagny that bridge of oursthrow in the ash can all the drawings i sent you because what oh that to hell with that never mind the looters and their laws forget it dagny what do we care listen you know the contraption you called the rearden truss that you admired so much its not worth a damn ive figured out a truss that will beat anything ever built your bridge will carry four trains at once stand three hundred years and cost you less than your cheapest culvert ill send you the drawings in two days but i wanted to tell you about it right now you see its a matter of combining a truss with an arch if we take diagonal bracing and what i cant hear you have you caught a cold what are you thanking me for as yet wait till i explain it to you chapter viii the john galt line the worker smiled looking at eddie willers across the table i feel like a fugitive said eddie willers i guess you know why i havent been here for months he pointed at the underground cafeteria im supposed to be a vicepresident now the vicepresident in charge of operation for gods sake dont take it seriously i stood it as long as i could and then i had to escape if only for one evening the first time i came down here for dinner after my alleged promotion they all stared at me so much i didnt dare come back well let them stare you dont im glad that it doesnt make any difference to you no i havent seen her for two weeks but i speak to her on the phone every day sometimes twice a day yes i know how she feels she loves it what is it we hear over the telephonesound vibrations isnt it well her voice sounds as if it were turning into light vibrationsif you know what i mean she enjoys running that horrible battle single handed and winning oh yes shes winning do you know why you havent read anything about the john galt line in the newspapers for some time because its going so well only that rearden metal rail will be the greatest track ever built but what will be the use if we dont have any engines powerful enough to take advantage of it look at the kind of patched coalburners weve got leftthey can barely manage to drag themselves fast enough for old trolleycar rails still theres hope the united locomotive works went bankrupt thats the best break weve had in the last few weeks because their plant has been bought by dwight sanders hes a brilliant young engineer whos got the only good aircraft plant in the country he had to sell the aircraft plant to his brother in order to take over united locomotive thats on account of the equalization of opportunity bill sure its just a setup between them but can you blame him anyway well see diesels coming out of the united locomotive works now dwight sanders will start things going yes shes counting on him why do you ask that yes hes crucially important to us right now weve just signed a contract with him for the first ten diesel engines hell build when i phoned her that the contract was signed she laughed and said you see is there ever any reason to be afraid she said that because she knowsive never told her but she knowsthat im afraid yes i am i dont know i wouldnt be afraid if i knew of what i could do something about it but this tell me dont you really despise me for being operating vicepresident but dont you see that its vicious what honor i dont know what it is that i really am a clown a ghost an understudy or just a rotten stooge when i sit in her office in her chair at her desk i feel worse than that i feel like a murderer sure i know that im supposed to be a stooge for herand that would be an honorbut but i feel as if in some horrible way which i cant quite grasp im a stooge for jim taggart why should it be necessary for her to have a stooge why does she have to hide why did they throw her out of the building do you know that she had to move out into a dinky hole in the back alley across from our express and baggage entrance you ought to take a look at it some time thats the office of john galt inc yet everybody knows that its she whos still running taggart transcontinental why does she have to hide the magnificent job shes doing why are they giving her no credit why are they robbing her of her achievementwith me as the receiver of stolen goods why are they doing everything in their power to make it impossible for her to succeed when shes all theyve got standing between them and destruction why are they torturing her in return for saving their lives whats the matter with you why do you look at me like that yes i guess you understand theres something about it all that i cant define and its something evil thats why im afraid i dont think one can get away with it you know its strange but i think they know it too jim and his crowd and all of them in the building theres something guilty and sneaky about the whole place guilty and sneaky and dead taggart transcontinental is now like a man whos lost his soul whos betrayed his soul no she doesnt care last time she was in new york she came in unexpectedlyi was in my office in her officeand suddenly the door opened and there she was she came in saying mr willers im looking for a job as a station operator would you give me a chance i wanted to damn them all but i had to laugh i was so glad to see her and she was laughing so happily she had come straight from the airportshe wore slacks and a flying jacketshe looked wonderfulshed got windburned it looked like a suntan just as if shed returned from a vacation she made me remain where i was in her chair and she sat on the desk and talked about the new bridge of the john galt line no no i never asked her why she chose that name i dont know what it means to her a sort of challenge i guess i dont know to whom oh it doesnt matter it doesnt mean a thing there isnt any john galt but i wish she hadnt used it i dont like it do you you do you dont sound very happy saying it the windows of the offices of the john galt line faced a dark alley looking up from her desk dagny could not see the sky only the wall of a building rising past her range of vision it was the side wall of the great skyscraper of taggart transcontinental her new headquarters were two rooms on the ground floor of a half collapsed structure the structure still stood but its upper stories were boarded off as unsafe for occupancy such tenants as it sheltered were halfbankrupt existing as it did on the inertia of the momentum of the past she liked her new place it saved money the rooms contained no superfluous furniture or people the furniture had come from junk shops the people were the choice best she could find on her rare visits to new york she had no time to notice the room where she worked she noticed only that it served its purpose she did not know what made her stop tonight and look at the thin streaks of rain on the glass of the window at the wall of the building across the alley it was past midnight her small staff had gone she was due at the airport at three am to fly her plane back to colorado she had little left to do only a few of eddies reports to read with the sudden break of the tension of hurrying she stopped unable to go on the reports seemed to require an effort beyond her power it was too late to go home and sleep too early to go to the airport she thought youre tiredand watched her own mood with severe contemptuous detachment knowing that it would pass she had flown to new york unexpectedly at a moments notice leaping to the controls of her plane within twenty minutes after hearing a brief item in a news broadcast the radio voice had said that dwight sanders had retired from business suddenly without reason or explanation she had hurried to new york hoping to find him and stop him but she had felt while flying across the continent that there would be no trace of him to find the spring rain hung motionless in the air beyond the window like a thin mist she sat looking across at the open cavern of the express and baggage entrance of the taggart terminal there were naked lights inside among the steel girders of the ceiling and a few piles of luggage on the worn concrete of the floor the place looked abandoned and dead she glanced at a jagged crack on the wall of her office she heard no sound she knew she was alone in the ruins of a building it seemed as if she were alone in the city she felt an emotion held back for years a loneliness much beyond this moment beyond the silence of the room and the wet glistening emptiness of the street the loneliness of a gray wasteland where nothing was worth reaching the loneliness of her childhood she rose and walked to the window by pressing her face to the pane she could see the whole of the taggart building its lines converging abruptly to its distant pinnacle in the sky she looked up at the dark window of the room that had been her office she felt as if she were in exile never to return as if she were separated from the building by much more than a sheet of glass a curtain of rain and the span of a few months she stood in a room of crumbling plaster pressed to the windowpane looking up at the unattainable form of everything she loved she did not know the nature of her loneliness the only words that named it were this is not the world i expected once when she was sixteen looking at a long stretch of taggart track at the rails that convergedlike the lines of a skyscraperto a single point in the distance she had told eddie willers that she had always felt as if the rails were held in the hand of a man beyond the horizonno not her father or any of the men in the officeand some day she would meet him she shook her head and turned away from the window she went back to her desk she tried to reach for the reports but suddenly she was slumped across the desk her head on her arm dont she thought but she did not move to rise it made no difference there was no one to see her this was a longing she had never permitted herself to acknowledge she faced it now she thought if emotion is ones response to the things the world has to offer if she loved the rails the building and more if she loved her love for themthere was still one response the greatest that she had missed she thought to find a feeling that would hold as their sum as their final expression the purpose of all the things she loved on earth to find a consciousness like her own who would be the meaning of her world as she would be of his no not francisco danconia not hank rearden not any man she had ever met or admired a man who existed only in her knowledge of her capacity for an emotion she had never felt but would have given her life to experience she twisted herself in a slow faint movement her breasts pressed to the desk she felt the longing in her muscles in the nerves of her body is that what you want is it as simple as thatshe thought but knew that it was not simple there was some unbreakable link between her love for her work and the desire of her body as if one gave her the right to the other the right and the meaning as if one were the completion of the otherand the desire would never be satisfied except by a being of equal greatness her face pressed to her arm she moved her head shaking it slowly hi negation she would never find it her own thought of what life could be like was all she would ever have of the world she had wanted only the thought of itand a few rare moments like a few lights reflected from it on her wayto know to hold to follow to the end she raised her head on the pavement of the alley outside her window she saw the shadow of a man who stood at the door of her office the door was some steps away she could not see him or the street light beyond only his shadow on the stones of the pavement he stood perfectly still he was so close to the door like a man about to enter that she waited to hear him knock instead she saw the shadow jerk abruptly as if he were jolted backward then he turned and walked away there was only the outline of his hat brim and shoulders left on the ground when he stopped the shadow lay still for a moment wavered and grew longer again as he came back she felt no fear she sat at her desk motionless watching in blank wonder he stopped at the door then backed away from it he stood somewhere in the middle of the alley then paced restlessly and stopped again his shadow swung like an irregular pendulum across the pavement describing the course of a soundless battle it was a man fighting himself to enter that door or to escape she looked on with peculiar detachment she had no power to react only to observe she wondered numbly distantly who was he had he been watching her from somewhere in the darkness had he seen her slumped across her desk in the lighted naked window had he watched her desolate loneliness as she was now watching his she felt nothing they were alone in the silence of a dead cityit seemed to her that he was miles away a reflection of suffering without identity a fellow survivor whose problem was as distant to her as hers would be to him he paced moving out of her sight coming back again she sat watchingon the glistening pavement of a dark alleythe shadow of an unknown torment the shadow moved away once more she waited it did not return then she leaped to her feet she had wanted to see the outcome of the battle now that he had won itor lostshe was struck by the sudden urgent need to know his identity and motive she ran through the dark anteroom she threw the door open and looked out the alley was empty the pavement went tapering off into the distance like a band of wet mirror under a few spaced lights there was no one in sight she saw the dark hole of a broken window in an abandoned shop beyond it there were the doors of a few rooming houses across the alley streaks of rain glittered under a light that hung over the black gap of an open door leading down to the underground tunnels of taggart transcontinental rearden signed the papers pushed them across the desk and looked away thinking that he would never have to think of them again wishing he were carried to the time when this moment would be far behind him paul larkin reached for the papers hesitantly he looked ingratiatingly helpless its only a legal technicality hank he said you know that ill always consider these ore mines as yours rearden shook his head slowly it was just a movement of his neck muscles his face looked immovable as if he were speaking to a stranger no he said either i own a property or i dont but but you know that you can trust me you dont have to worry about your supply of ore weve made an agreement you know that you can count on me i dont know it i hope i can but ive given you my word i have never been at the mercy of anyones word before why why do you say that were friends ill do anything you wish youll get my entire output the mines are still yoursjust as good as yours you have nothing to fear ill hank whats the matter dont talk but but whats the matter i dont like assurances i dont want any pretense about how safe i am im not we have made an agreement which i cant enforce i want you to know that i understand my position fully if you intend to keep your word dont talk about it just do it why do you look at me as if it were my fault you know how badly i feel about it i bought the mines only because i thought it would help you outi mean i thought youd rather sell them to a friend than to some total stranger its not my fault i dont like that miserable equalization bill i dont know whos behind it i never dreamed theyd pass it it was such a shock to me when they never mind but i only why do you insist on talking about it i larkins voice was pleading i gave you the best price hank the law said reasonable compensation my bid was higher than anyone elses rearden looked at the papers still lying across the desk he thought of the payment these papers gave him for his ore mines twothirds of the sum was money which larkin had obtained as a loan from the government the new law made provisions for such loans in order to give a fair opportunity to the new owners who have never had a chance twothirds of the rest was a loan he himself had granted to larkin a mortgage he had accepted on his own mines and the government money he thought suddenly the money now given to him as payment for his property where had that come from whose work had provided it you dont have to worry hank said larkin with that incomprehensible insistent note of pleading in his voice its just a paper formality rearden wondered dimly what it was that larkin wanted from him he felt that the man was waiting for something beyond the physical fact of the sale some words which he rearden was supposed to pronounce some action pertaining to mercy which he was expected to grant larkins eyes in this moment of his best fortune had the sickening look of a beggar why should you be angry hank its only a new form of legal red tape just a new historical condition nobody can help it if its a historical condition nobody can be blamed for it but theres always a way to get along look at all the others they dont mind theyre theyre setting up stooges whom they control to run the properties extorted from them i now why do you want to use such words i might as well tell youand i think you know itthat i am not good at games of that kind i have neither the time nor the stomach to devise some form of blackmail in order to tie you up and own my mines through you ownership is a thing i dont share and i dont wish to hold it by the grace of your cowardiceby means of a constant struggle to outwit you and keep some threat over your head i dont do business that way and i dont deal with cowards the mines are yours if you wish to give me first call on all the ore produced you will do so if you wish to doublecross me its in your power larkin looked hurt thats very unfair of you he said there was a dry little note of righteous reproach in his voice i have never given you cause to distrust me he picked up the papers with a hasty movement rearden saw the papers disappear into larkins inside coat pocket he saw the flare of the open coat the wrinkles of a vest pulled tight over flabby bulges and a stain of perspiration in the armpit of the shirt unsummoned the picture of a face seen twentyseven years ago rose suddenly in his mind it was the face of a preacher on a street corner he had passed in a town he could not remember any longer only the dark walls of the slums remained in his memory the rain of an autumn evening and the righteous malice of the mans mouth a small mouth stretched to yell into the darkness the noblest idealthat man live for the sake of his brothers that the strong work for the weak that he who has ability serve him who hasnt then he saw the boy who had been hank rearden at eighteen he saw the tension of the face the speed of the walk the drunken exhilaration of the body drunk on the energy of sleepless nights the proud lift of the head the clear steady ruthless eyes the eyes of a man who drove himself without pity toward that which he wanted and he saw what paul larkin must have been at that timea youth with an aged babys face smiling ingratiatingly joylessly begging to be spared pleading with the universe to give him a chance if someone had shown that youth to the hank rearden of that time and told him that this was to be the goal of his steps the collector of the energy of his aching tendons what would he have it was not a thought it was like the punch of a fist inside his skull then when he could think again rearden knew what the boy he had been would have felt a desire to step on the obscene thing which was larkin and grind every wet bit of it out of existence he had never experienced an emotion o this kind it took him a few moments to realize that this was what men called hatred he noticed that rising to leave and muttering some sort of goodbyes larkin had a wounded reproachful mouthpinched look as if he larkin were the injured party when he sold his coal mines to ken danagger who owned the largest coal company in pennsylvania rearden wondered why he felt as if it were almost painless he felt no hatred ken danagger was a man in his fifties with a hard closed face he had started in life as a miner when rearden handed to him the deed to his new property danagger said impassively i dont believe ive mentioned that any coal you buy from me youll get it at cost rearden glanced at him astonished its against the law he said whos going to find out what sort of cash i band to you in your own living room youre talking about a rebate i am thats against two dozen laws theyll sock you worse than me if they catch you at it sure thats your protectionso you wont be left at the mercy of my good will rearden smiled it was a happy smile but he closed his eyes as under a blow then he shook his head thanks he said but im not one of them i dont expect anybody to work for me at cost im not one of them either said danagger angrily look here rearden dont you suppose i know what im getting unearned the money doesnt pay you for it not nowadays you didnt volunteer to bid to buy my property i asked you to buy it i wish there had been somebody like you in the ore business to take over my mines there wasnt if you want to do me a favor dont offer me rebates give me a chance to pay you higher prices higher than anyone else will offer sock me anything you wish just so ill be first to get the coal ill manage my end of it only let me have the coal youll have it rearden wondered for a while why he heard no word from wesley mouch his calls to washington remained unanswered then he received a letter consisting of a single sentence which informed him that mr mouch was resigning from his employ two weeks later he read in the newspapers that wesley mouch had been appointed assistant coordinator of the bureau of economic planning and national resources dont dwell on any of itthought rearden through the silence of many evenings fighting the sudden access of that new emotion which he did not want to feelthere is an unspeakable evil in the world you know it and its no use dwelling on the details of it you must work a little harder just a little harder dont let it win the beams and girders of the rearden metal bridge were coming daily out of the rolling mills and were being shipped to the site of the john galt line where the first shapes of greenblue metal swung into space to span the canyon glittered in the first rays of the spring sun he had no time for pain no energy for anger within a few weeks it was over the blinding stabs of hatred ceased and did not return he was back in confident selfcontrol on the evening when he telephoned eddie willers eddie im in new york at the waynefalkland come to have breakfast with me tomorrow morning theres something id like to discuss with you eddie willers went to the appointment with a heavy feeling of guilt he had not recovered from the shock of the equalization of opportunity bill it had left a dull ache within him like the blackandblue mark of a blow he disliked the sight of the city it now looked as if it hid the threat of some malicious unknown he dreaded facing one of the bills victims he felt almost as if he eddie willers shared the responsibility for it in some terrible way which he could not define when he saw rearden the feeling vanished there was no hint suggesting a victim in reardens bearing beyond the windows of the hotel room the spring sunlight of early morning sparkled on the windows of the city the sky was a very pale blue that seemed young the offices were still closed and the city did not look as if it held malice but as if it were joyously hopefully ready to swing into actionin the same manner as rearden he looked refreshed by an untroubled sleep he wore a dressing gown he seemed impatient of the necessity to dress unwilling to delay the exciting game of his business duties good morning eddie sorry if i got you out so early its the only time i had have to go back to philadelphia right after breakfast we can talk while were eating the dressing gown he wore was of dark blue flannel with the white initials h r on the breast pocket he looked young relaxed at home in this room and in the world eddie watched a waiter wheel the breakfast table into the room with a swift efficiency that made him feel braced he found himself enjoying the stiff freshness of the white tablecloth and the sunlight sparkling on the silver on the two bowls of crushed ice holding glasses of orange juice he had not known that such things could give him an invigorating pleasure i didnt want to phone dagny long distance about this particular matter said rearden she has enough to do we can settle it in a few minutes you and i if i have the authority to do it rearden smiled you have he leaned forward across the table eddie whats the financial state of taggart transcontinental at the moment desperate worse than that mr rearden are you able to meet pay rolls not quite weve kept it out of the newspapers but i think everybody knows it were in arrears all over the system and jim is running out of excuses do you know that your first payment for the rearden metal rail is due next week yes i know it well lets agree on a moratorium im going to give you an extensionyou wont have to pay me anything until six months after the opening of the john galt line eddie willers put down his cup of coffee with a sharp thud he could not say a word rearden chuckled whats the matter you do have the authority to accept dont you mr rearden i dont know what to say to you why just okay is all thats necessary okay mr rearden eddies voice was barely audible ill draw up the papers and send them to you you can tell jim about it and have him sign them yes mr rearden i dont like to deal with jim hed waste two hours trying to make himself believe that hes made me believe that hes doing me a favor by accepting eddie sat without moving looking down at his plate whats the matter mr rearden id like to say thank you but there isnt any form of it big enough to look eddie youve got the makings of a good businessman so youd better get a few things straight there arent any thankyous in situations of this kind im not doing it for taggart transcontinental its a simple practical selfish matter on my part why should i collect my money from you now when it might prove to be the death blow to your company if your company were no good id collect and fast i dont engage in charity and i dont gamble on incompetents but youre still the best railroad in the country when the john galt line is completed youll be the soundest one financially so i have good reason to wait besides youre in trouble on account of my rail i intend to see you win i still owe you thanks mr rearden for something much greater than charity no dont you see i have just received a great deal of money which i didnt want i cant invest it its of no use to me whatever so in a way it pleases me that i can turn that money against the same people in the same battle they made it possible for me to give you an extension to help you fight them he saw eddie wincing as if he had hit a wound thats whats horrible about it what what theyve done to youand what youre doing in return i mean he stopped forgive me mr rearden i know this is no way to talk business rearden smiled thanks eddie i know what you mean but forget it to hell with them yes only mr rearden may i say something to you i know its completely improper and im not speaking as a vicepresident go ahead i dont have to tell you what your offer means to dagny to me to every decent person on taggart transcontinental you know it and you know you can count on us but but i think its horrible that jim taggart should benefit toothat you should be the one to save him and people like him after they rearden laughed eddie what do we care about people like him were driving an express and theyre riding on the roof making a lot of noise about being leaders why should we care we have enough power to carry them alonghavent we it wont stand the summer sun made blotches of fire on the windows of the city and glittering sparks in the dust of the streets columns of heat shimmered through the air rising from the roofs to the white page of the calendar the calendars motor ran on marking off the last days of june it wont stand people said when they run the first train on the john galt line the rail will split theyll never get to the bridge if they do the bridge will collapse under the engine from the slopes of colorado freight trains rolled down the track of the phoenixdurango north to wyoming and the main line of taggart transcontinental south to new mexico and the main line of the atlantic southern strings of tank cars went radiating in all directions from the wyatt oil fields to industries in distant states no one spoke about them to the knowledge of the public the tank trains moved as silently as rays and as rays they were noticed only when they became the light of electric lamps the heat of furnaces the movement of motors but as such they were not noticed they were taken for granted the phoenixdurango railroad was to end operations on july hank rearden is a greedy monster people said look at the fortune hes made has he ever given anything in return has he ever shown any sign of social conscience money thats all hes after hell do anything for money what does he care if people lose their lives when his bridge collapses the taggarts have been a band of vultures for generations people said its in their blood just remember that the founder of that family was nat taggart the most notoriously antisocial scoundrel that ever lived who bled the country white to squeeze a fortune for himself you can be sure that a taggart wont hesitate to risk peoples lives in order to make a profit they bought inferior rail because its cheaper than steelwhat do they care about catastrophes and mangled human bodies after theyve collected the fares people said it because other people said it they did not know why it was being said and heard everywhere they did not give or ask for reasons reason dr pritchett had told them is the most naive of all superstitions the source of public opinion said claude slagenhop in a radio speech there is no source of public opinion it is spontaneously general it is a reflex of the collective instinct of the collective mind orren boyle gave an interview to globe the news magazine with the largest circulation the interview was devoted to the subject of the grave social responsibility of metallurgists stressing the fact that metal performed so many crucial tasks where human lives depended on its quality one should not it seems to me use human beings as guinea pigs in the launching of a new product he said he mentioned no names why no i dont say that that bridge will collapse said the chief metallurgist of associated steel on a television program i dont say it at all i just say that if i had any children i wouldnt let them ride on the first train thats going to cross that bridge but its only a personal preference nothing more just because im overly fond of children i dont claim that the reardentaggart contraption will collapse wrote bertram scudder in the future maybe it will and maybe it wont thats not the important issue the important issue is what protection does society have against the arrogance selfishness and greed of two unbridled individualists whose records are conspicuously devoid of any publicspirited actions these two apparently are willing to stake the lives of their fellow men on their own conceited notions about their powers of judgment against the overwhelming majority opinion of recognized experts should society permit it if that thing does collapse wont it be too late to take precautionary measures wont it be like locking the barn after the horse has escaped it has always been the belief of this column that certain kinds of horses should be kept bridled and locked on general social principles a group that called itself committee of disinterested citizens collected signatures on a petition demanding a years study of the john galt line by government experts before the first train were allowed to run the petition stated that its signers had no motive other than a sense of civic duty the first signatures were those of balph eubank and mort liddy the petition was given a great deal of space and comment in all the newspapers the consideration it received was respectful because it came from people who were disinterested no space was given by the newspapers to the progress of the construction of the john galt line no reporter was sent to look at the scene the general policy of the press had been stated by a famous editor five years ago there are no objective facts he had said every report on facts is only somebodys opinion it is therefore useless to write about facts a few businessmen thought that one should think about the possibility that there might be commercial value in rearden metal they undertook a survey of the question they did not hire metallurgists to examine samples nor engineers to visit the site of construction they took a public poll ten thousand people guaranteed to represent every existing kin of brain were asked the question would you ride on the john galt line the answer overwhelmingly was no sirreel no voices were heard in public in defense of rearden metal and nobody attached significance to the fact that the stock of taggart transcontinental was rising on the market very slowly almost furtively there were men who watched and played safe mr mowen bought taggart stock in the name of his sister ben nealy bought it in the name of a cousin paul larkin bought it under an alias i dont believe in raising controversial issues said one of these men oh yes of course the construction is moving on schedule said james taggart shrugging to his board of directors oh yes you may feel full confidence my dear sister does not happen to be a human being but just an internal combustion engine so one must not wonder at her success when james taggart heard a rumor that some bridge girders had split and crashed killing three workmen he leaped to his feet and ran to his secretarys office ordering him to call colorado he waited pressed against the secretarys desk as if seeking protection his eyes had the unfocused look of panic yet his mouth moved suddenly into almost a smile and he said id give anything to see henry reardens face right now when he heard that the rumor was false he said thank god but his voice had a note of disappointment oh well said philip rearden to his friends hearing the same rumor maybe he can fail too once in a while maybe my great brother isnt as great as he thinks darling said lillian rearden to her husband i fought for you yesterday at a tea where the women were saying that dagny taggart is your mistress oh for heavens sake dont look at me like that i know its preposterous and i gave them hell for it its just that those silly bitches cant imagine any other reason why a woman would take such a stand against everybody for the sake of your metal of course i know better than that i know that the taggart woman is perfectly sexless and doesnt give a damn about youand darling i know that if you ever had the courage for anything of the sort which you havent you wouldnt go for an adding machine in tailored suits youd go for some blond feminine chorus girl whooh but henry im only joking dont look at me like that dagny james taggart said miserably whats going to happen to us taggart transcontinental has become so unpopular dagny laughed in enjoyment of the moment any moment as if the undercurrent of enjoyment was constant within her and little was needed to tap it she laughed easily her mouth relaxed and open her teeth were very white against her sunscorched face her eyes had the look acquired in open country of being set for great distances on her last few visits to new york he had noticed that she looked at him as if she did not see him what are we going to do the public is so overwhelmingly against us jim do you remember the story they tell about nat taggart he said that he envied only one of his competitors the one who said the public be damned he wished he had said it in the summer days and in the heavy stillness of the evenings of the city there were moments when a lonely man or womanon a park bench on a street corner at an open windowwould see in a newspaper a brief mention of the progress of the john galt line and would look at the city with a sudden stab of hope they were the very young who felt that it was the kind of event they longed to see happening in the worldor the very old who had seen a world in which such events did happen they did not care about railroads they knew nothing about business they knew only that someone was fighting against great odds and winning they did not admire the fighters purpose they believed the voices of public opinionand yet when they read that the line was growing they felt a moments sparkle and wondered why it made their own problems seem easier silently unknown to everyone except to the freight yard of taggart transcontinental in cheyenne and the office of the john galt line in the dark alley freight was rolling in and orders for cars were piling upfor the first train to run on the john galt line dagny taggart had announced that the first train would be not a passenger express loaded with celebrities and politicians as was the custom but a freight special the freight came from farms from lumber yards from mines all over the country from distant places whose last means of survival were the new factories of colorado no one wrote about these shippers because they were men who were not disinterested the phoenixdurango railroad was to close on july the first train of the john galt line was to run on july well its like this miss taggart said the delegate of the union of locomotive engineers i dont think were going to allow you to run that train dagny sat at her battered desk against the blotched wall of her office she said without moving get out of here it was a sentence the man had never heard in the polished offices of railroad executives he looked bewildered i came to tell you if you have anything to say to me start over again what dont tell me what youre going to allow me to do well i meant were not going to allow our men to run your train thats different well thats what weve decided whos decided it the committee what youre doing is a violation of human rights you cant force men to go out to get killedwhen that bridge collapses just to make money for you she reached for a sheet of blank paper and handed it to him put it down in writing she said and well sign a contract to that effect what contract that no member of your union will ever be employed to run an engine on the john galt line why wait a minute i havent said you dont want to sign such a contract no i why not since you know that the bridge is going to collapse i only want i know what you want you want a stranglehold on your men by means of the jobs which i give themand on me by means of your men you want me to provide the jobs and you want to make it impossible for me to have any jobs to provide now ill give you a choice that train is going to be run you have no choice about that but you can choose whether its going to be run by one of your men or not if you choose not to let them the train will still run if i have to drive the engine myself then if the bridge collapses there wont be any railroad left in existence anyway but if it doesnt collapse no member of your union will ever get a job on the john galt line if you think that i need your men more than they need me choose accordingly if you know that i can run an engine but they cant build a railroad choose according to that now are you going to forbid your men to run that train i didnt say wed forbid it i havent said anything about forbidding but but you cant force men to risk their lives on something nobodys ever tried before im not going to force anyone to take that run what are you going to do im going to ask for a volunteer and if none of them volunteers then it will be my problem not yours well let me tell you that im going to advise them to refuse go ahead advise them anything you wish tell them whatever you like but leave the choice to them dont try to forbid it the notice that appeared in every roundhouse of the taggart system was signed edwin willers vicepresident in charge of operation it asked engineers who were willing to drive the first train on the john galt line so to inform the office of mr willers not later than eleven am of july it was a quarter of eleven on the morning of the fifteenth when the telephone rang in her office it was eddie calling from high up in the taggart building outside her window dagny i think youd better come over his voice sounded queer she hurried across the street then down the marblefloored halls to the door that still carried the name dagny taggart on its glass panel she pulled the door open the anteroom of the office was full men stood jammed among the desks against the walls as she entered they took their hats off in sudden silence she saw the graying heads the muscular shoulders she saw the smiling faces of her staff at their desks and the face of eddie willers at the end of the room everybody knew that nothing had to be said eddie stood by the open door of her office the crowd parted to let her approach him he moved his hand pointing at the room then at a pile of letters and telegrams dagny every one of them he said every engineer on taggart transcontinental those who could came here some from as far as the chicago division he pointed at the mail theres the rest of them to be exact theres only three i havent heard from ones on a vacation in the north woods ones in a hospital and ones in jail for reckless drivingof his automobile she looked at the men she saw the suppressed grins on the solemn faces she inclined her head in acknowledgment she stood for a moment head bowed as if she were accepting a verdict knowing that the verdict applied to her to every man in the room and to the world beyond the walls of the building thank you she said most of the men had seen her many times looking at her as she raised her head many of them thoughtin astonishment and for the first timethat the face of their operating vicepresident was the face of a woman and that it was beautiful someone in the back of the crowd cried suddenly cheerfully to hell with jim taggart an explosion answered him the men laughed they cheered they broke into applause the response was out of all proportion to the sentence but the sentence had given them the excuse they needed they seemed to be applauding the speaker in insolent defiance of authority but everyone in the room knew who it was that they were cheering she raised her hand were too early she said laughing wait till a week from today thats when we ought to celebrate and believe me we will they drew lots for the run she picked a folded slip of paper from among a pile containing all their names the winner was not in the room but he was one of the best men on the system pat logan engineer of the taggart comet on the nebraska division wire pat and tell him hes been demoted to a freight she said to eddie she added casually as if it were a lastmoment decision but it fooled no one oh yes tell him that im going to ride with him in the cab of the engine on that run an old engineer beside her grinned and said i thought you would miss taggart rearden was in new york on the day when dagny telephoned him from her office hank im going to have a press conference tomorrow he laughed aloud no yes her voice sounded earnest but dangerously a bit too earnest the newspapers have suddenly discovered me and are asking questions im going to answer them have a good time i will are you going to be in town tomorrow id like to have you in on it okay i wouldnt want to miss it the reporters who came to the press conference in the office of the john galt line were young men who had been trained to think that their job consisted of concealing from the world the nature of its events it was their daily duty to serve as audience for some public figure who made utterances about the public good in phrases carefully chosen to convey no meaning it was their daily job to sling words together in any combination they pleased so long as the words did not fall into a sequence saying something specific they could not understand the interview now being given to them dagny taggart sat behind her desk in an office that looked like a slum basement she wore a dark blue suit with a white blouse beautifully tailored suggesting an air of formal almost military elegance she sat straight and her manner was severely dignified just a shade too dignified rearden sat in a corner of the room sprawled across a broken armchair his long legs thrown over one of its arms his body leaning against the other his manner was pleasantly informal just a bit too informal in the clear monotonous voice of a military report consulting no papers looking straight at the men dagny recited the technological facts about the john galt line giving exact figures on the nature of the rail the capacity of the bridge the method of construction the costs then in the dry tone of a banker she explained the financial prospects of the line and named the large profits she expected to make that is all she said all said one of the reporters arent you going to give us a message for the public that was my message but helli mean arent you going to defend yourself against what dont you want to tell us something to justify your line i have a man with a mouth shaped as a permanent sneer asked well what i want to know as bertram scudder stated is what protection do we have against your line being no good dont ride on it another asked arent you going to tell us your motive for building that line i have told you the profit which i expect to make oh miss taggart dont say that cried a young boy he was new he was still honest about his job and he felt that he liked dagny taggart without knowing why thats the wrong thing to say thats what theyre all saying about you are they im sure you didnt mean it the way it sounds and and im sure youll want to clarify it why yes if you wish me to the average profit of railroads has been two per cent of the capital invested an industry that does so much and keeps so little should consider itself immoral as i have explained the cost of the john galt line in relation to the traffic which it will carry makes me expect a profit of not less than fifteen per cent on our investment of course any industrial profit above four per cent is considered usury nowadays i shall nevertheless do my best to make the john galt line earn a profit of twenty per cent for me if possible that was my motive for building the line have i made myself clear now the boy was looking at her helplessly you dont mean to earn a profit for you miss taggart you mean for the small stockholders of course he prompted hopefully why no i happen to be one of the largest stockholders of taggart transcontinental so my share of the profits will be one of the largest now mr rearden is in a much more fortunate position because he has no stockholders to share withor would you rather make your own statement mr rearden yes gladly said rearden inasmuch as the formula of rearden metal is my own personal secret and in view of the fact that the metal costs much less to produce than you boys can imagine i expect to skin the public to the tune of a profit of twentyfive per cent in the next few years what do you mean skin the public mr rearden asked the boy if its true as ive read in your ads that your metal will last three times longer than any other and at half the price wouldnt the public be getting a bargain oh have you noticed that said rearden do the two of you realize youre talking for publication asked the man with the sneer but mr hopkins said dagny in polite astonishment is there any reason why we would talk to you if it werent for publication do you want us to quote all the things you said i hope i may trust you to be sure and quote them would you oblige me by taking this down verbatim she paused to see their pencils ready then dictated miss taggart saysquotei expect to make a pile of money on the john galt line i will have earned it close quote thank you so much any questions gentlemen asked rearden there were no questions now i must tell you about the opening of the john galt line said dagny the first train will depart from the station of taggart transcontinental in cheyenne wyoming at four pm on july twentysecond it will be a freight special consisting of eighty cars it will be driven by an eightthousandhorsepower fourunit diesel locomotivewhich im leasing from taggart transcontinental for the occasion it will run nonstop to wyatt junction colorado traveling at an average speed of one hundred miles per hour i beg your pardon she asked hearing the long low sound of a whistle what did you say miss taggart i said one hundred miles per hourgrades curves and all but shouldnt you cut the speed below normal rather than miss taggart dont you have any consideration whatever for public opinion but i do if it werent for public opinion an average speed of sixtyfive miles per hour would have been quite sufficient whos going to run that train i had quite a bit of trouble about that all the taggart engineers volunteered to do it so did the firemen the brakemen and the conductors we had to draw lots for every job on the trains crew the engineer will be pat logan of the taggart comet the firemanray mckim i shall ride in the cab of the engine with them not really please do attend the opening its on july twentysecond the press is most eagerly invited contrary to my usual policy i have become a publicity hound really i should like to have spotlights radio microphones and television cameras i suggest that you plant a few cameras around the bridge the collapse of the bridge would give you some interesting shots miss taggart asked rearden why didnt you mention that im going to ride in that engine too she looked at him across the room and for a moment they were alone holding each others glance yes of course mr rearden she answered she did not see him again until they looked at each other across the platform of the taggart station in cheyenne on july she did not look for anyone when she stepped out on the platform she felt as if her senses had merged so that she could not distinguish the sky the sun or the sounds of an enormous crowd but perceived only a sensation of shock and light yet he was the first person she saw and she could not tell for how long a time he was also the only one he stood by the engine of the john galt train talking to somebody outside the field of her consciousness he was dressed in gray slacks and shirt he looked like an expert mechanic but he was stared at by the faces around him because he was hank rearden of rearden steel high above him she saw the letters tt on the silver front of the engine the lines of the engine slanted back aimed at space there was distance and a crowd between them but his eyes moved to her the moment she came out they looked at each other and she knew that he felt as she did this was not to be a solemn venture upon which their future depended but simply their day of enjoyment their work was done for the moment there was no future they had earned the present only if one feels immensely important she had told him can one feel truly light whatever the trains run would mean to others for the two of them their own persons were this days sole meaning whatever it was that others sought in life their right to what they now felt was all the two of them wished to find it was as if across the platform they said it to each other then she turned away from him she noticed that she too was being stared at that there were people around her that she was laughing and answering questions she had not expected such a large crowd they filled the platform the tracks the square beyond the station they were on the roofs of the boxcars on the sidings at the windows of every house in sight something had drawn them here something in the air which at the last moment had made james taggart want to attend the opening of the john galt line she had forbidden it if you come jim she had said ill have you thrown out of your own taggart station this is one event youre not going to see then she had chosen eddie willers to represent taggart transcontinental at the opening she looked at the crowd and she felt simultaneously astonishment that they should stare at her when this event was so personally her own that no communication about it was possible and a sense of fitness that they should be here that they should want to see it because the sight of an achievement was the greatest gift a human being could offer to others she felt no anger toward anyone on earth the things she had endured had now receded into some outer fog like pain that still exists but has no power to hurt those things could not stand in the face of this moments reality the meaning of this day was as brilliantly violently clear as the splashes of sun on the silver of the engine all men had to perceive it now no one could doubt it and she had no one to hate eddie willers was watching her he stood on the platform surrounded by taggart executives division heads civic leaders and the various local officials who had been out argued bribed or threatened to obtain permits to run a train through town zones at a hundred miles an hour for once for this day and event his title of vicepresident was real to him and he carried it well but while he spoke to those around him his eyes kept following dagny through the crowd she was dressed in blue slacks and shirt she was unconscious of official duties she had left them to him the train was now her sole concern as if she were only a member of its crew she saw him she approached and she shook his hand her smile was like a summation of all the things they did not have to say well eddie youre taggart transcontinental now yes he said solemnly his voice low there were reporters asking questions and they dragged her away from him they were asking him questions too mr willers what is the policy of taggart transcontinental in regard to this line so taggart transcontinental is just a disinterested observer is it mr willers he answered as best he could he was looking at the sun on a diesel engine but what he was seeing was the sun in a clearing of the woods and a twelveyearold girl telling him that he would help her run the railroad some day he watched from a distance while the trains crew was lined up in front of the engine to face a firing squad of cameras dagny and rearden were smiling as if posing for snapshots of a summer vacation pat logan the engineer a short sinewy man with graying hair and a contemptuously inscrutable face posed in a manner of amused indifference ray mckim the fireman a husky young giant grinned with an air of embarrassment and superiority together the rest of the crew looked as if they were about to wink at the cameras a photographer said laughing cant you people look doomed please i know thats what the editor wants dagny and rearden were answering questions for the press there was no mockery in their answers now no bitterness they were enjoying it they spoke as if the questions were asked in good faith irresistibly at some point which no one noticed this became true what do you expect to happen on this run a reporter asked one of the brakemen do you think youll get there i think well get there said the brakeman and so do you brother mr logan do you have any children did you take out any extra insurance im just thinking of the bridge you know dont cross that bridge till i come to it pat logan answered contemptuously mr rearden how do you know that your rail will hold the man who taught people to make a printing press said rearden how did he know it tell me miss taggart whats going to support a seventhousandton train on a threethousandton bridge my judgment she answered the men of the press who despised their own profession did not know why they were enjoying it today one of them a young man with years of notorious success behind him and a cynical look of twice his age said suddenly i know what id like to be i wish i could be a man who covers news the hands of the clock on the station building stood at the crew started off toward the caboose at the distant end of the train the movement and noise of the crowd were subsiding without conscious intention people were beginning to stand still the dispatcher had received word from every local operator along the line of rail that wound through the mountains to the wyatt oil fields three hundred miles away he came out of the station building and looking at dagny gave the signal for clear track ahead standing by the engine dagny raised her hand repeating his gesture in sign of an order received and understood the long line of boxcars stretched off into the distance in spaced rectangular links like a spinal cord when the conductors arm swept through the air far at the end she moved her arm in answering signal rearden logan and mckim stood silently as if at attention letting her be first to get aboard as she started up the rungs on the side of the engine a reporter thought of a question he had not asked miss taggart he called after her who is john galt she turned hanging onto a metal bar with one hand suspended for an instant above the heads of the crowd we are she answered logan followed her into the cab then mckim rearden went last then the door of the engine was shut with the tight finality of sealed metal the lights hanging on a signal bridge against the sky were green there were green lights between the tracks low over the ground dropping off into the distance where the rails turned and a green light stood at the curve against leaves of a summer green that looked as if they too were lights two men held a white silk ribbon stretched across the track in front of the engine they were the superintendent of the colorado division and nealys chief engineer who had remained on the job eddie willers was to cut the ribbon they held and thus to open the new line the photographers posed him carefully scissors in hand his back to the engine he would repeat the ceremony two or three times they explained to give them a choice of shots they had a fresh bolt of ribbon ready he was about to comply then stopped no he said suddenly its not going to be a phony in a voice of quiet authority the voice of a vicepresident he ordered pointing at the cameras stand backway back take one shot when i cut it then get out of the way fast they obeyed moving hastily farther down the track there was only one minute left eddie turned his back to the cameras and stood between the rails facing the engine he held the scissors ready over the white ribbon he took his hat off and tossed it aside he was looking up at the engine a faint wind stirred his blond hair the engine was a great silver shield bearing the emblem of nat taggart eddie willers raised his hand as the hand of the station clock reached the instant of four open her up pat he called in the moment when the engine started forward he cut the white ribbon and leaped out of the way from the side track he saw the window of the cab go by and dagny waving to him in an answering salute then the engine was gone and he stood looking across at the crowded platform that kept appearing and vanishing as the freight cars clicked past him the greenblue rails ran to meet them like two jets shot out of a single point beyond the curve of the earth the crossties melted as they approached into a smooth stream rolling down under the wheels a blurred streak clung to the side of the engine low over the ground trees and telegraph poles sprang into sight abruptly and went by as if jerked back the green plains stretched past in a leisurely flow at the edge of the sky a long wave of mountains reversed the movement and seemed to follow the train she felt no wheels under the floor the motion was a smooth flight on a sustained impulse as if the engine hung above the rails riding a current she felt no speed it seemed strange that the green lights of the signals kept coming at them and past every few seconds she knew that the signal lights were spaced two miles apart the needle on the speedometer in front of pat logan stood at one hundred she sat in the firemans chair and glanced across at logan once in a while he sat slumped forward a little relaxed one hand resting lightly on the throttle as if by chance but his eyes were fixed on the track ahead he had the ease of an expert so confident that it seemed casual but it was the ease of a tremendous concentration the concentration on ones task that has the ruthlessness of an absolute ray mckim sat on a bench behind them rearden stood in the middle of the cab he stood hands in pockets feet apart braced against the motion looking ahead there was nothing he could now care to see by the side of the track he was looking at the rail ownershipshe thought glancing back at himwerent there those who knew nothing of its nature and doubted its reality no it was not made of papers seals grants and permissions there it wasin his eyes the sound filling the cab seemed part of the space they were crossing it held the low drone of the motorsthe sharper clicking of the many parts that rang in varied cries of metaland the high thin chimes of trembling glass panes things streaked pasta water tank a tree a shanty a grain silo they had a windshieldwiper motion they were rising describing a curve and dropping back the telegraph wires ran a race with the train rising and falling from pole to pole in an even rhythm like the cardiograph record of a steady heartbeat written across the sky she looked ahead at the haze that melted rail and distance a haze that could rip apart at any moment to some shape of disaster she wondered why she felt safer than she had ever felt in a car behind the engine safer here where it seemed as if should an obstacle rise her breast and the glass shield would be first to smash against it she smiled grasping the answer it was the security of being first with full sight and full knowledge of ones coursenot the blind sense of being pulled into the unknown by some unknown power ahead it was the greatest sensation of existence not to trust but to know the glass sheets of the cabs windows made the spread of the fields seem vaster the earth looked as open to movement as it was to sight yet nothing was distant and nothing was out of reach she had barely grasped the sparkle of a lake aheadand in the next instant she was beside it then past it was a strange foreshortening between sight and touch she thought between wish and fulfillment betweenthe words clicked sharply in her mind after a startled stopbetween spirit and body first the visionthen the physical shape to express it first the thoughtthen the purposeful motion down the straight line of a single track to a chosen goal could one have any meaning without the other wasnt it evil to wish without movingor to move without aim whose malevolence was it that crept through the world struggling to break the two apart and set them against each other she shook her head she did not want to think or to wonder why the world behind her was as it was she did not care she was flying away from it at the rate of a hundred miles an hour she leaned to the open window by her side and felt the wind of the speed blowing her hair off her forehead she lay back conscious of nothing but the pleasure it gave her yet her mind kept racing broken bits of thought flew past her attention like the telegraph poles by the track physical pleasureshe thought this is a train made of steel running on rails of rearden metal moved by the energy of burning oil and electric generators its a physical sensation of physical movement through space but is that the cause and the meaning of what i now feel do they call it a low animal joythis feeling that i would not care if the rail did break to bits under us nowit wontbut i wouldnt care because i have experienced this a low physical material degrading pleasure of the body she smiled her eyes closed the wind streaming through her hair she opened her eyes and saw that rearden stood looking down at her it was the same glance with which he had looked at the rail she felt her power of volition knocked out by some single dull blow that made her unable to move she held his eyes lying back in her chair the wind pressing the thin cloth of her shirt to her body he looked away and she turned again to the sight of the earth tearing open before them she did not want to think but the sound of thought went on like the drone of the motors under the sounds of the engine she looked at the cab around her the fine steel mesh of the ceiling she thought and the row of rivets in the corner holding sheets of steel sealed togetherwho made them the brute force of mens muscles who made it possible for four dials and three levers in front of pat logan to hold the incredible power of the sixteen motors behind them and deliver it to the effortless control of one mans hand these things and the capacity from which they camewas this the pursuit men regarded as evil was this what they called an ignoble concern with the physical world was this the state of being enslaved by matter was this the surrender of mans spirit to his body she shook her head as if she wished she could toss the subject out of the window and let it get shattered somewhere along the track she looked at the sun on the summer fields she did not have to think because these questions were only details of a truth she knew and had always known let them go past like the telegraph poles the thing she knew was like the wires flying above in an unbroken line the words for it and for this journey and for her feeling and for the whole of mans earth were its so simple and so right she looked out at the country she had been aware for some time of the human figures that flashed with an odd regularity at the side of the track but they went by so fast that she could not grasp their meaning until like the squares of a movie film brief flashes blended into a whole and she understood it she had had the track guarded since its completion but she had not hired the human chain she saw strung out along the rightofway a solitary figure stood at every mile post some were young schoolboys others were so old that the silhouettes of their bodies looked bent against the sky all of them were armed with anything they had found from costly rifles to ancient muskets all of them wore railroad caps they were the sons of taggart employees and old railroad men who had retired after a full lifetime of taggart service they had come unsummoned to guard this train as the engine went past him every man in his turn stood erect at attention and raised his gun in a military salute when she grasped it she burst out laughing suddenly with the abruptness of a cry she laughed shaking like a child it sounded like sobs of deliverance pat logan nodded to her with a faint smile he had noted the guard of honor long ago she leaned to the open window and her arm swept in wide curves of triumph waving to the men by the track on the crest of a distant hill she saw a crowd of people their arms swinging against the sky the gray houses of a village were scattered through a valley below as if dropped there once and forgotten the roof lines slanted sagging and the years had washed away the color of the walls perhaps generations had lived there with nothing to mark the passage of their days but the movement of the sun from east to west now these men had climbed the hill to see a silverheaded comet cut through their plains like the sound of a bugle through a long weight of silence as houses began to come more frequently closer to the track she saw people at the windows on the porches on distant roofs she saw crowds blocking the roads at grade crossings the roads went sweeping past like the spokes of a fan and she could not distinguish human figures only their arms greeting the train like branches waving in the wind of its speed they stood under the swinging red lights of warning signals under the signs saying stop look listen the station past which they flew as they went through a town at a hundred miles an hour was a swaying sculpture of people from platform to roof she caught the flicker of waving arms of hats tossed in the air of something flung against the side of the engine which was a bunch of flowers as the miles clicked past them the towns went by with the stations at which they did not stop with the crowds of people who had come only to see to cheer and to hope she saw garlands of flowers under the sooted eaves of old station buildings and bunting of redwhiteandblue on the timeeaten walls it was like the pictures she had seenand enviedin schoolbook histories of railroads from the era when people gathered to greet the first run of a train it was like the age when nat taggart moved across the country and the stops along his way were marked by men eager for the sight of achievement that age she had thought was gone generations had passed with no event to greet anywhere with nothing to see but the cracks lengthening year by year on the walls built by nat taggart yet men came again as they had come in his time drawn by the same response she glanced at rearden he stood against the wall unaware of the crowds indifferent to admiration he was watching the performance of track and train with an experts intensity of professional interest his bearing suggested that he would kick aside as irrelevant any thought such as they like it when the thought ringing in his mind was it works his tall figure in the single gray of slacks and shirt looked as if his body were stripped for action the slacks stressed the long lines of his legs the light firm posture of standing without effort or being ready to swing forward at an instants notice the short sleeves stressed the gaunt strength of his arms the open shirt bared the tight skin of his chest she turned away realizing suddenly that she had been glancing back at him too often but this day had no ties to past or futureher thoughts were cut off from implicationsshe saw no further meaning only the immediate intensity of the feeling that she was imprisoned with him sealed together in the same cube of air the closeness of his presence underscoring her awareness of this day as his rails underscored the flight of the train she turned deliberately and glanced back he was looking at her he did not turn away but held her glance coldly and with full intention she smiled defiantly not letting herself know the full meaning of her smile knowing only that it was the sharpest blow she could strike at his inflexible face she felt a sudden desire to see him trembling to tear a cry out of him she turned her head away slowly feeling a reckless amusement wondering why she found it difficult to breathe she sat leaning back in her chair looking ahead knowing that he was as aware of her as she was of him she found pleasure in the special selfconsciousness it gave her when she crossed her legs when she leaned on her arm against the window sill when she brushed her hair off her foreheadevery movement of her body was underscored by a feeling the unadmitted words for which were is he seeing it the towns had been left behind the track was rising through a country growing more grimly reluctant to permit approach the rails kept vanishing behind curves and the ridges of hills kept moving closer as if the plains were being folded into pleats the flat stone shelves of colorado were advancing to the edge of the trackand the distant reaches of the sky were shrinking into waves of bluish mountains far ahead they saw a mist of smoke over factory chimneysthen the web of a power station and the lone needle of a steel structure they were approaching denver she glanced at pat logan he was leaning forward a little farther she saw a slight tightening in the fingers of his hand and in his eyes he knew as she did the danger of crossing a city at the speed they were traveling it was a succession of minutes but it hit them as a single whole first they saw the lone shapes which were factories rolling across their windowpanesthen the shapes fused into the blur of streetsthen a delta of rails spread out before them like the mouth of a funnel sucking them into the taggart station with nothing to protect them but the small green beads of lights scattered over the groundfrom the height of the cab they saw boxcars on sidings streak past as flat ribbons of roof tops the black hole of the trainshed flew at their facesthey hurtled through an explosion of sound the beating of wheels against the glass panes of a vault and the screams of cheering from a mass that swayed like a liquid in the darkness among steel columnsthey flew toward a glowing arch and the green lights hanging in the open sky beyond the green lights that were like the doorknobs of space throwing door after door open before them then vanishing behind them went the streets clotted with traffic the open windows bulging with human figures the screaming sirens andfrom the top of a distant skyscrapera cloud of paper snowflakes shimmering on the air flung by someone who saw the passage of a silver bullet across a city stopped still to watch it then they were out again on a rocky gradeand with shocking suddenness the mountains were before them as if the city had flung them straight at a granite wall and a thin ledge had caught them in time they were clinging to the side of a vertical cliff with the earth rolling down dropping away and giant tiers of twisted boulders streaming up and shutting out the sun leaving them to speed through a bluish twilight with no sight of soil or sky the curves of rail became coiling circles among walls that advanced to grind them off their sides but the track cut through at times and the mountains parted flaring open like two wings at the tip of the railone wing green made of vertical needles with whole pines serving as the pile of a solid carpetthe other reddishbrown made of naked rock she looked down through the open window and saw the silver side of the engine hanging over empty space far below the thin thread of a stream went falling from ledge to ledge and the ferns that drooped to the water were the shimmering tops of birch trees she saw the engines tail of boxcars winding along the face of a granite dropand miles of contorted stone below she saw the coils of greenblue rail unwinding behind the train a wall of rock shot upward in their path filling the windshield darkening the cab so close that it seemed as if the remnant of time could not let them escape it but she heard the screech of wheels on curve the light came bursting backand she saw an open stretch of rail on a narrow shelf the shelf ended in space the nose of the engine was aimed straight at the sky there was nothing to stop them but two strips of greenblue metal strung in a curve along the shelf to take the pounding violence of sixteen motors she thought the thrust of seven thousand tons of steel and freight to withstand it grip it and swing it around a curve was the impossible feat performed by two strips of metal no wider than her arm what made it possible what power had given to an unseen arrangement of molecules the power on which their lives depended and the lives of all the men who waited for the eighty boxcars she saw a mans face and hands in the glow of a laboratory oven over the white liquid of a sample of metal she felt the sweep of an emotion which she could not contain as of something bursting upward she turned to the door of the motor units she threw it open to a screaming jet of sound and escaped into the pounding of the engines heart for a moment it was as if she were reduced to a single sense the sense of hearing and what remained of her hearing was only a long rising falling rising scream she stood in a swaying sealed chamber of metal looking at the giant generators she had wanted to see them because the sense of triumph within her was bound to them to her love for them to the reason of the lifework she had chosen in the abnormal clarity of a violent emotion she felt as if she were about to grasp something she had never known and had to know she laughed aloud but heard no sound of it nothing could be heard through the continuous explosion the john galt line she shouted for the amusement of feeling her voice swept away from her lips she moved slowly along the length of the motor units down a narrow passage between the engines and the wall she felt the immodesty of an intruder as if she had slipped inside a living creature under its silver skin and were watching its life beating in gray metal cylinders in twisted coils in sealed tubes in the convulsive whirl of blades in wire cages the enormous complexity of the shape above her was drained by invisible channels and the violence raging within it was led to fragile needles on glass dials to green and red beads winking on panels to tall thin cabinets stenciled high voltage why had she always felt that joyous sense of confidence when looking at machinesshe thought in these giant shapes two aspects pertaining to the inhuman were radiantly absent the causeless and the purposeless every part of the motors was an embodied answer to why and what forlike the steps of a lifecourse chosen by the sort of mind she worshipped the motors were a moral code cast in steel they are alive she thought because they are the physical shape of the action of a living powerof the mind that had been able to grasp the whole of this complexity to set its purpose to give it form for an instant it seemed to her that the motors were transparent and she was seeing the net of their nervous system it was a net of connections more intricate more crucial than all of their wires and circuits the rational connections made by that human mind which had fashioned any one part of them for the first time they are alive she thought but their soul operates them by remote control their soul is in every man who has the capacity to equal this achievement should the soul vanish from the earth the motors would stop because that is the power which keeps them goingnot the oil under the floor under her feet the oil that would then become primeval ooze againnot the steel cylinders that would become stains of rust on the walls of the caves of shivering savagesthe power of a living mind the power of thought and choice and purpose she was making her way back toward the cab feeling that she wanted to laugh to kneel or to lift her arms wishing she were able to release the thing she felt knowing that it had no form of expression she stopped she saw rearden standing by the steps of the door to the cab he was looking at her as if he knew why she had escaped and what she felt they stood still their bodies becoming a glance that met across a narrow passage the beating within her was one with the beating of the motorsand she felt as if both came from him the pounding rhythm wiped out her will they went back to the cab silently knowing that there had been a moment which was not to be mentioned between them the cliffs ahead were a bright liquid gold strips of shadow were lengthening in the valleys below the sun was descending to the peaks in the west they were going west and up toward the sun the sky had deepened to the greenishblue of the rails when they saw smokestacks in a distant valley it was one of colorados new towns the towns that had grown like a radiation from the wyatt oil fields she saw the angular lines of modern houses flat roofs great sheets of windows it was too far to distinguish people in the moment when she thought that they would not be watching the train at that distance a rocket shot out from among the buildings rose high above the town and broke as a fountain of gold stars against the darkening sky men whom she could not see were seeing the streak of the train on the side of the mountain and were sending a salute a lonely plume of fire in the dusk the symbol of celebration or of a call for help beyond the next turn in a sudden view of distance she saw two dots of electric light white and red low in the sky they were not airplanes she saw the cones of metal girders supporting themand in the moment when she knew that they were the derricks of wyatt oil she saw that the track was sweeping downward that the earth flared open as if the mountains were flung apartand at the bottom at the foot of the wyatt hill across the dark crack of a canyon she saw the bridge of rearden metal they were flying down she forgot the careful grading the great curves of the gradual descent she felt as if the train were plunging downward head first she watched the bridge growing to meet thema small square tunnel of metal lace work a few beams crisscrossed through the air greenblue and glowing struck by a long ray of sunset light from some crack in the barrier of mountains there were people by the bridge the dark splash of a crowd but they rolled off the edge of her consciousness she heard the rising accelerating sound of the wheelsand some theme of music heard to the rhythm of wheels kept tugging at her mind growing louderit burst suddenly within the cab but she knew that it was only in her mind the fifth concerto by richard halleyshe thought did he write it for this had he known a feeling such as thisthey were going faster they had left the ground she thought flung off by the mountains as by a springboard they were now sailing through spaceits not a fair test she thought were not going to touch that bridgeshe saw reardens face above her she held his eyes and her head leaned back so that her face lay still on the air under his facethey heard a ringing blast of metal they heard a drum roll under their feet the diagonals of the bridge went smearing across the windows with the sound of a metal rod being run along the pickets of a fencethen the windows were too suddenly clear the sweep of their downward plunge was carrying them up a hill the derricks of wyatt oil were reeling before thempat logan turned glancing up at rearden with the hint of a smileand rearden said thats that the sign on the edge of a roof read wyatt junction she stared feeling that there was something odd about it until she grasped what it was the sign did not move the sharpest jolt of the journey was the realization that the engine stood still she heard voices somewhere she looked down and saw that there were people on the platform then the door of the cab was flung open she knew that she had to be first to descend and she stepped to the edge for the flash of an instant she felt the slenderness of her own body the lightness of standing fullfigure in a current of open air she gripped the metal bars and started down the ladder she was halfway down when she felt the palms of a mans hands slam tight against her ribs and waistline she was torn off the steps swung through the air and deposited on the ground she could not believe that the young boy laughing in her face was ellis wyatt the tense scornful face she remembered now had the purity the eagerness the joyous benevolence of a child in the kind of world for which he had been intended she was leaning against his shoulder feeling unsteady on the motionless ground with his arm about her she was laughing she was listening to the things he said she was answering but didnt you know we would in a moment she saw the faces around them they were the bondholders of the john galt line the men who were nielsen motors hammond cars stockton foundry and all the others she shook their hands and there were no speeches she stood against ellis wyatt sagging a little brushing her hair away from her eyes leaving smudges of soot on her forehead she shook the hands of the men of the trains crew without words with the seal of the grins on their faces there were flash bulbs exploding around them and men waving to them from the riggings of the oil wells on the slopes of the mountains above her head above the heads of the crowd the letters tt on a silver shield were hit by the last ray of a sinking sun ellis wyatt had taken charge he was leading her somewhere the sweep of his arm cutting a path for them through the crowd when one of the men with the cameras broke through to her side miss taggart he called will you give us a message for the public ellis wyatt pointed at the long string of freight cars she has then she was sitting in the back seat of an open car driving up the curves of a mountain road the man beside her was rearden the driver was ellis wyatt they stopped at a house that stood on the edge of a cliff with no other habitation anywhere in sight with the whole of the oil fields spread on the slopes below why of course youre staying at my house overnight both of you said ellis wyatt as they went in where did you expect to stay she laughed i dont know i hadnt thought of it at all the nearest town is an hours drive away thats where your crew has gone your boys at the division point are giving a party in their honor so is the whole town but i told ted nielsen and the others that wed have no banquets for you and no oratory unless youd like it god no she said thanks ellis it was dark when they sat at the dinner table in a room that had large windows and a few pieces of costly furniture the dinner was served by a silent figure in a white jacket the only other inhabitant of the house an elderly indian with a stony face and a courteous manner a few points of fire were scattered through the room running over and out beyond the windows the candles on the table the lights on the derricks and the stars do you think that you have your hands full now ellis wyatt was saying just give me a year and ill give you something to keep you busy two tank trains a day dagny its going to be four or six or as many as you wish me to fill his hand swept over the lights on the mountains this its nothing compared to what ive got coming he pointed west the buena esperanza pass five miles from here everybodys wondering what im doing with it oil shale how many years ago was it that they gave up trying to get oil from shale because it was too expensive well wait till you see the process ive developed it will be the cheapest oil ever to splash in their faces and an unlimited supply of it an untapped supply that will make the biggest oil pool look like a mud puddle did i order a pipe line hank you and i will have to build pipe lines in all directions to oh i beg your pardon i dont believe i introduced myself when i spoke to you at the station i havent even told you my name rearden grinned ive guessed it by now im sorry i dont like to be careless but i was too excited what were you excited about asked dagny her eyes narrowed in mockery wyatt held her glance for a moment his answer had a tone of solemn intensity strangely conveyed by a smiling voice about the most beautiful slap in the face i ever got and deserved do you mean for our first meeting i mean for our first meeting dont you were right i was about everything but you dagny to find an exception after years of oh to hell with them do you want me to turn on the radio and hear what theyre saying about the two of you tonight no good i dont want to hear them let them swallow their own speeches theyre all climbing on the band wagon now were the band he glanced at rearden what are you smiling at ive always been curious to see what youre like ive never had a chance to be what im likeexcept tonight do you live here alone like this miles away from everything wyatt pointed at the window im a couple of steps away fromeverything what about people i have guest rooms for the kind of people who come to see me on business i want as many miles as possible between myself and all the other kinds he leaned forward to refill their wine glasses hank why dont you move to colorado to hell with new york and the eastern seaboard this is the capital of the renaissance the second renaissancenot of oil paintings and cathedralsbut of oil derricks power plants and motors made of rearden metal they had the stone age and the iron age and now theyre going to call it the rearden metal agebecause theres no limit to what your metal has made possible im going to buy a few square miles of pennsylvania said rearden the ones around my mills it would have been cheaper to build a branch here as i wanted but you know why i cant and to hell with them ill beat them anyway im going to expand the millsand if she can give me threeday freight service to colorado ill give you a race for whos going to be the capital of the renaissance give me a year said dagny of running trains on the john galt line give me time to pull the taggart system togetherand ill give you threeday freight service across the continent on a rearden metal track from ocean to ocean who was it that said he needed a fulcrum said ellis wyatt give me an unobstructed rightofway and ill show them how to move the earth she wondered what it was that she liked about the sound of wyatts laughter their voices even her own had a tone she had never heard before when they rose from the table she was astonished to notice that the candles were the only illumination of the room she had felt as if she were sitting in a violent light ellis wyatt picked up his glass looked at their faces and said to the world as it seems to be right now he emptied the glass with a single movement she heard the crash of the glass against the wall in the same instant that she saw a circling currentfrom the curve of his body to the sweep of his arm to the terrible violence of his hand that flung the glass across the room it was not the conventional gesture meant as celebration it was the gesture of a rebellious anger the vicious gesture which is movement substituted for a scream of pain ellis she whispered whats the matter he turned to look at her with the same violent suddenness his eyes were clear his face was calm what frightened her was seeing him smile gently im sorry he said never mind well try to think that it will last the earth below was streaked with moonlight when wyatt led them up an outside stairway to the second floor of the house to the open gallery at the doors of the guest rooms he wished them good night and they heard his steps descending the stairs the moonlight seemed to drain sound as it drained color the steps rolled into a distant past and when they died the silence had the quality of a solitude that had lasted for a long time as if no person were left anywhere in reach she did not turn to the door of her room he did not move at the level of their feet there was nothing but a thin railing and a spread of space angular tiers descended below with shadows repeating the steel tracery of derricks crisscrossing sharp black lines on patches of glowing rock a few lights white and red trembled in the clear air like drops of rain caught on the edges of steel girders far in the distance three small drops were green strung in a line along the taggart track beyond them at the end of space at the foot of a white curve hung a webbed rectangle which was the bridge she felt a rhythm without sound or movement a sense of beating tension as if the wheels of the john galt line were still speeding on slowly in answer and in resistance to an unspoken summons she turned and looked at him the look she saw on his face made her know for the first time that she had known this would be the end of the journey that look was not as men are taught to represent it it was not a matter of loose muscles hanging lips and mindless hunger the lines of his face were pulled tight giving it a peculiar purity a sharp precision of form making it clean and young his mouth was taut the lips faintly drawn inward stressing the outline of its shape only his eyes were blurred their lower lids swollen and raised their glance intent with that which resembled hatred and pain the shock became numbness spreading through her bodyshe felt a tight pressure in her throat and her stomachshe was conscious of nothing but a silent convulsion that made her unable to breathe but what she felt without words for it was yes hank yesnowbecause it is part of the same battle in some way that i cant name because it is our being against theirs our great capacity for which they torture us the capacity of happiness now like this without words or questions because we want it it was like an act of hatred like the cutting blow of a lash encircling her body she felt his arms around her she felt her legs pulled forward against him and her chest bent back under the pressure of his his mouth on hers her hand moved from his shoulders to his waist to his legs releasing the unconfessed desire of her every meeting with him when she tore her mouth away from him she was laughing soundlessly in triumph as if saying hank reardenthe austere unapproachable hank rearden of the monk like office the business conferences the harsh bargainsdo you remember them nowim thinking of it for the pleasure of knowing that ive brought you to this he was not smiling his face was tight it was the face of an enemy he jerked her head and caught her mouth again as if he were inflicting a wound she felt him trembling and she thought that this was the kind of cry she had wanted to tear from himthis surrender through the shreds of his tortured resistance yet she knew at the same time that the triumph was his that her laughter was her tribute to him that her defiance was submission that the purpose of all of her violent strength was only to make his victory the greaterhe was holding her body against his as if stressing his wish to let her know that she was now only a tool for the satisfaction of his desireand his victory she knew was her wish to let him reduce her to that whatever i am she thought whatever pride of person i may hold the pride of my courage of my work of my mind and my freedomthat is what i offer you for the pleasure of your body that is what i want you to use in your serviceand that you want it to serve you is the greatest reward i can have there were lights burning in the two rooms behind them he took her wrist and threw her inside his room making the gesture tell her that he needed no sign of consent or resistance he locked the door watching her face standing straight holding his glance she extended her arm to the lamp on the table and turned out the light he approached he turned the light on again with a single contemptuous jerk of his wrist she saw him smile for the first time a slow mocking sensual smile that stressed the purpose of his action he was holding her halfstretched across the bed he was tearing her clothes off while her face was pressed against him her mouth moving down the line of his neck down his shoulder she knew that every gesture of her desire for him struck him like a blow that there was some shudder of incredulous anger within himyet that no gesture would satisfy his greed for every evidence of her desire he stood looking down at her naked body he leaned over she heard his voiceit was more a statement of contemptuous triumph than a question you want it her answer was more a gasp than a word her eyes closed her mouth open yes she knew that what she felt with the skin of her arms was the cloth of his shirt she knew that the lips she felt on her mouth were his but in the rest of her there was no distinction between his being and her own as there was no division between body and spirit through all the steps of the years behind them the steps down a course chosen in the courage of a single loyalty their love of existencechosen in the knowledge that nothing will be given that one must make ones own desire and every shape of its fulfillmentthrough the steps of shaping metal rails and motorsthey had moved by the power of the thought that one remakes the earth for ones enjoyment that mans spirit gives meaning to insentient matter by molding it to serve ones chosen goal the course led them to the moment when in answer to the highest of ones values in an admiration not to be expressed by any other form of tribute ones spirit makes ones body become the tribute recasting itas proof as sanction as rewardinto a single sensation of such intensity of joy that no other sanction of ones existence is necessary he heard the moan of her breath she felt the shudder of his body in the same instant chapter ix the sacred and the profane she looked at the glowing bands on the skin of her arm spaced like bracelets from her wrist to her shoulder they were strips of sunlight from the venetian blinds on the window of an unfamiliar room she saw a bruise above her elbow with dark beads that had been blood her arm lay on the blanket that covered her body she was aware of her legs and hips but the rest of her body was only a sense of lightness as if it were stretched restfully across the air in a place that looked like a cage made of sunrays turning to look at him she thought from his aloofness from his manner of glassenclosed formality from his pride in never being made to feel anythingto this to hank rearden in bed beside her after hours of a violence which they could not name now not in words or in daylightbut which was in their eyes as they looked at each other which they wanted to name to stress to throw at each others face he saw the face of a young girl her lips suggesting a smile as if her natural state of relaxation were a state of radiance a lock of hair falling across her cheek to the curve of a naked shoulder her eyes looking at him as if she were ready to accept anything he might wish to say as she had been ready to accept anything he had wished to do he reached over and moved the lock of hair from her cheek cautiously as if it were fragile he held it back with his fingertips and looked at her face then his fingers closed suddenly in her hair and he raised the lock to his lips the way he pressed his mouth to it was tenderness but the way his fingers held it was despair he dropped back on the pillow and lay still his eyes closed his face seemed young at peace seeing it for a moment without the reins of tension she realized suddenly the extent of the unhappiness he had borne but its past now she thought its over he got up not looking at her his face was blank and closed again he picked up his clothes from the floor and proceeded to dress standing in the middle of the room halfturned away from her he acted not as if she wasnt present but as if it did not matter that she was his movements as he buttoned his shirt as he buckled the belt of his slacks had the rapid precision of performing a duty she lay back on the pillow watching him enjoying the sight of his figure in motion she liked the gray slacks and shirtthe expert mechanic of the john galt line she thought in the stripes of sunlight and shadow like a convict behind bars but they were not bars any longer they were the cracks of a wall which the john galt line had broken the advance notice of what awaited them outside beyond the venetian blindsshe thought of the trip back on the new rail with the first train from wyatt junctionthe trip back to her office in the taggart building and to all the things now open for her to winbut she was free to let it wait she did not want to think of it she was thinking of the first touch of his mouth on hersshe was free to feel it to hold a moment when nothing else was of any concernshe smiled defiantly at the strips of sky beyond the blinds i want you to know this he stood by the bed dressed looking down at her his voice had pronounced it evenly with great clarity and no inflection she looked up at him obediently he said what i feel for you is contempt but its nothing compared to the contempt i feel for myself i dont love you ive never loved anyone i wanted you from the first moment i saw you i wanted you as one wants a whorefor the same reason and purpose i spent two years damning myself because i thought you were above a desire of this kind youre not youre as vile an animal as i am i should loathe my discovering it i dont yesterday i would have killed anyone whod tell me that you were capable of doing what ive had you do today i would give my life not to let it be otherwise not to have you be anything but the bitch you are all the greatness that i saw in youi would not take it in exchange for the obscenity of your talent at an animals sensation of pleasure we were two great beings you and i proud of our strength werent we well this is all thats left of usand i want no selfdeception about it he spoke slowly as if lashing himself with his words there was no sound of emotion in his voice only the lifeless pull of effort it was not the tone of a mans willingness to speak but the ugly tortured sound of duty i held it as my honor that i would never need anyone i need you it had been my pride that i had always acted on my convictions ive given in to a desire which i despise it is a desire that has reduced my mind my will my being my power to exist into an abject dependence upon younot even upon the dagny taggart whom i admiredbut upon your body your hands your mouth and the few seconds of a convulsion of your muscles i had never broken my word now ive broken an oath i gave for life i had never committed an act that had to be hidden now i am to lie to sneak to hide whatever i wanted i was free to proclaim it aloud and achieve it in the sight of the whole world now my only desire is one i loathe to name even to myself but it is my only desire im going to have youid give up everything i own for it the mills the metal the achievement of my whole life im going to have you at the price of more than myself at the price of my self esteemand i want you to know it i want no pretense no evasion no silent indulgence with the nature of our actions left unnamed i want no pretense about love value loyalty or respect i want no shred of honor left to us to hide behind ive never begged for mercy ive chosen to do thisand ill take all the consequences including the full recognition of my choice its depravityand i accept it as suchand there is no height of virtue that i wouldnt give up for it now if you wish to slap my face go ahead i wish you would she had listened sitting up straight holding the blanket clutched at her throat to cover her body at first he had seen her eyes growing dark with incredulous shock then it seemed to him that she was listening with greater attentiveness but seeing more than his face even though her eyes were fixed on his she looked as if she were studying intently some revelation that had never confronted her before he felt as if some ray of light were growing stronger on his face because he saw its reflection on hers as she watched himhe saw the shock vanishing then the wonderhe saw her face being smoothed into a strange serenity that seemed quiet and glittering at once when he stopped she burst out laughing the shock to him was that he heard no anger in her laughter she laughed simply easily in joyous amusement in release not as one laughs at the solution of a problem but at the discovery that no problem had ever existed she threw the blanket off with a stressed deliberate sweep of her arm she stood up she saw her clothes on the floor and kicked them aside she stood facing him naked she said i want you hank im much more of an animal than you think i wanted you from the first moment i saw youand the only thing im ashamed of is that i did not know it i did not know why for two years the brightest moments i found were the ones in your office where i could lift my head to look up at you i did not know the nature of what i felt in your presence nor the reason i know it now that is all i want hank i want you in my bedand you are free of me for all the rest of your time theres nothing youll have to pretenddont think of me dont feel dont carei do not want your mind your will your being or your soul so long as its to me that you will come for that lowest one of your desires i am an animal who wants nothing but that sensation of pleasure which you despisebut i want it from you youd give up any height of virtue for it while ii havent any to give up theres none i seek or wish to reach i am so low that i would exchange the greatest sight of beauty in the world for the sight of your figure in the cab of a railroad engine and seeing it i would not be able to see it indifferently you dont have to fear that youre now dependent upon me its i who will depend on any whim of yours youll have me any time you wish anywhere on any terms did you call it the obscenity of my talent its such that it gives you a safer hold on me than on any other property you own you may dispose of me as you pleaseim not afraid to admit itl have nothing to protect from you and nothing to reserve you think that this is a threat to your achievement but it is not to mine i will sit at my desk and work and when the things around me get hard to bear i will think that for my reward i will be in your bed that night did you call it depravity i am much more depraved than you are you hold it as your guilt and ias my pride im more proud of it than of anything ive done more proud than of building the line if im asked to name my proudest attainment i will say i have slept with hank rearden i had earned it when he threw her down on the bed their bodies met like the two sounds that broke against each other in the air of the room the sound of his tortured moan and of her laughter the rain was invisible in the darkness of the streets but it hung like the sparkling fringe of a lampshade under the corner light fumbling in his pockets james taggart discovered that he had lost his handkerchief he swore halfaloud with resentful malice as if the loss the rain and his head cold were someones personal conspiracy against him there was a thin gruel of mud on the pavements he felt a gluey suction under his shoe soles and a chill slipping down past his collar he did not want to walk or to stop he had no place to go leaving his office after the meeting of the board of directors he had realized suddenly that there were no other appointments that he had a long evening ahead and no one to help him kill it the front pages of the newspapers were screaming of the triumph of the john galt line as the radios had screamed it yesterday and all through the night the name of taggart transcontinental was stretched in headlines across the continent like its track and he had smiled in answer to the congratulations he had smiled seated at the bead of the long table at the board meeting while the directors spoke about the soaring rise of the taggart stock on the exchange while they cautiously asked to see his written agreement with his sisterjust in case they saidand commented that it was fine it was hole proof there was no doubt but that she would have to turn the line over to taggart transcontinental at once they spoke about their brilliant future and the debt of gratitude which the company owed to james taggart he had sat through the meeting wishing it were over with so that he could go home then he had stepped out into the street and realized that home was the one place where he dared not go tonight he could not be alone not in the next few hours yet there was nobody to call he did not want to see people he kept seeing the eyes of the men of the board when they spoke about his greatness a sly filmy look that held contempt for him and more terrifyingly for themselves he walked head down a needle of rain pricking the skin of his neck once in a while he looked away whenever he passed a newsstand the papers seemed to shriek at him the name of the john galt line and another name which he did not want to hear ragnar danneskjold a ship bound for the peoples state of norway with an emergency gift cargo of machine tools had been seized by ragnar danneskjold last night that story disturbed him in some personal manner which he could not explain the feeling seemed to have some quality in common with the things he felt about the john galt line its because he had a cold he thought he wouldnt feel this way if he didnt have a cold a man couldnt be expected to be in top form when he had a coldhe couldnt help itwhat did they expect him to do tonight sing and dancehe snapped the question angrily at the unknown judges of his unwitnessed mood he fumbled for his handkerchief again cursed and decided that hed better stop somewhere to buy some paper tissues across the square of what had once been a busy neighborhood he saw the lighted windows of a dime store still open hopefully at this late hour theres another one that will go out of business pretty soon he thought as he crossed the square the thought gave him pleasure there were glaring lights inside a few tired salesgirls among a spread of deserted counters and the screaming of a phonograph record being played for a lone listless customer in a corner the music swallowed the sharp edges of taggarts voice he asked for paper tissues in a tone which implied that the salesgirl was responsible for his cold the girl turned to the counter behind her but turned back once to glance swiftly at his face she took a packet but stopped hesitating studying him with peculiar curiosity are you james taggart she asked yes he snapped why oh she gasped like a child at a burst of firecrackers she was looking at him with a glance which he had thought to be reserved only for movie stars i saw your picture in the paper this morning mr taggart she said very rapidly a faint flush appearing on her face and vanishing it said what a great achievement it was and how it was really you who had done it all only you didnt want it to be known oh said taggart he was smiling you look just like your picture she said in immense astonishment and added imagine you walking in here like this in person shouldnt i his tone was amused i mean everybodys talking about it the whole country and youre the man who did itand here you are ive never seen an important person before ive never been so close to anything important i mean to any newspaper news he had never had the experience of seeing his presence give color to a place he entered the girl looked as if she was not tired any longer as if the dime store had become a scene of drama and wonder mr taggart is it true what they said about you in the paper what did they say about your secret what secret well they said that when everybody was fighting about your bridge whether it would stand or not you didnt argue with them you just went ahead because you knew it would stand when nobody else was sure of itso the line was a taggart project and you were the guiding spirit behind the scenes but you kept it secret because you didnt care whether you got credit for it or not he had seen the mimeographed release of his public relations department yes he said its true the way she looked at him made him feel as if it were it was wonderful of you mr taggart do you always remember what you read in the newspapers so well in such detail why yes i guess soall the interesting things the big things i like to read about them nothing big ever happens to me she said it gaily without selfpity there was a young determined brusqueness in her voice and movements she had a head of reddish brown curls wideset eyes a few freckles on the bridge of an upturned nose he thought that one would call her face attractive if one ever noticed it but there was no particular reason to notice it it was a common little face except for a look of alertness of eager interest a look that expected the world to contain an exciting secret behind every corner mr taggart how does it feel to be a great man how does it feel to be a little girl she laughed why wonderful then youre better off than i am oh how can you say such a maybe youre lucky if you dont have anything to do with the big events in the newspapers big what do you call big anyway why important whats important youre the one who ought to tell me that mr taggart nothings important she looked at him incredulously you of all people saying that tonight of all nights dont feel wonderful at all if thats what you want to know ive never felt less wonderful in my life he was astonished to see her studying his face with a look of concern such as no one had ever granted him youre worn out mr taggart she said earnestly tell them to go to hell whom whoevers getting you down it isnt right what isnt that you should feel this way youve had a tough time but youve licked them all so you ought to enjoy yourself now youve earned it and how do you propose that i enjoy myself oh i dont know but i thought youd be having a celebration tonight a party with all the big shots and champagne and things given to you like keys to cities a real swank party like thatinstead of walking around all by yourself shopping for paper handkerchiefs of all fool things you give me those handkerchiefs before you forget them altogether he said handing her a dime and as to the swank party did it occur to you that i might not want to see anybody tonight she considered it earnestly no she said i hadnt thought of it but i can see why you wouldnt why it was a question to which he bad no answer nobodys really good enough for you mr taggart she answered very simply not as flattery but as a matter of fact is that what you think i dont think i like people very much mr taggart not most of them i dont either not any of them i thought a man like youyou wouldnt know how mean they can be and how they try to step on you and ride on your back if you let them i thought the big men in the world could get away from them and not have to be fleabait all of the time but maybe i was wrong what do you mean fleabait oh its just something i tell myself when things get toughthat ive got to beat my way out to where i wont feel like im fleabitten all the time by all kinds of lousinessbut maybe its the same anywhere only the fleas get bigger much bigger she remained silent as if considering something its funny she said sadly to some thought of her own whats funny i read a book once where it said that great men are always unhappy and the greaterthe unhappier it didnt make sense to me but maybe its true its much truer than you think she looked away her face disturbed why do you worry so much about the great men he asked what are you a hero worshipper of some kind she turned to look at him and he saw the light of an inner smile while her face remained solemnly grave it was the most eloquently personal glance he had ever seen directed at himself while she answered in a quiet impersonal voice mr taggart what else is there to look up to a screeching sound neither quite bell nor buzzer rang out suddenly and went on ringing with nervegrating insistence she jerked her head as if awakening at the scream of an alarm clock then sighed thats closing time mr taggart she said regretfully go get your hatill wait for you outside he said she stared at him as if among all of lifes possibilities this was one she had never held as conceivable no kidding she whispered no kidding she whirled around and ran like a streak to the door of the employees quarters forgetting her counter her duties and all feminine concern about never showing eagerness in accepting a mans invitation he stood looking after her for a moment his eyes narrowed he did not name to himself the nature of his own feelingnever to identify his emotions was the only steadfast rule of his life he merely felt itand this particular feeling was pleasurable which was the only identification he cared to know but the feeling was the product of a thought he would not utter he had often met girls of the lower classes who had put on a brash little act pretending to look up to him spilling crude flattery for an obvious purpose he had neither liked nor resented them he had found a bored amusement in their company and he had granted them the status of his equals in a game he considered natural to both players involved this girl was different the unuttered words in his mind were the damn little fool means it that he waited for her impatiently when he stood in the rain on the sidewalk that she was the one person he needed tonight did not disturb him or strike him as a contradiction he did not name the nature of his need the unnamed and the unuttered could not clash into a contradiction when she came out he noted the peculiar combination of her shyness and of her head held high she wore an ugly raincoat made worse by a gob of cheap jewelry on the lapel and a small hat of plush flowers planted defiantly among her curls strangely the lift of her head made the apparel seem attractive it stressed how well she wore even the things she wore want to come to my place and have a drink with me he asked she nodded silently solemnly as if not trusting herself to find the right words of acceptance then she said not looking at him as if stating it to herself you didnt want to see anybody tonight but you want o see me he had never heard so solemn a tone of pride in anyones voice she was silent when she sat beside him in the taxicab she looked up at the skyscrapers they passed after a while she said i heard that things like this happened in new york but i never thought theyd happen to me where do you come from buffalo got any family she hesitated i guess so in buffalo what do you mean you guess so i walked out on them why i thought that if i ever was to amount to anything i had to get away from them clean away why what happened nothing happened and nothing was ever going to happen thats what i couldnt stand what do you mean well they well i guess i ought to tell you the truth mr taggart my old mans never been any good and ma didnt care whether he was or not and i got sick of it always turning out that i was the only one of the seven of us that kept a job and the rest of them always being out of luck one way or another i thought if i didnt get out it would get meid rot all the way through like the rest of them so i bought a railroad ticket one day and left didnt say goodbye they didnt even know i was going she gave a soft startled little laugh at a sudden thought mr taggart she said it was a taggart train when did you come here six months ago and youre all alone yes she said happily what was it you wanted to do well you knowmake something of myself get somewhere where oh i dont know but but people do things in the world saw pictures of new york and i thoughtshe pointed at the giant buildings beyond the streaks of rain on the cab windowi thought somebody built those buildingshe didnt just sit and whine that the kitchen was filthy and the roof leaking and the plumbing clogged and its a goddamn world and mr taggartshe jerked her head in a shudder and looked straight at himwe were stinking poor and not giving a damn about it thats what i couldnt takethat they didnt really give a damn not enough to lift a finger not enough to empty the garbage pail and the woman next door saying it was my duty to help them saying it made no difference what became of me or of her or of any of us because what could anybody do anyway beyond the bright look of her eyes he saw something within her that was hurt and hard i dont want to talk about them she said not with you thismy meeting you i meanthats what they couldnt have thats what im not going to share with them its mine not theirs how old are you he asked nineteen when he looked at her in the lights of his living room he thought that shed have a good figure if shed eat a few meals she seemed too thin for the height and structure of her bones she wore a tight shabby little black dress which she had tried to camouflage by the gaudy plastic bracelets tinkling on her wrist she stood looking at his room as if it were a museum where she must touch nothing and reverently memorize everything whats your name he asked cherryl brooks well sit down he mixed the drinks in silence while she waited obediently sitting on the edge of an armchair when he handed her a glass she swallowed dutifully a few times then held the glass clutched in her hand he knew that she did not taste what she was drinking did not notice it had no time to care he took a gulp of his drink and put the glass down with irritation he did not feel like drinking either he paced the room sullenly knowing that her eyes followed him enjoying the knowledge enjoying the sense of tremendous significance which his movements his cuff links his shoelaces his lampshades and ashtrays acquired in that gentle unquestioning glance mr taggart what is it that makes you so unhappy why should you care whether i am or not because well if you havent the right to be happy and proud who has thats what i want to knowwho has he turned to her abruptly the words exploding as if a safety fuse had blown he didnt invent iron ore and blast furnaces did he who rearden he didnt invent smelting and chemistry and air compression he couldnt have invented his metal but for thousands and thousands of other people his metal why does he think its his why does he think its his invention everybody uses the work of everybody else nobody ever invents anything she said puzzled but the iron ore and all those other things were there all the time why didnt anybody else make that metal but mr rearden did he didnt do it for any noble purpose he did it just for his own profit hes never done anything for any other reason whats wrong with that mr taggart then she laughed softly as if at the sudden solution of a riddle thats nonsense mr taggart you dont mean it you know that mr rearden has earned all his profits and so have you youre saying those things just to be modest when everybody knows what a great job you people have doneyou and mr rearden and your sister who must be such a wonderful person yeah thats what you think shes a hard insensitive woman who spends her life building tracks and bridges not for any great ideal but only because thats what she enjoys doing if she enjoys it what is there to admire about her doing it im not so sure it was greatbuilding that line for all those prosperous industrialists in colorado when there are so many poor people in blighted areas who need transportation but mr taggart it was you who fought to build that line yes because it was my dutyto the company and the stockholders and our employees but dont expect me to enjoy it im not so sure it was greatinventing this complex new metal when so many nations are in need of plain ironwhy do you know that the peoples state of china hasnt even got enough nails to put wooden roofs over peoples heads but but i dont see that thats your fault somebody should attend to it somebody with the vision to see beyond his own pocketbook no sensitive person these dayswhen theres so much suffering around uswould devote ten years of his life to splashing about with a lot of trick metals you think its great well its not any kind of superior ability but just a hide that you couldnt pierce if you poured a ton of his own steel over his head there are many people of much greater ability in the world but you dont read about them in the headlines and you dont run to gape at them at grade crossingsbecause they cant invent noncollapsible bridges at a time when the suffering of mankind weighs on their spirit she was looking at him silently respectfully her joyous eagerness toned down her eyes subdued he felt better he picked up his drink took a gulp and chuckled abruptly at a sudden recollection it was funny though he said his tone easier livelier the tone of a confidence to a pal you should have seen orren boyle yesterday when the first flash came through on the radio from wyatt junction he turned greenbut i mean green the color of a fish thats been lying around too long do you know what he did last night by way of taking the bad news hired himself a suite at the valhalla hoteland you know what that isand the last i heard he was still there today drinking himself under the table and the beds with a few choice friends of his and half the female population of upper amsterdam avenue who is mr boyle she asked stupefied oh a fat slob thats inclined to overreach himself a smart guy who gets too smart at times you should have seen his face yesterday i got a kick out of that thatand dr floyd ferris that smoothy didnt like it a bit oh not a bitthe elegant dr ferris of the state science institute the servant of the people with the patentleather vocabularybut he carried it off pretty well i must say only you could see him squirming in every paragraphi mean that interview he gave out this morning where he said the country gave rearden that metal now we expect him to give the country something in return that was pretty nifty considering whos been riding on the gravy train and well considering that was better than bertram scuddermr scudder couldnt think of anything but no comment when his fellow gentlemen of the press asked him to voice his sentiments no commentfrom bertram scudder whos never been known to shut his trap from the day he was born about anything you ask him or dont ask abyssinian poetry or the state of the ladies rest rooms in the textile industry and dr pritchett the old fool is going around saying that he knows for certain that rearden didnt invent that metalbecause he was told by an unnamed reliable source that rearden stole the formula from a penniless inventor whom he murdered he was chuckling happily she was listening as to a lecture on higher mathematics grasping nothing not even the style of the language a style which made the mystery greater because she was certain that it did not meancoming from himwhat it would have meant anywhere else he refilled his glass and drained it but his gaiety vanished abruptly he slumped into an armchair facing her looking up at her from under his bald forehead his eyes blurred shes coming back tomorrow he said with a sound like a chuckle devoid of amusement who my sister my dear sister oh shell think shes great wont she you dislike your sister mr taggart he made the same sound its meaning was so eloquent that she needed no other answer why she asked because she thinks shes so good what right has she to think it what right has anybody to think hes good nobodys any good you dont mean it mr taggart i mean were only human beingsand whats a human being a weak ugly sinful creature born that way rotten in his bonesso humility is the one virtue he ought to practice he ought to spend his life on his knees begging to be forgiven for his dirty existence when a man thinks hes goodthats when hes rotten pride is the worst of all sins no matter what hes done but if a man knows that what hes done is good then he ought to apologize for it to whom to those who havent done it i i dont understand of course you dont it takes years and years of study in the higher reaches of the intellect have you ever heard of the metaphysical contradictions of the universe by dr simon pritchett she shook her head frightened how do you know whats good anyway who knows whats good who can ever know there are no absolutesas dr pritchett has proved irrefutably nothing is absolute everything is a matter of opinion how do you know that that bridge hasnt collapsed you only think it hasnt how do you know that theres any bridge at all you think that a system of philosophysuch as dr pritchettsis just something academic remote impractical but it isnt oh boy how it isnt but mr taggart the line you built oh whats that line anyway its only a material achievement is that of any importance is there any greatness in anything material only a low animal can gape at that bridgewhen there are so many higher things in life but do the higher things ever get recognition oh no look at people all that hue and cry and front pages about some trick arrangement of some scraps of matter do they care about any nobler issue do they ever give front pages to a phenomenon of the spirit do they notice or appreciate a person of finer sensibility and you wonder whether its true that a great man is doomed to unhappiness in this depraved world he leaned forward staring at her intently ill tell you ill tell you something unhappiness is the hallmark of virtue if a man is unhappy really truly unhappy it means that he is a superior sort of person he saw the puzzled anxious look of her face but mr taggart you got everything you wanted now you have the best railroad in the country the newspapers call you the greatest business executive of the age they say the stock of your company made a fortune for you overnight you got everything you could ask forarent you glad of it in the brief space of his answer she felt frightened sensing a sudden fear within him he answered no she didnt know why her voice dropped to a whisper youd rather the bridge had collapsed i havent said that he snapped sharply then he shrugged and waved his hand in a gesture of contempt you dont understand im sorry oh i know that i have such an awful lot to learn i am talking about a hunger for something much beyond that bridge a hunger that nothing material will ever satisfy what mr taggart what is it you want oh there you go the moment you ask what is it youre back in the crude material world where everythings got to be tagged and measured im speaking of things that cant be named in materialistic words the higher realms of the spirit which man can never reach whats any human achievement anyway the earth is only an atom whirling in the universeof what importance is that bridge to the solar system a sudden happy look of understanding cleared her eyes its great of you mr taggart to think that your own achievement isnt good enough for you i guess no matter how far youve gone you want to go still farther youre ambitious thats what i admire most ambition i mean doing things not stopping and giving up but doing i understand mr taggart even if i dont understand all the big thoughts youll learn oh ill work very hard to learn her glance of admiration had not changed he walked across the room moving in that glance as in a gentle spotlight he went to refill his glass a mirror hung in the niche behind the portable bar he caught a glimpse of his own figure the tall body distorted by a sloppy sagging posture as if in deliberate negation of human grace the thinning hair the soft sullen mouth it struck him suddenly that she did not see him at all what she saw was the heroic figure of a builder with proudly straight shoulders and windblown hair he chuckled aloud feeling that this was a good joke on her feeling dimly a satisfaction that resembled a sense of victory the superiority of having put something over on her sipping his drink he glanced at the door of his bedroom and thought of the usual ending for an adventure of this kind he thought that it would be easy the girl was too awed to resist he saw the reddishbronze sparkle of her hairas she sat head bent under a lightand a wedge of smooth glowing skin on her shoulder he looked away why bother he thought the hint of desire that he felt was no more than a sense of physical discomfort the sharpest impulse in his mind nagging him to action was not the thought of the girl but of all the men who would not pass up an opportunity of this kind he admitted to himself that she was a much better person than betty pope perhaps the best person ever offered to him the admission left him indifferent he felt no more than he had felt for betty pope he felt nothing the prospect of experiencing pleasure was not worth the effort he had no desire to experience pleasure its getting late he said where do you live let me give you another drink and then ill take you home when he said goodbye to her at the door of a miserable rooming house in a slum neighborhood she hesitated fighting not to ask a question which she desperately wished to ask him will i she began and stopped what no nothing nothing he knew that the question was will i see you again it gave him pleasure not to answer even though he knew that she would she glanced up at him once more as if it were perhaps for the last time then said earnestly her voice low mr taggart im very grateful to you because you i mean any other man would have tried to i mean thats all hed want but youre so much better than that oh so much better he leaned closer to her with a faint interested smile would you have he asked she drew back from him in sudden terror at her own words oh i didnt mean it that way she gasped oh god i wasnt hinting or or she blushed furiously whirled around and ran vanishing up the long steep stairs of the rooming house he stood on the sidewalk feeling an odd heavy foggy sense of satisfaction feeling as if he had committed an act of virtueand as if he had taken his revenge upon every person who had stood cheering along the threehundredmile track of the john galt line when their train reached philadelphia rearden left her without a word as if the nights of their return journey deserved no acknowledgment in the daylight reality of crowded station platforms and moving engines the reality he respected she went on to new york alone but late that evening the doorbell of her apartment rang and dagny knew that she had expected it he said nothing when he entered he looked at her making his silent presence more intimate a greeting than words there was the faint suggestion of a contemptuous smile in his face at once admitting and mocking his knowledge of her hours of impatience and his own he stood in the middle of her living room looking slowly around him this was her apartment the one place in the city that had been the focus of two years of his torment as the place he could not think about and did the place he could not enterand was now entering with the casual unannounced right of an owner he sat down in an armchair stretching his legs forwardand she stood before him almost as if she needed his permission to sit down and it gave her pleasure to wait shall i tell you that you did a magnificent job building that line he asked she glanced at him in astonishment he had never paid her open compliments of that kind the admiration in his voice was genuine but the hint of mockery remained in his face and she felt as if he were speaking to some purpose which she could not guess ive spent all day answering questions about youand about the line the metal and the future that and counting the orders for the metal theyre coming in at the rate of thousands of tons an hour when was it nine months agoi couldnt get a single answer anywhere today i had to cut off my phone not to listen to all the people who wanted to speak to me personally about their urgent need of rearden metal what did you do today i dont know tried to listen to eddies reportstried to get away from peopletried to find the rolling stock to put more trains on the john galt line because the schedule id planned wont be enough for the business thats piled up in just three days a great many people wanted to see you today didnt they why yes theyd have given anything just for a word with you wouldnt they i i suppose so the reporters kept asking me what you were like a young boy from a local sheet kept saying that you were a great woman he said hed be afraid to speak to you if he ever had the chance hes right that future that theyre all talking and trembling aboutit will be as you made it because you had the courage none of them could conceive of all the roads to wealth that theyre scrambling for now its your strength that broke them open the strength to stand against everyone the strength to recognize no will but your own she caught the sinking gasp of her breath she knew his purpose she stood straight her arms at her sides her face austere as if in unflinching endurance she stood under the praise as under a lashing of insults they kept asking you questions too didnt they he spoke intently leaning forward and they looked at you with admiration they looked as if you stood on a mountain peak and they could only take their hats off to you across the great distance didnt they yes she whispered they looked as if they knew that one may not approach you or speak in your presence or touch a fold of your dress they knew it and its true they looked at you with respect didnt they they looked up to you he seized her arm threw her down on her knees twisting her body against his legs and bent down to kiss her mouth she laughed soundlessly her laughter mocking but her eyes halfclosed veiled with pleasure hours later when they lay in bed together his hand moving over her body he asked suddenly throwing her back against the curve of his arm bending over herand she knew by the intensity of his face by the sound of a gasp somewhere in the quality of his voice even though his voice was low and steady that the question broke out of him as if it were worn by the hours of torture he had spent with it who were the other men that had you he looked at her as if the question were a sight visualized in every detail a sight he loathed but would not abandon she heard the contempt in his voice the hatred the sufferingand an odd eagerness that did not pertain to torture he had asked the question holding her body tight against him she answered evenly but he saw a dangerous flicker in her eyes as of a warning that she understood him too well there was only one other hank when when i was seventeen did it last for some years who was he she drew back lying against his arm he leaned closer his face taut she held his eyes i wont answer you did you love him i wont answer did you like sleeping with him yes the laughter in her eyes made it sound like a slap across his face the laughter of her knowledge that this was the answer he dreaded and wanted he twisted her arms behind her holding her helpless her breasts pressed against him she felt the pain ripping through her shoulders she heard the anger in his words and the huskiness of pleasure in his voice who was he she did not answer she looked at him her eyes dark and oddly brilliant and he saw that the shape of her mouth distorted by pain was the shape of a mocking smile he felt it change to a shape of surrender under the touch of his lips he held her body as if the violence and the despair of the way he took her could wipe his unknown rival out of existence out of her past and more as if it could transform any part of her even the rival into an instrument of his pleasure he knew by the eagerness of her movement as her arms seized him that this was the way she wanted to be taken the silhouette of a conveyor belt moved against the strips of fire in the sky raising coal to the top of a distant tower as if an inexhaustible number of small black buckets rode out of the earth in a diagonal line across the sunset the harsh distant clatter kept going through the rattle of the chains which a young man in blue overalls was fastening over the machinery securing it to the flatcars lined on the siding of the quinn ball bearing company of connecticut mr mowen of the amalgamated switch and signal company across the street stood by watching he had stopped to watch on his way home from his own plant he wore a light overcoat stretched over his short paunchy figure and a derby hat over his graying blondish head there was a first touch of september chill in the air all the gates of the quinn plant buildings stood wide open while men and cranes moved the machinery out like taking the vital organs and leaving a carcass thought mr mowen another one asked mr mowen jerking his thumb at the plant even though he knew the answer huh asked the young man who had not noticed him standing there another company moving to colorado uhhuh its the third one from connecticut in the last two weeks said mr mowen and when you look at whats happening in new jersey rhode island massachusetts and all along the atlantic coast the young man was not looking and did not seem to listen its like a leaking faucet said mr mowen and all the waters running out to colorado all the money the young man flung the chain across and followed it deftly climbing over the big shape covered with canvas youd think people would have some feeling for their native state some loyalty but theyre running away i dont know whats happening to people its the bill said the young man what bill the equalization of opportunity bill how do you mean i hear mr quinn was making plans a year ago to open a branch in colorado the bill knocked that out cold so now hes made up his mind to move there lock stock and barrel i dont see where that makes it right the bill was necessary its a rotten shameold firms that have been here for generations there ought to be a law the young man worked swiftly competently as if he enjoyed it behind him the conveyor belt kept rising and clattering against the sky four distant smokestacks stood like flagpoles with coils of smoke weaving slowly about them like long banners at halfmast in the reddish glow of the evening mr mowen had lived with every smokestack of that skyline since the days of his father and grandfather he had seen the conveyor belt from his office window for thirty years that the quinn ball bearing company should vanish from across the street had seemed inconceivable he had known about quinns decision and had not believed it or rather he had believed it as he believed any words he heard or spoke as sounds that bore no fixed relation to physical reality now he knew that it was real he stood by the flatcars on the siding as if he still had a chance to stop them it isnt right he said he was speaking to the skyline at large but the young man above was the only part of it that could hear him thats not the way it was in my fathers time im not a big shot i dont want to fight anybody whats the matter with the world there was no answer now you for instanceare they taking you along to colorado me no i dont work here im just transient labor just picked up this job helping to lug the stuff out well where are you going to go when they move away havent any idea what are you going to do if more of them move out wait and see mr mowen glanced up dubiously he could not tell whether the answer was intended to apply to him or to the young man but the young mans attention was fixed on his task he was not looking down he moved on to the shrouded shapes on the next flatcar and mr mowen followed looking up at him pleading with something up in space ive got rights havent i i was born here i expected the old companies to be here when i grew up i expected to run the plant like my father did a man is part of his community hes got a right to count on it hasnt he something ought to be done about it about what oh i know you think its great dont youthat taggart boom and rearden metal and the gold rush to colorado and the drunken spree out there with wyatt and his bunch expanding their production like kettles boiling over everybody thinks its greatthats all you hear anywhere you gopeople are slaphappy making plans like sixyear olds on a vacationyoud think it was a national honeymoon of some kind or a permanent fourth of july the young man said nothing well i dont think so said mr mowen he lowered his voice the newspapers dont say so eithermind you thatthe newspapers arent saying anything mr mowen heard no answer only the clanking of the chains why are they all running to colorado he asked what have they got down there that we havent got the young man grinned maybe its something youve got that they havent got what the young man did not answer i dont see it its a backward primitive unenlightened place they dont even have a modern government its the worst government in any state the laziest it does nothingoutside of keeping law courts and a police department it doesnt do anything for the people it doesnt help anybody i dont see why all our best companies want to run there the young man glanced down at him but did not answer mr mowen sighed things arent right he said the equalization of opportunity bill was a sound idea theres got to be a chance for everybody its a rotten shame if people like quinn take unfair advantage of it why didnt he let somebody else start manufacturing ball bearings in colorado i wish the colorado people would leave us alone that stockton foundry out there had no right going into the switch and signal business thats been my business for years i have the right of seniority it isnt fair its dogeatdog competition newcomers shouldnt be allowed to muscle in where am i going to sell switches and signals there were two big railroads out in colorado now the phoenixdurangos gone so theres just taggart transcontinental left it isnt fairtheir forcing dan conway out theres got to be room for competition and ive been waiting six months for an order of steel from orren boyleand now he says he cant promise me anything because rearden metal has shot his market to hell theres a run on that metal boyle has to retrench it isnt fairrearden being allowed to ruin other peoples markets that way and i want to get some rearden metal too i need itbut try and get it he has a waiting line that would stretch across three statesnobody can get a scrap of it except his old friends people like wyatt and danagger and such it isnt fair its discrimination im just as good as the next fellow im entitled to my share of that metal the young man looked up i was in pennsylvania last week he said i saw the rearden mills theres a place thats busy theyre building four new openhearth furnaces and theyve got six more coming new furnaces he said looking off to the south nobodys built a new furnace on the atlantic coast for the last five years he stood against the sky on the top of a shrouded motor looking off at the dusk with a faint smile of eagerness and longing as one looks at the distant vision of ones love theyre busy he said then his smile vanished abruptly the way he jerked the crufin was the first break in the smooth competence of his movements it looked like a jolt of anger mr mowen looked at the skyline at the belts the wheels the smokethe smoke that settled heavily peacefully across the evening air stretching in a long haze all the way to the city of new york somewhere beyond the sunsetand he felt reassured by the thought of new york in its ring of sacred fires the ring of smokestacks gas tanks cranes and high tension lines he felt a current of power flowing through every grimy structure of his familiar street he liked the figure of the young man above him there was something reassuring in the way he worked something that blended with the skyline yet mr mowen wondered why he felt that a crack was growing somewhere eating through the solid the eternal walls something ought to be done said mr mowen a friend of mine went out of business last weekthe oil businesshad a couple of wells down in oklahomacouldnt compete with ellis wyatt it isnt fair they ought to leave the little people a chance they ought to place a limit on wyatts output he shouldnt be allowed to produce so much that hell swamp everybody else off the market i got stuck in new york yesterday had to leave my car there and come home on a damn commuters local couldnt get any gas for the car they said theres a shortage of oil in the city things arent right something ought to be done about it looking at the skyline mr mowen wondered what was the nameless threat to it and who was its destroyer what do you want to do about it asked the young man who me said mr mowen i wouldnt know im not a big shot i cant solve national problems i just want to make a living all i know is somebody ought to do something about it things arent right listenwhats your name owen kellogg listen kellogg what do you think is going to happen to the world you wouldnt care to know a whistle blew on a distant tower the nightshift whistle and mr mowen realized that it was getting late he sighed buttoning his coat turning to go well things are being done he said steps are being taken constructive steps the legislature has passed a bill giving wider powers to the bureau of economic planning and national resources theyve appointed a very able man as top coordinator cant say ive heard of him before but the newspapers said hes a man to be watched his name is wesley mouch dagny stood at the window of her living room looking at the city it was late and the lights were like the last sparks left glittering on the black remnants of a bonfire she felt at peace and she wished she could hold her mind still to let her own emotions catch up with her to look at every moment of the month that had rushed past her she had had no time to feel that she was back in her own office at taggart transcontinental there had been so much to do that she forgot it was a return from exile she had not noticed what jim had said on her return or whether he had said anything there had been only one person whose reaction she had wanted to know she had telephoned the waynefalkland hotel but senor francisco danconia she was told had gone back to buenos aires she remembered the moment when she signed her name at the bottom of a long legal page it was the moment that ended the john galt line now it was the rio norte line of taggart transcontinental againexcept that the men of the train crews refused to give up its name she too found it hard to give up she forced herself not to call it the john galt and wondered why that required an effort and why she felt a faint wrench of sadness one evening on a sudden impulse she had turned the corner of the taggart building for a last look at the office of john galt inc in the alley she did not know what she wantedjust to see it she thought a plank barrier had been raised along the sidewalk the old building was being demolished it had given up at last she had climbed over the planks and by the light of the street lamp that had once thrown a strangers shadow across the pavement she had looked in through the window of her former office nothing was left of the ground floor the partitions had been torn down there were broken pipes hanging from the ceiling and a pile of rubble on the floor there was nothing to see she had asked rearden whether he had come there one night last spring and stood outside her window fighting his desire to enter but she had known even before he answered that he had not she did not tell him why she asked it she did not know why that memory still disturbed her at times beyond the window of her living room the lighted rectangle of the calendar hung like a small shipping tag in the black sky it read september she smiled defiantly remembering the race she had run against its changing pages there were no deadlines now she thought no barriers no threats no limits she heard a key turning in the door of her apartment this was the sound she had waited for had wanted to hear tonight rearden came in as he had come many times using the key she had given him as sole announcement he threw his hat and coat down on a chair with a gesture that had become familiar he wore the formal black of dinner clothes hello she said im still waiting for the evening when i wont find you in he answered then youll have to phone the offices of taggart transcontinental any evening nowhere else jealous hank no curious what it would feel like to be he stood looking at her across the room refusing to let himself approach her deliberately prolonging the pleasure of knowing that he could do it whenever he wished she wore the tight gray skirt of an office suit and a blouse of transparent white cloth tailored like a mans shirt the blouse flared out above her waistline stressing the trim flatness of her hips against the glow of a lamp behind her he could see the slender silhouette of her body within the flaring circle of the blouse how was the banquet she asked fine i escaped as soon as i could why didnt you come you were invited i didnt want to see you in public he glanced at her as if stressing that he noted the full meaning of her answer then the lines of his face moved to the hint of an amused smile you missed a lot the national council of metal industries wont put itself again through the ordeal of having me for guest of honor not if they can help it what happened nothing just a lot of speeches was it an ordeal for you no yes in a way i had really wanted to enjoy it shall i get you a drink yes will you she turned to go he stopped her grasping her shoulders from behind he bent her head back and kissed her mouth when he raised his head she pulled it down again with a demanding gesture of ownership as if stressing her right to do it then she stepped away from him never mind the drink he said i didnt really want itexcept for seeing you wait on me well then let me wait on you no he smiled stretching himself out on the couch his hands crossed under his head he felt at home it was the first home he had ever found you know the worst part of the banquet was that the only wish of every person present was to get it over with he said what i cant understand is why they wanted to do it at all they didnt have to certainly not for my sake she picked up a cigarette box extended it to him then held the flame of a lighter to the tip of his cigarette in the deliberate manner of waiting on him she smiled in answer to his chuckle then sat down on the arm of a chair across the room why did you accept their invitation hank she asked youve always refused to join them i didnt want to refuse a peace offerwhen ive beaten them and they know it ill never join them but an invitation to appear as a guest of honorwell i thought they were good losers i thought it was generous of them of them are you going to say of me hank after all the things theyve done to stop you i won didnt i so i thought you know i didnt hold it against them that they couldnt see the value of the metal soonerso long as they saw it at last every man learns in his own way and time sure i knew there was a lot of cowardice there and envy and hypocrisy but i thought that that was only the surfacenow when ive proved my case when ive proved it so loudlyi thought their real motive for inviting me was their appreciation of the metal and she smiled in the brief space of his pause she knew the sentence he had stopped himself from uttering and for that i would forgive anyone anything but it wasnt he said and i couldnt figure out what their motive was dagny i dont think they had any motive at all they didnt give that banquet to please me or to gain something from me or to save face with the public there was no purpose of any kind about it no meaning they didnt really care when they denounced the metaland they dont care now theyre not really afraid that ill drive them all off the marketthey dont care enough even about that do you know what that banquet was like its as if theyd heard that there are values one is supposed to honor and this is what one does to honor themso they went through the motions like ghosts pulled by some sort of distant echoes from a better age i i couldnt stand it she said her face tight and you dont think youre generous he glanced up at her his eyes brightened to a look of amusement why do they make you so angry she said her voice low to hide the sound of tenderness you wanted to enjoy it it probably serves me right i shouldnt have expected anything dont know what it was that i wanted i do ive never liked occasions of that sort i dont see why i expected it to be different this time you know i went there feeling almost as if the metal had changed everything even people oh yes hank i know well it was the wrong place to seek anything do you remember you said once that celebrations should be only for those who have something to celebrate the dot of her lighted cigarette stopped in midair she sat still she had never spoken to him of that party or of anything related to his home in a moment she answered quietly i remember know what you meant i knew it then too he was looking straight at her she lowered her eyes he remained silent when he spoke again his voice was gay the worst thing about people is not the insults they hand out but the compliments i couldnt bear the kind they spouted tonight particularly when they kept saying how much everybody needs methey the city the country and the whole world i guess apparently their idea of the height of glory is to deal with people who need them i cant stand people who need me he glanced at her do you need me she answered her voice earnest desperately he laughed no not the way i meant you didnt say it the way they do how did i say it like a traderwho pays for what he wants they say it like beggars who use a tin cup as a claim check i pay for it hank dont look innocent you know exactly what i mean yes she whispered she was smiling oh to hell with them he said happily stretching his legs shifting the position of his body on the couch stressing the luxury of relaxation im no good as a public figure anyway it doesnt matter now we dont have to care what they see or dont see theyll leave us alone its clear track ahead whats the next undertaking mr vicepresident a transcontinental track of rearden metal how soon do you want it tomorrow morning three years from now is when ill get it think you can do it in three years if the john galt if the rio norte line does as well as its doing now its going to do better thats only the beginning i have an installment plan made out as the money comes in im going to start tearing up the main track one division at a time and replacing it with rearden metal rail okay any time you wish to start ill keep moving the old rail to the branch linesthey wont last much longer if i dont in three years youll ride on your own metal into san francisco if somebody wants to give you a banquet there in three years ill have mills pouring rearden metal in colorado in michigan and in idaho thats my installment plan your own mills branches uhhuh what about the equalization of opportunity bill you dont think its going to exist three years from now do you weve given them such a demonstration that all that rot is going to be swept away the whole country is with us wholl want to stop things now wholl listen to the bilge theres a lobby of the better kind of men working in washington right this moment theyre going to get the equalization bill scrapped at the next session i i hope so ive had a terrible time these last few weeks getting the new furnaces started but its all set now theyre being built i can sit back and take it easy i can sit at my desk rake in the money loaf like a bum watch the orders for the metal pouring in and play favorites ail over the place say whats the first train youve got for philadelphia tomorrow morning oh i dont know you dont whats the use of an operating vicepresident i have to be at the mills by seven tomorrow got anything running around six fivethirty am is the first one i think will you wake me up in time to make it or would you rather order the train held for me ill wake you up ok she sat watching him as he remained silent he had looked tired when he came in the lines of exhaustion were gone from his face now dagny he asked suddenly his tone had changed there was some hidden earnest note in his voice why didnt you want to see me in public i dont want to be part of your official life he did not answer in a moment he asked casually when did you take a vacation last i think it was two no three years ago what did you do went to the adirondacks for a month came back in a week i did that five years ago only it was oregon he lay flat on his back looking at the ceiling dagny lets take a vacation together lets take my car and drive away for a few weeks anywhere just drive down the back roads where no one knows us well leave no address we wont look at a newspaper we wont touch a phonewe wont have any official life at all she got up she approached him she stood by the side of the couch looking down at him the light of the lamp behind her she did not want him to see her face and the effort she was making not to smile you can take a few weeks off cant you he said things are set and going now its safe we wont have another chance in the next three years all right hank she said forcing her voice to sound calmly toneless will you when do you want to start monday morning all right she turned to step away he seized her wrist pulled her down swung her body to lie stretched fulllength on top of him he held her still uncomfortably as she had fallen his one hand in her hair pressing her mouth to his his other hand moving from the shoulder blades under her thin blouse to her waist to her legs she whispered and you say i dont need you she pulled herself away from him and stood up brushing her hair off her face he lay still looking up at her his eyes narrowed the bright flicker of some particular interest in his eyes intent and faintly mocking she glanced down a strap of her slip had broken the slip hung diagonally from her one shoulder to her side and he was looking at her breast under the transparent film of the blouse she raised her hand to adjust the strap he slapped her hand down she smiled in understanding in answering mockery she walked slowly deliberately across the room and leaned against a table facing him her hands holding the tables edge her shoulders thrown back it was the contrast he likedthe severity of her clothes and the halfnaked body the railroad executive who was a woman he owned he sat up he sat leaning comfortably across the couch his legs crossed and stretched forward his hands in his pockets looking at her with the glance of a property appraisal did you say you wanted a transcontinental track of rearden metal mr vicepresident he asked what if i dont give it to you i can choose my customers now and demand any price i please if this were a year ago i would have demanded that you sleep with me in exchange i wish you had would you have done it of course as a matter of business as a sale if you were the buyer you would have liked that wouldnt you would you yes she whispered he approached her he grasped her shoulders and pressed his mouth to her breast through the thin cloth then holding her he looked at her silently for a long moment what did you do with that bracelet he asked they had never referred to it she had to let a moment pass to regain the steadiness of her voice i have it she answered i want you to wear it if anyone guesses it will be worse for you than for me wear it she brought out the bracelet of rearden metal she extended it to him without a word looking straight at him the greenblue chain glittering across her palm holding her glance he clasped the bracelet on her wrist in the moment when the clasp clicked shut under his fingers she bent her head down to them and kissed his hand the earth went flowing under the hood of the car uncoiling from among the curves of wisconsins hills the highway was the only evidence of human labor a precarious bridge stretched across a sea of brush weeds and trees the sea rolled softly in sprays of yellow and orange with a few red jets shooting up on the hillsides with pools of remnant green in the hollows under a pure blue sky among the colors of a picture post card the cars hood looked like the work of a jeweler with the sun sparkling on its chromium steel and its black enamel reflecting the sky dagny leaned against the corner of the side window her legs stretched forward she liked the wide comfortable space of the cars seat and the warmth of the sun on her shoulders she thought that the countryside was beautiful what id like to see said rearden is a billboard she laughed he had answered her silent thought selling what and to whom we havent seen a car or a house for an hour thats what i dont like about it he bent forward a little his hands on the wheel he was frowning look at that road the long strip of concrete was bleached to the powdery gray of bones left on a desert as if sun and snows had eaten away the traces of tires oil and carbon the lustrous polish of motion green weeds rose from the angular cracks of the concrete no one had used the road or repaired it for many years but the cracks were few its a good road said rearden it was built to last the man who built it must have had a good reason for expecting it to carry a heavy traffic in the years ahead yes i dont like the looks of this i dont either then she smiled but think how often weve heard people complain that billboards ruin the appearance of the countryside well theres the unruined countryside for them to admire she added theyre the people i hate she did not want to feel the uneasiness which she felt like a thin crack under her enjoyment of this day she had felt that uneasiness at times in the last three weeks at the sight of the country streaming past the wedge of the cars hood she smiled it was the hood that had been the immovable point in her field of vision while the earth had gone by it was the hood that had been the center the focus the security in a blurred dissolving world the hood before her and reardens hands on the wheel by her side she smiled thinking that she was satisfied to let this be the shape of her world after the first week of their wandering when they had driven at random at the mercy of unknown crossroads he had said to her one morning as they started out dagny does resting have to be purposeless she had laughed answering no what factory do you want to see he had smiledat the guilt he did not have to assume at the explanations he did not have to giveand he had answered its an abandoned ore mine around saginaw bay that ive heard about they say its exhausted they had driven across michigan to the ore mine they had walked through the ledges of an empty pit with the remnants of a crane like a skeleton bending above them against the sky and someones rusted lunchbox clattering away from under their feet she had felt a stab of uneasiness sharper than sadnessbut rearden had said cheerfully exhausted hell ill show them how many tons and dollars i can draw out of this place on their way back to the car he had said if i could find the right man id buy that mine for him tomorrow morning and set him up to work it the next day when they were driving west and south toward the plains of illinois he had said suddenly after a long silence no ill have to wait till they junk the bill the man who could work that mine wouldnt need me to teach him the man whod need me wouldnt be worth a damn they could speak of their work as they always had with full confidence in being understood but they never spoke of each other he acted as if their passionate intimacy were a nameless physical fact not to be identified in the communication between two minds each night it was as if she lay in the arms of a stranger who let her see every shudder of sensation that ran through his body but would never permit her to know whether the shocks reached any answering tremor within him she lay naked at his side but on her wrist there was the bracelet of rearden metal she knew that he hated the ordeal of signing the mr and mrs smith on the registers of squalid roadside hotels there were evenings when she noticed the faint contraction of anger in the tightness of his mouth as he signed the expected names of the expected fraud anger at those who made fraud necessary she noticed indifferently the air of knowing slyness in the manner of the hotel clerks which seemed to suggest that guests and clerks alike were accomplices in a shameful guilt the guilt of seeking pleasure but she knew that it did not matter to him when they were alone when he held her against him for a moment and she saw his eyes look alive and guiltless they drove through small towns through obscure side roads through the kind of places they had not seen for years she felt uneasiness at the sight of the towns days passed before she realized what it was that she missed most a glimpse of fresh paint the houses stood like men in unpressed suits who had lost the desire to stand straight the cornices were like sagging shoulders the crooked porch steps like torn hem lines the broken windows like patches mended with clapboard the people in the streets stared at the new car not as one stares at a rare sight but as if the glittering black shape were an impossible vision from another world there were few vehicles in the streets and too many of them were horsedrawn she had forgotten the literal shape and usage of horsepower she did not like to see its return she did not laugh that day at the grade crossing when rearden chuckled pointing and she saw the train of a small local railroad come tottering from behind a hill drawn by an ancient locomotive that coughed black smoke through a tall stack oh god hank its not funny i know he said they were seventy miles and an hour away from it when she said hank do you see the taggart comet being pulled across the continent by a coalburner of that kind whats the matter with you pull yourself together im sorry its just that i keep thinking it wont be any use all my new track and all your new furnaces if we dont find someone able to produce diesel engines if we dont find him fast ted nielsen of colorado is your man yes if he finds a way to open his new plant hes sunk more money than he should into the bonds of the john galt line thats turned out to be a pretty profitable investment hasnt it yes but its held him up now hes ready to go ahead but he cant find the tools there are no machine tools to buy not anywhere not at any price hes getting nothing but promises and delays hes combing the country looking for old junk to reclaim from closed factories if he doesnt start soon he will whos going to stop him now hank she said suddenly could we go to a place id like to see sure anywhere which place its in wisconsin there used to be a great motor company there in my fathers time we had a branch line serving it but we closed the lineabout seven years agowhen they closed the factory i think its one of those blighted areas now maybe theres still some machinery left there that ted nielsen could use it might have been overlookedthe place is forgotten and theres no transportation to it at all ill find it what was the name of the factory the twentieth century motor company oh of course that was one of the best motor firms in my youth perhaps the best i seem to remember that there was something odd about the way it went out of business cant recall what it was it took them three days of inquiries but they found the bleached abandoned roadand now they were driving through the yellow leaves that glittered like a sea of gold coins to the twentieth century motor company hank what if anything happens to ted nielsen she asked suddenly as they drove in silence why should anything happen to him i dont know but well there was dwight sanders he vanished united locomotives is done for now and the other plants are in no condition to produce diesels ive stopped listening to promises and and of what use is a railroad without motive power of what use is anything for that matter without it the leaves sparkled swaying in the wind they spread for miles from grass to brush to trees with the motion and all the colors of fire they seemed to celebrate an accomplished purpose burning in unchecked untouched abundance rearden smiled theres something to be said for the wilderness im beginning to like it new country that nobodys discovered she nodded gaily its good soillook at the way things grow id clear that brush and id build a and then they stopped smiling the corpse they saw in the weeds by the roadside was a rusty cylinder with bits of glassthe remnant of a gasstation pump it was the only thing left visible the few charred posts the slab of concrete and the sparkle of glass dustwhich had been a gas stationwere swallowed in the brush not to be noticed except by a careful glance not to be seen at all in another year they looked away they drove on not wanting to know what else lay hidden under the miles of weeds they felt the same wonder like a weight in the silence between them wonder as to how much the weeds had swallowed and how fast the road ended abruptly behind the turn of a hill what remained was a few chunks of concrete sticking out of a long pitted stretch of tar and mud the concrete had been smashed by someone and carted away even weeds could not grow in the strip of earth left behind on the crest of a distant hill a single telegraph pole stood slanted against the sky like a cross over a vast grave it took them three hours and a punctured tire to crawl in low gear through trackless soft through gullies then down ruts left by cart wheelsto reach the settlement that lay in the valley beyond the hill with the telegraph pole a few houses still stood within the skeleton of what had once been an industrial town everything that could move had moved away but some human beings had remained the empty structures were vertical rubble they had been eaten not by time but by men boards torn out at random missing patches of roofs holes left in gutted cellars it looked as if blind hands had seized whatever fitted the need of the moment with no concept of remaining in existence the next morning the inhabited houses were scattered at random among the ruins the smoke of their chimneys was the only movement visible in town a shell of concrete which had been a schoolhouse stood on the outskirts it looked like a skull with the empty sockets of glassless windows with a few strands of hair still clinging to it in the shape of broken wires beyond the town on a distant hill stood the factory of the twentieth century motor company its walls roof lines and smokestacks looked trim impregnable like a fortress it would have seemed intact but for a silver water tank the water tank was tipped sidewise they saw no trace of a road to the factory in the tangled miles of trees and hillsides they drove to the door of the first house in sight that showed a feeble signal of rising smoke the door was open an old woman came shuffling out at the sound of the motor she was bent and swollen barefooted dressed in a garment of flour sacking she looked at the car without astonishment without curiosity it was the blank stare of a being who had lost the capacity to feel anything but exhaustion can you tell me the way to the factory asked rearden the woman did not answer at once she looked as if she would be unable to speak english what factory she asked rearden pointed that one its closed i know its closed but is there any way to get there i dont know is there any sort of road theres roads in the woods any for a car to drive through maybe well which would be the best road to take i dont know through the open door they could see the interior of her house there was a useless gas stove its oven stuffed with rags serving as a chest of drawers there was a stove built of stones in a corner with a few logs burning under an old kettle and long streaks of soot rising up the wall a white object lay propped against the legs of a table it was a porcelain washbowl torn from the wall of some bathroom filled with wilted cabbages a tallow candle stood in a bottle on the table there was no paint left on the floor its boards were scrubbed to a soggy gray that looked like the visual expression of the pain in the bones of the person who had bent and scrubbed and lost the battle against the grime now soaked into the grain of the boards a brood of ragged children had gathered at the door behind the woman silently one by one they stared at the car not with the bright curiosity of children but with the tension of savages ready to vanish at the first sign of danger how many miles is it to the factory asked rearden ten miles said the woman and added maybe five how far is the next town there aint any next town there are other towns somewhere i mean how far yeah somewhere in the vacant space by the side of the house they saw faded rags hanging on a clothesline which was a piece of telegraph wire three chickens pecked among the beds of a scraggly vegetable garden a fourth sat roosting on a bar which was a length of plumbers pipe two pigs waddled in a stretch of mud and refuse the stepping stones laid across the muck were pieces of the highways concrete they heard a screeching sound in the distance and saw a man drawing water from a public well by means of a rope pulley they watched him as he came slowly down the street he carried two buckets that seemed too heavy for his thin arms one could not tell his age he approached and stopped looking at the car his eyes darted at the strangers then away suspicious and furtive rearden took out a tendollar bill and extended it to him asking would you please tell us the way to the factory the man stared at the money with sullen indifference not moving not lifting a hand for it still clutching the two buckets if one were ever to see a man devoid of greed thought dagny there he was we dont need no money around here he said dont you work for a living yeah well what do you use for money the man put the buckets down as if it had just occurred to him that he did not have to stand straining under their weight we dont use no money he said we just trade things amongst us how do you trade with people from other towns we dont go to no other towns you dont seem to have it easy here whats that to you nothing just curiosity why do you people stay here my old man used to have a grocery store here only the factory closed why didnt you move where to anywhere what for dagny was staring at the two buckets they were square tins with rope handles they had been oil cans listen said rearden can you tell us whether theres a road to the factory theres plenty of roads is there one that a car can take i guess so which one the man weighed the problem earnestly for some moments well now if you turn to the left by the schoolhouse he said and go on til you come to the crooked oak theres a road up there thats fine when it dont rain for a couple of weeks when did it rain last yesterday is there another road well you could go through hansons pasture and across the woods and then theres a good solid road there all the way down to the creek is there a bridge across the creek no what are the other roads well if its a car road that you want theres one the other side of millers patch its paved its the best road for a car you just turn to the right by the schoolhouse and but that road doesnt go to the factory does it no not to the factory all right said rearden guess well find our own way he had pressed the starter when a rock came smashing into the windshield the glass was shatterproof but a sunburst of cracks spread across it they saw a ragged little hoodlum vanishing behind a corner with a scream of laughter and they heard the shrill laughter of children answering him from behind some windows or crevices rearden suppressed a swear word the man looked vapidly across the street frowning a little the old woman looked on without reaction she had stood there silently watching without interest or purpose like a chemical compound on a photographic plate absorbing visual shapes because they were there to be absorbed but unable ever to form any estimate of the objects of her vision dagny had been studying her for some minutes the swollen shapelessness of the womans body did not look like the product of age and neglect it looked as if she was pregnant this seemed impossible but glancing closer dagny saw that her dustcolored hair was not gray and that there were few wrinkles on her face it was only the vacant eyes the stooped shoulders the shuffling movements that gave her the stamp of senility dagny leaned out and asked how old are you the woman looked at her not in resentment but merely as one looks at a pointless question thirtyseven she answered they had driven five former blocks away when dagny spoke hank she said in terror that woman is only two years older than i yes god how did they ever come to such a state he shrugged who is john galt the last thing they saw as they left the town was a billboard a design was still visible on its peeling strips imprinted in the dead gray that had once been color it advertised a washing machine in a distant field beyond the town they saw the figure of a man moving slowly contorted by the ugliness of a physical effort beyond the proper use of a human body he was pushing a plow by hand they reached the factory of the twentieth century motor company two miles and two hours later they knew as they climbed the hill that their quest was useless a rusted padlock hung on the door of the main entrance but the huge windows were shattered and the place was open to anyone to the woodchucks the rabbits and the dried leaves that lay in drifts inside the factory had been gutted long ago the great pieces of machinery had been moved out by some civilized meansthe neat holes of their bases still remained in the concrete of the floor the rest had gone to random looters there was nothing left except refuse which the neediest tramp had found worthless piles of twisted rusted scraps of boards plaster and glass splintersand the steel stairways built to last and lasting rising in trim spirals to the roof they stopped in the great hall where a ray of light fell diagonally from a gap in the ceiling and the echoes of their steps rang around them dying far away in rows of empty rooms a bird darted from among the steel rafters and went in a hissing streak of wings out into the sky wed better look through it just in case said dagny you take the shops and ill take the annexes lets do it as fast as possible i dont like to let you wander around alone i dont know how safe they are any of those floors or stairways oh nonsense i can find my way around a factoryor in a wrecking crew lets get it over with i want to get out of here when she walked through the silent yardswhere steel bridges still hung overhead tracing lines of geometrical perfection across the sky her only wish was not to see any of it but she forced herself to look it was like having to perform an autopsy on the body of ones love she moved her glance as an automatic searchlight her teeth clamped tight together she walked rapidlythere was no necessity to pause anywhere it was in a room of what had been the laboratory that she stopped it was a coil of wire that made her stop the coil protruded from a pile of junk she had never seen that particular arrangement of wires yet it seemed familiar as if it touched the hint of some memory faint and very distant she reached for the coil but could not move it it seemed to be part of some object buried in the pile the room looked as if it had been an experimental laboratoryif she was right in judging the purpose of the torn remnants she saw on the walls a great many electrical outlets bits of heavy cable lead conduits glass tubing builtin cabinets without shelves or doors there was a great deal of glass rubber plastic and metal in the junk pile and dark gray splinters of slate that had been a blackboard scraps of paper rustled dryly all over the floor there were also remnants of things which had not been brought here by the owner of that room popcorn wrappers a whiskey bottle a confession magazine she attempted to extricate the coil from the scrap pile it would not move it was part of some large object she knelt and began to dig through the junk she had cut her hands she was covered with dust by the time she stood up to look at the object she had cleared it was the broken remnant of the model of a motor most of its parts were missing but enough was left to convey some idea of its former shape and purpose she had never seen a motor of this kind or anything resembling it she could not understand the peculiar design of its parts or the functions they were intended to perform she examined the tarnished tubes and oddshaped connections she tried to guess their purpose her mind going over every type of motor she knew and every possible kind of work its parts could perform none fitted the model it looked like an electric motor but she could not tell what fuel it was intended to burn it was not designed for steam or oil or anything she could name her sudden gasp was not a sound but a jolt that threw her at the junk pile she was on her hands and knees crawling over the wreckage seizing every piece of paper in sight flinging it away searching further her hands were shaking she found part of what she hoped had remained in existence it was a thin sheaf of typewritten pages clamped togetherthe remnant of a manuscript its beginning and end were gone the bits of paper left under the clamp showed the thick number of pages it had once contained the paper was yellowed and dry the manuscript had been a description of the motor from the empty enclosure of the plants powerhouse rearden heard her voice screaming hank it sounded like a scream of terror he ran in the direction of the voice he found her standing in the middle of a room her hands bleeding her stockings torn her suit smeared with dust a bunch of papers clutched in her hand hank what does this look like she asked pointing at an odd piece of wreckage at her feet her voice had the intense obsessed tone of a person stunned by a shock cut off from reality what does it look like are you hurt what happened no oh never mind dont look at me im all right look at this do you know what that is what did you do to yourself i had to dig it out of there im all right youre shaking you will too in a moment hank look at it just look and tell me what you think it is he glanced down then looked attentivelythen he was sitting on the floor studying the object intently its a queer way to put a motor together he said frowning read this she said extending the pages he read looked up and said good god she was sitting on the floor beside him and for a moment they could say nothing else it was the coil she said she felt as if her mind were racing she could not keep up with all the things which a sudden blast had opened to her vision and her words came hurtling against one another it was the coil that i noticed firstbecause i had seen drawings like it not quite but something like it years ago when i was in schoolit was in an old book it was given up as impossible long long agobut i liked to read everything i could find about railroad motors that book said that there was a time when men were thinking of itthey worked on it they spent years on experiments but they couldnt solve it and they gave it up it was forgotten for generations i didnt think that any living scientist ever thought of it now but someone did someone has solved it now today hank do you understand those men long ago tried to invent a motor that would draw static electricity from the atmosphere convert it and create its own power as it went along they couldnt do it they gave it up she pointed at the broken shape but there it is he nodded he was not smiling he sat looking at the remnant intent on some thought of his own it did not seem to be a happy thought hank dont you understand what this means its the greatest revolution in power motors since the internalcombustion enginegreater than that it wipes everything outand makes everything possible to hell with dwight sanders and all of them wholl want to look at a diesel wholl want to worry about oil coal or refueling stations do you see what i see a brandnew locomotive half the size of a single diesel unit and with ten times the power a selfgenerator working on a few drops of fuel with no limits to its energy the cleanest swiftest cheapest means of motion ever devised do you see what this will do to our transportation systems and to the countryin about one year there was no spark of excitement in his face he said slowly who designed it why was it left here well find out he weighed the pages in his hand reflectively dagny he asked if you dont find the man who made it will you be able to reconstruct that motor from what is left she took a long moment then the word fell with a sinking sound no nobody will he had it all right it workedjudging by what he writes here it is the greatest thing ive ever laid eyes on it was we cant make it work again to supply whats missing would take a mind as great as his ill find himif i have to drop every other thing im doing and if hes still alive she heard the unstated guess in the tone of his voice why do you say it like that i dont think he is if he were would he leave an invention of this kind to rot on a junk pile would he abandon an achievement of this size if he were still alive you would have had the locomotives with the selfgenerators years ago and you wouldnt have had to look for him because the whole world would know his name by now i dont think this model was made so very long ago he looked at the paper of the manuscript and at the rusty tarnish of the motor about ten years ago id guess maybe a little longer weve got to find him or somebody who knew him this is more important than anything owned or manufactured by anyone today i dont think well find him and if we dont nobody will be able to repeat his performance nobody will rebuild his motor theres not enough of it left its only a lead an invaluable lead but it would take the sort of mind thats born once in a century to complete it do you see our presentday motor designers attempting it no theres not a firstrate designer left there hasnt been a new idea in motors for years thats one profession that seems to be dyingor dead hank do you know what that motor would have meant if built he chuckled briefly id say about ten years added to the life of every person in this countryif you consider how many things it would have made easier and cheaper to produce how many hours of human labor it would have released for other work and how much more anyones work would have brought him locomotives what about automobiles and ships and airplanes with a motor of this kind and tractors and power plants all hooked to an unlimited supply of energy with no fuel to pay for except a few pennies worth to keep the converter going that motor could have set the whole country in motion and on fire it would have brought an electric light bulb into every hole even into the homes of those people we saw down in the valley it would have it will im going to find the man who made it well try he rose abruptly but stopped to glance down at the broken remnant and said with a chuckle that was not gay there was the motor for the john galt line then he spoke in the brusque manner of an executive first well try to see if we can find their personnel office here well look for their records if theres any left we want the names of their research staff and their engineers i dont know who owns this place now and i suspect that the owners will be hard to find or they wouldnt have let it come to this then well go over every room in the laboratory later well get a few engineers to fly here and comb the rest of the place they started out but she stopped for a moment on the threshold hank that motor was the most valuable thing inside this factory she said her voice low it was more valuable than the whole factory and everything it ever contained yet it was passed up and left in the refuse it was the one thing nobody found worth the trouble of taking thats what frightens me about this he answered the personnel office did not take them long they found it by the sign which was left on the door but it was the only thing left there was no furniture inside no papers nothing but the splinters of smashed windows they went back to the room of the motor crawling on hands and knees they examined every scrap of the junk that littered the floor there was little to find they put aside the papers that seemed to contain laboratory notes but none referred to the motor and there were no pages of the manuscript among them the popcorn wrappers and the whiskey bottle testified to the kind of invading hordes that had rolled through the room like waves washing the remnants of destruction away to unknown bottoms they put aside a few bits of metal that could have belonged to the motor but these were too small to be of value the motor looked as if parts of it had been ripped off perhaps by someone who thought he could put them to some customary use what had remained was too unfamiliar to interest anybody on aching knees her palms spread flat upon the gritty floor she felt the anger trembling within her the hurting helpless anger that answers the sight of desecration she wondered whether someones diapers hung on a clothesline made of the motors missing wireswhether its wheels had become a rope pulley over a communal wellwhether its cylinder was now a pot containing geraniums on the window sill of the sweetheart of the man with the whiskey bottle there was a remnant of light on the hill but a blue haze was moving in upon the valleys and the red and gold of the leaves was spreading to the sky in strips of sunset it was dark when they finished she rose and leaned against the empty frame of the window for a touch of cool air on her forehead the sky was dark blue it could have set the whole country in motion and on fire she looked down at the motor she looked out at the country she moaned suddenly hit by a single long shudder and dropped her head on her arm standing pressed to the frame of the window whats the matter he asked she did not answer he looked out far below in the valley in the gathering night there trembled a few pale smears which were the lights of tallow candles chapter x wyatts torch god have mercy on us maam said the clerk of the hall of records nobody knows who owns that factory now i guess nobody will ever know it the clerk sat at a desk in a groundfloor office where dust lay undisturbed on the files and few visitors ever called he looked at the shining automobile parked outside his window in the muddy square that had once been the center of a prosperous county seat he looked with a faint wistful wonder at his two unknown visitors why asked dagny he pointed helplessly at the mass of papers he had taken out of the files the court will have to decide who owns it which i dont think any court can do if a court ever gets to it i dont think it will why what happened well it was sold outthe twentieth century i mean the twentieth century motor company it was sold twice at the same time and to two different sets of owners that was sort of a big scandal at the time two years ago and now its justhe pointedjust a bunch of paper lying around waiting for a court hearing i dont see how any judge will be able to untangle any property rights out of itor any right at all would you tell me please just what happened well the last legal owner of the factory was the peoples mortgage company of rome wisconsin thats the town the other side of the factory thirty miles north that mortgage company was a sort of noisy outfit that did a lot of advertising about easy credit mark yonts was the head of it nobody knew where he came from and nobody knows where hes gone to now but what they discovered the morning after the peoples mortgage company collapsed was that mark yonts had sold the twentieth century motor factory to a bunch of suckers from south dakota and that hed also given it as collateral for a loan from a bank in illinois and when they took a look at the factory they discovered that hed moved all the machinery out and sold it piecemeal god only knows where and to whom so it seems like everybody owns the placeand nobody thats how it stands nowthe south dakotans and the bank and the attorney for the creditors of the peoples mortgage company all suing one another all claiming this factory and nobody having the right to move a wheel in it except that theres no wheels left to move did mark yonts operate the factory before he sold it lord no maam he wasnt the kind that ever operates anything he didnt want to make money only to get it guess he got it toomore than anyone could have made out of that factory he wondered why the blond hardfaced man who sat with the woman in front of his desk looked grimly out the window at their car at a large object wrapped in canvas roped tightly under the raised cover of the cars luggage compartment what happened to the factory records which do you mean maam their production records their work records their personnel files oh theres nothing left of that now theres been a lot of looting going on all the mixed owners grabbed what furniture or things they could haul out of there even if the sheriff did put a padlock on the door the papers and stuff like thati guess it was all taken by the scavengers from starnesville thats the place down in the valley where theyre having it pretty tough these days they burned the stuff for kindling most likely is there anyone left here who used to work in the factory asked rearden no sir not around here they all lived down in starnesville all of them whispered dagny she was thinking of the ruins the engineers too yes maam that was the factory town theyve all gone long ago do you happen to remember the names of any men who worked there no maam what owner was the last to operate the factory asked rearden i couldnt say sir theres been so much trouble up there and the place has changed hands so many times since old jed starnes died hes the man who built the factory he made this whole part of the country i guess he died twelve years ago can you give us the names of all the owners since no sir we had a fire in the old courthouse about three years ago and all the old records are gone i dont know where you could trace them now you dont know how this mark yonts happened to acquire the factory yes i know that he bought it from mayor bascom of rome how mayor bascom happened to own it i dont know where is mayor bascom now still there in rome thank you very much said rearden rising well call on him they were at the door when the clerk asked what is it youre looking for sir were looking for a friend of ours said rearden a friend weve lost who used to work in that factory mayor bascom of rome wisconsin leaned back in his chair his chest and stomach formed a pearshaped outline under his soiled shirt the air was a mixture of sun and dust pressing heavily upon the porch of his house he waved his arm the ring on his finger flashing a large topaz of poor quality no use no use lady absolutely no use he said would be just a waste of your time trying to question the folks around here theres no factory people left and nobody that would remember much about them so many families have moved away that whats left here is plain no good if i do say so myself plain no good just being mayor of a bunch of trash he had offered chairs to his two visitors but he did not mind it if the lady preferred to stand at the porch railing he leaned back studying her longlined figure highclass merchandise he thought but then the man with her was obviously rich dagny stood looking at the streets of rome there were houses sidewalks lampposts even a sign advertising soft drinks but they looked as if it were now only a matter of inches and hours before the town would reach the stage of starnesville naw theres no factory records left said mayor bascom if thats what you want to find lady give it up its like chasing leaves in a storm now just like leaves in a storm who cares about papers at a time like this what people save is good solid material objects ones got to be practical through the dusty windowpanes they could see the living room of his house there were persian rugs on a buckled wooden floor a portable bar with chromium strips against a wall stained by the seepage of last years rains an expensive radio with an old kerosene lamp placed on top of it sure its me that sold the factory to mark yonts mark was a nice fellow a nice lively energetic fellow sure he did trim a few corners but who doesnt of course he went a bit too far that i didnt expect i thought he was smart enough to stay within the lawwhatevers left of it nowadays mayor bascom smiled looking at them in a manner of placid frankness his eyes were shrewd without intelligence his smile goodnatured without kindness i dont think you folks are detectives he said but even if you were it wouldnt matter to me i didnt get any rakeoff from mark he didnt let me in on any of his deals i havent any idea where hes gone to now he sighed i liked that fellow wish hed stayed around never mind the sunday sermons he had to live didnt he he was no worse than anybody only smarter some get caught at it and some dontthats the only difference nope i didnt know what he was going to do with it when he bought that factory sure he paid me quite a bit more than the old booby trap was worth sure he was doing me a favor when he bought it nope i didnt put any pressure on him to make him buy it wasnt necessary id done him a few favors before theres plenty of laws thats sort of made of rubber and a mayors in a position to stretch them a bit for a friend well what the hell thats the only way anybody ever gets rich in this worldhe glanced at the luxurious black caras you ought to know you were telling us about the factory said rearden trying to control himself what i cant stand said mayor bascom is people who talk about principles no principle ever filled anybodys milk bottle the only thing that counts in life is solid material assets its no time for theories when everything is falling to pieces around us well mei dont aim to go under let them keep their ideas and ill take the factory i dont want ideas i just want my three square meals a day why did you buy that factory why does anybody buy any business to squeeze whatever can be squeezed out of it i know a good chance when i see it it was a bankruptcy sale and nobody much whod want to bid on the old mess so i got the place for peanuts didnt have to hold it long eithermark took it off my hands in twothree months sure it was a smart deal if i say so myself no big business tycoon could have done any better with it was the factory operating when you took it over naw it was shut down did you attempt to reopen it not me im a practical person can you recall the names of any men who worked there no never met em did you move anything out of the factory well ill tell you i took a look aroundand what i liked was old jeds desk old led starnes he was a real big shot in his time wonderful desk solid mahogany so i carted it home and some executive dont know who he was had a stall shower in his bathroom the like of which i never saw a glass door with a mermaid cut in the glass real art work and hot stuff too hotter than any oil painting so i had that shower lifted and moved here what the hell i owned it didnt i i was entitled to get something valuable out of that factory whose bankruptcy sale was it when you bought the factory oh that was the big crash of the community national bank in madison boy was that a crash it just about finished the whole state of wisconsinsure finished this part of it some say it was this motor factory that broke the bank but others say it was only the last drop in a leaking bucket because the community national had bum investments all over three or four states eugene lawson was the head of it the banker with a heart they called him he was quite famous in these parts twothree years ago did lawson operate the factory no he merely lent an awful lot of money on it more than he could ever hope to get back out of the old dump when the factory busted that was the last straw for gene lawson the bank busted three months later he sighed it hit the folks pretty hard around here they all had their life savings in the community national mayor bascom looked regretfully past his porch railing at his town he jerked his thumb at a figure across the street it was a whitehaired charwoman moving painfully on her knees scrubbing the steps of a house see that woman for instance they used to be solid respectable folks her husband owned the drygoods store he worked all his life to provide for her in her old age and he did too by the time he diedonly the money was in the community national bank who operated the factory when it failed oh that was some quicky corporation called amalgamated service inc just a puffball came up out of nothing and went back to it where are its members where are the pieces of a puffball when it bursts try and trace them all over the united states try it where is eugene lawson oh him hes done all right hes got a job in washingtonin the bureau of economic planning and national resources rearden rose too fast thrown to his feet by a jolt of anger then said controlling himself thank you for the information youre welcome friend youre welcome said mayor bascom placidly i dont know what it is youre after but take my word for it give it up theres nothing more to be had out of that factory i told you that we are looking for a friend of ours well have it your way must be a pretty good friend if youll go to so much trouble to find him you and the charming lady who is not your wife dagny saw reardens face go white so that even his lips became a sculptured feature indistinguishable against his skin keep your dirty he began but she stepped between them why do you think that i am not his wife she asked calmly mayor bascom looked astonished by reardens reaction he had made the remark without malice merely like a fellow cheat displaying his shrewdness to his partners in guilt lady ive seen a lot in my lifetime he said goodnaturedly married people dont look as if they have a bedroom on their minds when they look at each other in this world either youre virtuous or you enjoy yourself not both lady not both ive asked him a question she said to rearden in time to silence him hes given me an instructive explanation if you want a tip lady said mayor bascom get yourself a wedding ring from the dime store and wear it its not sure fire but it helps thank you she said goodbye the stern stressed calm of her manner was a command that made rearden follow her back to their car in silence they were miles beyond the town when he said not looking at her his voice desperate and low dagny dagny dagny im sorry im not moments later when she saw the look of control returning to his face she said dont ever get angry at a man for stating the truth that particular truth was none of his business his particular estimate of it was none of your concern or mine he said through his teeth not as an answer but as if the single thought battering his brain turned into sounds against his will t couldnt protect you from that unspeakable little i didnt need protection he remained silent not looking at her hank when youre able to keep down the anger tomorrow or next week give some thought to that mans explanation and see if you recognize any part of it he jerked his head to glance at her but said nothing when he spoke a long time later it was only to say in a tired even voice we cant call new york and have our engineers come here to search the factory we cant meet them here we cant let it be known that we found the motor together i had forgotten all that up there in the laboratory let me call eddie when we find a telephone ill have him send two engineers from the taggart staff im here alone on my vacation for all theyll know or have to know they drove two hundred miles before they found a longdistance telephone line when she called eddie willers he gasped hearing her voice dagny for gods sake where are you in wisconsin why didnt know where to reach you youd better come back at once as fast as you can what happened nothingyet but there are things going on which youd better stop them now if you can if anybody can what things havent you been reading the newspapers no i cant tell you over the phone i cant give you all the details dagny youll think im insane but i think theyre planning to kill colorado ill come back at once she said cut into the granite of manhattan under the taggart terminal there were tunnels which had once been used as sidings at a time when traffic ran in clicking currents through every artery of the terminal every hour of the day the need for space had shrunk through the years with the shrinking of the traffic and the side tunnels had been abandoned like dry river beds a few lights remained as blue patches on the granite over rails left to rust on the ground dagny placed the remnant of the motor into a vault in one of the tunnels the vault had once contained an emergency electric generator which had been removed long ago she did not trust the useless young men of the taggart research staff there were only two engineers of talent among them who could appreciate her discovery she had shared her secret with the two and sent them to search the factory in wisconsin then she had hidden the motor where no one else would know of its existence when her workers carried the motor down to the vault and departed she was about to follow them and lock the steel door but she stopped key in hand as if the silence and solitude had suddenly thrown her at the problem she had been facing for days as if this were the moment to make her decision her office car was waiting for her at one of the terminal platforms attached to the end of a train due to leave for washington in a few minutes she had made an appointment to see eugene lawson but she had told herself that she would cancel it and postpone her questif she could think of some action to take against the things she had found on her return to new york the things eddie begged her to fight she had tried to think but she could see no way of fighting no rules of battle no weapons helplessness was a strange experience new to her she had never found it hard to face things and make decisions but she was not dealing with thingsthis was a fog without shapes or definitions in which something kept forming and shifting before it could be seen like semiclots in a notquiteliquidit was as if her eyes were reduced to sidevision and she were sensing blurs of disaster coiling toward her but she could not move her glance she had no glance to move and focus the union of locomotive engineers was demanding that the maximum speed of all trains on the john galt line be reduced to sixty miles an hour the union of railway conductors and brakemen was demanding that the length of all freight trains on the john galt line be reduced to sixty cars the states of wyoming new mexico utah and arizona were demanding that the number of trains run in colorado not exceed the number of trains run in each of these neighboring states a group headed by orren boyle was demanding the passage of a preservation of livelihood law which would limit the production of rearden metal to an amount equal to the output of any other steel mill of equal plant capacity a group headed by mr mowen was demanding the passage of a fair share law to give every customer who wanted it an equal supply of rearden metal a group headed by bertram scudder was demanding the passage of a public stability law forbidding eastern business firms to move out of their states wesley mouch top coordinator of the bureau of economic planning and national resources was issuing a great many statements the content and purpose of which could not be denned except that the words emergency powers and unbalanced economy kept appearing in the text every few lines dagny by what right eddie willers had asked her his voice quiet but the words sounding like a cry by what right are they all doing it by what right she had confronted james taggart in his office and said jim this is your battle ive fought mine youre supposed to be an expert at dealing with the looters stop them taggart had said not looking at her you cant expect to run the national economy to suit your own convenience i dont want to run the national economy i want your national economy runners to leave me alone i have a railroad to runand i know whats going to happen to your national economy if my railroad collapses i see no necessity for panic jim do i have to explain to you that the income from our rio norte line is all weve got to save us from collapsing that we need every penny of it every fare every carload of freightas fast as we can get it he had not answered when we have to use every bit of power in every one of our brokendown diesels when we dont have enough of them to give colorado the service it needswhats going to happen if we reduce the speed and the length of trains well theres something to be said for the unions viewpoint too with so many railroads closing and so many railroad men out of work they feel that those extra speeds youve established on the rio norte line are unfairthey feel that there should be more trains instead so that the work would be divided aroundthey feel that its not fair for us to get all the benefit of that new rail they want a share of it too who wants a share of it in payment for what he had not answered wholl bear the cost of two trains doing the work of one he had not answered where are you going to get the cars and the engines he had not answered what are those men going to do after theyve put taggart transcontinental out of existence i fully intend to protect the interests of taggart transcontinental how he had not answered howif you kill colorado it seems to me that before we worry about giving some people a chance to expand we ought to give some consideration to the people who need a chance of bare survival if you kill colorado what is there going to be left for your damn looters to survive on you have always been opposed to every progressive social measure i seem to remember that you predicted disaster when we passed the antidogeatdog rulebut the disaster has not come because i saved you you rotten fools i wont be able to save you this time he had shrugged not looking at her and if i dont who will he had not answered it did not seem real to her here under the ground thinking of it here she knew she could have no part in jims battle there was no action she could take against the men of undefined thought of unnamed motives of unstated purposes of unspecified morality there was nothing she could say to themnothing would be heard or answered what were the weapons she thought in a realm where reason was not a weapon any longer it was a realm she could not enter she had to leave it to jim and count on his selfinterest dimly she felt the chill of a thought telling her that selfinterest was not jims motive she looked at the object before her a glass case containing the remnant of the motor the man who made the motorshe thought suddenly the thought coming like a cry of despair she felt a moments helpless longing to find him to lean against him and let him tell her what to do a mind like his would know the way to win this battle she looked around her in the clean rational world of the underground tunnels nothing was of so urgent an importance as the task of finding the man who made the motor she thought could she delay it in order to argue with orren boyleto reason with mr mowento plead with bertram scudder she saw the motor completed built into an engine that pulled a train of two hundred cars down a track of rearden metal at two hundred miles an hour when the vision was within her reach within the possible was she to give it up and spend her time bargaining about sixty miles and sixty cars she could not descend to an existence where her brain would explode under the pressure of forcing itself not to outdistance incompetence she could not function to the rule of pipe downkeep downslow downdont do your best it is not wanted she turned resolutely and left the vault to take the train for washington it seemed to her as she locked the steel door that she heard a faint echo of steps she glanced up and down the dark curve of the tunnel there was no one in sight there was nothing but a string of blue lights glistening on walls of damp granite rearden could not fight the gangs who demanded the laws the choice was to fight them or to keep his mills open he had lost his supply of iron ore he had to fight one battle or the other there was no time for both he had found on his return that a scheduled shipment of ore had not been delivered no word or explanation had been heard from larkin when summoned to reardens office larkin appeared three days later than the appointment made offering no apology he said not looking at rearden his mouth drawn tightly into an expression of rancorous dignity after all you cant order people to come running to your office any time you please rearden spoke slowly and carefully why wasnt the ore delivered i wont take abuse i simply wont take any abuse for something i couldnt help i can run a mine just as well as you ran it every bit as well i did everything you didi dont know why something keeps going wrong unexpectedly all the time i cant be blamed for the unexpected to whom did you ship your ore last month i intended to ship you your share of it i fully intended it but i couldnt help it if we lost ten days of production last month on account of the rainstorm in the whole of north minnesotai intended to ship you the ore so you cant blame me because my intention was completely honest if one of my blast furnaces goes down will i be able to keep it going by feeding your intention into it thats why nobody can deal with you or talk to youbecause youre inhuman i have just learned that for the last three months you have not been shipping your ore by the lake boats you have been shipping it by rail why well after all i have a right to run my business as i see fit why are you willing to pay the extra cost what do you care im not charging it to you what will you do when you find that you cant afford the rail rates and that you have destroyed the lake shipping i am sure you wouldnt understand any consideration other than dollars and cents but some people do consider their social and patriotic responsibilities what responsibilities well i think that a railroad like taggart transcontinental is essential to the national welfare and it is ones public duty to support jims minnesota branch line which is running at a deficit rearden leaned forward across the desk he was beginning to see the links of a sequence he had never understood to whom did you ship your ore last month he asked evenly well after all that is my private business which to orren boyle wasnt it you cant expect people to sacrifice the entire steel industry of the nation to your selfish interests and get out of here said rearden he said it calmly the sequence was clear to him now dont misunderstand me i didnt mean get out larkin got out then there followed the days and nights of searching a continent by phone by wire by planeof looking at abandoned mines and at mines ready to be abandonedof tense rushed conferences held at tables hi the unlighted corners of disreputable restaurants looking across the table rearden had to decide how much he could risk to invest upon the sole evidence of a mans face manner and tone of voice hating the state of having to hope for honesty as for a favor but risking it pouring money into unknown hands in exchange for unsupported promises into unsigned unrecorded loans to dummy owners of failing minesmoney handed and taken furtively as an exchange between criminals in anonymous cash money poured into unenforceable contractsboth parties knowing that in case of fraud the defrauded was to be punished not the defrauderbut poured that a stream of ore might continue flowing into furnaces that the furnaces might continue to pour a stream of white metal mr rearden asked the purchasing manager of his mills if you keep that up where will be your profit well make it up on tonnage said rearden wearily we have an unlimited market for rearden metal the purchasing manager was an elderly man with graying hair a lean dry face and a heart which people said was given exclusively to the task of squeezing every last ounce of value out of a penny he stood in front of reardens desk saying nothing else merely looking straight at rearden his cold eyes narrowed and grim it was a look of the most profound sympathy that rearden had ever seen theres no other course open thought rearden as he had thought through days and nights he knew no weapons but to pay for what he wanted to give value for value to ask nothing of nature without trading his effort in return to ask nothing of men without trading the product of his effort what were the weapons he thought if values were not a weapon any longer an unlimited market mr rearden the purchasing manager asked dryly rearden glanced up at him i guess im not smart enough to make the sort of deals needed nowadays he said in answer to the unspoken thoughts that hung across his desk the purchasing manager shook his head no mr rearden its one or the other the same kind of brain cant do both either youre good at running the mills or youre good at running to washington maybe i ought to learn their method you couldnt learn it and it wouldnt do you any good you wouldnt win in any of those deals dont you understand youre the one whos got something to be looted when he was left alone rearden felt a jolt of blinding anger as it had come to him before painful single and sudden like an electric shockthe anger bursting out of the knowledge that one cannot deal with pure evil with the naked fullconscious evil that neither has nor seeks justification but when he felt the wish to fight and kill in the rightful cause of selfdefensehe saw the fat grinning face of mayor bascom and heard the drawling voice saying you and the charming lady who is not your wife then no rightful cause was left and the pain of anger was turning into the shameful pain of submission he had no right to condemn anyonehe thoughtto denounce anything to fight and die joyously claiming the sanction of virtue the broken promises the unconfessed desires the betrayal the deceit the lies the fraudhe was guilty of them all what form of corruption could he scorn degrees do not matter he thought one does not bargain about inches of evil he did not knowas he sat slumped at his desk thinking of the honesty he could claim no longer of the sense of justice he had lostthat it was his rigid honesty and ruthless sense of justice that were now knocking his only weapon out of his hands he would fight the looters but the wrath and fire were gone he would fight but only as one guilty wretch against the others he did not pronounce the words but the pain was their equivalent the ugly pain saying who am i to cast the first stone he let his body fall across the desk dagny he thought dagny if this is the price i have to pay ill pay it he was still the trader who knew no code except that of full payment for his desires it was late when he came home and hurried soundlessly up the stairs to his bedroom he hated himself for being reduced to sneaking but he had done it on most of his evenings for months the sight of his family had become unbearable to him he could not tell why dont hate them for your own guilt he had told himself but knew dimly that this was not the root of his hatred he closed the door of his bedroom like a fugitive winning a moments reprieve he moved cautiously undressing for bed he wanted no sound to betray his presence to his family he wanted no contact with them not even in their own minds he had put on his pajamas and stopped to light a cigarette when the door of his bedroom opened the only person who could properly enter his room without knocking had never volunteered to enter it so he stared blankly for a moment before he was able to believe that it was lillian who came in she wore an empire garment of pale chartreuse its pleated skirt streaming gracefully from its high waistline one could not tell at first glance whether it was an evening gown or a negligee it was a negligee she paused in the doorway the lines of her body flowing into an attractive silhouette against the light i know i shouldnt introduce myself to a stranger she said softly but ill have to my name is mrs rearden he could not tell whether it was sarcasm or a plea she entered and threw the door closed with a casual imperious gesture the gesture of an owner what is it lillian he asked quietly my dear you mustnt confess so much so bluntlyshe moved in a leisurely manner across the room past his bed and sat down in an armchairand so unflatteringly its an admission that i need to show special cause for taking your time should i make an appointment through your secretary he stood in the middle of the room holding the cigarette at his lips looking at her volunteering no answer she laughed my reason is so unusual that i know it will never occur to you loneliness darling do you mind throwing a few crumbs of your expensive attention to a beggar do you mind if i stay here without any formal reason at all no he said quietly not if you wish to i have nothing weighty to discussno milliondollar orders no transcontinental deals no rails no bridges not even the political situation i just want to chatter like a woman about perfectly unimportant things go ahead henry theres no better way to stop me is there she had an air of helpless appealing sincerity what can i say after that suppose i wanted to tell you about the new novel which balph eubank is writinghe is dedicating it to mewould that interest you if its the truth that you wantnot in the least she laughed and if its not the truth that i want then i wouldnt know what to say he answeredand felt a rush of blood to his brain tight as a slap realizing suddenly the double infamy of a lie uttered in protestation of honesty he had said it sincerely but it implied a boast to which he had no right any longer why would you want it if its not the truth he asked what for now you see thats the cruelty of conscientious people you wouldnt understand itwould youif i answered that real devotion consists of being willing to lie cheat and fake in order to make another person happyto create for him the reality he wants if he doesnt like the one that exists no he said slowly i wouldnt understand it its really very simple if you tell a beautiful woman that she is beautiful what have you given her its no more than a fact and it has cost you nothing but if you tell an ugly woman that she is beautiful you offer her the great homage of corrupting the concept of beauty to love a woman for her virtues is meaningless shes earned it its a payment not a gift but to love her for her vices is a real gift unearned and undeserved to love her for her vices is to defile all virtue for her sakeand that is a real tribute of love because you sacrifice your conscience your reason your integrity and your invaluable selfesteem he looked at her blankly it sounded like some sort of monstrous corruption that precluded the possibility of wondering whether anyone could mean it he wondered only what was the point of uttering it whats love darling if its not selfsacrifice she went on lightly in the tone of a drawingroom discussion whats selfsacrifice unless one sacrifices that which is ones most precious and most important but i dont expect you to understand it not a stainlesssteel puritan like you thats the immense selfishness of the puritan youd let the whole world perish rather than soil that immaculate self of yours with a single spot of which youd have to be ashamed he said slowly his voice oddly strained and solemn i have never claimed to be immaculate she laughed and what is it youre being right now youre giving me an honest answer arent you she shrugged her naked shoulders oh darling dont take me seriously im just talking he ground his cigarette into an ashtray he did not answer darling she said i actually came here only because i kept thinking that i had a husband and i wanted to find out what he looked like she studied him as he stood across the room the tall straight taut lines of his body emphasized by the single color of the dark blue pajamas youre very attractive she said you look so much betterthese last few months younger should i say happier you look less tense oh i know youre rushed more than ever and you act like a commander in an air raid but thats only the surface youre less tenseinside he looked at her astonished it was true he had not known it had not admitted it to himself he wondered at her power of observation she had seen little of him in these last few months he had not entered her bedroom since his return from colorado he had thought that she would welcome their isolation from each other now he wondered what motive could have made her so sensitive to a change in himunless it was a feeling much greater than he had ever suspected her of experiencing i was not aware of it he said its quite becoming dearand astonishing since youve been having such a terribly difficult time he wondered whether this was intended as a question she paused as if waiting for an answer but she did not press it and went on gaily i know youre having all sorts of trouble at the millsand then the political situation is getting to be ominous isnt it if they pass those laws theyre talking about it will hit you pretty hard wont it yes it will but that is a subject which is of no interest to you lillian is it oh but it is she raised her head and looked straight at him her eyes had the blank veiled look he had seen before a look of deliberate mystery and of confidence in his inability to solve it it is of great interest to me though not because of any possible financial losses she added softly he wondered for the first time whether her spite her sarcasm the cowardly manner of delivering insults under the protection of a smile were not the opposite of what he had always taken them to benot a method of torture but a twisted form of despair not a desire to make him suffer but a confession of her own pain a defense for the pride of an unloved wife a secret pleaso that the subtle the hinted the evasive in her manner the thing begging to be understood was not the open malice but the hidden love he thought of it aghast it made his guilt greater than he had ever contemplated if were talking politics henry i had an amusing thought the side you representwhat is that slogan you all use so much the motto youre supposed to stand for the sanctity of contractis that it she saw his swift glance the intentness of his eyes the first response of something she had struck and she laughed aloud go on he said his voice was low it had the sound of a threat darling what forsince you understood me quite well what was it you intended to say his voice was harshly precise and without any color of feeling do you really wish to bring me to the humiliation of complaining its so trite and such a common complaintalthough i did think i had a husband who prides himself on being different from lesser men do you want me to remind you that you once swore to make my happiness the aim of your life and that you cant really say in all honesty whether im happy or unhappy because you havent even inquired whether i exist he felt them as a physical painall the things that came tearing at him impossibly together her words were a plea he thoughtand he felt the dark hot flow of guilt he felt pitythe cold ugliness of pity without affection he felt a dim anger like a voice he tried to choke a voice crying in revulsion why should i deal with her rotten twisted lyingwhy should i accept torture for the sake of pitywhy is it i who should have to take the hopeless burden of trying to spare a feeling she wont admit a feeling i cant know or understand or try to guess if she loves me why doesnt the damn coward say so and let us both face it in the open he heard another louder voice saying evenly dont switch the blame to her thats the oldest trick of all cowardsyoure guiltyno matter what she does its nothing compared to your guiltshes rightit makes you sick doesnt it to know its she whos rightlet it make you sick you damn adultererits she whos right what would make you happy lillian he asked his voice was toneless she smiled leaning back in her chair relaxing she had been watching his face intently oh dear she said as in bored amusement thats the shyster question the loophole the escape clause she got up letting her arms fall with a shrug stretching her body in a limp graceful gesture of helplessness what would make me happy henry that is what you ought to tell me that is what you should have discovered for me i dont know you were to create it and offer it to me that was your trust your obligation your responsibility but you wont be the first man to default on that promise its the easiest of all debts to repudiate oh youd never welsh on a payment for a load of iron ore delivered to you only on a life she was moving casually across the room the greenyellow folds of her skirt coiling in long waves about her i know that claims of this kind are impractical she said i have no mortgage on you no collateral no guns no chains i have no hold on you at all henrynothing but your honor he stood looking at her as if it took all of his effort to keep his eyes directed at her face to keep seeing her to endure the sight what do you want he asked darling there are so many things you could guess by yourself if you really wished to know what i want for instance if you have been avoiding me so blatantly for months wouldnt i want to know the reason i have been very busy she shrugged a wife expects to be the first concern of her husbands existence i didnt know that when you swore to forsake all others it didnt include blast furnaces she came closer and with an amused smile that seemed to mock them both she slipped her arms around him it was the swift instinctive ferocious gesture of a young bridegroom at the unrequested contact of a whorethe gesture with which he tore her arms off his body and threw her aside he stood paralyzed shocked by the brutality of his own reaction she was staring at him her face naked in bewilderment with no mystery no pretense or protection whatever calculations she had made this was a thing she had not expected im sorry lillian he said his voice low a voice of sincerity and of suffering she did not answer im sorry its just that im very tired he added his voice lifeless he was broken by the triple lie one part of which was a disloyalty he could not bear to face it was not the disloyalty to lillian she gave a brief chuckle well if thats the effect your work has on you i may come to approve of it do forgive me i was merely trying to do my duty i thought that you were a sensualist whod never rise above the instincts of an animal in the gutter im not one of those bitches who belong in it she was snapping the words dryly absently without thinking her mind was on a question mark racing over every possible answer it was her last sentence that made him face her suddenly face her simply directly not as one on the defensive any longer lillian what purpose do you live for he asked what a crude question no enlightened person would ever ask it well what is it that enlightened people do with their lives perhaps they do not attempt to do anything that is their enlightenment what do they do with their time they certainly dont spend it on manufacturing plumbing pipes tell me why do you keep making those cracks i know that you feel contempt for the plumbing pipes youve made that clear long ago your contempt means nothing to me why keep repeating it he wondered why this hit her he did not know in what manner but he knew that it did he wondered why he felt with absolute certainty that that had been the right thing to say she asked her voice dry whats the purpose of the sudden questionnaire he answered simply id like to know whether theres anything that you really want if there is id like to give it to you if i can youd like to buy it thats all you knowpaying for things you get off easily dont you no its not as simple as that what i want is nonmaterial what is it you how do you mean that lillian you dont mean it in the gutter sense no not in the gutter sense how then she was at the door she turned she raised her head to look at him and smiled coldly you wouldnt understand it she said and walked out the torture remaining to him was the knowledge that she would never want to leave him and he would never have the right to leavethe thought that he owed her at least the feeble recognition of sympathy of respect for a feeling he could neither understand nor returnthe knowledge that he could summon nothing for her except contempt a strange total unreasoning contempt impervious to pity to reproach to his own pleas for justiceand hardest to bear the proud revulsion against his own verdict against his demand that he consider himself lower than this woman he despised then it did not matter to him any longer it all receded into some outer distance leaving only the thought that he was willing to bear anythingleaving him in a state which was both tension and peacebecause he lay in bed his face pressed to the pillow thinking of dagny of her slender sensitive body stretched beside him trembling under the touch of his fingers he wished she were back in new york if she were he would have gone there now at once in the middle of the night eugene lawson sat at his desk as if it were the control panel of a bomber plane commanding a continent below but he forgot it at times and slouched down his muscles going slack inside his suit as if he were pouting at the world his mouth was the one part of him which he could not pull tight at any time it was uncomfortably prominent in his lean face attracting the eyes of any listener when he spoke the movement ran through his lower lip twisting its moist flesh into extraneous contortions of its own i am not ashamed of it said eugene lawson miss taggart i want you to know that i am not ashamed of my past career as president of the community national bank of madison i havent made any reference to shame said dagny coldly no moral guilt can be attached to me inasmuch as i lost everything i possessed in the crash of that bank it seems to me that i would have the right to feel proud of such a sacrifice i merely wanted to ask you some questions about the twentieth century motor company which i shall be glad to answer any questions i have nothing to hide my conscience is clear if you thought that the subject was embarrassing to me you were mistaken i wanted to inquire about the men who owned the factory at the time when you made a loan to they were perfectly good men they were a perfectly sound riskthough of course i am speaking in human terms not in the terms of cold cash which you are accustomed to expect from bankers i granted them the loan for the purchase of that factory because they needed the money if people needed money that was enough for me need was my standard miss taggart need not greed my father and grandfather built up the community national bank just to amass a fortune for themselves i placed their fortune in the service of a higher ideal i did not sit on piles of money and demand collateral from poor people who needed loans the heart was my collateral of course i do not expect anyone in this materialistic country to understand me the rewards i got were not of a kind that people of your class miss taggart would appreciate the people who used to sit in front of my desk at the bank did not sit as you do miss taggart they were humble uncertain worn with care afraid to speak my rewards were the tears of gratitude in their eyes the trembling voices the blessings the woman who kissed my hand when i granted her a loan she had begged for in vain everywhere else will you please tell me the names of the men who owned the motor factory that factory was essential to the region absolutely essential i was perfectly justified in granting that loan it provided employment for thousands of workers who had no other means of livelihood did you know any of the people who worked in the factory certainly i knew them all it was men that interested me not machines i was concerned with the human side of industry not the cash register side she leaned eagerly across the desk did you know any of the engineers who worked there the engineers no no i was much more democratic than that its the real workers that interested me the common men they all knew me by sight i used to come into the shops and they would wave and shout hello gene thats what they called megene but im sure this is of no interest to you its past history now if you really came to washington in order to talk to me about your railroadhe straightened up briskly the bomberplane pose returningi dont know whether i can promise you any special consideration inasmuch as i must hold the national welfare above any private privileges or interests which didnt come to talk to you about my railroad she said looking at him in bewilderment i have no desire to talk to you about my railroad no he sounded disappointed no i came for information about the motor factory could you possibly recall the names of any of the engineers who worked there i dont believe i ever inquired about their names i wasnt concerned with the parasites of office and laboratory i was concerned with the real workersthe men of calloused hands who keep a factory going they were my friends can you give me a few of their names any names of anyone who worked there my dear miss taggart it was so long ago there were thousands of them how can i remember cant you recall one any one i certainly cannot so many people have always filled my life that i cant be expected to recall individual drops in the ocean were you familiar with the production of that factory with the kind of work they were doingor planning certainly i took a personal interest in all my investments i went to inspect that factory very often they were doing exceedingly well they were accomplishing wonders the workers housing conditions were the best in the country i saw lace curtains at every window and flowers on the window sills every home had a plot of ground for a garden they had built a new schoolhouse for the children did you know anything about the work of the factorys research laboratory yes yes they had a wonderful research laboratory very advanced very dynamic with forward vision and great plans do you remember hearing anything about any plans to produce a new type of motor motor what motor miss taggart i had no time for details my objective was social progress universal prosperity human brotherhood and love love miss taggart that is the key to everything if men learned to love one another it would solve all their problems she turned away not to see the damp movements of his mouth a chunk of stone with egyptian hieroglyphs lay on a pedestal in a corner of the officethe statue of a hindu goddess with six spider arms stood in a nicheand a huge graph of bewildering mathematical detail like the sales chart of a mailorder house hung on the wall therefore if youre thinking of your railroad miss taggartas of course you are in view of certain possible developmentsi must point out to you that although the welfare of the country is my first consideration to which i would not hesitate to sacrifice anyones profits still i have never closed my ears to a plea for mercy and she looked at him and understood what it was that he wanted from her what sort of motive kept him going i dont wish to discuss my railroad she said fighting to keep her voice monotonously flat while she wanted to scream in revulsion anything you have to say on the subject you will please say it to my brother mr james taggart id think that at a time like this you wouldnt want to pass up a rare opportunity to plead your case before have you preserved any records pertaining to the motor factory she sat straight her hands clasped tight together what records i believe i told you that i lost everything i owned when the bank collapsed his body had gone slack once more his interest had vanished but i do not mind it what i lost was mere material wealth i am not the first man in history to suffer for an ideal i was defeated by the selfish greed of those around me i couldnt establish a system of brotherhood and love in just one small state amidst a nation of profitseekers and dollargrubbers it was not my fault but i wont let them beat me i am not to be stopped i am fightingon a wider scalefor the privilege of serving my fellow men records miss taggart the record i left when i departed from madison is inscribed in the hearts of the poor who had never had a chance before she did not want to utter a single unnecessary word but she could not stop herself she kept seeing the figure of the old charwoman scrubbing the steps have you seen that section of the country since she asked its not my fault he yelled its the fault of the rich who still had money but wouldnt sacrifice it to save my bank and the people of wisconsin you cant blame me i lost everything mr lawson she said with effort do you perhaps recall the name of the man who headed the corporation that owned the factory the corporation to which you lent the money it was called amalgamated service wasnt it who was its president oh him yes i remember him his name was lee hunsacker a very worthwhile young man whos taken a terrible beating where is he now do you know his address whyi believe hes somewhere in oregon grangeville oregon my secretary can give you his address but i dont see of what interest miss taggart if what you have in mind is to try to see mr wesley mouch let me tell you that mr mouch attaches a great deal of weight to my opinion in matters affecting such issues as railroads and other i have no desire to see mr mouch she said rising but then i cant understand what really was your purpose in coming here i am trying to find a certain man who used to work for the twentieth century motor company why do you wish to find him i want him to work for my railroad he spread his arms wide looking incredulous and slightly indignant at such a moment when crucial issues hang in the balance you choose to waste your time on looking for some one employee believe me the fate of your railroad depends on mr mouch much more than on any employee you ever find good day she said she had turned to go when he said his voice jerky and high you havent any right to despise me she stopped to look at him i have expressed no opinion i am perfectly innocent since i lost my money since i lost all of my own money for a good cause my motives were pure i wanted nothing for myself ive never sought anything for myself miss taggart i can proudly say that in all of my life i have never made a profit her voice was quiet steady and solemn mr lawson i think i should let you know that of all the statements a man can make that is the one i consider most despicable i never had a chance said lee hunsacker he sat in the middle of the kitchen at a table cluttered with papers he needed a shave his shirt needed laundering it was hard to judge his age the swollen flesh of his face looked smooth and blank untouched by experience the graying hair and filmy eyes looked worn by exhaustion he was fortytwo nobody ever gave me a chance i hope theyre satisfied with what theyve made of me but dont think that i dont know it i know i was cheated out of my birthright dont let them put on any airs about how kind they are theyre a stinking bunch of hypocrites who asked dagny everybody said lee hunsacker people are bastards at heart and its no use pretending otherwise justice huh look at it his arm swept around him a man like me reduced to this beyond the window the light of noon looked like grayish dusk among the bleak roofs and naked trees of a place that was not country and could never quite become a town dusk and dampness seemed soaked into the walls of the kitchen a pile of breakfast dishes lay in the sink a pot of stew simmered on the stove emitting steam with the greasy odor of cheap meat a dusty typewriter stood among the papers on the table the twentieth century motor company said lee hunsacker was one of the most illustrious names in the history of american industry i was the president of that company i owned that factory but they wouldnt give me a chance you were not the president of the twentieth century motor company were you i believe you headed a corporation called amalgamated service yes yes but its the same thing we took over their factory we were going to do just as well as they did better we were just as important who the hell was jed starnes anyway nothing but a backwoods garage mechanicdid you know that thats how he startedwithout any background at all my family once belonged to the new york four hundred my grandfather was a member of the national legislature its not my fault that my father couldnt afford to give me a car of my own when he sent me to school all the other boys had cars my family name was just as good as any of theirs when i went to college he broke off abruptly what newspaper did you say youre from she had given him her name she did not know why she now felt glad that he had not recognized it and why she preferred not to enlighten him i did not say i was from a newspaper she answered j need some information on that motor factory for a private purpose of my own not for publication oh he looked disappointed he went on sullenly as if she were guilty of a deliberate offense against him i thought maybe you came for an advance interview because im writing my autobiography he pointed to the papers on the table and what i intend to tell is plenty i intendoh hell he said suddenly remembering something he rushed to the stove lifted the lid off the pot and went through the motions of stirring the stew hatefully paying no attention to his performance he flung the wet spoon down on the stove letting the grease drip into the gas burners and came back to the table yeah ill write my autobiography if anybody ever gives me a chance he said how can i concentrate on serious work when this is the sort of thing i have to do he jerked his head at the stove friends huh those people think that just because they took me in they can exploit me like a chinese coolie just because i had no other place to go they have it easy those good old friends of mine he never lifts a finger around the house just sits in his store all day a lousy little twobit stationery storecan it compare in importance with the book im writing and she goes out shopping and asks me to watch her damn stew for her she knows that a writer needs peace and concentration but does she care about that do you know what she did today he leaned confidentially across the table pointing at the dishes in the sink she went to the market and left all the breakfast dishes there and said shed do them later i know what she wanted she expected me to do them well ill fool her ill leave them just where they are would you allow me to ask you a few questions about the motor factory dont imagine that that motor factory was the only thing in my life id held many important positions before i was prominently connected at various times with enterprises manufacturing surgical appliances paper containers mens hats and vacuum cleaners of course that sort of stuff didnt give me much scope but the motor factorythat was my big chance that was what id been waiting for how did you happen to acquire it it was meant for me it was my dream come true the factory was shut downbankrupt the heirs of jed starnes had run it into the ground pretty fast i dont know exactly what it was but there had been something goofy going on up there so the company went broke the railroad people closed their branch line nobody wanted the place nobody would bid on it but there it was this great factory with all the equipment all the machinery all the things that had made millions for jed starnes that was the kind of setup i wanted the kind of opportunity i was entitled to so i got a few friends together and we formed the amalgamated service corporation and we scraped up a little money but we didnt have enough we needed a loan to help us out and give us a start it was a perfectly safe bet we were young men embarking on great careers full of eagerness and hope for the future but do you think anybody gave us any encouragement they did not not those greedy entrenched vultures of privilege how were we to succeed in life if nobody would give us a factory we couldnt compete against the little snots who inherit whole chains of factories could we werent we entitled to the same break aw dont let me hear anything about justice i worked like a dog trying to get somebody to lend us the money but that bastard midas mulligan put me through the wringer she sat up straight midas mulligan yeahthe banker who looked like a truck driver and acted it too did you know midas mulligan did i know him im the only man who ever beat himnot that it did me any good at odd moments with a sudden sense of uneasiness she had wonderedas she wondered about the stories of deserted ships found floating at sea or of sourceless lights flashing in the skyabout the disappearance of midas mulligan there was no reason why she felt that she had to solve these riddles except that they were mysteries which had no business being mysteries they could not be causeless yet no known cause could explain them midas mulligan had once been the richest and consequently the most denounced man in the country he had never taken a loss on any investment he made everything he touched turned into gold its because i know what to touch he said nobody could grasp the pattern of his investments he rejected deals that were considered flawlessly safe and he put enormous amounts into ventures that no other banker would handle through the years he had been the trigger that had sent unexpected spectacular bullets of industrial success shooting over the country it was he who had invested in rearden steel at its start thus helping rearden to complete the purchase of the abandoned steel mills in pennsylvania when an economist referred to him once as an audacious gambler mulligan said the reason why youll never get rich is because you think that what i do is gambling it was rumored that one had to observe a certain unwritten rule when dealing with midas mulligan if an applicant for a loan ever mentioned his personal need or any personal feeling whatever the interview ended and he was never given another chance to speak to mr mulligan why yes i can said midas mulligan when he was asked whether he could name a person more evil than the man with a heart closed to pity the man who uses anothers pity for him as a weapon in his long career he had ignored all the public attacks on him except one his first name had been michael when a newspaper columnist of the humanitarian clique nicknamed him midas mulligan and the tag stuck to him as an insult mulligan appeared in court and petitioned for a legal change of his first name to midas the petition was granted in the eyes of his contemporaries he was a man who had committed the one unforgivable sin he was proud of his wealth these were the things dagny had heard about midas mulligan she had never met him seven years ago midas mulligan had vanished he left his home one morning and was never heard from again on the next day the depositors of the mulligan bank in chicago received notices requesting that they withdraw their funds because the bank was closing in the investigations that followed it was learned that mulligan had planned the closing in advance and in minute detail his employees were merely carrying out his instructions it was the most orderly run on a bank that the country ever witnessed every depositor received his money down to the last fraction of interest due all of the banks assets had been sold piecemeal to various financial institutions when the books were balanced it was found that they balanced perfectly to the penny nothing was left over the mulligan bank had been wiped out no clue was ever found to mulligans motive to his personal fate or to the many millions of his personal fortune the man and the fortune vanished as if they had never existed no one had had any warning about his decision and no events could be traced to explain it if he had wished to retirepeople wonderedwhy hadnt he sold his establishment at a huge profit as he could have done instead of destroying it there was nobody to give an answer he had no family no friends his servants knew nothing he had left his home that morning as usual and did not come back that was all there wasdagny had thought uneasily for yearsa quality of the impossible about mulligans disappearance it was as if a new york skyscraper had vanished one night leaving nothing behind but a vacant lot on a street corner a man like mulligan and a fortune such as he had taken along with him could not stay hidden anywhere a skyscraper could not get lost it would be seen rising above any plain or forest chosen for its hiding place were it destroyed even its pile of rubble could not remain unnoticed but mulligan had goneand in the seven years since in the mass of rumors guesses theories sunday supplement stories and eyewitnesses who claimed to have seen him in every part of the world no clue to a plausible explanation had ever been discovered among the stories there was one so preposterously out of character that dagny believed it to be true nothing in mulligans nature could have given anyone ground to invent it it was said that the last person to see him on the spring morning of his disappearance was an old woman who sold flowers on a chicago street corner by the mulligan bank she related that he stopped and bought a bunch of the years first bluebells his face was the happiest face she had ever seen he had the look of a youth starting out into a great unobstructed vision of life lying open before him the marks of pain and tension the sediment of years upon a human face had been wiped off and what remained was only joyous eagerness and peace he picked up the flowers as if on a sudden impulse and he winked at the old woman as if he had some shining joke to share with her he said do you know how much ive always loved itbeing alive she stared at him bewildered and he walked away tossing the flowers like a ball in his handa broad straight figure in a sedate expensive businessmans overcoat going off into the distance against the straight cliffs of office buildings with the spring sun sparkling on their windows midas mulligan was a vicious bastard with a dollar sign stamped on his heart said lee hunsacker in the fumes of the acrid stew my whole future depended upon a miserable halfmillion dollars which was just small change to him bat when i applied for a loan he turned me down flatfor no better reason than that i had no collateral to offer how could i have accumulated any collateral when nobody had ever given me a chance at anything big why did he lend money to others but not to me it was plain discrimination he didnt even care about my feelingshe said that my past record of failures disqualified me for ownership of a vegetable pushcart let alone a motor factory what failures i couldnt help it if a lot of ignorant grocers refused to cooperate with me about the paper containers by what right did he pass judgment on my ability why did my plans for my own future have to depend upon the arbitrary opinion of a selfish monopolist i wasnt going to stand for that i wasnt going to take it lying down i brought suit against him you did what oh yes he said proudly i brought suit im sure it would seem strange in some of your hidebound eastern states but the state of illinois had a very humane very progressive law under which i could sue him i must say it was the first case of its kind but i had a very smart liberal lawyer who saw a way for us to do it it was an economic emergency law which said that people were forbidden to discriminate for any reason whatever against any person in any matter involving his livelihood it was used to protect day laborers and such but it applied to me and my partners as well didnt it so we went to court and we testified about the bad breaks wed all had in the past and i quoted mulligan saying that i couldnt even own a vegetable pushcart and we proved that all the members of the amalgamated service corporation had no prestige no credit no way to make a living and therefore the purchase of the motor factory was our only chance of livelihoodand therefore midas mulligan had no right to discriminate against usand therefore we were entitled to demand a loan from him under the law oh we had a perfect case all right but the man who presided at the trial was judge narragansett one of those oldfashioned monks of the bench who thinks like a mathematician and never feels the human side of anything he just sat there all through the trial like a marble statuelike one of those blindfolded marble statues at the end he instructed the jury to bring in a verdict in favor of midas mulliganand he said some very harsh things about me and my partners but we appealed to a higher courtand the higher court reversed the verdict and ordered mulligan to give us the loan on our terms he had three months in which to comply but before the three months were up something happened that nobody can figure out and he vanished into thin air he and his bank there wasnt an extra penny left of that bank to collect our lawful claim we wasted a lot of money on detectives trying to find himas who didntbut we gave it up nothought dagnyno apart from the sickening feeling it gave her this case was not much worse than any of the other things that midas mulligan had borne for years he had taken many losses under laws of a similar justice under rules and edicts that had cost him much larger sums of money he had borne them and fought and worked the harder it was not likely that this case had broken him what happened to judge narragansett she asked involuntarily and wondered what subconscious connection had made her ask it she knew little about judge narragansett but she had heard and remembered his name because it was a name that belonged so exclusively to the north american continent now she realized suddenly that she had heard nothing about him for years oh he retired said lee hunsacker he did the question was almost a gasp yeah when oh about six months later what did he do after he retired i dont know i dont think anybodys heard from him since he wondered why she looked frightened part of the fear she felt was that she could not name its reason either please tell me about the motor factory she said with effort well eugene lawson of the community national bank in madison finally gave us a loan to buy the factorybut he was just a messy cheapskate he didnt have enough money to see us through he couldnt help us when we went bankrupt it was not our fault we had everything against us from the start how could we run a factory when we had no railroad werent we entitled to a railroad i tried to get them to reopen their branch line but those damn people at taggart trans he stopped say are you by any chance one of those taggarts i am the operating vicepresident of taggart transcontinental for a moment he stared at her in blank stupor she saw the struggle of fear obsequiousness and hatred in his filmy eyes the result was a sudden snarl i dont need any of you big shots dont think im going to be afraid of you dont expect me to beg for a job im not asking favors of anybody i bet youre not used to hear people talk to you this way are you mr hunsacker i will appreciate it very much if you will give me the information i need about the factory youre a little late getting interested whats the matter your conscience bothering you you people let jed starnes grow filthy rich on that factory but you wouldnt give us a break it was the same factory we did everything he did we started right in manufacturing the particular type of motor that had been his biggest moneymaker for years and then some newcomer nobody ever heard of opened a two bit factory down in colorado by the name of nielsen motors and put out a new motor of the same class as the starnes model at half the price we couldnt help that could we it was all right for jed starnes no destructive competitor happened to come up in his time but what were we to do how could we fight this nielsen when nobody had given us a motor to compete with his did you take over the starnes research laboratory yes yes it was there everything was there his staff too oh some of them a lot of them had gone while the factory was closed his research staff they were gone did you hire any research men of your own yes yes somebut let me tell you i didnt have much money to spend on such things as laboratories when i never had enough funds to give me a breathing spell i couldnt even pay the bills i owed for the absolutely essential modernizing and redecorating which id had to do that factory was disgracefully oldfashioned from the standpoint of human efficiency the executive offices had bare plaster walls and a dinky little washroom any modern psychologist will tell you that nobody could do his best in such depressing surroundings i had to have a brighter color scheme in my office and a decent modern bathroom with a stall shower furthermore i spent a lot of money on a new cafeteria and a playroom and rest room for the workers we had to have morale didnt we any enlightened person knows that man is made by the material factors of his background and that a mans mind is shaped by his tools of production but people wouldnt wait for the laws of economic determinism to operate upon us we never had a motor factory before we had to let the tools condition our minds didnt we but nobody gave us time can you tell me about the work of your research staff oh i had a group of very promising young men all of them guaranteed by diplomas from the best universities but it didnt do me any good i dont know what they were doing i think they were just sitting around eating up their salaries who was in charge of your laboratory hell how can i remember that now do you remember any of the names of your research staff do you think i had time to meet every hireling in person did any of them ever mention to you any experiments with a with an entirely new kind of motor what motor let me tell you that an executive of my position does not hang around laboratories i spent most of my time in new york and chicago trying to raise money to keep us going who was the general manager of tie factory a very able fellow by the name of roy cunningham he died last year in an auto accident drunk driving they said can you give me the names and addresses of any of your associates anyone you remember i dont know whats become of them i wasnt in a mood to keep track of that have you preserved any of the factory records i certainly have she sat up eagerly would you let me see them you bet he seemed eager to comply he rose at once and hurried out of the room what he put down before her when he returned was a thick album of clippings it contained his newspaper interviews and his press agents releases i was one of the big industrialists too he said proudly i was a national figure as you can see my life will make a book of deep human significance id have written it long ago if i had the proper tools of production he banged angrily upon his typewriter i cant work on this damn thing it skips spaces how can i get any inspiration and write a best seller with a typewriter that skips spaces thank you mr hunsacker she said i believe this is all you can tell me she rose you dont happen to know what became of the starnes heirs oh they ran for cover after theyd wrecked the factory there were three of them two sons and a daughter last i heard they were hiding their faces out in durance louisiana the last sight she caught of lee hunsacker as she turned to go was his sudden leap to the stove he seized the lid off the pot and dropped it to the floor scorching his fingers and cursing the stew was burned little was left of the starnes fortune and less of the starnes heirs you wont like having to see them miss taggart said the chief of police of durance louisiana he was an elderly man with a slow firm manner and a look of bitterness acquired not in blind resentment but in fidelity to clearcut standards theres all sorts of human beings to see in the world theres murderers and criminal maniacsbut somehow i think these starnes persons are what decent people shouldnt have to see theyre a bad sort miss taggart clammy and bad yes theyre still here in towntwo of them that is the third one is dead suicide that was four years ago its an ugly story he was the youngest of the three eric starnes he was one of those chronic young men who go around whining about their sensitive feelings when theyre well past forty he needed love was his line he was being kept by older women when he could find them then he started running after a girl of sixteen a nice girl who wouldnt have anything to do with him she married a boy she was engaged to eric starnes got into their house on the wedding day and when they came back from church after the ceremony they found him in their bedroom dead messy dead his wrists slashed now i say there might be forgiveness for a man who kills himself quietly who can pass judgment on another mans suffering and on the limit of what he can bear but the man who kills himself making a show of his death in order to hurt somebody the man who gives his life for malicetheres no forgiveness for him no excuse hes rotten clear through and what he deserves is that people spit at his memory instead of feeling sorry for him and hurt as he wanted them to be well that was eric starnes i can tell you where to find the other two if you wish she found gerald starnes in the ward of a flophouse he lay half twisted on a cot his hair was still black but the white stubble of his chin was like a mist of dead weeds over a vacant face he was soggy drunk a pointless chuckle kept breaking his voice when he spoke the sound of a static unfocused malevolence it went bust the great factory thats what happened to it just went up and bust does that bother you madam the factory was rotten everybody is rotten im supposed to beg somebodys pardon but i wont i dont give a damn people get fits trying to keep up the show when its all rot black rot the automobiles the buildings and the souls and it doesnt make any difference one way or another you shouldve seen the kind of literati who turned flipflops when i whistled when i had the dough the professors the poets the intellectuals the worldsavers and the brotherlovers any way i whistled i had lots of fun i wanted to do good but now i dont there isnt any good not any goddamn good in the whole goddamn universe i dont propose to take a bath if i dont feel like it and thats that if you want to know anything about the factory ask my sister my sweet sister who had a trust fund they couldnt touch so she got out of it safe even if shes in the hamburger class now not the filet mignon a la sauce bearnaise but would she give a penny of it to her brother the noble plan that busted was her idea as much as mine but will she give me a penny hah go take a look at the duchess take a look what do i care about the factory it was just a pile of greasy machinery ill sell you all my rights claims and title to itfor a drink im the last of the starnes name it used to be a great namestarnes ill sell it to you you think im a stinking bum but that goes for all the rest of them and for rich ladies like you too i wanted to do good for humanity hah i wish theyd all boil in oil be lots of fun i wish theyd choke what does it matter what does anything matter on the next cot a whitehaired shriveled little tramp turned in his sleep moaning a nickel clattered to the floor out of his rags gerald starnes picked it up and slipped it into his own pocket he glanced at dagny the creases of his face were a malignant smile want to wake him up and start trouble he asked if you do ill say that youre lying the illsmelling bungalow where she found ivy starnes stood on the edge of town by the shore of the mississippi hanging strands of moss and clots of waxy foliage made the thick vegetation look as if it were drooling the too many draperies hanging in the stagnant air of a small room had the same look the smell came from undusted corners and from incense burning in silver jars at the feet of contorted oriental deities ivy starnes sat on a pillow like a baggy buddha her mouth was a tight little crescent the petulant mouth of a child demanding adulationon the spreading pallid face of a woman past fifty her eyes were two lifeless puddles of water her voice had the even dripping monotone of rain i cant answer the kind of questions youre asking my girl the research laboratory the engineers why should i remember anything about them it was my father who was concerned with such matters not i my father was an evil man who cared for nothing but business he had no time for love only for money my brothers and i lived on a different plane our aim was not to produce gadgets but to do good we brought a great new plan into the factory it was eleven years ago we were defeated by the greed the selfishness and the base animal nature of men it was the eternal conflict between spirit and matter between soul and body they would not renounce their bodies which was all we asked of them i do not remember any of those men i do not care to remember the engineers i believe it was they who started the hemophilia yes that is what i said the hemophiliathe slow leakthe loss of blood that cannot be stopped they ran first they deserted us one after another our plan we put into practice that noble historical precept from each according to his ability to each according to his need everybody in the factory from charwomen to president received the same salarythe barest minimum necessary twice a year we all gathered in a mass meeting where every person presented his claim for what he believed to be his needs we voted on every claim and the will of the majority established every persons need and every persons ability the income of the factory was distributed accordingly rewards were based on need and penalties on ability those whose needs were voted to be the greatest received the most those who had not produced as much as the vote said they could were fined and had to pay the fines by working overtime without pay that was our plan it was based on the principle of selflessness it required men to be motivated not by personal gain but by love for their brothers dagny heard a cold implacable voice saying somewhere within her remember itremember it wellit is not often that one can see pure evillook at itrememberand some day youll find the words to name its essence she heard it through the screaming of other voices that cried in helpless violence its nothingive heard it before im hearing it everywhereits nothing but the same old tripewhy cant i stand iti cant stand iti cant stand it whats the matter with you my girl why did you jump up like that why are you shaking what do speak louder i cant hear you how did the plan work out i do not care to discuss it things became very ugly indeed and went fouler every year it has cost me my faith in human nature in four years a plan conceived not by the cold calculations of the mind but by the pure love of the heart was brought to an end in the sordid mess of policemen lawyers and bankruptcy proceedings but i have seen my error and i am free of it i am through with the world of machines manufacturers and money the world enslaved by matter i am learning the emancipation of the spirit as revealed in the great secrets of india the release from bondage to flesh the victory over physical nature the triumph of the spirit over matter through the blinding white glare of anger dagny was seeing a long strip of concrete that had been a road with weeds rising from its cracks and the figure of a man contorted by a hand plow but my girl i said that i do not remember but i do not know their names i do not know any names i do not know what sort of adventurers my father may have had in that laboratory dont you hear me i am not accustomed to being questioned in such manner and dont keep repeating it dont you know any words but engineer dont you hear me at all whats the matter with you ii dont like your face youre leave me alone i dont know who you are ive never hurt you im an old woman dont look at me like that i stand back dont come near me or ill call for help ill oh yes yes i know that one the chief engineer yes he was the head of the laboratory yes william hastings that was his namewilliam hastings i remember he went off to brandon wyoming he quit the day after we introduced the plan he was the second man to quit us no no i dont remember who was the first he wasnt anybody important the woman who opened the door had graying hair and a poised distinguished look of grooming it took dagny a few seconds to realize that her garment was only a simple cotton housedress may i see mr william hastings asked dagny the woman looked at her for the briefest instant of a pause it was an odd glance inquiring and grave may i ask your name i am dagny taggart of taggart transcontinental oh please come in miss taggart i am mrs william hastings the measured tone of gravity went through every syllable of her voice like a warning her manner was courteous but she did not smile it was a modest home in the suburbs of an industrial town bare tree branches cut across the bright cold blue of the sky on the top of the rise that led to the house the walls of the living room were silvergray sunlight hit the crystal stand of a lamp with a white shade beyond an open door a breakfast nook was papered in reddotted white were you acquainted with my husband in business miss taggart no i have never met mr hastings but i should like to speak to him on a matter of business of crucial importance my husband died five years ago miss taggart dagny closed her eyes the dull sinking shock contained the conclusions she did not have to make in words this then had been the man she was seeking and rearden had been right this was why the motor had been left unclaimed on a junk pile im sorry she said both to mrs hastings and to herself the suggestion of a smile on mrs hastings face held sadness but the face had no imprint of tragedy only a grave look of firmness acceptance and quiet serenity mrs hastings would you permit me to ask you a few questions certainly please sit down did you have some knowledge of your husbands scientific work very little none really he never discussed it at home he was at one time chief engineer of the twentieth century motor company yes he had been employed by them for eighteen years i wanted to ask mr hastings about his work there and the reason why he gave it up if you can tell me i would like to know what happened in that factory the smile of sadness and humor appeared fully on mrs hastings face that is what i would like to know myself she said but im afraid i shall never learn it now i know why he left the factory it was because of an outrageous scheme which the heirs of led starnes established there he would not work on such terms or for such people but there was something else ive always felt that something happened at twentieth century motors which he would not tell me im extremely anxious to know any clue you may care to give me i have no clue to it ive tried to guess and given up i cannot understand or explain it but i know that something happened when my husband left twentieth century we came here and he took a job as head of the engineering department of acme motors it was a growing successful concern at the time it gave my husband the kind of work he liked he was not a person prone to inner conflicts he had always been sure of his actions and at peace with himself but for a whole year after we left wisconsin he acted as if he were tortured by something as if he were struggling with a personal problem he could not solve at the end of that year he came to me one morning and told me that he had resigned from acme motors that he was retiring and would not work anywhere else he loved his work it was his whole life yet he looked calm selfconfident and happy for the first time since wed come here he asked me not to question him about the reason of his decision i didnt question him and i didnt object we had this house we had our savings we had enough to live on modestly for the rest of our days i never learned his reason we went on living here quietly and very happily he seemed to feel a profound contentment he had an odd serenity of spirit that i had never seen in him before there was nothing strange in his behavior or activityexcept that at times very rarely he went out without telling me where he went or whom he saw in the last two years of his life he went away for one month each summer he did not tell me where otherwise he lived as he always had he studied a great deal and he spent his time on engineering research of his own working in the basement of our house i dont know what he did with his notes and experimental models i found no trace of them in the basement after his death he died five years ago of a heart ailment from which he had suffered for some time dagny asked hopelessly did you know the nature of his experiments no i know very little about engineering did you know any of his professional friends or coworkers who might have been acquainted with his research no when he was at twentieth century motors he worked such long hours that we had very little time for ourselves and we spent it together we had no social life at all he never brought his associates to the house when he was at twentieth century did he ever mention to you a motor he had designed an entirely new type of motor that could have changed the course of all industry a motor yes yes he spoke of it several times he said it was an invention of incalculable importance but it was not he who had designed it it was the invention of a young assistant of his she saw the expression on dagnys face and added slowly quizzically without reproach merely in sad amusement i see oh im sorry said dagny realizing that her emotion had shot to her face and become a smile as obvious as a cry of relief its quite all right i understand its the inventor of that motor that youre interested in i dont know whether he is still alive but at least i have no reason to think that he isnt id give half my life to know that he isand to find him its as important as that mrs hastings who is he i dont know i dont know his name or anything about him i never knew any of the men on my husbands staff he told me only that he had a young engineer who some day would upturn the world my husband did not care for anything in people except ability i think this was the only man he ever loved he didnt say so but i could tell it just by the way he spoke of this young assistant i rememberthe day he told me that the motor was completedhow his voice sounded when he said and hes only twentysix this was about a month before the death of jed starnes he never mentioned the motor or the young engineer after that you dont know what became of the young engineer no you cant suggest any way to find him no you have no clue no lead to help me learn his name none tell me was that motor extremely valuable more valuable than any estimate i could give you its strange because you see i thought of it once some years after wed left wisconsin and i asked my husband what had become of that invention hed said was so great what would be done with it he looked at me very oddly and answered nothing why he wouldnt tell me can you remember anyone at all who worked at twentieth century anyone who knew that young engineer any friend of his no i wait wait i think i can give you a lead i can tell you where to find one friend of his i dont even know that friends name either but i know his address its an odd story id better explain how it happened one eveningabout two years after wed come heremy husband was going out and i needed our car that night so he asked me to pick him up after dinner at the restaurant of the railroad station he did not tell me with whom he was having dinner when i drove up to the station i saw him standing outside the restaurant with two men one of them was young and tall the other was elderly he looked very distinguished i would still recognize those men anywhere they had the kind of faces one doesnt forget my husband saw me and left them they walked away toward the station platform there was a train coming my husband pointed after the young man and said did you see him thats the boy i told you about the one whos the great maker of motors the one who was and he told you nothing else nothing else this was nine years ago last spring i went to visit my brother who lives in cheyenne one afternoon he took the family out for a long drive we went up into pretty wild country high in the rockies and we stopped at a roadside diner there was a distinguished grayhaired man behind the counter i kept staring at him while he fixed our sandwiches and coffee because i knew that i had seen his face before but could not remember where we drove on we were miles away from the diner when i remembered youd better go there its on route in the mountains west of cheyenne near a small industrial settlement by the lennox copper foundry it seems strange but im certain of it the cook in that diner is the man i saw at the railroad station with my husbands young idol the diner stood on the summit of a long hard climb its glass walls spread a coat of polish over the view of rocks and pines descending in broken ledges to the sunset it was dark below but an even glowing light still remained in the diner as in a small pool left behind by a receding tide dagny sat at the end of the counter eating a hamburger sandwich it was the bestcooked food she had ever tasted the product of simple ingredients and of an unusual skill two workers were finishing their dinner she was waiting for them to depart she studied the man behind the counter he was slender and tall he had an air of distinction that belonged in an ancient castle or in the inner office of a bank but his peculiar quality came from the fact that he made the distinction seem appropriate here behind the counter of a diner he wore a cooks white jacket as if it were a fulldress suit there was an expert competence in his manner of working his movements were easy intelligently economical he had a lean face and gray hair that blended in tone with the cold blue of his eyes somewhere beyond his look of courteous sternness there was a note of humor so faint that it vanished if one tried to discern it the two workers finished paid and departed each leaving a dime for a tip she watched the man as he removed their dishes put the dimes into the pocket of his white jacket wiped the counter working with swift precision then he turned and looked at her it was an impersonal glance not intended to invite conversation but she felt certain that he had long since noted her new york suit her highheeled pumps her air of being a woman who did not waste her time his cold observant eyes seemed to tell her that he knew she did not belong here and that he was waiting to discover her purpose how is business she asked pretty bad theyre going to close the lennox foundry next week so ill have to close soon too and move on his voice was clear impersonally cordial where to havent decided what sort of thing do you have in mind i dont know im thinking of opening a garage if i can find the right spot in some town oh no youre too good at your job to change it you shouldnt want to be anything but a cook a strange fine smile moved the curve of his mouth no he asked courteously no how would you like a job in new york he looked at her astonished im serious i can give you a job on a big railroad in charge of the diningcar department may i ask why you should want to she raised the hamburger sandwich in its white paper napkin theres one of the reasons thank you what are the others t dont suppose youve lived in a big city or youd know how miserably difficult it is to find any competent men for any job whatever i know a little about that well how about it then would you like a job in new york at ten thousand dollars a year no she had been carried away by the joy of discovering and rewarding ability she looked at him silently shocked i dont think you understood me she said i did youre refusing an opportunity of this kind yes but why that is a personal matter why should you work like this when you can have a better job i am not looking for a better job you dont want a chance to rise and make money no why do you insist because i hate to see ability being wasted he said slowly intently so do i something in the way he said it made her feel the bond of some profound emotion which they held in common it broke the discipline that forbade her ever to call for help im so sick of them her voice startled hen it was an involuntary cry im so hungry for any sight of anyone whos able to do whatever it is hes doing she pressed the back of her hand to her eyes trying to dam the outbreak of a despair she had not permitted herself to acknowledge she had not known the extent of it nor how little of her endurance the quest had left her im sorry he said his voice low it sounded not as an apology but as a statement of compassion she glanced up at him he smiled and she knew that the smile was intended to break the bond which he too had felt the smile had a trace of courteous mockery he said but i dont believe that you came all the way from new york just to hunt for railroad cooks in the rockies no i came for something else she leaned forward both forearms braced firmly against the counter feeling calm and in tight control again sensing a dangerous adversary did you know about ten years ago a young engineer who worked for the twentieth century motor company she counted the seconds of a pause she could not define the nature of the way he looked at her except that it was the look of some special attentiveness yes i did he answered could you give me his name and address what for its crucially important that i find him that man of what importance is he he is the most important man in the world really why did you know anything about his work yes did you know that he hit upon an idea of the most tremendous consequence he let a moment pass may i ask who you are dagny taggart im the vicepres yes miss taggart i know who you are he said it with impersonal deference but he looked as if he had found the answer to some special question in his mind and was not astonished any longer then you know that my interest is not idle she said im in a position to give him the chance he needs and im prepared to pay anything he asks may i ask what has aroused your interest in him his motor how did you happen to know about his motor i found a broken remnant of it in the ruins of the twentieth century factory not enough to reconstruct it or to learn how it worked but enough to know that it did work and that its an invention which can save my railroad the country and the economy of the whole world dont ask me to tell you now what trail ive followed trying to trace that motor and to find its inventor thats not of any importance even my life and work are not of any importance to me right now nothing is of any importance except that i must find him dont ask me how i happened to come to you youre the end of the trail tell me his name he had listened without moving looking straight at her the attentiveness of his eyes seemed to take hold of every word and store it carefully away giving her no clue to his purpose he did not move for a long time then he said give it up miss taggart you wont find him what is his name i can tell you nothing about him is he still alive i can tell you nothing what is your name hugh akston through the blank seconds of recapturing her mind she kept telling herself youre hysterical dont be preposterous its just a coincidence of nameswhile she knew in certainty and numb inexplicable terror that this was the hugh akston hugh akston she stammered the philosopher the last of the advocates of reason why yes he answered pleasantly or the first of their return he did not seem startled by her shock but he seemed to find it unnecessary his manner was simple almost friendly as if he felt no need to hide his identity and no resentment at its being discovered i didnt think that any young person would recognize my name or attach any significance to it nowadays he said but but what are you doing here her arm swept at the room this doesnt make sense are you sure what is it a stunt an experiment a secret mission are you studying something for some special purpose no miss taggart im earning my living the words and the voice had the genuine simplicity of truth dr akston i its inconceivable its youre youre a philosopher the greatest philosopher living an immortal name why would you do this because i am a philosopher miss taggart she knew with certaintyeven though she felt as if her capacity for certainty and for understanding were gonethat she would obtain no help from him that questions were useless that he would give her no explanation neither of the inventors fate nor of his own give it up miss taggart he said quietly as if giving proof that he could guess her thoughts as she had known he would it is a hopeless quest the more hopeless because you have no inkling of what an impossible task you have chosen to undertake i would like to spare you the strain of trying to devise some argument trick or plea that would make me give you the information you are seeking take my word for it it cant be done you said im the end of your trail its a blind alley miss taggart do not attempt to waste your money and effort on other more conventional methods of inquiry do not hire detectives they will learn nothing you may choose to ignore my warning but i think that you are a person of high intelligence able to know that i know what i am saying give it up the secret you are trying to solve involves something greatermuch greaterthan the invention of a motor run by atmospheric electricity there is only one helpful suggestion that i can give you by the essence and nature of existence contradictions cannot exist if you find it inconceivable that an invention of genius should be abandoned among ruins and that a philosopher should wish to work as a cook in a dinercheck your premises you will find that one of them is wrong she started she remembered that she had heard this before and that it was francisco who had said it and then she remembered that this man had been one of franciscos teachers as you wish dr akston she said i wont attempt to question you about it but would you permit me to ask you a question on an entirely different subject certainly dr robert stadler once told me that when you were at the patrick henry university you had three students who were your favorites and his three brilliant minds from whom you expected a great future one of them was francisco danconia yes another was ragnar danneskjold incidentallythis is not my questionwho was the third his name would mean nothing to you he is not famous dr stadler said that you and he were rivals over these three students because you both regarded them as your sons rivals he lost them tell me are you proud of the way these three have turned out he looked off into the distance at the dying fire of the sunset on the farthest rocks his face had the look of a father who watches his sons bleeding on a battlefield he answered more proud than i had ever hoped to be it was almost dark he turned sharply took a package of cigarettes from his pocket pulled out one cigarette but stopped remembering her presence as if he had forgotten it for a moment and extended the package to her she took a cigarette and he struck the brief flare of a match then shook it out leaving only two small points of fire in the darkness of a glass room and of miles of mountains beyond it she rose paid her bill and said thank you dr akston i will not molest you with tricks or pleas i will not hire detectives but i think i should tell you that i will not give up i must find the inventor of that motor i will find him not until the day when he chooses to find youas he will when she walked to her car he switched on the lights in the diner she saw the mailbox by the side of the road and noted the incredible fact that the name hugh akston stood written openly across it she had driven far down the winding road and the lights of the diner were long since out of sight when she noticed that she was enjoying the taste of the cigarette he had given her it was different from any she had ever smoked before she held the small remnant to the light of the dashboard looking for the name of the brand there was no name only a trademark stamped in gold on the thin white paper there stood the sign of the dollar she examined it curiously she had never heard of that brand before then she remembered the old man at the cigar stand of the taggart terminal and smiled thinking that this was a specimen for his collection she stamped out the fire and dropped the butt into her handbag train number was lined along the track ready to leave for wyatt junction when she reached cheyenne left her car at the garage where she had rented it and walked out on the platform of the taggart station she had half an hour to wait for the eastbound main liner to new york she walked to the end of the platform and leaned wearily against a lamppost she did not want to be seen and recognized by the station employees she did not want to talk to anyone she needed rest a few people stood in clusters on the halfdeserted platform animated conversations seemed to be going on and newspapers were more prominently in evidence than usual she looked at the lighted windows of train number for a moments relief in the sight of a victorious achievement train number was about to start down the track of the john galt line through the towns through the curves of the mountains past the green signals where people had stood cheering and the valleys where rockets had risen to the summer sky twisted remnants of leaves now hung on the branches beyond the trains roof line and the passengers wore furs and mufflers as they climbed aboard they moved with the casual manner of a daily event with the security of expecting a performance long since taken for granted weve done itshe thoughtthis much at least is done it was the chance conversation of two men somewhere behind her that came beating suddenly against her closed attention but laws shouldnt be passed that way so quickly theyre not laws theyre directives then its illegal its not illegal because the legislature passed a law last month giving him the power to issue directives i dont think directives should be sprung on people that way out of the blue like a punch in the nose well theres no time to palaver when its a national emergency but i dont think its right and it doesnt jibe how is rearden going to do it when it says here why should you worry about rearden hes rich enough he can find a way to do anything then she leaped to the first newsstand in sight and seized a copy of the evening paper it was on the front page wesley mouch top coordinator of the bureau of economic planning and national resources in a surprise move said the paper and in the name of the national emergency had issued a set of directives which were strung in a column down the page the railroads of the country were ordered to reduce the maximum speed of all trains to sixty miles per hourto reduce the maximum length of all trains to sixty carsand to run the same number of trains in every state of a zone composed of five neighboring states the country being divided into such zones for the purpose the steel mills of the country were ordered to limit the maximum production of any metal alloy to an amount equal to the production of other metal alloys by other mills placed in the same classification of plant capacityand to supply a fair share of any metal alloy to all consumers who might desire to obtain it all the manufacturing establishments of the country of any size and nature were forbidden to move from their present locations except when granted a special permission to do so by the bureau of economic planning and national resources to compensate the railroads of the country for the extra costs involved and to cushion the process of readjustment a moratorium on payments of interest and principal on all railroad bondssecured and unsecured convertible and nonconvertiblewas declared for a period of five years to provide the funds for the personnel to enforce these directives a special tax was imposed on the state of colorado as the state best able to assist the needier states to bear the brunt of the national emergency such tax to consist of five per cent of the gross sales of colorados industrial concerns the cry she uttered was one she had never permitted herself before because she made it her pride always to answer it herselfbut she saw a man standing a few steps away she did not see that he was a ragged bum and she uttered the cry because it was the plea of reason and he was a human figure what are we going to do the bum grinned mirthlessly and shrugged who is john galt it was not taggart transcontinental that stood as the focus of terror in her mind it was not the thought of hank rearden tied to a rack pulled in opposite directionsit was ellis wyatt wiping out the rest filling her consciousness leaving no room for words no time for wonder as a glaring answer to the questions she had not begun to ask stood two pictures ellis wyatts implacable figure in front of her desk saying it is now in your power to destroy me i may have to go but if i go ill make sure that i take all the rest of you along with meand the circling violence of ellis wyatts body when he flung a glass to shatter against the wall the only consciousness the pictures left her was the feeling of the approach of some unthinkable disaster and the feeling that she had to outrun it she had to reach ellis wyatt and stop him she did not know what it was that she had to prevent she knew only that she had to stop him and because were she lying crushed under the ruins of a building were she torn by the bomb of an air raid so long as she was still in existence she would know that action is mans foremost obligation regardless of anything he feelsshe was able to run down the platform and to see the face of the stationmaster when she found himshe was able to order hold number for methen to run to the privacy of a telephone booth in the darkness beyond the end of the platform and to give the longdistance operator the number of ellis wyatts house she stood propped up by the walls of the booth her eyes closed and listened to the dead whirl of metal which was the sound of a bell ringing somewhere it brought no answer the bell kept coming in sudden spasms like a drill going through her ear through her body she clutched the receiver as if unheeded it were still a form of contact she wished the bell were louder she forgot that the sound she heard was not the one ringing in his house she did not know that she was screaming ellis dont dont dont iuntil she heard the cold reproving voice of the operator say your party does not answer she sat at the window of a coach of train number and listened to the clicking of the wheels on the rails of rearden metal she sat unresisting swaying with the motion of the train the black luster of the window hid the countryside she did not want to see it was her second run on the john galt line and she tried not to think of the first the bondholders she thought the bondholders of the john galt lineit was to her honor that they had entrusted their money the saving and achievement of years it was on her ability that they had staked it it was on her work that they had relied and on their ownand she had been made to betray them into a looters trap there would be no trains and no lifeblood of freight the john galt line had been only a drainpipe that had permitted jim taggart to make a deal and to drain their wealth unearned into his pocket in exchange for letting others drain his railroadthe bonds of the john galt line which this morning had been the proud guardians of their owners security and future had become in the space of an hour scraps of paper that no one would buy with no value no future no power save the power to close the doors and stop the wheels of the last hope of the countryand taggart transcontinental was not a living plant fed by blood it had worked to produce but a cannibal of the moment devouring the unborn children of greatness the tax on colorado she thought the tax collected from ellis wyatt to pay for the livelihood of those whose job was to tie him and make him unable to live those who would stand on guard to see that he got no trains no tank cars no pipeline of rearden metalellis wyatt stripped of the right of serfdefense left without voice without weapons and worse made to be the tool of his own destruction the supporter of his own destroyers the provider of their food and of their weaponsellis wyatt being choked with his own bright energy turned against him as the nooseellis wyatt who had wanted to tap an unlimited source of shale oil and who spoke of a second renaissance she sat bent over her head on her arms slumped at the ledge of the windowwhile the great curves of the greenblue rail the mountains the valleys the new towns of colorado went by in the darkness unseen the sudden jolt of brakes on wheels threw her upright it was an unscheduled stop and the platform of the small station was crowded with people all looking off in the same direction the passengers around her were pressing to the windows staring she leaped to her feet she ran down the aisle down the steps into the cold wind sweeping the platform in the instant before she saw it and her scream cut the voices of the crowd she knew that she had known that which she was to see in a break between mountains lighting the sky throwing a glow that swayed on the roofs and walls of the station the hill of wyatt oil was a solid sheet of flame later when they told her that ellis wyatt had vanished leaving nothing behind but a board he had nailed to a post at the foot of the hill when she looked at his handwriting on the board she felt as if she had almost known that these would be the words i am leaving it as i found it take over its yours part ii eitheror chapter i the man who belonged on earth dr robert stadler paced his office wishing he would not feel the cold spring had been late in coming beyond the window the dead gray of the hills looked like the smeared transition from the soiled white of the sky to the leaden black of the river once in a while a distant patch of hillside flared into a silveryellow that was almost green then vanished the clouds kept cracking for the width of a single sunray then oozing closed again it was not cold in the office thought dr stadler it was that view that froze the place it was not cold today the chill was in his boneshe thoughtthe stored accumulation of the winter months when he had had to be distracted from his work by an awareness of such a matter as inadequate heating and people had talked about conserving fuel it was preposterous he thought this growing intrusion of the accidents of nature into the affairs of men it had never mattered before if a winter happened to be unusually severe if a flood washed out a section of railroad track one did not spend two weeks eating canned vegetables if an electric storm struck some power station an establishment such as the state science institute was not left without electricity for five days five days of stillness this winter he thought with the great laboratory motors stopped and irretrievable hours wiped out when his staff had been working on problems that involved the heart of the universe he turned angrily away from the windowbut stopped and turned back to it again he did not want to see the book that lay on his desk he wished dr ferris would come he glanced at his watch dr ferris was latean astonishing matterlate for an appointment with himdr floyd ferris the valet of science who had always faced him in a manner that suggested an apology for having but one hat to take off this was outrageous weather for the month of may he thought looking down at the river it was certainly the weather that made him feel as he did not the book he had placed the book in plain view on his desk when he had noted that his reluctance to see it was more than mere revulsion that it contained the element of an emotion never to be admitted he told himself that he had risen from his desk not because the book lay there but merely because he had wanted to move feeling cold he paced the room trapped between the desk and the window he would throw that book in the ash can where it belonged he thought just as soon as he had spoken to dr ferris he watched the patch of green and sunlight on the distant hill the promise of spring in a world that looked as if no grass or bud would ever function again he smiled eagerlyand when the patch vanished he felt a stab of humiliation at his own eagerness at the desperate way he had wanted to hold it it reminded him of that interview with the eminent novelist last winter the novelist had come from europe to write an article about himand he who had once despised interviews had talked eagerly lengthily too lengthily seeing a promise of intelligence in the novelists face feeling a causeless desperate need to be understood the article had come out as a collection of sentences that gave him exorbitant praise and garbled every thought he had expressed closing the magazine he had felt what he was feeling now at the desertion of a sunray all righthe thought turning away from the windowhe would concede that attacks of loneliness had begun to strike him at times but it was a loneliness to which he was entitled it was hunger for the response of some living thinking mind he was so tired of all those people he thought in contemptuous bitterness he dealt with cosmic rays while they were unable to deal with an electric storm he felt the sudden contraction of his mouth like a slap denying him the right to pursue this course of thought he was looking at the book on his desk its glossy jacket was glaring and new it had been published two weeks ago but i had nothing to do with ithe screamed to himself the scream seemed wasted on a merciless silence nothing answered it no echo of forgiveness the title on the books jacket was why do you think you think there was no sound in that courtroom silence within him no pity no voice of defensenothing but the paragraphs which his great memory had reprinted on his brain thought is a primitive superstition reason is an irrational idea the childish notion that we are able to think has been mankinds costliest error what you think you think is an illusion created by your glands your emotions and in the last analysis by the content of your stomach that gray matter youre so proud of is like a mirror in an amusement park which transmits to you nothing but distorted signals from a reality forever beyond your grasp the more certain you feel of your rational conclusions the more certain you are to be wrong your brain being an instrument of distortion the more active the brain the greater the distortion the giants of the intellect whom you admire so much once taught you that the earth was flat and that the atom was the smallest particle of matter the entire history of science is a progression of exploded fallacies not of achievements the more we know the more we learn that we know nothing only the crassest ignoramus can still hold to the oldfashioned notion that seeing is believing that which you see is the first thing to disbelieve a scientist knows that a stone is not a stone at all it is in fact identical with a feather pillow both are only a cloud formation of the same invisible whirling particles but you say you cant use a stone for a pillow well that merely proves your helplessness in the face of actual reality the latest scientific discoveriessuch as the tremendous achievements of dr robert stadlerhave demonstrated conclusively that our reason is incapable of dealing with the nature of the universe these discoveries have led scientists to contradictions which are impossible according to the human mind but which exist in reality nonetheless if you have not yet heard it my dear oldfashioned friends it has now been proved that the rational is the insane do not expect consistency everything is a contradiction of everything else nothing exists but contradictions do not look for common sense to demand sense is the hallmark of nonsense nature does not make sense nothing makes sense the only crusaders for sense are the studious type of adolescent old maid who cant find a boy friend and the oldfashioned shopkeeper who thinks that the universe is as simple as his neat little inventory and beloved cash register let us break the chains of the prejudice called logic are we going to be stopped by a syllogism so you think youre sure of your opinions you cannot be sure of anything are you going to endanger the harmony of your community your fellowship with your neighbors your standing reputation good name and financial securityfor the sake of an illusion for the sake of the mirage of thinking that you think are you going to run risks and court disastersat a precarious time like oursby opposing the existing social order in the name of those imaginary notions of yours which you call your convictions you say that youre sure youre right nobody is right or ever can be you feel that the world around you is wrong you have no means to know it everything is wrong in human eyesso why fight it dont argue accept adjust yourself obey the book was written by dr floyd ferris and published by the state science institute i had nothing to do with it said dr robert stadler he stood still by the side of his desk with the uncomfortable feeling of having missed some beat of time of not knowing how long the preceding moment had lasted he had pronounced the words aloud in a tone of rancorous sarcasm directed at whoever had made him say it he shrugged resting on the belief that selfmockery is an act of virtue the shrug was the emotional equivalent of the sentence youre robert stadler dont act like a highschool neurotic he sat down at his desk and pushed the book aside with the back of his hand dr floyd ferris arrived half an hour late sorry he said but my car broke down again on the way from washington and i had a hell of a time trying to find somebody to fix ittheres getting to be so damn few cars out on the road that half the service stations are closed there was more annoyance than apology in his voice he sat down without waiting for an invitation to do so dr floyd ferris would not have been noticed as particularly handsome in any other profession but in the one he had chosen he was always described as that goodlooking scientist he was six feet tall and fortyfive years old but he managed to look taller and younger he had an air of immaculate grooming and a ballroom grace of motion but his clothes were severe his suits being usually black or midnight blue he had a finely traced mustache and his smooth black hair made the institute office boys say that he used the same shoe polish on both ends of him he did not mind repeating in the tone of a joke on himself that a movie producer once said he would cast him for the part of a titled european gigolo he had begun his career as a biologist but that was forgotten long ago he was famous as the top coordinator of the state science institute dr stadler glanced at him with astonishmentthe lack of apology was unprecedentedand said dryly it seems to me that you are spending a great deal of your time in washington but dr stadler wasnt it you who once paid me the compliment of calling me the watchdog of this institute said dr ferris pleasantly isnt that my most essential duty a few of your duties seem to be accumulating right around this place before i forget it would you mind telling me whats going on here about that oil shortage mess he could not understand why dr ferris face tightened into an injured look you will permit me to say that this is unexpected and unwarranted said dr ferris in that tone of formality which conceals pain and reveals martyrdom none of the authorities involved have found cause for criticism we have just submitted a detailed report on the progress of the work to date to the bureau of economic planning and national resources and mr wesley mouch has expressed himself as satisfied we have done our best on that project we have heard no one else describe it as a mess considering the difficulties of the terrain the hazards of the fire and the fact that it has been only six months since we what are you talking about asked dr stadler the wyatt reclamation project isnt that what you asked me no said dr stadler no i wait a moment let me get this straight i seem to recall something about this institute taking charge of a reclamation project what is it that youre reclaiming oil said dr ferris the wyatt oil fields that was a fire wasnt it in colorado that was wait a moment that was the man who set fire to his own oil wells im inclined to believe that thats a rumor created by public hysteria said dr ferris dryly a rumor with some undesirable unpatriotic implications i wouldnt put too much faith in those newspaper stories personally i believe that it was an accident and that ellis wyatt perished in the fire well who owns those fields now nobodyat the moment there being no will or heirs the government has taken charge of operating the fieldsas a measure of public necessityfor seven years if ellis wyatt does not return within that time he will be considered officially dead well why did they come to youto us for such an unlikely assignment as oil pumping because it is a problem of great technological difficulty requiring the services of the best scientific talent available you see it is a matter of reconstructing the special method of oil extraction that wyatt had employed his equipment is still there though in a dreadful condition some of his processes are known but somehow there is no full record of the complete operation or the basic principle involved that is what we have to rediscover and how is it going the progress is most gratifying we have just been granted a new and larger appropriation mr wesley mouch is pleased with our work so are mr balch of the emergency commission mr anderson of crucial supplies and mr pettibone of consumers protection i do not see what more could be expected of us the project is fully successful have you produced any oil no but we have succeeded in forcing a flow from one of the wells to the extent of six and a half gallons this of course is merely of experimental significance but you must take into consideration the fact that we had to spend three full months just to put out the fire which has now been totallyalmost totallyextinguished we have a much tougher problem than wyatt ever had because he started from scratch while we have to deal with the disfigured wreckage of an act of vicious antisocial sabotage which i mean to say it is a difficult problem but there is no doubt that we will be able to solve it well what i really asked you about was the oil shortage here in the institute the level of temperature maintained in this building all winter was outrageous they told me that they had to conserve oil surely you could have seen to it that the matter of keeping this place adequately supplied with such things as oil was handled more efficiently oh is that what you had in mind dr stadler oh but i am so sorry the words came with a bright smile of relief on dr ferris face his solicitous manner returned do you mean that the temperature was low enough to cause you discomfort i mean that i nearly froze to death but that is unforgivable why didnt they tell me please accept my personal apology dr stadler and rest assured that you will never be inconvenienced again the only excuse i can offer for our maintenance department is that the shortage of fuel was not due to their negligence it wasoh i realize that you would not know about it and such matters should not take up your invaluable attentionbut you see the oil shortage last winter was a nationwide crisis why for heavens sake dont tell me that those wyatt fields were the only source of oil in the country no no but the sudden disappearance of a major supply wrought havoc in the entire oil market so the government had to assume control and impose oil rationing on the country in order to protect the essential enterprises i did obtain an unusually large quota for the instituteand only by the special favor of some very special connectionsbut i feel abjectly guilty if this proved insufficient rest assured that it will not happen again it is only a temporary emergency by next winter we shall have the wyatt fields back in production and conditions will return to normal besides as far as this institute is concerned i made all the arrangements to convert our furnaces to coal and it was to be done next month only the stockton foundry in colorado closed down suddenly without noticethey were casting parts for our furnaces but andrew stockton retired quite unexpectedly and now we have to wait till his nephew reopens the plant i see well i trust that you will take care of it among all your other activities dr stadler shrugged with annoyance it is becoming a little ridiculousthe number of technological ventures that an institution of science has to handle for the government but dr stadler i know i know it cant be avoided by the way what is project x dr ferris eyes shot to him swiftlyan odd bright glance of alertness that seemed startled but not frightened where did you hear about project x dr stadler oh i heard a couple of your younger boys saying something about it with an air of mystery youd expect from amateur detectives they told me it was something very secret thats right dr stadler it is an extremely secret research project which the government has entrusted to us and it is of utmost importance that the newspapers get no word about it whats the x xylophone project xylophone that is a code name of course the work has to do with sound but i am sure that it would not interest you it is a purely technological undertaking yes do spare me the story i have no time for your technological undertakings may i suggest that it would be advisable to refrain from mentioning the words project x to anyone dr stadler oh all right all right i must say i do not enjoy discussions of that kind but of course and i wouldnt forgive myself if i allowed your time to be taken up by such concerns please feel certain that you may safely leave it to me he made a movement to rise now if this was the reason you wanted to see me please believe that i no said dr stadler slowly this was not the reason i wanted to see you dr ferris volunteered no questions no eager offers of service he remained seated merely waiting dr stadler reached over and made the book slide from the corner to the center of his desk with a contemptuous flick of one hand will you tell me please he asked what is this piece of indecency dr ferris did not glance at the book but kept his eyes fixed on stadlers for an inexplicable moment then he leaned back and said with an odd smile i feel honored that you chose to make such an exception for my sake as reading a popular book this little piece has sold twenty thousand copies in two weeks i have read it and i expect an explanation did you find the text confusing dr stadler looked at him in bewilderment do you realize what theme you chose to treat and in what manner the style alone the style the gutter kind of attitudefor a subject of this nature do you think then that the content deserved a more dignified form of presentation the voice was so innocently smooth that dr stadler could not decide whether this was mockery do you realize what youre preaching in this book since you do not seem to approve of it dr stadler id rather have you think that i wrote it innocently this was it thought dr stadler this was the incomprehensible element in ferris manner he had supposed that an indication of his disapproval would be sufficient but ferris seemed to remain untouched by it if a drunken lout could find the power to express himself on paper said dr stadler if he could give voice to his essencethe eternal savage leering his hatred of the mindthis is the sort of book i would expect him to write but to see it come from a scientist under the imprint of this institute but dr stadler this book was not intended to be read by scientists it was written for that drunken lout what do you mean for the general public but good god the feeblest imbecile should be able to see the glaring contradictions in every one of your statements let us put it this way dr stadler the man who doesnt see that deserves to believe all my statements but youve given the prestige of science to that unspeakable stuff it was all right for a disreputable mediocrity like simon pritchett to drool it as some sort of woozy mysticismnobody listened to him but youve made them think its science science youve taken the achievements of the mind to destroy the mind by what right did you use my work to make an unwarranted preposterous switch into another field pull an inapplicable metaphor and draw a monstrous generalization out of what is merely a mathematical problem by what right did you make it sound as if iigave my sanction to that book dr ferris did nothing he merely looked at dr stadler calmly but the calm gave him an air that was almost patronizing now you see dr stadler youre speaking as if this book were addressed to a thinking audience if it were one would have to be concerned with such matters as accuracy validity logic and the prestige of science but it isnt its addressed to the public and you have always been first to believe that the public does not think he paused but dr stadler said nothing this book may have no philosophical value whatever but it has a great psychological value just what is that you see dr stadler people dont want to think and the deeper they get into trouble the less they want to think but by some sort of instinct they feel that they ought to and it makes them feel guilty so theyll bless and follow anyone who gives them a justification for not thinking anyone who makes a virtuea highly intellectual virtueout of what they know to be their sin their weakness and their guilt and you propose to pander to that that is the road to popularity why should you seek popularity dr ferris eyes moved casually to dr stadlers face as if by pure accident we are a public institution he answered evenly supported by public funds so you tell people that science is a futile fraud which ought to be abolished that is a conclusion which could be drawn in logic from my book but that is not the conclusion they will draw and what about the disgrace to the institute in the eyes of the men of intelligence wherever such may be left why should we worry about them dr stadler could have regarded the sentence as conceivable had it been uttered with hatred envy or malice but the absence of any such emotion the casual ease of the voice an ease suggesting a chuckle hit him like a moments glimpse of a realm that could not be taken as part of reality the thing spreading down to his stomach was cold terror did you observe the reactions to my book dr stadler it was received with considerable favor yesand that is what i find impossible to believe he had to speak he had to speak as if this were a civilized discussion he could not allow himself time to know what it was he had felt for a moment i am unable to understand the attention you received in all the reputable academic magazines and how they could permit themselves to discuss your book seriously if hugh akston were around no academic publication would have dared to treat this as a work admissible into the realm of philosophy he is not around dr stadler felt that there were words which he was now called upon to pronounceand he wished he could end this conversation before he discovered what they were on the other hand said dr ferris the ads for my bookoh im sure you wouldnt notice such things as adsquote a letter of high praise which i received from mr wesley mouch who the hell is mr wesley mouch dr ferris smiled in another year even you wont ask that question dr stadler let us put it this way mr mouch is the man who is rationing oilfor the time being then i suggest that you stick to your job deal with mr mouch and leave him the realm of oil furnaces but leave the realm of ideas to me it would be curious to try to formulate the line of demarcation said dr ferris in the tone of an idle academic remark but if were talking about my book why then were talking about the realm of public relations he turned to point solicitously at the mathematical formulas chalked on the blackboard dr stadler it would be disastrous if you allowed the realm of public relations to distract you from the work which you alone on earth are capable of doing it was said with obsequious deference and dr stadler could not tell what made him hear in it the sentence stick to your blackboard he felt a biting irritation and he switched it against himself thinking angrily that he had to get rid of these suspicions public relations he said contemptuously i dont see any practical purpose in your book i dont see what its intended to accomplish dont you dr ferris eyes flickered briefly to his face the sparkle of insolence was too swift to be identified with certainty i cannot permit myself to consider certain things as possible in a civilized society dr stadler said sternly that is admirably exact said dr ferris cheerfully you cannot permit yourself dr ferris rose being first to indicate that the interview was ended please call for me whenever anything occurs in this institute to cause you discomfort dr stadler he said it is my privilege always to be at your service knowing that he had to assert his authority smothering the shameful realization of the sort of substitute he was choosing dr stadler said imperiously in a tone of sarcastic rudeness the next time i call for you youd better do something about that car of yours yes dr stadler i shall make certain never to be late again and i beg you to forgive me dr ferris responded as if playing a part on cue as if he were pleased that dr stadler had learned at last the modern method of communication my car has been causing me a great deal of trouble its falling to pieces and i had ordered a new one sometime ago the best one on the market a hammond convertiblebut lawrence hammond went out of business last week without reason or warning so now im stuck those bastards seem to be vanishing somewhere something will have to be done about it when ferris had gone dr stadler sat at his desk his shoulders shrinking together conscious only of a desperate wish not to be seen by anyone in the fog of the pain which he would not define there was also the desperate feeling that no oneno one of those he valuedwould ever wish to see him again he knew the words which he had not uttered he had not said that he would denounce the book in public and repudiate it in the name of the institute he had not said it because he had been afraid to discover that the threat would leave ferris unmoved that ferris was safe that the word of dr robert stadler had no power any longer and while he told himself that he would consider later the question of making a public protest he knew that he would not make it he picked up the book and let it drop into the wastebasket a face came to his mind suddenly and clearly as if he were seeing the purity of its every line a young face he had not permitted himself to recall for years he thought no he has not read this book he wont see it hes dead he must have died long ago the sharp pain was the shock of discovering simultaneously that this was the man he longed to see more than any other being in the worldand that he had to hope that this man was dead he did not know whywhen the telephone rang and his secretary told him that miss dagny taggart was on the linewhy he seized the receiver with eagerness and noticed that his hand was trembling she would never want to see him again he had thought for over a year he heard her clear impersonal voice asking for an appointment to see him yes miss taggart certainly yes indeed monday morning yeslook miss taggart i have an engagement in new york today i could drop in at your office this afternoon if you wish no no no trouble at all ill be delighted this afternoon miss taggart about twoi mean about four oclock he had no engagement in new york he did not give himself time to know what had prompted him to do it he was smiling eagerly looking at a patch of sunlight on a distant hill dagny drew a black line across train number on the schedule and felt a moments desolate satisfaction in noting that she did it calmly it was an action which she had had to perform many times in the last six months it had been hard at first it was becoming easier the day would come she thought when she would be able to deliver that death stroke even without the small salute of an effort train number was a freight that had earned its living by carrying supplies to hammondsville colorado she knew what steps would come next first the death of the special freightsthen the shrinking in the number of boxcars for hammondsville attached like poor relatives to the rear end of freights bound for other townsthen the gradual cutting of the stops at hammondsville station from the schedules of the passenger trainsthen the day when she would strike hammondsville colorado off the map that had been the progression of wyatt junction and of the town called stockton she knewonce word was received that lawrence hammond had retiredthat it was useless to wait to hope and to wonder whether his cousin his lawyer or a committee of local citizens would reopen the plant she knew it was time to start cutting the schedules it had lasted less than six months after ellis wyatt had gonethat period which a columnist had gleefully called the field day of the little fellow every oil operator in the country who owned three wells and whined that ellis wyatt left him no chance of livelihood had rushed to fill the hole which wyatt had left wide open they formed leagues cooperatives associations they pooled their resources and their letter heads the little fellows day in the sun the columnist had said their sun had been the flames that twisted through the derricks of wyatt oil in its glare they made the kind of fortunes they had dreamed about fortunes requiring no competence or effort then their biggest customers such as power companies who drank oil by the trainful and would make no allowances for human frailty began to convert to coal and the smaller customers who were more tolerant began to go out of businessthe boys in washington imposed rationing on oil and an emergency tax on employers to support the unemployed oil field workersthen a few of the big oil companies closed downthen the little fellows in the sun discovered that a drilling bit which had cost a hundred dollars now cost them five hundred there being no market for oil field equipment and the suppliers having to earn on one drill what they had earned on five or perishthen the pipe lines began to close there being no one able to pay for their upkeepthen the railroads were granted permission to raise their freight rates there being little oil to carry and the cost of running tank trains having crushed two small lines out of existenceand when the sun went down they saw that the operating costs which had once permitted them to exist on their sixtyacre fields had been made possible by the miles of wyatts hillside and had gone in the same coils of smoke not until their fortunes had vanished and their pumps had stopped did the little fellows realize that no business in the country could afford to buy oil at the price it would now take them to produce it then the boys in washington granted subsidies to the oil operators but not all of the oil operators had friends in washington and there followed a situation which no one cared to examine too closely or to discuss andrew stockton had been in the sort of position which most of the businessmen envied the rush to convert to coal had descended upon his shoulders like a weight of gold he had kept his plant working around the clock running a race with next winters blizzards casting parts for coalburning stoves and furnaces there were not many dependable foundries left he had become one of the main pillars supporting the cellars and kitchens of the country the pillar collapsed without warning andrew stockton announced that lie was retiring closed his plant and vanished he left no word on what he wished to be done with the plant or whether his relatives had the right to reopen it there still were cars on the roads of the country but they moved like travelers in the desert who ride past the warning skeletons of horses bleached by the sun they moved past the skeletons of cars that had collapsed on duty and had been left in the ditches by the side of the road people were not buying cars any longer and the automobile factories were closing but there were men still able to get oil by means of friendships that nobody cared to question these men bought cars at any price demanded lights flooded the mountains of colorado from the great windows of the plant where the assembly belts of lawrence hammond poured trucks and cars to the sidings of taggart transcontinental the word that lawrence hammond had retired came when least expected brief and sudden like the single stroke of a bell in a heavy stillness a committee of local citizens was now broadcasting appeals on the radio begging lawrence hammond wherever he was to give them permission to reopen his plant there was no answer she had screamed when ellis wyatt went she had gasped when andrew stockton retired when she heard that lawrence hammond had quit she asked impassively whos next no miss taggart i cant explain it the sister of andrew stockton had told her on her last trip to colorado two months ago he never said a word to me and i dont even know whether hes dead or living same as ellis wyatt no nothing special had happened the day before he quit i remember only that some man came to see him on that last evening a stranger id never seen before they talked late into the nightwhen i went to sleep the light was still burning in andrews study people were silent in the towns of colorado dagny had seen the way they walked in the streets past their small drugstores hardware stores and grocery markets as if they hoped that the motions of their jobs would save them from looking ahead at the future she too had walked through those streets trying not to lift her head not to see the ledges of sooted rock and twisted steel which had been the wyatt oil fields they could be seen from many of the towns when she had looked ahead she had seen them in the distance one well on the crest of the hill was still burning nobody had been able to extinguish it she had seen it from the streets a spurt of fire twisting convulsively against the sky as if trying to tear loose she had seen it at night across the distance of a hundred clear black miles from the window of a train a small violent flame waving in the wind people called it wyatts torch the longest train on the john galt line had forty cars the fastest ran at fifty miles an hour the engines had to be spared they were coal burning engines long past their age of retirement jim obtained the oil for the diesels that pulled the comet and a few of their transcontinental freights the only source of fuel she could count on and deal with was ken danagger of danagger coal in pennsylvania empty trains clattered through the four states that were tied as neighbors to the throat of colorado they carried a few carloads of sheep some corn some melons and an occasional farmer with an overdressed family who had friends in washington jim had obtained a subsidy from washington for every train that was run not as a profit making carrier but as a service of public equality it took every scrap of her energy to keep trains running through the sections where they were still needed in the areas that were still producing but on the balance sheets of taggart transcontinental the checks of jims subsidies for empty trains bore larger figures than the profit brought by the best freight train of the busiest industrial division jim boasted that this had been the most prosperous six months in taggart history listed as profit on the glossy pages of his report to the stockholders was the money he had not earnedthe subsidies for empty trains and the money he did not ownthe sums that should have gone to pay the interest and the retirement of taggart bonds the debt which by the will of wesley mouch he had been permitted not to pay he boasted about the greater volume of freight carried by taggart trains in arizonawhere dan conway had closed the last of the phoenixdurango and retired and in minnesotawhere paul larkin was shipping iron ore by rail and the last of the ore boats on the great lakes had gone out of existence you have always considered moneymaking as such an important virtue jim had said to her with an odd halfsmile well it seems to me that im better at it than you are nobody professed to understand the question of the frozen railroad bonds perhaps because everybody understood it too well at first there had been signs of a panic among the bondholders and of a dangerous indignation among the public then wesley mouch had issued another directive which ruled that people could get their bonds defrozen upon a plea of essential need the government would purchase the bonds if it found the proof of the need satisfactory there were three questions that no one answered or asked what constituted proof what constituted need essentialto whom then it became bad manners to discuss why one man received the grant defreezing his money while another had been refused people turned away in mouthpinched silence if anybody asked a why one was supposed to describe not to explain to catalogue facts not to evaluate them mr smith had been defrozen mr jones had not that was all and when mr jones committed suicide people said well i dont know if hed really needed his money the government would have given it to him but some men arc just greedy one was not supposed to speak about the men who having been refused sold their bonds for onethird of the value to other men who possessed needs which miraculously made thirtythree frozen cents melt into a whole dollar or about a new profession practiced by bright young boys just out of college who called themselves defreezers and offered their services to help you draft your application in the proper modern terms the boys had friends in washington looking at the taggart rail from the platform of some country station she had found herself feeling not the brilliant pride she had once felt but a foggy guilty shame as if some foul kind of rust had grown on the metal and worse as if the rust had a tinge of blood but then in the concourse of the terminal she looked at the statue of nat taggart and thought it was your rail you made it you fought for it you were not stopped by fear or by loathingi wont surrender it to the men of blood and rustand im the only one left to guard it she had not given up her quest for the man who invented the motor it was the only part of her work that made her able to bear the rest it was the only goal in sight that gave meaning to her struggle there were times when she wondered why she wanted to rebuild that motor what forsome voice seemed to ask her because im still alive she answered but her quest had remained futile her two engineers had found nothing in wisconsin she had sent them to search through the country for men who had worked for twentieth century to learn the name of the inventor they had learned nothing she had sent them to search through the files of the patent office no patent for the motor had ever been registered the only remnant of her personal quest was the stub of the cigarette with the dollar sign she had forgotten it until a recent evening when she had found it in a drawer of her desk and given it to her friend at the cigar counter of the concourse the old man had been very astonished as he examined the stub holding it cautiously between two fingers he had never heard of such a brand and wondered how he could have missed it was it of good quality miss taggart the best ive ever smoked he had shaken his head puzzled he had promised to discover where those cigarettes were made and to get her a carton she had tried to find a scientist able to attempt the reconstruction of the motor she had interviewed the men recommended to her as the best in their field the first one after studying the remnants of the motor and of the manuscript had declared in the tone of a drill sergeant that the thing could not work had never worked and he would prove that no such motor could ever be made to work the second one had drawled in the tone of an answer to a boring imposition that he did not know whether it could be done or not and did not care to find out the third had said his voice belligerently insolent that he would attempt the task on a tenyear contract at twentyfive thousand dollars a yearafter all miss taggart if you expect to make huge profits on that motor its you who should pay for the gamble of my time the fourth who was the youngest had looked at her silently for a moment and the lines of his face had slithered from blankness into a suggestion of contempt you know miss taggart i dont think that such a motor should ever be made even if somebody did learn how to make it it would be so superior to anything weve got that it would be unfair to lesser scientists because it would leave no field for their achievements and abilities i dont think that the strong should have the right to wound the self esteem of the weak she had ordered him out of her office and had sat in incredulous horror before the fact that the most vicious statement she had ever heard had been uttered in a tone of moral righteousness the decision to speak to dr robert stadler had been her last recourse she had forced herself to call him against the resistance of some immovable point within her that felt like brakes slammed tight she had argued against herself she had thought i deal with men like jim and orren boylehis guilt is less than theirswhy cant i speak to him she had found no answer only a stubborn sense of reluctance only the feeling that of all the men on earth dr robert stadler was the one she must not call as she sat at her desk over the schedules of the john galt line waiting for dr stadler to come she wondered why no firstrate talent had risen in the field of science for years she was unable to look for an answer she was looking at the black line which was the corpse of train number on the schedule before her a train has the two great attributes of life she thought motion and purpose this had been like a living entity but now it was only a number of dead freight cars and engines dont give yourself time to fee she thought dismember the carcass as fast as possible the engines are needed all over the system ken danagger in pennsylvania needs trains more trains if only dr robert stadler said the voice of the interoffice communicator on her desk he came in smiling the smile seemed to underscore his words miss taggart would you care to believe how helplessly glad i am to see you again she did not smile she looked gravely courteous as she answered it was very kind of you to come here she bowed her slender figure standing tautly straight but for the slow formal movement of her head what if i confessed that all i needed was some plausible excuse in order to come would it astonish you i would try not to overtax your courtesy she did not smile please sit down dr stadler he looked brightly around him ive never seen the office of a railroad executive i didnt know it would be so so solemn a place is that in the nature of the job the matter on which id like to ask your advice is far removed from the field of your interests dr stadler you may think it odd that i should call on you please allow me to explain my reason the fact that you wished to call on me is a fully sufficient reason if i can be of any service to you any service whatever i dont know what would please me more at this moment his smile had an attractive quality the smile of a man of the world who used it not to cover his words but to stress the audacity of expressing a sincere emotion my problem is a matter of technology she said in the clear expressionless tone of a young mechanic discussing a difficult assignment i fully realize your contempt for that branch of science i do not expect you to solve my problemit is not the kind of work which you do or care about i should like only to submit the problem to you and then ill have just two questions to ask you i had to call on you because it is a matter that involves someones mind a very great mind andshe spoke impersonally in the manner of rendering exact justiceand you are the only great mind left in this field she could not tell why her words bit him as they did she saw the stillness of his face the sudden earnestness of the eyes a strange earnestness that seemed eager and almost pleading then she heard his voice come gravely as if from under the pressure of some emotion that made it sound simple and humble what is your problem miss taggart she told him about the motor and the place where she had found it she told him that it had proved impossible to learn the name of the inventor she did not mention the details of her quest she handed him photographs of the motor and the remnant of the manuscript she watched him as he read she saw the professional assurance in the swift scanning motion of his eyes at first then the pause then the growing intentness then a movement of his lips which from another man would have been a whistle or a gasp she saw him stop for long minutes and look off as if his mind were racing over countless sudden trails trying to follow them allshe saw him leaf back through the pages then stop then force himself to read on as if he were torn between his eagerness to continue and his eagerness to seize all the possibilities breaking open before his vision she saw his silent excitement she knew that he had forgotten her office her existence everything but the sight of an achievementand in tribute to his being capable of such reaction she wished it were possible for her to like dr robert stadler they had been silent for over an hour when he finished and looked up at her but this is extraordinary he said in the joyous astonished tone of announcing some news she had not expected she wished she could smile in answer and grant him the comradeship of a joy celebrated together but she merely nodded and said coldly yes but miss taggart this is tremendous yes did you say its a matter of technology its more much much more than that the pages where he writes about his converteryou can see what premise hes speaking from he arrived at some new concept of energy he discarded all our standard assumptions according to which his motor would have been impossible he formulated a new premise of his own and he solved the secret of converting static energy into kinetic power do you know what that means do you realize what a feat of pure abstract science he had to perform before he could make his motor who she asked quietly i beg your pardon that was the first of the two questions i wanted to ask you dr stadler can you think of any young scientist you might have known ten years ago who would have been able to do this he paused astonished he had not had time to wonder about that question no he said slowly frowning no i cant think of anyone and thats odd because an ability of this kind couldnt have passed unnoticed anywhere somebody would have called him to my attention they always sent promising young physicists to me did you say you found this in the research laboratory of a plain commercial motor factory yes thats odd what was he doing in such a place designing a motor thats what i mean a man with the genius of a great scientist who chose to be a commercial inventor i find it outrageous he wanted a motor and he quietly performed a major revolution in the science of energy just as a means to an end and he didnt bother to publish his findings but went right on making his motor why did he want to waste his mind on practical appliances perhaps because he liked living on this earth she said involuntarily i beg your pardon no i im sorry dr stadler i did not intend to discuss any irrelevant subject he was looking off pursuing his own course of thought why didnt he come to me why wasnt he in some great scientific establishment where he belonged if he had the brains to achieve this surely he had the brains to know the importance of what he had done why didnt he publish a paper on his definition of energy i can see the general direction hed taken but god damn himthe most important pages are missing the statement isnt here surely somebody around him should have known enough to announce his work to the whole world of science why didnt they how could they abandon just abandon a thing of this kind these are the questions to which i found no answers and besides from the purely practical aspect why was that motor left in a junk pile youd think any greedy fool of an industrialist would have grabbed it in order to make a fortune no intelligence was needed to see its commercial value she smiled for the first timea smile ugly with bitterness she said nothing you found it impossible to trace the inventor he asked completely impossibleso far do you think that he is still alive i have reason to think that he is but i cant be sure suppose i tried to advertise for him no dont but if i were to place ads in scientific publications and have dr ferrishe stopped he saw her glance at him as swiftly as he glanced at her she said nothing but she held his glance he looked away and finished the sentence coldly and firmlyand have dr ferris broadcast on the radio that i wish to see him would he refuse to come yes dr stadler i think he would refuse he was not looking at her she saw the faint tightening of his facial muscles and simultaneously the look of something going slack in the lines of his face she could not tell what sort of light was dying within him nor what made her think of the death of a light he tossed the manuscript down on the desk with a casual contemptuous movement of his wrist those men who do not mind being practical enough to sell their brains for money ought to acquire a little knowledge of the conditions of practical reality he looked at her with a touch of defiance as if waiting for an angry answer but her answer was worse than anger her face remained expressionless as if the truth or falsehood of his convictions were of no concern to her any longer she said politely the second question i wanted to ask you was whether you would be kind enough to tell me the name of any physicist you know who in your judgment would possess the ability to attempt the reconstruction of this motor he looked at her and chuckled it was a sound of pain have you been tortured by it too miss taggart by the impossibility of finding any sort of intelligence anywhere i have interviewed some physicists who were highly recommended to me and i have found them to be hopeless he leaned forward eagerly miss taggart he asked did you call on me because you trusted the integrity of my scientific judgment the question was a naked plea yes she answered evenly i trusted the integrity of your scientific judgment he leaned back he looked as if some hidden smile were smoothing the tension away from his face i wish i could help you he said as to a comrade i most selfishly wish i could help you because you see this has been my hardest problemtrying to find men of talent for my own staff talent hell id be satisfied with just a semblance of promise but the men they send me couldnt be honestly said to possess the potentiality of developing into decent garage mechanics i dont know whether i am getting older and more demanding or whether the human race is degenerating but the world didnt seem to be so barren of intelligence in my youth today if you saw the kind of men ive had to interview youd he stopped abruptly as if at a sudden recollection he remained silent he seemed to be considering something he knew but did not wish to tell her she became certain of it when he concluded brusquely in that tone of resentment which conceals an evasion no i dont know anyone id care to recommend to you this was all i wanted to ask you dr stadler she said thank you for giving me your time he sat silently still for a moment as if he could not bring himself to leave miss taggart he asked could you show me the actual motor itself she looked at him astonished why yes if you wish but its in an underground vault down in our terminal tunnels i dont mind if you wouldnt mind taking me down there i have no special motive its only my personal curiosity i would like to see itthats all when they stood in the granite vault over a glass case containing a shape of broken metal he took off his hat with a slow absent movementand she could not tell whether it was the routine gesture of remembering that he was in a room with a lady or the gesture of baring ones head over a coffin they stood in silence in the glare of a single light refracted from the glass surface to their faces train wheels were clicking in the distance and it seemed at times as if a sudden sharper jolt of vibration were about to awaken an answer from the corpse in the glass case its so wonderful said dr stadler his voice low its so wonderful to see a great new crucial idea which is not mine she looked at him wishing she could believe that she understood him correctly he spoke in passionate sincerity discarding convention discarding concern for whether it was proper to let her hear the confession of his pain seeing nothing but the face of a woman who was able to understand miss taggart do you know the hallmark of the secondrater its resentment of another mans achievement those touchy mediocrities who sit trembling lest someones work prove greater than their ownthey have no inkling of the loneliness that comes when you reach the top the loneliness for an equal for a mind to respect and an achievement to admire they bare their teeth at you from out of their rat holes thinking that you take pleasure in letting your brilliance dim themwhile youd give a year of your life to see a flicker of talent anywhere among them they envy achievement and their dream of greatness is a world where all men have become their acknowledged inferiors they dont know that that dream is the infallible proof of mediocrity because that sort of world is what the man of achievement would not be able to bear they have no way of knowing what he feels when surrounded by inferiorshatred no not hatred but boredom the terrible hopeless draining paralyzing boredom of what account are praise and adulation from men whom you dont respect have you ever felt the longing for someone you could admire for something not to look down at but up to ive felt it all my life she said it was an answer she could not refuse him i know he saidand there was beauty in the impersonal gentleness of his voice i knew it the first time i spoke to you that was why i came today he stopped for the briefest instant but she did not answer the appeal and he finished with the same quiet gentleness well that was why i wanted to see the motor i understand she said softly the tone of her voice was the only form of acknowledgment she could grant him miss taggart he said his eyes lowered looking at the glass case i know a man who might be able to undertake the reconstruction of that motor he would not work for meso he is probably the kind of man you want but by the time he raised his headand before he saw the look of admiration in her eyes the open look he had begged for the look of forgivenesshe destroyed his single moments atonement by adding in a voice of drawingroom sarcasm apparently the young man had no desire to work for the good of society or the welfare of science he told me that he would not take a government job i presume he wanted the bigger salary he could hope to obtain from a private employer he turned away not to see the look that was fading from her face not to let himself know its meaning yes she said her voice hard he is probably the kind of man i want hes a young physicist from the utah institute of technology he said dryly his name is quentin daniels a friend of mine sent him to me a few months ago he came to see me but he would not take the job i offered i wanted him on my staff he had the mind of a scientist i dont know whether he can succeed with your motor but at least he has the ability to attempt it i believe you can still reach him at the utah institute of technology i dont know what hes doing there nowthey closed the institute a year ago thank you dr stadler i shall get in touch with him if if you want me to ill be glad to help him with the theoretical part of it im going to do some work myself starting from the leads of that manuscript id like to find the cardinal secret of energy that its author had found its his basic principle that we must discover if we succeed mr daniels may finish the job as far as your motor is concerned i will appreciate any help you may care to give me dr stadler they walked silently through the dead tunnels of the terminal down the ties of a rusted track under a string of blue lights to the distant glow of the platforms at the mouth of the tunnel they saw a man kneeling on the track hammering at a switch with the unrhythmical exasperation of uncertainty another man stood watching him impatiently well whats the matter with the damn thing asked the watcher dont know youve been at it for an hour yeah how long is it going to take who is john galt dr stadler winced they had gone past the men when he said i dont like that expression i dont either she answered where did it come from nobody knows they were silent then he said i knew a john galt once only he died long ago who was he i used to think that he was still alive but now im certain that he must have died he had such a mind that had he lived the whole world would have been talking of him by now but the whole world is talking of him he stopped still yes he said slowly staring at a thought that had never struck him before yes why the word was heavy with the sound of terror who was he dr stadler why are they talking of him who was he he shook his head with a shudder and said sharply its just a coincidence the name is not uncommon at all its a meaningless coincidence it has no connection with the man i knew that man is dead he did not permit himself to know the full meaning of the words he added he has to be dead the order that lay on his desk was marked confidential emergency priority essential need certified by office of top coordinator for the account of project xand demanded that he sell ten thousand tons of rearden metal to the state science institute rearden read it and glanced up at the superintendent of his mills who stood before him without moving the superintendent had come in and put the order down on his desk without a word i thought youd want to see it he said in answer to reardens glance rearden pressed a button summoning miss ives he handed the order to her and said send this back to wherever it came from tell them that i will not sell any rearden metal to the state science institute gwen ives and the superintendent looked at him at each other and back at him again what he saw in their eyes was congratulation yes mr rearden gwen ives said formally taking the slip as if it were any other kind of business paper she bowed and left the room the superintendent followed rearden smiled faintly in greeting to what they felt he felt nothing about that paper or its possible consequences by a sort of inner convulsionwhich had been like tearing a plug out to cut off the current of his emotionshe had told himself six months ago act first keep the mills going feel later it had made him able to watch dispassionately the working of the fair share law nobody had known how that law was to be observed first he had been told that he could not produce rearden metal in an amount greater than the tonnage of the best special alloy other than steel produced by orren boyle but orren boyles best special alloy was some cracking mixture that no one cared to buy then he had been told that he could produce rearden metal in the amount that orren boyle could have produced if he could have produced it nobody had known how this was to be determined somebody in washington had announced a figure naming a number of tons per year giving no reasons everybody had let it go at that he had not known how to give every consumer who demanded it an equal share of rearden metal the waiting list of orders could not be filled in three years even had he been permitted to work at full capacity new orders were coming in daily they were not orders any longer in the old honorable sense of trade they were demands the law provided that he could be sued by any consumer who failed to receive his fair share of rearden metal nobody had known how to determine what constituted a fair share of what amount then a bright young boy just out of college had been sent to him from washington as deputy director of distribution after many telephone conferences with the capital the boy announced that customers would get five hundred tons of the metal each in the order of the dates of their applications nobody had argued against his figure there was no way to form an argument the figure could have been one pound or one million tons with the same validity the boy had established an office at the rearden mills where four girls took applications for shares of rearden metal at the present rate of the mills production the applications extended well into the next century five hundred tons of rearden metal could not provide three miles of rail for taggart transcontinental it could not provide the bracing for one of ken danaggers coal mines the largest industries reardens best customers were denied the use of his metal but golf clubs made of rearden metal were suddenly appearing on the market as well as coffee pots garden tools and bathroom faucets ken danagger who had seen the value of the metal and had dared to order it against a fury of public opinion was not permitted to obtain it his order had been left unfilled cut off without warning by the new laws mr mowen who had betrayed taggart transcontinental in its most dangerous hour was now making switches of rearden metal and selling them to the atlantic southern rearden looked on his emotions plugged out he turned away without a word when anybody mentioned to him what everybody knew the quick fortunes that were being made on rearden metal well no people said in drawing rooms you mustnt call it a black market because it isnt really nobody is selling the metal illegally theyre just selling their right to it not selling really just pooling their shares he did not want to know the insect intricacy of the deals through which the shares were sold and poolednor how a manufacturer in virginia had produced in two months five thousand tons of castings made of rearden metalnor what man in washington was that manufacturers unlisted partner he knew that their profit on a ton of rearden metal was five times larger than his own he said nothing everybody had a right to the metal except himself the young boy from washingtonwhom the steel workers had nicknamed the wet nursehung around rearden with a primitive astonished curiosity which incredibly was a form of admiration rearden watched him with disgusted amusement the boy had no inkling of any concept of morality it had been bred out of him by his college this had left him an odd frankness naive and cynical at once like the innocence of a savage you despise me mr rearden he had declared once suddenly and without any resentment thats impractical why is it impractical rearden had asked the boy had looked puzzled and had found no answer he never had an answer to any why he spoke in flat assertions he would say about people hes oldfashioned hes unreconstructed hes unadjusted without hesitation or explanation he would also say while being a graduate in metallurgy iron smelting i think seems to require a high temperature he uttered nothing but uncertain opinions about physical natureand nothing but categorical imperatives about men mr rearden he had said once if you feel youd like to hand out more of the metal to friends of yoursi mean in bigger haulsit could be arranged you know why dont we apply for a special permission on the ground of essential need ive got a few friends in washington your friends are pretty important people big businessmen so it wouldnt be difficult to get away with the essential need dodge of course there would be a few expenses for things in washington you know how it is things always occasion expenses what things you understand what i mean no rearden had said i dont why dont you explain it to me the boy had looked at him uncertainly weighed it in his mind then come out with its bad psychology what is you know mr rearden its not necessary to use such words as that as what words are relative theyre only symbols if we dont use ugly symbols we wont have any ugliness why do you want me to say things one way when ive already said them another which way do i want you to say them why do you want me to for the same reason that you dont the boy had remained silent for a moment then had said you know mr rearden there are no absolute standards we cant go by rigid principles weve got to be flexible weve got to adjust to the reality of the day and act on the expediency of the moment run along punk go and try to pour a ton of steel without rigid principles on the expediency of the moment a strange sense which was almost a sense of style made rearden feel contempt for the boy but no resentment the boy seemed to fit the spirit of the events around them it was as if they were being carried back across a long span of centuries to the age where the boy had belonged but he rearden had not instead of building new furnaces thought rearden he was now running a losing race to keep the old ones going instead of starting new ventures new research new experiments in the use of rearden metal he was spending the whole of his energy on a quest for sources of iron ore like the men at the dawn of the iron agehe thoughtbut with less hope he tried to avoid these thoughts he had to stand on guard against his own feelingas if some part of him had become a stranger that had to be kept numb and his will had to be its constant watchful anesthetic that part was an unknown of which he knew only that he must never see its root and never give it voice he had lived through one dangerous moment which he could not allow to return it was the moment whenalone in his office on a winter evening held paralyzed by a newspaper spread on his desk with a long column of directives on the front pagehe had heard on the radio the news of ellis wyatts flaming oil fields then his first reactionbefore any thought of the future any sense of disaster any shock terror or protest had been to burst out laughing he had laughed in triumph in deliverance in a spurting living exultationand the words which he had not pronounced but felt were god bless you ellis whatever youre doing when he had grasped the implications of his laughter he had known that he was now condemned to constant vigilance against himself like the survivor of a heart attack he knew that he had had a warning and that he carried within him a danger that could strike him at any moment he had held it off since then he had kept an even cautious severely controlled pace in his inner steps but it had come close to him for a moment once again when he had looked at the order of the state science institute on his desk it had seemed to him that the glow moving over the paper did not come from the furnaces outside but from the flames of a burning oil field mr rearden said the wet nurse when he heard about the rejected order you shouldnt have done that why not theres going to be trouble what kind of trouble its a government order you cant reject a government order why cant i its an essential need project and secret too its very important what kind of a project is it i dont know its secret then how do you know its important it said so who said so you cant doubt such a thing as that mr rearden why cant but you cant if i cant then that would make it an absolute and you said there arent any absolutes thats different how is it different its the government you mean there arent any absolutes except the government i mean if they say its important then it is why i dont want you to get in trouble mr rearden and youre going to sure as hell you ask too many whys now why do you do that rearden glanced at him and chuckled the boy noticed his own words and grinned sheepishly but he looked unhappy the man who came to see rearden a week later was youngish and slenderish but neither as young nor as slender as he tried to make himself appear he wore civilian clothes and the leather leggings of a traffic cop rearden could not quite get it clear whether he came from the state science institute or from washington i understand that you refused to sell metal to the state science institute mr rearden he said in a soft confidential tone of voice thats right said rearden but wouldnt that constitute a willful disobedience of the law its for you to interpret may i ask your reason my reason is of no interest to you oh but of course it is we are not your enemies mr rearden we want to be fair to you you mustnt be afraid of the fact that you are a big industrialist we wont hold it against you we actually want to be as fair to you as to the lowest day laborer we would like to know your reason print my refusal in the newspapers and any reader will tell you my reason it appeared in all the newspapers a little over a year ago oh no no no why talk of newspapers cant we settle this as a friendly private matter thats up to you we dont want this in the newspapers no no we wouldnt want to hurt you rearden glanced at him and asked why does the state science institute need ten thousand tons of metal what is project x oh that its a very important project of scientific research an undertaking of great social value that may prove of inestimable public benefit but unfortunately the regulations of top policy do not permit me to tell you its nature in fuller detail you know said rearden i could tell youas my reasonthat i do not wish to sell my metal to those whose purpose is kept secret from me i created that metal it is my moral responsibility to know for what purpose i permit it to be used oh but you dont have to worry about that mr rearden we relieve you of the responsibility suppose i dont wish to be relieved of it but but that is an oldfashioned and and purely theoretical attitude i said i could name it as my reason but i wontbecause in this case i have another inclusive reason i would not sell any rearden metal to the state science institute for any purpose whatever good or bad secret or open but why listen said rearden slowly there might be some sort of justification for the savage societies in which a man had to expect that enemies could murder him at any moment and had to defend himself as best he could but there can be no justification for a society in which a man is expected to manufacture the weapons for his own murderers i dont think its advisable to use such words mr rearden i dont think its practical to think in such terms after all the government cannotin the pursuit of wide national policiestake cognizance of your personal grudge against some one particular institution then dont take cognizance of it what do you mean dont come asking my reason but mr rearden we cannot let a refusal to obey the law pass unnoticed what do you expect us to do whatever you wish but this is totally unprecedented nobody has ever refused to sell an essential commodity to the government as a matter of fact the law does not permit you to refuse to sell your metal to any consumer let alone the government well why dont you arrest me then mr rearden this is an amicable discussion why speak of such things as arrests isnt that your ultimate argument against me why bring it up isnt it implied in every sentence of this discussion why name it why not there was no answer arc you trying to hide from me the fact that if it werent for that trump card of yours i wouldnt have allowed you to enter this office but im not speaking of arrests i am i dont understand you mr rearden i am not helping you to pretend that this is any sort of amicable discussion it isnt now do what you please about it there was a strange look on the mans face bewilderment as if he had no conception of the issue confronting him and fear as if he had always had full knowledge of it and had lived in dread of exposure rearden felt a strange excitement he felt as if he were about to grasp something he had never understood as if he were on the trail of some discovery still too distant to know except that it had the most immense importance he had ever glimpsed mr rearden said the man the government needs your metal you have to sell it to us because surely you realize that the governments plans cannot be held up by the matter of your consent a sale said rearden slowly requires the sellers consent he got up and walked to the window ill tell you what you can do he pointed to the siding where ingots of rearden metal were being loaded onto freight cars theres rearden metal drive down there with your truckslike any other looter but without his risk because i wont shoot you as you know i canttake as much of the metal as you wish and go dont try to send me payment i wont accept it dont print out a check to me it wont be cashed if you want that metal you have the guns to seize it go ahead good god mr rearden what would the public think it was an instinctive involuntary cry the muscles of reardens face moved briefly in a soundless laughter both of them had understood the implications of that cry rearden said evenly in the grave unstrained tone of finality you need my help to make it look like a salelike a safe just moral transaction i will not help you the man did not argue he rose to leave he said only you will regret the stand youve taken mr rearden i dont think so said rearden he knew that the incident was not ended he knew also that the secrecy of project x was not the main reason why these people feared to make the issue public he knew that he felt an odd joyous lighthearted selfconfidence he knew that these were the right steps down the trail he had glimpsed dagny lay stretched in an armchair of her living room her eyes closed this day had been hard but she knew that she would see hank rearden tonight the thought of it was like a lever lifting the weight of hours of senseless ugliness away from her she lay still content to rest with the single purpose of waiting quietly for the sound of the key in the lock he had not telephoned her but she had heard that he was in new york today for a conference with producers of copper and he never left the city till next morning nor spent a night in new york that was not hers she liked to wait for him she needed a span of time as a bridge between her days and his nights the hours ahead like all her nights with him would be added she thought to that savings account of ones life where moments of time are stored in the pride of having been lived the only pride of her workday was not that it had been lived but that it had been survived it was wrong she thought it was viciously wrong that one should ever be forced to say that about any hour of ones life but she could not think of it now she was thinking of him of the struggle she had watched through the months behind them his struggle for deliverance she had known that she could help him win but must help him in every way except in words she thought of the evening last winter when he came in took a small package from his pocket and held it out to her saying i want you to have it she opened it and stared in incredulous bewilderment at a pendant made of a single pearshaped ruby that spurted a violent fire on the white satin of the jewelers box it was a famous stone which only a dozen men in the world could properly afford to purchase he was not one of them hank why no special reason i just wanted to see you wear it oh no not a thing of this kind why waste it i go so rarely to occasions where one has to dress when would i ever wear it he looked at her his glance moving slowly from her legs to her face ill show you he said he led her to the bedroom he took off her clothes without a word in the manner of an owner undressing a person whose consent is not required he clasped the pendant on her shoulders she stood naked the stone between her breasts like a sparkling drop of blood do you think a man should give jewelry to his mistress for any purpose but his own pleasure he asked this is the way i want you to wear it only for me i like to look at it its beautiful she laughed it was a soft low breathless sound she could not speak or move only nod silently in acceptance and obedience she nodded several times her hair swaying with the wide circular movement of her head then hanging still as she kept her head bowed to him she dropped down on the bed she lay stretched lazily her head thrown back her arms at her sides palms pressed to the rough texture of the bedspread one leg bent the long line of the other extended across the dark blue linen of the spread the stone glowing like a wound in the semidarkness throwing a star of rays against her skin her eyes were halfclosed in the mocking conscious triumph of being admired but her mouth was halfopen in helpless begging expectation he stood across the room looking at her at her flat stomach drawn in as her breath was drawn at the sensitive body of a sensitive consciousness he said his voice low intent and oddly quiet dagny if some artist painted you as you are now men would come to look at the painting to experience a moment that nothing could give them in their own lives they would call it great art they would not know the nature of what they felt but the painting would show them everythingeven that youre not some classical venus but the vicepresident of a railroad because thats part of iteven what i am because thats part of it too dagny theyd feel it and go away and sleep with the first barmaid in sightand theyd never try to reach what they had felt i wouldnt want to seek it from a painting id want it real id take no pride in any hopeless longing i wouldnt hold a stillborn aspiration id want to have it to make it to live it do you understand oh yes hank understand she said do you my darlingdo you understand it fullyshe thought but did not say it aloud on the evening of a blizzard she came home to find an enormous spread of tropical flowers standing in her living room against the dark glass of windows battered by snowflakes they were stems of hawaiian torch ginger three feet tall their large heads were cones of petals that had the sensual texture of soft leather and the color of blood i saw them in a florists window he told her when he came that night i liked seeing them through a blizzard but theres nothing as wasted as an object in a public window she began to find flowers in her apartment at unpredictable times flowers sent without a card but with the signature of the sender in their fantastic shapes in the violent colors in the extravagant cost he brought her a gold necklace made of small hinged squares that formed a spread of solid gold to cover her neck and shoulders like the collar of a knights armorwear it with a black dress he ordered he brought her a set of glasses that were tall slender blocks of squarecut crystal made by a famous jeweler she watched the way he held one of the glasses when she served him a drinkas if the touch of the texture under his fingers the taste of the drink and the sight of her face were the single form of an indivisible moment of enjoyment i used to see things i liked he said but i never bought them there didnt seem to be much meaning in it there is now he telephoned her at the office one winter morning and said not in the tone of an invitation but in the tone of an executives order were going to have dinner together tonight t want you to dress do you have any sort of blue evening gown wear it the dress she wore was a slender tunic of dusty blue that gave her a look of unprotected simplicity the look of a statue in the blue shadows of a garden under the summer sun what he brought and put over her shoulders was a cape of blue fox that swallowed her from the curve of her chin to the tips of her sandals hank thats preposterousshe laughedits not my kind of thing no he asked drawing her to a mirror the huge blanket of fur made her look like a child bundled for a snowstorm the luxurious texture transformed the innocence of the awkward bundle into the elegance of a perversely intentional contrast into a look of stressed sensuality the fur was a soft brown dimmed by an aura of blue that could not be seen only felt like an enveloping mist like a suggestion of color grasped not by ones eyes but by ones hands as if one felt without contact the sensation of sinking ones palms into the furs softness the cape left nothing to be seen of her except the brown of her hair the bluegray of her eyes the shape of her mouth she turned to him her smile startled and helpless i i didnt know it would look like that i did she sat beside him in his car as he drove through the dark streets of the city a sparkling net of snow flashed into sight once in a while when they went past the lights on the corners she did not ask where they were going she sat low in the scat leaning back looking up at the snowflakes the fur cape was wrapped tightly about her within it her dress felt as light as a nightgown and the feel of the cape was like an embrace she looked at the angular tiers of lights rising through the snowy curtain andglancing at him at the grip of his gloved hands on the wheel at the austere fastidious elegance of the figure in black overcoat and white mufflershe thought that he belonged in a great city among polished sidewalks and sculptured stone the car went down into a tunnel streaked through an echoing tube of tile under the river and rose to the coils of an elevated highway under an open black sky the lights were below them now spread in flat miles of bluish windows of smokestacks slanting cranes red gusts of fire and long dim rays silhouetting the contorted shapes of an industrial district she thought that she had seen him once at his mills with smudges of soot on his forehead dressed in acideaten overalls he had worn them as naturally well as he wore his formal clothes he belonged here tooshe thought looking down at the flats of new jerseyamong the cranes the fires and the grinding clatter of gears when they sped down a dark road through an empty countryside with the strands of snow glittering across their headlightsshe remembered how he had looked in the summer of their vacation dressed in slacks stretched on the ground of a lonely ravine with the grass under his body and the sun on his bare arms he belonged in the countryside she thoughthe belonged everywherehe was a man who belonged on earthand then she thought of the words which were more exact he was a man to whom the earth belonged the man at home on earth and in control why thenshe wonderedshould he have had to carry a burden of tragedy which in silent endurance he had accepted so completely that he had barely known he carried it she knew part of the answer she felt as if the whole answer were close and she would grasp it on some approaching day but she did not want to think of it now because they were moving away from the burdens because within the space of a speeding car they held the stillness of full happiness she moved her head imperceptibly to let it touch his shoulder for a moment the car left the highway and turned toward the lighted squares of distant windows that hung above the snow beyond a grillwork of bare branches then in a soft dim light they sat at a table by a window facing darkness and trees the inn stood on a knoll in the woods it had the luxury of high cost and privacy and an air of beautiful taste suggesting that it had not been discovered by those who sought high cost and notice she was barely aware of the dining room it blended away into a sense of superlative comfort and the only ornament that caught her attention was the glitter of iced branches beyond the glass of the window she sat looking out the blue fur halfslipping off her naked arms and shoulders he watched her through narrowed eyes with the satisfaction of a man studying his own workmanship i like giving things to you he said because you dont need them no and its not that i want you to have them i want you to have them from me that is the way i do need them hank from you do you understand that its nothing but vicious selfindulgence on my part im not doing it for your pleasure but for mine hank the cry was involuntary it held amusement despair indignation and pity if youd given me those things just for my pleasure not yours i would have thrown them in your face yes yes then you wouldand should did you call it your vicious selfindulgence thats what they call it oh yes thats what they call it what do you call it hank i dont know he said indifferently and went on intently i know only that if its vicious then let me be damned for it but thats what i want to do more than anything else on earth she did not answer she sat looking straight at him with a faint smile as if asking him to listen to the meaning of his own words ive always wanted to enjoy my wealth he said i didnt know how to do it i didnt even have time to know how much t wanted to but i knew that all the steel i poured came back to me as liquid gold and the gold was meant to harden into any shape i wished and it was i who had to enjoy it only i couldnt i couldnt find any purpose for it ive found it now its i whove produced that wealth and its i who am going to let it buy for me every kind of pleasure i wantincluding the pleasure of seeing row much im able to pay forincluding the preposterous feat of turning you into a luxury object but im a luxury object that youve paid for long ago she said she was not smiling how by means of the same values with which you paid for your mills she did not know whether he understood it with that full luminous finality which is a thought named in words but she knew that what he felt in that moment was understanding she saw the relaxation of an invisible smile in his eyes ive never despised luxury he said yet ive always despised those who enjoyed it i looked at what they called their pleasures and it seemed so miserably senseless to meafter what i felt at the mills i used to watch steel being poured tons of liquid steel running as i wanted it to where i wanted it and then id go to a banquet and id see people who sat trembling in awe before their own gold dishes and lace tablecloths as if their dining room were the master and they were just objects serving it objects created by their diamond shirt studs and necklaces not the other way around then id run to the sight of the first slag heap i could findand theyd say that i didnt know how to enjoy life because i cared for nothing but business he looked at the dim sculptured beauty of the room and at the people who sat at the tables they sat in a manner of selfconscious display as if the enormous cost of their clothes and the enormous care of their grooming should have fused into splendor but didnt their faces had a look of rancorous anxiety dagny look at those people theyre supposed to be the playboys of life the amusementseekers and luxurylovers they sit there waiting for this place to give them meaning not the other way around but theyre always shown to us as the enjoyers of material pleasures and then were taught that enjoyment of material pleasures is evil enjoyment are they enjoying it isnt there some sort of perversion in what were taught some error thats vicious and very important yes hankvery vicious and very very important they are the playboys while were just tradesmen you and i do you realize that were much more capable of enjoying this place than they can ever hope to be yes he said slowly in the tone of a quotation why have we left it all to fools it should have been ours she looked at him startled he smiled i remember every word you said to me at that party i didnt answer you then because the only answer i had the only thing your words meant to me was an answer that you would hate me for i thought it was that i wanted you he looked at her dagny you didnt intend it then but what you were saying was that you wanted to sleep with me wasnt it yes hank of course he held her eyes then looked away they were silent for a long time he glanced at the soft twilight around them then at the sparkle of two wine glasses on their table dagny in my youth when i was working in the ore mines in minnesota i thought that i wanted to reach an evening like this no that was not what i was working for and i didnt think of it often but once in a while on a winter night when the stars were out and it was very cold when i was tired because i had worked two shifts and wanted nothing on earth except to lie down and fall asleep right there on the mine ledgei thought that some day i would sit in a place like this where one drink of wine would cost more than my days wages and i would have earned the price of every minute of it and of every drop and of every flower on the table and i would sit there for no purpose but my own amusement she asked smiling with your mistress she saw the shot of pain in his eyes and wished desperately that she had not said it with a woman he answered she knew the word he had not pronounced he went on his voice soft and steady when i became rich and saw what the rich did for their amusement i thought that the place i had imagined did not exist i had not even imagined it too clearly i did not know what it would be like only what i would feel i gave up expecting it years ago but i feel it tonight he raised his glass looking at her hank i id give up anything ive ever had in my life except my being a a luxury object of your amusement he saw her hand trembling as she held her glass he said evenly i know it dearest she sat shocked and still he had never used that word before he threw his head back and smiled the most brilliantly gay smile she had ever seen on his face your first moment of weakness dagny he said she laughed and shook her head he stretched his arm across the table and closed his hand over her naked shoulder as if giving her an instants support laughing softly and as if by accident she let her mouth brush against his fingers it kept her face down for the one moment when he could have seen that the brilliance of her eyes was tears when she looked up at him her smile matched hisand the rest of the evening was their celebrationfor all his years since the nights on the mine ledgesfor all her years since the night of her first ball when in desolate longing for an uncaptured vision of gaiety she had wondered about the people who expected the lights and the flowers to make them brilliant isnt there in what were taught some error thats vicious and very importantshe thought of his words as she lay in an armchair of her living room on a dismal evening of spring waiting for him to come just a little farther my darlingshe thoughtlook a little farther and youll be free of that error and of all the wasted pain you never should have had to carry but she felt that she too had not seen the whole of the distance and she wondered what were the steps left for her to discover walking through the darkness of the streets on his way to her apartment rearden kept his hands in his coat pockets and his arms pressed to his sides because he felt that he did not want to touch anything or brush against anyone he had never experienced it before this sense of revulsion that was not aroused by any particular object but seemed to flood everything around him making the city seem sodden he could understand disgust for any one thing and he could fight that thing with the healthy indignation of knowing that it did not belong in the world but this was new to himthis feeling that the world was a loathsome place where he did not want to belong he had held a conference with the producers of copper who had just been garroted by a set of directives that would put them out of existence in another year he had had no advice to give them no solution to offer his ingenuity which had made him famous as the man who would always find a way to keep production going had not been able to discover a way to save them but they had all known that there was no way ingenuity was a virtue of the mindand in the issue confronting them the mind had been discarded as irrelevant long ago its a deal between the boys in washington and the importers of copper one of the men had said mainly danconia copper this was only a small extraneous stab of pain he thought a feeling of disappointment in an expectation he had never had the right to expect he should have known that this was just what a man like francisco danconia would doand he wondered angrily why he felt as if a bright brief flame had died somewhere in a lightless world he did not know whether the impossibility of acting had given him this sense of loathing or whether the loathing had made him lose the desire to act its both he thought a desire presupposes the possibility of action to achieve it action presupposes a goal which is worth achieving if the only goal possible was to wheedle a precarious moments favor from men who held guns then neither action nor desire could exist any longer then could lifehe asked himself indifferently life he thought had been defined as motion mans life was purposeful motion what was the state of a being to whom purpose and motion were denied a being held in chains but left to breathe and to see all the magnificence of the possibilities he could have reached left to scream why and to be shown the muzzle of a gun as sole explanation he shrugged walking on he did not care even to find an answer he observed indifferently the devastation wrought by his own indifference no matter how hard a struggle he had lived through in the past he had never reached the ultimate ugliness of abandoning the will to act in moments of suffering he had never let pain win its one permanent victory he had never allowed it to make him lose the desire for joy he had never doubted the nature of the world or mans greatness as its motive power and its core years ago he had wondered with contemptuous incredulity about the fanatical sects that appeared among men in the dark corners of history the sects who believed that man was trapped in a malevolent universe ruled by evil for the sole purpose of his torture tonight he knew what their vision of the world and their feel of it had been if what he now saw around him was the world in which he lived then he did not want to touch any part of it he did not want to fight it he was an outsider with nothing at stake and no concern for remaining alive much longer dagny and his wish to see her were the only exception left to him the wish remained but in a sudden shock he realized that he felt no desire to sleep with her tonight that desirewhich had never given him a moments rest which had been growing feeding on its own satisfactionwas wiped out it was an odd impotence neither of his mind nor of his body he felt as passionately as he had ever felt it that she was the most desirable woman on earth but what came from it was only a desire to desire her a wish to feel not a feeling the sense of numbness seemed impersonal as if its root were neither in him nor in her as if it were the act of sex that now belonged to a realm which he had left dont get upstay thereits so obvious that youve been waiting for me that i want to look at it longer he said it from the doorway of her apartment seeing her stretched in an armchair seeing the eager little jolt that threw her shoulders forward as she was about to rise he was smiling he notedas if some part of him were watching his reactions with detached curiositythat his smile and his sudden sense of gaiety were real he grasped a feeling that he had always experienced but never identified because it had always been absolute and immediate a feeling that forbade him ever to face her in pain it was much more than the pride of wishing to conceal his suffering it was the feeling that suffering must not be granted recognition in her presence that no form of claim between them should ever be motivated by pain and aimed at pity it was not pity that he brought here or came here to find do you still need proof that im always waiting for you she asked leaning obediently back in her chair her voice was neither tender nor pleading but bright and mocking dagny why is it that most women would never admit that but you do because theyre never sure that they ought to be wanted i am i do admire selfconfidence selfconfidence was only one part of what i said hank whats the whole confidence of my valueand yours he glanced at her as if catching the spark of a sudden thought and she laughed adding i wouldnt be sure of holding a man like orren boyle for instance he wouldnt want me at all you would are you saying he asked slowly that i rose in your estimation when you found that i wanted you of course thats not the reaction of most people to being wanted it isnt most people feel that they rise in their own eyes if others want them i feel that others live up to me if they want me and that is the way you feel too hank about yourselfwhether you admit it or not thats not what i said to you then on that first morninghe thought looking down at her she lay stretched out lazily her face blank but her eyes bright with amusement he knew that she was thinking of it and that she knew he was he smiled but said nothing else as he sat halfstretched on the couch watching her across the room he felt at peaceas if some temporary wall had risen between him and the things he had felt on his way here he told her about his encounter with the man from the state science institute because even though he knew that the event held danger an odd glowing sense of satisfaction still remained from it in his mind he chuckled at her look of indignation dont bother being angry at them he said its no worse than all the rest of what theyre doing every day hank do you want me to speak to dr stadler about it certainly not he ought to stop it he could at least do that much id rather go to jail dr stadler youre not having anything to do with him are you saw him a few days ago why in regard to the motor the motor he said it slowly in a strange way as if the thought of the motor had suddenly brought back to him a realm he had forgotten dagny the man who invented that motor he did exist didnt he why of course what do you mean i mean only that that its a pleasant thought isnt it even if hes dead now he was alive once so alive that he designed that motor whats the matter hank nothing tell me about the motor she told him about her meeting with dr stadler she got up and paced the room while speaking she could not lie still she always felt a surge of hope and of eagerness for action when she dealt with the subject of the motor the first thing he noticed were the lights of the city beyond the window he felt as if they were being turned on one by one forming the great skyline he loved he felt it even though he knew that the lights had been there all the time then he understood that the thing which was returning was within him the shape coming back drop by drop was his love for the city then he knew that it had come back because he was looking at the city past the taut slender figure of a woman whose head was lifted eagerly as at a sight of distance whose steps were a restless substitute for flight he was looking at her as at a stranger he was barely aware that she was a woman but the sight was flowing into a feeling the words for which were this is the world and the core of it this is what made the citythey go together the angular shapes of the buildings and the angular lines of a face stripped of everything but purposethe rising steps of steel and the steps of a being intent upon his goalthis is what they had been all the men who had lived to invent the lights the steel the furnaces the motorsthey were the world they not the men who crouched in dark corners halfbegging halfthreatening boastfully displaying their open sores as their only claim on life and virtueso long as he knew that there existed one man with the bright courage of a new thought could he give up the world to those othersso long as he could find a single sight to give him a liferestoring shot of admiration could he believe that the world belonged to the sores the moans and the gunsthe men who invented motors did exist he would never doubt their reality it was his vision of them that had made the contrastunbearable so that even the loathing was the tribute of his loyalty to them and to that world which was theirs and his darling he said darling like a man awakening suddenly when he noticed that she had stopped speaking whats the matter hank she asked softly nothing except that you shouldnt have called stadler his face was bright with confidence his voice sounded amused protective and gentle she could discover nothing else he looked as he had always looked it was only the note of gentleness that seemed strange and new i kept feeling that i shouldnt have she said but i didnt know why ill tell you why he leaned forward what he wanted from you was a recognition that he was still the dr robert stadler he should have been but wasnt and knew he wasnt he wanted you to grant him your respect in spite of and in contradiction to his actions he wanted you to juggle reality for him so that his greatness would remain but the state science institute would be wiped out as if it had never existedand youre the only one who could do it for him why i because youre the victim she looked at him startled he spoke intently he felt a sudden violent clarity of perception as if a surge of energy were rushing into the activity of sight fusing the halfseen and haftgrasped into a single shape and direction dagny theyre doing something that weve never understood they know something which we dont but should discover i cant see it fully yet but im beginning to see parts of it that looter from the state science institute was scared when i refused to help him pretend that he was just an honest buyer of my metal he was scared way deep of what i dont knowpublic opinion was just his name for it but its not the full name why should he have been scared he has the guns the jails the lawshe could have seized the whole of my mills if he wished and nobody would have risen to defend me and he knew itso why should he have cared what i thought but he did it was i who had to tell him that he wasnt a looter but my customer and friend thats what he needed from me and thats what dr stadler needed from youit was you who had to act as if he were a great man who had never tried to destroy your rail and my metal i dont know what it is that they think they accomplishbut they want us to pretend that we sec the world as they pretend they see it they need some sort of sanction from us i dont know the nature of that sanctionbut dagny i know that if we value our lives we must not give it to them if they put you on a torture rack dont give it to them let them destroy your railroad and my mills but dont give it to them because i know this much i know that thats our only chance she had remained standing still before him looking attentively at the faint outline of some shape she too had tried to grasp yes she said yes i know what youve seen in them ive felt it toobut its only like something brushing past thats gone before i know ive seen it like a touch of cold air and whats left is always the feeling that i should have stopped it i know that youre right i cant understand their game but this much is right we must not see the world as they want us to see it its some sort of fraud very ancient and very vastand the key to break it is to check every premise they teach us to question every precept to she whirled to him at a sudden thought but she cut the motion and the words in the same instant the next words would have been the ones she did not want to say to him she stood looking at him with a slow bright smile of curiosity somewhere within him he knew the thought she would not name but he knew it only in that prenatal shape which has to find its words in the future he did not pause to grasp it nowbecause in the flooding brightness of what he felt another thought which was its predecessor had become clear to him and had been holding him for many minutes past he rose approached her and took her in his arms he held the length of her body pressed to his as if their bodies were two currents rising upward together each to a single point each carrying the whole of their consciousness to the meeting of their lips what she felt in that moment contained as one nameless part of it the knowledge of the beauty in the posture of his body as he held her as they stood in the middle of a room high above the lights of the city what he knew what he had discovered tonight was that his recaptured love of existence had not been given back to him by the return of his desire for herbut that the desire had returned after he had regained his world the love the value and the sense of his worldand that the desire was not an answer to her body but a celebration of himself and of his will to live he did not know it he did not think of it he was past the need of words but in the moment when he felt the response of her body to his he felt also the unadmitted knowledge that that which he had called her depravity was her highest virtuethis capacity of hers to feel the joy of being as he felt it chapter ii the aristocracy of pull the calendar in the sky beyond the window of her office said september dagny leaned wearily across her desk the first light to snap on at the approach of dusk was always the ray that hit the calendar when the whiteglowing page appeared above the roofs it blurred the city hastening the darkness she had looked at that distant page every evening of the months behind her your days are numbered it had seemed to sayas if it were marking a progression toward something it knew but she didnt once it had clocked her race to build the john galt line now it was clocking her race against an unknown destroyer one by one the men who had built new towns in colorado had departed into some silent unknown from which no voice or person had yet returned the towns they had left were dying some of the factories they built had remained ownerless and locked others had been seized by the local authorities the machines in both stood still she had felt as if a dark map of colorado were spread before her like a traffic control panel with a few lights scattered through its mountains one after another the lights had gone out one after another the men had vanished there had been a pattern about it which she felt but could not define she had become able to predict almost with certainty who would go next and when she was unable to grasp the why of the men who had once greeted her descent from the cab of an engine on the platform of wyatt junction only ted nielsen was left still running the plant of nielsen motors ted you wont be the next one to go she had asked him on his recent visit to new york she had asked it trying to smile he had answered grimly i hope not what do you mean you hopearent you sure he had said slowly heavily dagny ive always thought that id rather die than stop working but so did the men whore gone it seems impossible to me that i could ever want to quit but a year ago it seemed impossible that they ever could those men were my friends they knew what their going would do to us the survivors they would not have gone like that without a word leaving to us the added terror of the inexplicableunless they had some reason of supreme importance a month ago roger marsh of marsh electric told me that hed have himself chained to his desk so that he wouldnt be able to leave it no matter what ghastly temptation struck him he was furious with anger at the men whod left he swore to me that hed never do it and if its something that i cant resist he said i swear that ill keep enough of my mind to leave you a letter and give you some hint of what it is so that you wont have to rack your brain in the kind of dread were both feeling now thats what he swore two weeks ago he went he left me no letter dagny i cant tell what ill do when i see itwhatever it was that they saw when they went it seemed to her that some destroyer was moving soundlessly through the country and the lights were dying at his touchsomeone she thought bitterly who had reversed the principle of the twentieth century motor and was now turning kinetic energy into static that was the enemyshe thought as she sat at her desk in the gathering twilightwith whom she was running a race the monthly report from quentin daniels lay on her desk she could not be certain as yet that daniels would solve the secret of the motor but the destroyer she thought was moving swiftly surely at an ever accelerating tempo she wondered whether by the time she rebuilt the motor there would be any world left to use it she had liked quentin daniels from the moment he entered her office on their first interview he was a lanky man in his early thirties with a homely angular face and an attractive smile a hint of the smile remained in his features at all times particularly when he listened it was a look of goodnatured amusement as if he were swiftly and patiently discarding the irrelevant in the words he heard and going straight to the point a moment ahead of the speaker why did you refuse to work for dr stadler she asked the hint of his smile grew harder and more stressed this was as near as he came to showing an emotion the emotion was anger but he answered in his even unhurried drawl you know dr stadler once said that the first word of free scientific inquiry was redundant he seems to have forgotten it well ill just say that governmental scientific inquiry is a contradiction in terms she asked him what position he held at the utah institute of technology night watchman he answered what she gasped night watchman he repeated politely as if she had not caught the words as if there were no cause for astonishment under her questioning he explained that he did not like any of the scientific foundations left in existence that he would have liked a job in the research laboratory of some big industrial concernbut which one of them can afford to undertake any longrange work nowadays and why should theyso when the utah institute of technology was closed for lack of funds he had remained there as night watchman and sole inhabitant of the place the salary was sufficient to pay for his needsand the institutes laboratory was there intact for his own private undisturbed use so youre doing research work of your own thats right for what purpose for my own pleasure what do you intend to do if you discover something of scientific importance or commercial value do you intend to put it to some public use i dont know i dont think so havent you any desire to be of service to humanity i dont talk that kind of language miss taggart i dont think you do either she laughed i think well get along together you and i we will when she had told him the story of the motor when he had studied the manuscript he made no comment but merely said that he would take the job on any terms she named she asked him to choose his own terms she protested in astonishment against the low monthly salary he quoted miss taggart he said if theres something that i wont take its something for nothing i dont know how long you might have to pay me or whether youll get anything at all in return ill gamble on my own mind i wont let anybody else do it i dont collect for an intention but i sure do intend to collect for goods delivered if i succeed thats when ill skin you alive because what i want then is a percentage and its going to be high but its going to be worth your while when he named the percentage he wanted she laughed that is skinning me alive and it will be worth my while okay they agreed that it was to be her private project and that he was to be her private employee neither of them wanted to have to deal with the interference of the taggart research department he asked to remain in utah in his post of watchman where he had all the laboratory equipment and all the privacy he needed the project was to remain confidential between them until and unless he succeeded miss taggart he said in conclusion i dont know how many years it will take me to solve this if ever but i know that if i spend the rest of my life on it and succeed i will die satisfied he added theres only one thing that i want more than to solve it its to meet the man who has once a month since his return to utah she had sent him a check and he had sent her a report on his work it was too early to hope but his reports were the only bright points in the stagnant fog of her days in the office she raised her head as she finished reading his pages the calendar in the distance said september the lights of the city had grown beneath it spreading and glittering she thought of rearden she wished he were in the city she wished she would sec him tonight then noticing the date she remembered suddenly that she had to rush home to dress because she had to attend jims wedding tonight she had not seen jim outside the office for over a year she had not met his fiancee but she had read enough about the engagement in the newspapers she rose from her desk in wearily distasteful resignation it seemed easier to attend the wedding than to bother explaining her absence afterwards she was hurrying across the concourse of the terminal when she heard a voice calling miss taggart with a strange note of urgency and reluctance together it stopped her abruptly she took a few seconds to realize that it was the old man at the cigar stand who had called ive been waiting to catch sight of you for days miss taggart ive been extremely anxious to speak to you there was an odd expression on his face the look of an effort not to look frightened im sorry she said smiling ive been rushing in and out of the building all week and didnt have time to stop he did not smile miss taggart that cigarette with the dollar sign that you gave me some months agowhere did you get it she stood still for a moment im afraid thats a long complicated story she answered have you any way of getting in touch with the person who gave it to you i suppose sothough im not too sure why would he tell you where he got it i dont know what makes you suspect that he wouldnt he hesitated then asked miss taggart what do you do when you have to tell someone something which you know to be impossible she chuckled the man who gave me the cigarette said that in such a case one must check ones premises he did about the cigarette well no not exactly but why what is it you have to tell me miss taggart i have inquired all over the world i have checked every source of information in and about the tobacco industry i have had that cigarette stub put through a chemical analysis there is no plant that manufactures that kind of paper the flavoring elements in that tobacco have never been used in any smoking mixture i could find that cigarette was machinemade but it was not made in any factory i knowand i know them all miss taggart to the best of my knowledge that cigarette was not made anywhere on earth rearden stood by watching absently while the waiter wheeled the dinner table out of his hotel room ken danagger had left the room was halfdark by an unspoken agreement they had kept the lights low during their dinner so that danaggers face would not be noticed and perhaps recognized by the waiters they had had to meet furtively like criminals who could not be seen together they could not meet in their offices or in their homes only in the crowded anonymity of a city in his suite at the wayne falkland hotel there could be a fine of and ten years of imprisonment for each of them if it became known that he had agreed to deliver to danagger four thousand tons of structural shapes of rearden metal they had not discussed that law at their dinner together or their motives or the risk they were taking they had merely talked business speaking clearly and dryly as he always spoke at any conference danagger had explained that half of his original order would be sufficient to brace such tunnels as would cave in if he delayed the bracing much longer and to recondition the mines of the confederated coal company gone bankrupt which he had purchased three weeks ago its an excellent property bat in rotten condition they had a nasty accident there last month cavein and gas explosion forty men killed he had added in the monotone of reciting some impersonal statistical report the newspapers are yelling that coal is now the most crucial commodity in the country they are also yelling that the coal operators are profiteering on the oil shortage one gang in washington is yelling that i am expanding too much and something should be done to stop me because i am becoming a monopoly another gang in washington is yelling that i am not expanding enough and something should be done to let the government seize my mines because i am greedy for profits and unwilling to satisfy the publics need of fuel at my present rate of profit this confederated coal property will bring back the money i spent on itin fortyseven years i have no children i bought it because theres one customer i dont dare leave without coal and thats taggart transcontinental i keep thinking of what would happen if the railroads collapsed he had stopped then added t dont know why i still care about that but i do those people in washington dont seem to have a clear picture of what that would be like i have rearden had said ill deliver the metal when you need the other half of your order let me know ill deliver that too at the end of the dinner danagger had said in the same precise impassive tone the tone of a man who knows the exact meaning of his words if any employee of yours or mine discovers this and attempts private blackmail i will pay it within reason but i will not pay if he has friends in washington if any of those come around then i go to jail then we go together rearden had said standing alone in his halfdarkened room rearden noted that the prospect of going to jail left him blankly indifferent he remembered the time when aged fourteen faint with hunger he would not steal fruit from a sidewalk stand now the possibility of being sent to jailh this dinner was a felonymeant no more to him than the possibility of being run over by a truck an ugly physical accident without any moral significance he thought that he had been made to hide as a guilty secret the only business transaction he had enjoyed in a years workand that he was hiding as a guilty secret his nights with dagny the only hours that kept him alive he felt that there was some connection between the two secrets some essential connection which he had to discover he could not grasp it he could not find the words to name it but he felt that the day when he would find them he would answer every question of his life he stood against the wall his head thrown back his eyes closed and thought of dagny and then he felt that no questions could matter to him any longer he thought that he would see her tonight almost hating it because tomorrow morning seemed so close and then he would have to leave herhe wondered whether he could remain in town tomorrow or whether he should leave now without seeing her so that he could wait so that he could always have it ahead of him the moment of closing his hands over her shoulders and looking down at her face youre going insane he thoughtbut he knew that if she were beside him through every hour of his days it would still be the same he would never have enough of it he would have to invent some senseless form of torture for himself in order to bear ithe knew he would see her tonight and the thought of leaving without it made the pleasure greater a moments torture to underscore his certainty of the hours ahead he would leave the light on in her living room he thought and hold her across the bed and see nothing but the curve of the strip of light running from her waist to her ankle a single line drawing the whole shape of her long slim body in the darkness then he would pull her head into the light to see her face to see it falling back unresisting her hair over his arm her eyes closed the face drawn as in a look of pain her mouth open to him he stood at the wall waiting to let all the events of the day drop away from him to feel free to know that the next span of time was his when the door of his room flew open without warning he did not quite hear or believe it at first he saw the silhouette of a woman then of a bellboy who put down a suitcase and vanished the voice he heard was lillians why henry all alone and in the dark she pressed a light switch by the door she stood there fastidiously groomed wearing a pale beige traveling suit that looked as if she had traveled under glass she was smiling and pulling her gloves off with the air of having reached home are you in for the evening dear she asked or were you going out he did not know how long a time passed before he answered what are you doing here why dont you remember that jim taggart invited us to his wedding its tonight i didnt intend to go to his wedding oh but i did why didnt you tell me this morning before i left to surprise you darling she laughed gaily its practically impossible to drag you to any social function but i thought you might do it like this on the spur of the moment just to go out and have a good time as married couples are supposed to i thought you wouldnt mind ityouve been staying overnight in new york so often he saw the casual glance thrown at him from under the brim of her fashionably tilted hat he said nothing of course i was running a risk she said you might have been taking somebody out to dinner he said nothing or were you perhaps intending to return home tonight no did you have an engagement for this evening no fine she pointed at her suitcase i brought my evening clothes will you bet me a corsage of orchids that i can get dressed faster than you can he thought that dagny would be at her brothers wedding tonight the evening did not matter to him any longer ill take you out if you wish he said but not to that wedding oh but thats where i want to go its the most preposterous event of the season and everybodys been looking forward to it for weeks all my friends i wouldnt miss it for the world there isnt any better show in townnor better publicized its a perfectly ridiculous marriage but just about what youd expect from jim taggart she was moving casually through the room glancing around as if getting acquainted with an unfamiliar place i havent been in new york for years she said not with you that is not on any formal occasion he noticed the pause in the aimless wandering of her eyes a glance that stopped briefly on a filled ashtray and moved on he felt a stab of revulsion she saw it in his face and laughed gaily oh but darling im not relieved im disappointed i did hope id find a few cigarette butts smeared with lipstick he gave her credit for the admission of the spying even if under cover of a joke but something in the stressed frankness of her manner made him wonder whether she was joking for the flash of an instant he felt that she had told him the truth he dismissed the impression because he could not conceive of it as possible im afraid that youll never be human she said so im sure that i have no rival and if i havewhich i doubt darlingi dont think ill worry about it because if its a person whos always available on call without appointmentwell everybody knows what sort of a person that is he thought that he would have to be careful he had been about to slap her face lillian i think you know he said that humor of this kind is more than i can stand oh youre so serious she laughed i keep forgetting it youre so serious about everythingparticularly yourself then she whirled to him suddenly her smile gone she had the strange pleading look which he had seen in her face at times a look that seemed made of sincerity and courage you prefer to be serious henry all right how long do you wish me to exist somewhere in the basement of your life how lonely do you want me to become ive asked nothing of you ive let you live your life as you pleased cant you give me one evening oh i know you hate parties and youll be bored but it means a great deal to me call it empty social vanityi want to appear for once with my husband i suppose you never think of it in such terms but youre an important man youre envied hated respected and feared youre a man whom any woman would be proud to show off as her husband you may say its a low form of feminine ostentation but thats the form of any womans happiness you dont live by such standards but i do cant you give me this much at the price of a few hours of boredom cant you be strong enough to fulfill your obligation and to perform a husbands duty cant you go there not for your own sake but mine not because you want to go but only because i want it dagnyhe thought desperatelydagny who had never said a word about his life at home who had never made a claim uttered a reproach or asked a questionhe could not appear before her with his wife he could not let her see him as the husband being proudly shown offhe wished he could die now in this moment before he committed this actionbecause he knew that he would commit it because he had accepted his secret as guilt and promised himself to take its consequencesbecause he had granted that the right was with lillian and he was able to bear any form of damnation but not able to deny the right when it was claimed of himbecause he knew that the reason for his refusal to go was the reason that gave him no right to refusebecause he heard the pleading cry in his mind oh god lillian anything but that party and he did not allow himself to beg for mercyhe said evenly his voice lifeless and firm all right lillian ill go the wedding veil of rosepoint lace caught on the splintered floor of her tenement bedroom cherryl brooks lifted it cautiously stepping to look at herself in a crooked mirror that hung on the wall she had been photographed here all day as she had been many times in the past two months she still smiled with incredulous gratitude when newspaper people wanted to take her picture but she wished they would not do it so often an aging sob sister who had a drippy love column in print and the bitter wisdom of a policewoman in person had taken cherryl under her protection weeks ago when the girl had first been thrown into press interviews as into a meat grinder today the sob sister had chased the reporters out had snapped all right all right beat it at the neighbors had slammed cherryls door in their faces and had helped her to dress she was to drive cherryl to the wedding she had discovered that there was no one else to do it the wedding veil the white satin gown the delicate slippers and the strand of pearls at her throat had cost five hundred times the price of the entire contents of cherryls room a bed took most of the rooms space and the rest was taken by a chest of drawers one chair and her few dresses hanging behind a faded curtain the huge hoop skirt of the wedding gown brushed against the walls when she moved her slender figure swaying above the skirt in the dramatic contrast of a tight severe longsleeved bodice the gown had been made by the best designer in the city you see when i got the job in the dime store i could have moved to a better room she said to the sob sister in apology but i dont think it matters much where you sleep at night so i saved my money because ill need it for something important in the future she stopped and smiled shaking her head dazedly i thought id need it she said you look fine said the sob sister you cant see much in that alleged mirror but youre okay the way all this happened i i havent had time to catch up with myself but you see jim is wonderful he doesnt mind it that im only a salesgirl from a dime store living in a place like this he doesnt hold it against me uhhuh said the sob sister her face looked grim cherryl remembered the wonder of the first time jim taggart had come here he had come one evening without warning a month after their first meeting when she had given up hope of ever seeing him again she had been miserably embarrassed she had felt as if she were trying to hold a sunrise within the space of a mud puddlebut jim had smiled sitting on her only chair looking at her flushed face and at her room then he had told her to put on her coat and he had taken her to dinner at the most expensive restaurant in the city he had smiled at her uncertainty at her awkwardness at her terror of picking the wrong fork and at the look of enchantment in her eyes she had not known what he thought but he had known that she was stunned not by the place but by his bringing her there that she barely touched the costly food that she took the dinner not as booty from a rich suckeras all the girls he knew would have taken itbut as some shining award she had never expected to deserve he had come back to her two weeks later and then their dates had grown progressively more frequent he would drive up to the dime store at the closing hour and she would see her fellow salesgirls gaping at her at his limousine at the uniformed chauffeur who opened the door for her he would take her to the best night clubs and when he introduced her to his friends he would say miss brooks works in the dime store in madison square she would see the strange expressions on their faces and jim watching them with a hint of mockery in his eyes he wanted to spare her the need of pretense or embarrassment she thought with gratitude he had the strength to be honest and not to care whether others approved of him or not she thought with admiration but she felt an odd burning pain new to her the night she heard some woman who worked for a highbrow political magazine say to her companion at the next table how generous of jim had he wished she would have given him the only kind of payment she could offer in return she was grateful that he did not seek it but she felt as if their relationship was an immense debt and she had nothing to pay it with except her silent worship he did not need her worship she thought there were evenings when he came to take her out but remained in her room instead and talked to her while she listened in silence it always happened unexpectedly with a kind of peculiar abruptness as if he had not intended doing it but something burst within him and he had to speak then he sat slumped on her bed unaware of his surroundings and of her presence yet his eyes jerked to her face once in a while as if he had to be certain that a living being heard him it wasnt for myself it wasnt for myself at allwhy wont they believe me those people i had to grant the unions demands to cut down the trainsand the moratorium on bonds was the only way i could do it so thats why wesley gave it to me for the workers not for myself ah the newspapers said that i was a great example for all businessmen to followa businessman with a sense of social responsibility thats what they said its true isnt it isnt it what was wrong about that moratorium what if we did skip a few technicalities it was for a good purpose everyone agrees that anything you do is good so long as its not for yourself but she wont give me credit for a good purpose she doesnt think anybodys any good except herself my sister is a ruthless conceited bitch who wont take anyones ideas but her own why do they keep looking at me that wayshe and rearden and all those people why are they so sure theyre right if i acknowledge their superiority in the material realm why dont they acknowledge mine in the spiritual they have the brain but i have the heart they have the capacity to produce wealth but i have the capacity to love isnt mine the greater capacity hasnt it been recognized as the greatest through all the centuries of human history why wont they recognize it why are they so sure theyre great and if theyre great and im not isnt that exactly why they should bow to me because im not wouldnt that be an act of true humanity it takes no kindness to respect a man who deserves respectits only a payment which hes earned to give an unearned respect is the supreme gesture of charity but theyre incapable of charity theyre not human they feel no concern for anyones need or weakness no concern and no pity she could understand little of it but she understood that he was unhappy and that somebody had hurt him he saw the pain of tenderness in her face the pain of indignation against his enemies and he saw the glance intended for heroesgiven to him by a person able to experience the emotion behind that glance she did not know why she felt certain that she was the only one to whom he could confess his torture she took it as a special honor as one more gift the only way to be worthy of him she thought was never to ask him for anything he offered her money once and she refused it with such a bright painful flare of anger in her eyes that he did not attempt it again the anger was at herself she wondered whether she had done something to make him think she was that kind of person but she did not want to be ungrateful for his concern or to embarrass him by her ugly poverty she wanted to show him her eagerness to rise and justify his favor so she told him that he could help her if he wished by helping her to find a better job he did not answer in the weeks that followed she waited but he never mentioned the subject she blamed herself she thought that she had offended him that he had taken it as an attempt to use him when he gave her an emerald bracelet she was too shocked to understand trying desperately not to hurt him she pleaded that she could not accept it why not he asked it isnt as if you were a bad woman paying the usual price for it are you afraid that ill start making demands dont you trust me he laughed aloud at her stammering embarrassment he smiled with an odd kind of enjoyment all through the evening when they went to a night club and she wore the bracelet with her shabby black dress he made her wear that bracelet again on the night when he took her to a party a great reception given by mrs cornelias pope if he considered her good enough to bring into the home of his friends she thoughtthe illustrious friends whose names she had seen on the inaccessible mountain peaks that were the society columns of the newspapersshe could not embarrass him by wearing her old dress she spent her years savings on an evening gown of bright green chiffon with a low neckline a belt of yellow roses and a rhinestone buckle when she entered the stern residence with the cold brilliant lights and a terrace suspended over the roofs of skyscrapers she knew that her dress was wrong for the occasion though she could not tell why but she kept her posture proudly straight and she smiled with the courageous trust of a kitten when it sees a hand extended to play people gathered to have a good time would not hurt anyone she thought at the end of an hour her attempt to smile had become a helpless bewildered plea then the smile went as she watched the people around her she saw that the trim confident girls had a nasty insolence of manner when they spoke to jim as if they did not respect him and never had one of them in particular a betty pope the daughter of the hostess kept making remarks to him which cherryl could not understand because she could not believe that she understood them correctly no one had paid any attention to her at first except for a few astonished glances at her gown after a while she saw them looking at her she heard an elderly woman ask jim in the anxious tone of referring to some distinguished family she had missed knowing did you say miss brooks of madison square she saw an odd smile on jims face when he answered making his voice sound peculiarly clear yes the cosmetics counter of raleighs five and ten then she saw some people becoming too polite to her and others moving away in a pointed manner and most of them being senselessly awkward in simple bewilderment and jim watching silently with that odd smile she tried to get out of the way out of their notice as she slipped by along the edge of the room she heard some man say with a shrug well jim taggart is one of the most powerful men in washington at the moment he did not say it respectfully out on the terrace where it was darker she heard two men talking and wondered why she felt certain that they were talking about her one of them said taggart can afford to do it if he pleases and the other said something about the horse of some roman emperor named caligula she looked at the lone straight shaft of the taggart building rising in the distanceand then she thought that she understood these people hated jim because they envied him whatever they were she thought whatever their names and their money none of them had an achievement comparable to his none of them had defied the whole country to build a railroad everybody thought impossible for the first time she saw that she did have something to offer jim these people were as mean and small as the people from whom she had escaped in buffalo he was as lonely as she had always been and the sincerity of her feeling was the only recognition he had found then she walked back into the ballroom cutting straight through the crowd and the only thing left of the tears she had tried to hold back in the darkness of the terrace was the fiercely luminous sparkle of her eyes if he wished to stand by her openly even though she was only a shop girl if he wished to flaunt it if he had brought her here to face the indignation of his friendsthen it was the gesture of a courageous man defying their opinion and she was willing to match his courage by serving as the scarecrow of the occasion but she was glad when it was over when she sat beside him in his car driving home through the darkness she felt a bleak kind of relief her battling defiance ebbed into a strange desolate feeling she tried not to give way to it jim said little he sat looking sullenly out the car window she wondered whether she had disappointed him in some manner on the stoop of her rooming house she said to him forlornly im sorry if i let you down he did not answer for a moment and then he asked what would you say if i asked you to marry me she looked at him she looked around themthere was a filthy mattress hanging on somebodys window sill a pawnshop across the street a garbage pail at the stoop beside themone did not ask such a question in such a place she did not know what it meant and she answered i guess i i havent any sense of humor this is a proposal my dear then this was the way they reached their first kisswith tears running down her face tears unshed at the party tears of shock of happiness of thinking that this should be happiness and of a low desolate voice telling her that this was not the way she would have wanted it to happen she had not thought about the newspapers until the day when jim told her to come to his apartment and she found it crowded with people who had notebooks cameras and flash bulbs when she saw her picture in the papers for the first timea picture of them together jims arm around hershe giggled with delight and wondered proudly whether every person in the city had seen it after a while the delight vanished they kept photographing her at the dimestore counter in the subway on the stoop of the tenement house in her miserable room she would have taken money from jim now and run to hide in some obscure hotel for the weeks of their engagementbut he did not offer it he seemed to want her to remain where she was they printed pictures of jim at his desk in the concourse of the taggart terminal by the steps of his private railway car at a formal banquet in washington the huge spreads of full newspaper pages the articles in magazines the radio voices the newsreels all were a single long sustained screamabout the cinderella girl and the democratic businessman she told herself not to be suspicious when she felt uneasy she told herself not to be ungrateful when she felt hurt she felt it only in a few rare moments when she awakened in the middle of the night and lay in the silence of her room unable to sleep she knew that it would take her years to recover to believe to understand she was reeling through her days like a person with a sunstroke seeing nothing but the figure of jim taggart as she had seen him first on the night of his great triumph listen kid the sob sister said to her when she stood in her room for the last time the lace of the wedding veil streaming like crystal foam from her hair to the blotched planks of the floor you think that if one gets hurt in life its through ones own sinsand thats true in the long run but there are people wholl try to hurt you through the good they see in youknowing that its the good needing it and punishing you for it dont let it break you when you discover that i dont think im afraid she said looking intently straight before her the radiance of her smile melting the earnestness of her glance i have no right to be afraid of anything im too happy you sec i always thought that there wasnt any sense in people saying that all you can do in life is suffer i wasnt going to knuckle down to that and give up i thought that things could happen which were beautiful and very great i didnt expect it to happen to menot so much and so soon but ill try to live up to it money is the root of all evil said james taggart money cant buy happiness love will conquer any barrier and any social distance that may be a bromide boys but thats how i feel he stood under the lights of the ballroom of the waynefalkland hotel in a circle of reporters who had closed about him the moment the wedding ceremony ended he heard the crowd of guests beating like a tide beyond the circle cherryl stood beside him her white gloved hand on the black of his sleeve she was still trying to hear the words of the ceremony not quite believing that she had heard them how do you feel mrs taggart she heard the question from somewhere in the circle of reporters it was like the jolt of returning to consciousness two words suddenly made everything real to her she smiled and whispered choking i im very happy at opposite ends of the ballroom orren boyle who seemed too stout for his fulldress clothes and bertram scudder who seemed too meager for his surveyed the crowd of guests with the same thought though neither of them admitted that he was thinking it orren boyle halftold himself that he was looking for the faces of friends and bertram scudder suggested to himself that he was gathering material for an article but both unknown to each other were drawing a mental chart of the faces they saw classifying them under two headings which if named would have read favor and fear there were men whose presence signified a special protection extended to james taggart and men whose presence confessed a desire to avoid his hostilitythose who represented a hand lowered to pull him up and those who represented a back bent to let him climb by the unwritten code of the day nobody received or accepted an invitation from a man of public prominence except in token of one or the other of these motives those in the first group were for the most part youthful they had come from washington those in the second group were older they were businessmen orren boyle and bertram scudder were men who used words as a public instrument to be avoided in the privacy of ones own mind words were a commitment carrying implications which they did not wish to face they needed no words for their chart the classification was done by physical means a respectful movement of their eyebrows equivalent to the emotion of the word so for the first groupand a sarcastic movement of their lips equivalent to the emotion of well well for the second one face blew up the smooth working of their calculating mechanisms for a moment when they saw the cold blue eyes and blond hair of hank rearden their muscles tore at the register of the second group in the equivalent of oh boy the sum of the chart was an estimate of james taggarts power it added up to an impressive total they knew that james taggart was fully aware of it when they saw him moving among his guests he walked briskly in a morse code pattern of short dashes and brief stops with a manner of faint irritation as if conscious of the number of people whom his displeasure might worry the hint of a smile on his face had a flavor of gloatingas if he knew that the act of coming to honor him was an act that disgraced the men who had come as if he knew and enjoyed it a tail of figures kept trailing and shifting behind him as if their function were to give him the pleasure of ignoring them mr mowen flickered briefly among the tail and dr pritchett and balph eubank the most persistent one was paul larkin he kept describing circles around taggart as if trying to acquire a suntan by means of an occasional ray his wistful smile pleading to be noticed taggarts eyes swept over the crowd once in a while swiftly and furtively in the manner of a prowlers flashlight this in the muscular shorthand legible to orren boyle meant that taggart was looking for someone and did not want anyone to know it the search ended when eugene lawson came to shake taggarts hand and to say his wet lower lip twisting like a cushion to soften the blow mr mouch couldnt come jim mr mouch is so sorry he had a special plane chartered but at the last minute things came up crucial national problems you know taggart stood still did not answer and frowned orren boyle burst out laughing taggart turned to him so sharply that the others melted away without waiting for a command to vanish what do you think youre doing snapped taggart having a good time jimmy just having a good time said boyle wesley is your boy wasnt he i know somebody whos my boy and hed better not forget it who larkin well no i dont think youre talking about larkin and if its not larkin that youre talking about why then i think you ought to be careful in your use of the possessive pronouns i dont mind the age classification i know i look young for my years but im just allergic to pronouns thats very smart but youre going to get too smart one of these days if i do you just go ahead and make the most of it jimmyif the trouble with people who overreach themselves is that they have short memories youd better remember who got rearden metal choked off the market for you why i remember who promised to that was the party who then pulled every string he could lay his hands on to try to prevent that particular directive from being issued because he figured he might need rail of rearden metal in the future because you spent ten thousand dollars pouring liquor into people you hoped would prevent the directive about the bond moratorium thats right so i did i had friends who had railroad bonds and besides i have friends in washington too jimmy well your friends beat mine on that moratorium business but mine beat yours on rearden metaland im not forgetting it but what the hellits all right with me thats the way to share things around only dont you try to fool me jimmy save the act for the suckers if you dont believe that ive always tried to do my best for you sure you have the best that could be expected all things considered and youll continue to do it too so long as ive got somebody you needand not a minute longer so i just wanted to remind you that ive got my own friends in washington friends that money cant buyjust like yours jimmy what do you think you mean just what youre thinking the ones you buy arent really worth a damn because somebody can always offer them more so the fields wide open to anybody and its just like oldfashioned competition again but if you get the goods on a man then youve got him then theres no higher bidder and you can count on his friendship well you have friends and so have i you have friends i can use and vice versa thats all right with mewhat the hellones got to trade something if we dont trade moneyand the age of money is pastthen we trade men what is it youre driving at why im just telling you a few things that you ought to remember now take wesley for instance you promised him the assistants job in the bureau of national planningfor doublecrossing rearden at the time of the equalization of opportunity bill you had the connections to do it and thats what i asked you to doin exchange for the antidogeatdog rule where i had the connections so wesley did his part and you saw to it that you got it all on paperoh sure i know that youve got written proof of the kind of deals he pulled to help pass that bill while he was taking reardens money to defeat it and keeping rearden off guard they were pretty ugly deals it would be pretty messy for mr mouch if it all came out in public so you kept your promise and you got the job for him because you thought you had him and so you did and he paid off pretty handsomely didnt he but it works only just so long after a while mr wesley mouch might get to be so powerful and the scandal so old that nobody will care how he got his start or whom he doublecrossed nothing lasts forever wesley was reardens man and then he was your man and he might be somebody elses man tomorrow are you giving me a hint why no im giving you a friendly warning were old friends jimmy and i think that thats what we ought to remain i think we can be very useful to each other you and i if you dont start getting the wrong ideas about friendship mei believe in a balance of power did you prevent mouch from coming here tonight well maybe i did and maybe i didnt ill let you worry about it thats good for me if i didand still better if i didnt cherryls eyes followed james taggart through the crowd the faces that kept shifting and gathering around her seemed so friendly and their voices were so eagerly warm that she felt certain there was no malice anywhere in the room she wondered why some of them talked to her about washington in a hopeful confidential manner of half sentences halfhints as if they were seeking her help for something secret she was supposed to understand she did not know what to say but she smiled and answered whatever she pleased she could not disgrace the person of mrs taggart by any touch of fear then she saw the enemy it was a tall slender figure in a gray evening gown who was now her sisterinlaw the pressure of anger in cherryls mind was the stored accumulation of the sounds of jims tortured voice she felt the nagging pull of a duty left undone her eyes kept returning to the enemy and studying her intently the pictures of dagny taggart in the newspapers had shown a figure dressed in slacks or a face with a slanting hat brim and a raised coat collar now she wore a gray evening gown that seemed indecent because it looked austerely modest so modest that it vanished from ones awareness and left one too aware of the slender body it pretended to cover there was a tone of blue in the gray cloth that went with the gunmetal gray of her eyes she wore no jewelry only a bracelet on her wrist a chain of heavy metal links with a green blue cast cherryl waited until she saw dagny standing alone then tore forward cutting resolutely across the room she looked at close range into the gunmetal eyes that seemed cold and intense at once the eyes that looked at her directly with a polite impersonal curiosity theres something i want you to know said cherryl her voice taut and harsh so that there wont be any pretending about it im not going to put on the sweet relative act i know what youve done to jim and how youve made him miserable all his life im going to protect him against you ill put you in your place im mrs taggart im the woman in this family now thats quite all right said dagny im the man cherryl watched her walk away and ihougrit that jim had been right this sister of his was a creature of cold evil who had given her no response no acknowledgment no emotion of any kind except a touch of something that looked like an astonished indifferent amusement rearden stood by lillians side and followed her when she moved she wished to be seen with her husband he was complying he did not know whether anyone looked at him or not he was aware of no one around them except the person whom he could not permit himself to see the image still holding his consciousness was the moment when he had entered this room with lillian and had seen dagny looking at them he had looked straight at her prepared to accept any blow her eyes would choose to give him whatever the consequences to lillian he would have confessed his adultery publicly there and in that moment rather than commit the unspeakable act of evading dagnys eyes of closing his face into a cowards blankness of pretending to her that he did not know the nature of his action but there had been no blow he knew every shade of sensation ever reflected in dagnys face he had known that she had felt no shock he had seen nothing but an untouched serenity her eyes had moved to his as if acknowledging the full meaning of this encounter but looking at him as she would have looked anywhere as she looked at him in his office or in her bedroom it had seemed to him that she had stood before them both at the distance of a few steps revealed to them as simply and openly as the gray dress revealed her body she had bowed to them the courteous movement of her head including them both he had answered he had seen lillians brief nod and then he had seen lillian moving away and realized that he had stood with his head bowed for a long moment he did not know what lillians friends were saying to him or what he was answering as a man goes step by step trying not to think of the length of a hopeless road so he went moment by moment keeping no imprint of anything in his mind he heard snatches of lillians pleased laughter and a tone of satisfaction in her voice after a while he noticed the women around him they all seemed to resemble lillian with the same look of static grooming with thin eyebrows plucked to a static lift and eyes frozen in static amusement he noticed that they were trying to flirt with him and that lillian watched it as if she were enjoying the hopelessness of their attempts this then he thoughtwas the happiness of feminine vanity which she had begged him to give her these were the standards which he did not live by but had to consider he turned for escape to a group of men he could not find a single straight statement in the conversation of the men whatever subject they seemed to be talking about never seemed to be the subject they were actually discussing he listened like a foreigner who recognized some of the words but could not connect them into sentences a young man with a look of alcoholic insolence staggered past the group and snapped chuckling learned your lesson rearden he did not know what the young rat had meant everybody else seemed to know it they looked shocked and secretly pleased lillian drifted away from him as if letting him understand that she did not insist upon his literal attendance he retreated to a corner of the room where no one would see him or notice the direction of his eyes then he permitted himself to look at dagny he watched the gray dress the shifting movement of the soft cloth when she walked the momentary pauses sculptured by the cloth the shadows and the light he saw it as a bluishgray smoke held shaped for an instant into a long curve that slanted forward to her knee and back to the tip of her sandal he knew every facet the light would shape if the smoke were ripped away he felt a murky twisting pain it was jealousy of every man who spoke to her he had never felt it before but he felt it here where everyone had the right to approach her except himself then as if a single sudden blow to his brain blasted a moments shift of perspective he felt an immense astonishment at what he was doing here and why he lost for that moment all the days and dogmas of his past his concepts his problems his pain were wiped out he knew onlyas from a great clear distancethat man exists for the achievement of his desires and he wondered why he stood here he wondered who had the right to demand that he waste a single irreplaceable hour of his life when his only desire was to seize the slender figure in gray and hold her through the length of whatever time there was left for him to exist in the next moment he felt the shudder of recapturing his mind he felt the tight contemptuous movement of his lips pressed together in token of the words he cried to himself you made a contract once now stick to it and then he thought suddenly that in business transactions the courts of law did not recognize a contract wherein no valuable consideration had been given by one party to the other he wondered what made him think of it the thought seemed irrelevant he did not pursue it james taggart saw lillian rearden drift casually toward him at the one moment when he chanced to be alone in the dim corner between a potted palm and a window he stopped and waited to let her approach he could not guess her purpose but this was the manner which in the code he understood meant that he had better hear her how do you like my wedding gift jim she asked and laughed at his look of embarrassment no no dont try to go over the list of things in your apartment wondering which one the hell it was its not in your apartment its right here and its a nonmaterial gift darling he saw the halfhint of a smile on her face the look understood among his friends as an invitation to share a secret victory it was the look not of having outthought but of having outsmarted somebody he answered cautiously with a safely pleasant smile your presence is the best gift you could give me my presence jim the lines of his face were shockbound for a moment he knew what she meant but he had not expected her to mean it she smiled openly we both know whose presence is the most valuable one for you tonightand the unexpected one didnt you really think of giving me credit for it im surprised at you i thought you had a genius for recognizing potential friends he would not commit himself he kept his voice carefully neutral have i failed to appreciate your friendship lillian now now darling you know what im talking about you didnt expect him to come here you didnt really think that he is afraid of you did you but to have the others think he isthats quite an inestimable advantage isnt it im surprised lillian shouldnt you say impressed your guests are quite impressed i can practically hear them thinking all over the room most of them are thinking if he has to seek terms with jim taggart wed better toe the line and a few are thinking if hes afraid well get away with much more this is as you want it of courseand i wouldnt think of spoiling your triumphbut you and i are the only ones who know that you didnt achieve it singlehanded he did not smile he asked his face blank his voice smooth but with a carefully measured hint of harshness whats your angle she laughed essentiallythe same as yours jim but speaking practicallynone at all its just a favor ive done you and i need no favor in return dont worry im not lobbying for any special interests im not after squeezing some particular directive out of mr mouch im not even after a diamond tiara from you unless of course its a tiara of a nonmaterial order such as your appreciation he looked straight at her for the first time his eyes narrowed his face relaxed to the same halfsmile as hers suggesting the expression which for both of them meant that they felt at home with each other an expression of contempt you know that i have always admired you lillian as one of the truly superior women im aware of it there was the faintest coating of mockery spread like shellac over the smooth notes of her voice he was studying her insolently you must forgive me if i think that some curiosity is permissible between friends he said with no tone of apology im wondering from what angle you contemplate the possibility of certain financial burdensor losseswhich affect your own personal interests she shrugged from the angle of a horsewoman darling if you had the most powerful horse in the world you would keep it bridled down to the galt required to carry you in comfort even though this meant the sacrifice of its full capacity even though its top speed would never be seen and its great power would be wasted you would do itbecause if you let the horse go full blast it would throw you off in no time however financial aspects are not my chief concern nor yours jim t did underestimate you he said slowly oh well thats an error im willing to help you correct i know the sort of problem he presents to you i know why youre afraid of him as you have good reason to be but well youre in business and in politics so ill try to say it in your language a businessman says that he can deliver the goods and a ward heeler says that he can deliver the vote is that right well what i wanted you to know is that i can deliver him any time i choose you may act accordingly in the code of his friends to reveal any part of ones self was to give a weapon to an enemybut he signed her confession and matched it when he said i wish i were as smart about my sister she looked at him without astonishment she did not find the words irrelevant yes theres a tough one she said no vulnerable point no weaknesses none no love affairs god no she shrugged in sign of changing the subject dagny taggart was a person on whom she did not care to dwell i think ill let you run along so that you can chat a little with balph eubank she said he looks worried because you havent looked at him all evening and hes wondering whether literature will be left without a friend at court lillian youre wonderful he said quite spontaneously she laughed that my dear is the nonmaterial tiara i wanted the remnant of a smile stayed on her face as she moved through the crowd a fluid smile that ran softly into the look of tension and boredom worn by all the faces around her she moved at random enjoying the sense of being seen her eggshell satin gown shimmering like heavy cream with the motion of her tall figure it was the greenblue spark that caught her attention it flashed for an instant under the lights on the wrist of a thin naked arm then she saw the slender body the gray dress the fragile naked shoulders she stopped she looked at the bracelet frowning dagny turned at her approach among the many things that lillian resented the impersonal politeness of dagnys face was the one she resented most what do you think of your brothers marriage miss taggart she asked casually smiling i have no opinion about it do you mean to say that you dont find it worthy of any thought if you wish to be exactyes thats what i mean oh but dont you see any human significance in it no dont you think that a person such as your brothers bride does deserve some interest why no i envy you miss taggart i envy your olympian detachment it is i think the secret of why lesser mortals can never hope to equal your success in the field of business they allow their attention to be dividedat least to the extent of acknowledging achievements in other fields what achievements are we talking about dont you grant any recognition at all to the women who attain unusual heights of conquest not in the industrial but in the human realm i dont think that there is such a word as conquestin the human realm oh but consider for instance how hard other women would have had to workif work were the only means available to themto achieve what this girl has achieved through the person of your brother dont think she knows the exact nature of what she has achieved rearden saw them together he approached he felt that he had to hear it no matter what the consequences he stopped silently beside them he did not know whether lillian was aware of his presence he knew that dagny was do show a little generosity toward her miss taggart said lillian at least the generosity of attention you must not despise the women who do not possess your brilliant talent but who exercise their own particular endowments nature always balances her gifts and offers compensationsdont you think so im not sure i understand you oh im sure you dont want to hear me become more explicit why yes i do lillian shrugged angrily among the women who were her friends she would have been understood and stopped long ago but this was an adversary new to hera woman who refused to be hurt she did not care to speak more clearly but she saw rearden looking at her she smiled and said well consider your sisterinlaw miss taggart what chance did she have to rise in the world noneby your exacting standards she could not have made a successful career in business she does not possess your unusual mind besides men would have made it impossible for her they would have found her too attractive so she took advantage of the fact that men have standards which unfortunately are not as high as yours she resorted to talents which im sure you despise you have never cared to compete with us lesser women in the sole field of our ambitionin the achievement of power over men if you call it power mrs reardenthen no i havent she turned to go but lillians voice stopped her i would like to believe that youre fully consistent miss taggart and fully devoid of human frailties i would like to believe that youve never felt the desire to flatteror to offendanyone but i see that you expected both henry and me to be here tonight why no i cant say that i did i had not seen my brothers guest list then why are you wearing that bracelet dagnys eyes moved deliberately straight to hers i always wear it dont you think that thats carrying a joke too far it was never a joke mrs rearden then youll understand me if i say that id like you to give that bracelet back to me i understand you but will not give it back lillian let a moment pass as if to let them both acknowledge the meaning of their silence for once she held dagnys glance without smiling what do you expect me to think miss taggart anything you wish what is your motive you knew my motive when you gave me the bracelet lillian glanced at rearden his face was expressionless she saw no reaction no hint of intention to help her or stop her nothing but an attentiveness that made her feel as if she were standing in a spotlight her smile came back as a protective shield an amused patronizing smile intended to convert the subject into a drawingroom issue again im sure miss taggart that you realize how enormously improper this is no but surely you know that you are taking a dangerous and ugly risk no you do not take into consideration the possibility of being misunderstood no lillian shook her head in smiling reproach miss taggart dont you think that this is a case where one cannot afford to indulge in abstract theory but must consider practical reality dagny would not smile i have never understood what is meant by a statement of that kind i mean that your attitude may be highly idealisticas i am sure it isbut unfortunately most people do not share your lofty frame of mind and will misinterpret your action in the one manner which would be most abhorrent to you then the responsibility and the risk will be theirs not mine i admire your no i must not say innocence but shall i say purity you have never thought of it im sure but life is not as straight and logical as as a railroad track it is regrettable but possible that your high intentions may lead people to suspect things which well which im sure you know to be of a sordid and scandalous nature dagny was looking straight at her i dont but you cannot ignore that possibility i do dagny turned to go oh but should you wish to evade a discussion if you have nothing to hide dagny stopped and if your brilliantand reckless courage permits you to gamble with your reputation should you ignore the danger to mr rearden dagny asked slowly what is the danger to mr rearden im sure you understand me i dont oh but surely it isnt necessary to be more explicit it isif you wish to continue this discussion lillians eyes went to reardens face searching for some sign to help her decide whether to continue or to stop he would not help her miss taggart she said i am not your equal in philosophical altitude i am only an average wife please give me that braceletif you do not wish me to think what i might think and what you wouldnt want me to name mrs rearden is this the manner and place in which you choose to suggest that i am sleeping with your husband certainly not the cry was immediate it had a sound of panic and the quality of an automatic reflex like the jerk of withdrawal of a pickpockets hand caught in action she added with an angry nervous chuckle in a tone of sarcasm and sincerity that confessed a reluctant admission of her actual opinion that would be the possibility farthest from my mind then you will please apologize to miss taggart said rearden dagny caught her breath cutting off all but the faint echo of a gasp they both whirled to him lillian saw nothing in his face dagny saw torture it isnt necessary hank she said it isfor me he answered coldly not looking at her he was looking at lillian in the manner of a command that could not be disobeyed lillian studied his face with mild astonishment but without anxiety or anger like a person confronted by a puzzle of no significance but of course she said complaisantly her voice smooth and confident again please accept my apology miss taggart if i gave you the impression that i suspected the existence of a relationship which i would consider improbable for you andfrom my knowledge of his inclinationsimpossible for my husband she turned and walked away indifferently leaving them together as if in deliberate proof of her words dagny stood still her eyes closed she was thinking of the night when lillian had given her the bracelet he had taken his wifes side then he had taken hers now of the three of them she was the only one who understood fully what this meant whatever is the worst you may wish to say to me you will be right she heard him and opened her eyes he was looking at her coldly his face harsh allowing no sign of pain or apology to suggest a hope of forgiveness dearest dont torture yourself like that she said i knew that youre married ive never tried to evade that knowledge im not hurt by it tonight her first word was the most violent of the several blows he felt she had never used that word before she had never let him hear that particular tone of tenderness she had never spoken of his marriage in the privacy of their meetingsyet she spoke of it here with effortless simplicity she saw the anger in his facethe rebellion against pitythe look of saying to her contemptuously that he had betrayed no torture and needed no helpthen the look of the realization that she knew his face as thoroughly as he knew hershe closed his eyes he inclined his head a little and he said very quietly thank you she smiled and turned away from him james taggart held an empty champagne glass in his hand and noticed the haste with which balph eubank waved at a passing waiter as if the waiter were guilty of an unpardonable lapse then eubank completed his sentence but you mr taggart would know that a man who lives on a higher plane cannot be understood or appreciated its a hopeless struggletrying to obtain support for literature from a world ruled by businessmen they are nothing but stuffy middleclass vulgarians or else predatory savages like rearden jim said bertram scudder slapping his shoulder the best compliment i can pay you is that youre not a real businessman youre a man of culture jim said dr pritchett youre not an exoredigger like rearden i dont have to explain to you the crucial need of washington assistance to higher education you really liked my last novel mr taggart balph eubank kept asking you really liked it orren boyle glanced at the group on his way across the room but did not stop the glance was sufficient to give him an estimate of the nature of the groups concerns fair enough he thought ones got to trade something he knew but did not care to name just what was being traded we arc at the dawn of a new age said james taggart from above the rim of his champagne glass we are breaking up the vicious tyranny of economic power we will set men free of the rule of the dollar we will release our spiritual aims from dependence on the owners of material means we will liberate our culture from the stranglehold of the profitchasers we will build a society dedicated to higher ideals and we will replace the aristocracy of money by the aristocracy of pull said a voice beyond the group they whirled around the man who stood facing them was francisco danconia his face looked tanned by a summer sun and his eyes were the exact color of the sky on the kind of day when he had acquired his tan his smile suggested a summer morning the way he wore his formal clothes made the rest of the crowd look as if they were masquerading in borrowed costumes whats the matter he asked in the midst of their silence did i say something that somebody here didnt know how did you get here was the first thing james taggart found himself able to utter by plane to newark by taxi from there then by elevator from my suite fiftythree floors above you i didnt mean that is what i meant was dont look so startled james if i land in new york and hear that theres a party going on i wouldnt miss it would i youve always said that im just a party hound the group was watching them im delighted to see you of course taggart said cautiously then added belligerently to balance it but if you think youre going to francisco would not pick up the threat he let taggarts sentence slide into midair and stop then asked politely if i think what you understand me very well yes i do shall i tell you what i think this is hardly the moment for any i think you should present me to your bride james your manners have never been glued to you too solidlyyou always lose them in an emergency and thats the time when one needs them most turning to escort him toward cherryl taggart caught the faint sound that came from bertram scudder it was an unborn chuckle taggart knew that the men who had crawled at his feet a moment ago whose hatred for francisco danconia was perhaps greater than his own were enjoying the spectacle none the less the implications of this knowledge were among the things he did not care to name francisco bowed to cherryl and offered his best wishes as if she were the bride of a royal heir watching nervously taggart felt reliefand a touch of nameless resentment which if named would have told him he wished the occasion deserved the grandeur that franciscos manner gave it for a moment he was afraid to remain by franciscos side and afraid to let him loose among the guests he backed a few tentative steps away but francisco followed him smiling you didnt think id want to miss your wedding jameswhen youre my childhood friend and best stockholder what gasped taggart and regretted it the sound was a confession of panic francisco did not seem to take note of it he said his voice gaily innocent oh but of course i know it i know the stooge behind the stooge behind every name on the list of the stockholders of danconia copper its surprising how many men by the name of smith and gomez are rich enough to own big chunks of the richest corporation in the worldso you cant blame me if i was curious to learn what distinguished persons i actually have among my minority stockholders i seem to be popular with an astonishing collection of public figures from all over the worldfrom peoples states where you wouldnt think theres any money left at all taggart said dryly frowning there are many reasonsbusiness reasonswhy it is sometimes advisable not to make ones investments directly one reason is that a man doesnt want people to know hes rich another is that he doesnt want them to learn how he got that way i dont know what you mean or why you should object oh i dont object at all i appreciate it a great many investors the oldfashioned sortdropped me after the san sebastian mines it scared them away but the modern ones had more faith in me and acted as they always doon faith i cant tell you how thoroughly i appreciate it taggart wished francisco would not talk so loudly he wished people would not gather around them you have been doing extremely well he said in the safe tone of a business compliment yes havent i its wonderful how the stock of danconia copper has risen within the last year but i dont think i should be too conceited about ittheres not much competition left in the world theres no place to invest ones money if one happens to get rich quickly and heres danconia copper the oldest company on earth the one thats been the safest bet for centuries just think of what it managed to survive through the ages so if you people have decided that its the best place for your hidden money that it cant be beaten that it would take a most unusual kind of man to destroy danconia copperyou were right well i hear it said that youve begun to take your responsibilities seriously and that youve settled down to business at last they say youve been working very hard oh has anybody noticed that it was the oldfashioned investors who made it a point to watch what the president of a company was doing the modern investors dont find knowledge necessary i dont think they ever look into my activities taggart smiled they look at the ticker tape of the stock exchange that tells the whole story doesnt it yes yes it doesin the long run i must say im glad that you havent been much of a party hound this past year the results show in your work do they well no not quite yet i suppose said taggart in the cautious tone of an indirect question that i should feel flattered you chose to come to this party oh but i had to come i thought you were expecting me why no i wasnt that is i mean you should have expected me james this is the great formal nosecounting event where the victims come in order to show how safe it is to destroy them and the destroyers form pacts of eternal friendship which lasts for three months i dont know exactly which group i belong to but i had to come and be counted didnt i what in hell do you think youre saying taggart cried furiously seeing the tension on the faces around them be careful james if you try to pretend that you dont understand me im going to make it much clearer if you think its proper to utter such i think its funny there was a time when men were afraid that somebody would reveal some secret of theirs that was unknown to their fellows nowadays theyre afraid that somebody will name what everybody knows have you practical people ever thought that thats all it would take to blast your whole big complex structure with all your laws and gunsjust somebody naming the exact nature of what youre doing if you think its proper to come to a celebration such as a wedding in order to insult the host why james i came here to thank you to thank me of course youve done me a great favoryou and your boys in washington and the boys in santiago only i wonder why none of you took the trouble to inform me about it those directives that somebody issued here a few months ago are choking off the entire copper industry of this country and the result is that this country suddenly has to import much larger amounts of copper and where in the world is there any copper leftunless its danconia copper so you see that i have good reason to be grateful assure you i had nothing to do with it taggart said hastily and besides the vital economic policies of this country are not determined by any considerations such as youre intimating or i know how theyre determined james i know that the deal started with the boys in santiago because theyve been on the danconia pay roll for centurieswell no pay roll is an honorable word it would be more exact to say that danconia copper has been paying them protection money for centuriesisnt that what your gangsters call it our boys in santiago call it taxes theyve been getting their cut on every ton of danconia copper sold so they have a vested interest to see me sell as many tons as possible but with the world turning into peoples states this is the only country left where men are not yet reduced to digging for roots in forests for their sustenanceso this is the only market left on earth the boys in santiago wanted to corner this market i dont know what they offered to the boys in washington or who traded what and to whombut i know that you came in on it somewhere because you do hold a sizable chunk of danconia copper stock and it surely didnt displease youthat morning four months l ago the day after the directives were issuedto see the kind of soaring leap that danconia copper performed on the stock exchange why it practically leaped off the ticker tape and into your face who gave you any grounds to invent an outrageous story of this kind nobody i knew nothing about it i just saw the leap on the ticker tape that morning that told the whole story didnt it besides the boys in santiago slapped a new tax on copper the following weekand they told me that i shouldnt mind it not with that sudden rise of my stock they were working for my best interests they said they said why should i caretaking the two events together i was richer than i had been before true enough i was why do you wish to tell me this why dont you wish to take any credit for it james thats out of character and out of the policy at which youre such an expert in an age when men exist not by right but by favor one does not reject a grateful person one tries to trap into gratitude as many people as possible dont you want to have me as one of your men under obligation i dont know what youre talking about think what a favor i received without any effort on my part i wasnt consulted i wasnt informed i wasnt thought about everything was arranged without meand all i have to do now is produce the copper that was a great favor jamesand you may be sure that i will repay it francisco turned abruptly not waiting for an answer and started away taggart did not follow he stood feeling that anything was preferable to one more minute of their conversation francisco stopped when he came to dagny he looked at her for a silent instant without greeting his smile acknowledging that she had been the first person he saw and the first one to see him at his entrance into the ballroom against every doubt and warning in her mind she felt nothing but a joyous confidence inexplicably she felt as if his figure in that crowd was a point of indestructible security but in the moment when the beginning of a smile told him how glad she was to see him he asked dont you want to tell me what a brilliant achievement the john galt line turned out to be she felt her lips trembling and tightening at once as she answered im sorry if i show that im still open to be hurt it shouldnt shock me that youve come to the stage where you despise achievement yes dont t i despised that line so much that i didnt want to see it reach the kind of end it has reached he saw her look of sudden attentiveness the look of thought rushing into a breach torn open upon a new direction he watched her for a moment as if he knew every step she would find along that road then chuckled and said dont you want to ask me now who is john galt why should i want to and why now dont you remember that you dared him to come and claim your line well he has he walked on not waiting to sec the look in her eyesa look that held anger bewilderment and the first faint gleam of a question mark it was the muscles of his own face that made rearden realize the nature of his reaction to franciscos arrival he noticed suddenly that he was smiling and that his face had been relaxed into the dim well being of a smile for some minutes past as he watched francisco danconia in the crowd he acknowledged to himself for the first time all the halfgrasped halfrejected moments when he had thought of francisco danconia and thrust the thought aside before it became the knowledge of how much he wanted to see him again in moments of sudden exhaustionat his desk with the fires of the furnaces going down in the twilightin the darkness of the lonely walk through the empty countryside to his housein the silence of sleepless nightshe had found himself thinking of the only man who had once seemed to be his spokesman he had pushed the memory aside telling himself but that one is worse than all the otherswhile feeling certain that this was not true yet being unable to name the reason of his certainty he had caught himself glancing through the newspapers to see whether francisco danconia had returned to new yorkand he had thrown the newspapers aside asking himself angrily what if he did returnwould you go chasing him through night clubs and cocktail partieswhat is it that you want from him this was what he had wantedhe thought when he caught himself smiling at the sight of francisco in the crowdthis strange feeling of expectation that held curiosity amusement and hope francisco did not seem to have noticed him rearden waited fighting a desire to approach not after the kind of conversation we had he thoughtwhat forwhat would i say to him and then with the same smiling lighthearted feeling the feeling of being certain that it was right he found himself walking across the ballroom toward the group that surrounded francisco danconia he wondered looking at them why these people were drawn to francisco why they chose to hold him imprisoned in a clinging circle when their resentment of him was obvious under their smiles their faces had the hint of a look peculiar not to fear but to cowardice a look of guilty anger francisco stood cornered against the side edge of a marble stairway halfleaning halfsitting on the steps the informality of his posture combined with the strict formality of his clothes gave him an air of superlative elegance his was the only face that had the carefree look and the brilliant smile proper to the enjoyment of a party but his eyes seemed intentionally expressionless holding no trace of gaiety showinglike a warning signalnothing but the activity of a heightened perceptiveness standing unnoticed on the edge of the group rearden heard a woman who had large diamond earrings and a flabby nervous face ask tensely senior danconia what do you think is going to happen to the world just exactly what it deserves oh how cruel dont you believe in the operation of the moral law madame francisco asked gravely i do rearden heard bertram scudder outside the group say to a girl who made some sound of indignation dont let him disturb you you know money is the root of all eviland hes the typical product of money rearden did not think that francisco could have heard it but he saw francisco turning to them with a gravely courteous smile so you think that money is the root of all evil said francisco danconia have you ever asked what is the root of money money is a tool of exchange which cant exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value money is not the tool of the moochers who claim your product by tears or of the looters who take it from you by force money is made possible only by the men who produce is this what you consider evil when you accept money in payment for your effort you do so only on the conviction that you will exchange it for the product of the effort of others it is not the moochers or the looters who give value to money not an ocean of tears nor all the guns in the world can transform those pieces of paper in your wallet into the bread you will need to survive tomorrow those pieces of paper which should have been gold are a token of honoryour claim upon the energy of the men who produce your wallet is your statement of hope that somewhere in the world around you there are men who will not default on that moral principle which is the root of money is this what you consider evil have you ever looked for the root of production take a look at an electric generator and dare tell yourself that it was created by the muscular effort of unthinking brutes try to grow a seed of wheat without the knowledge left to you by men who had to discover it for the first time try to obtain your food by means of nothing but physical motionsand youll learn that mans mind is the root of all the goods produced and of all the wealth that has ever existed on earth but you say that money is made by the strong at the expense of the weak what strength do you mean it is not the strength of guns or muscles wealth is the product of mans capacity to think then is money made by the man who invents a motor at the expense of those who did not invent it is money made by the intelligent at the expense of the fools by the able at the expense of the incompetent by the ambitious at the expense of the lazy money is madebefore it can be looted or moochedmade by the effort of every honest man each to the extent of his ability an honest man is one who knows that he cant consume more than he has produced to trade by means of money is the code of the men of good will money rests on the axiom that every man is the owner of his mind and his effort money allows no power to prescribe the value of your effort except the voluntary choice of the man who is willing to trade you his effort in return money permits you to obtain for your goods and your labor that which they are worth to the men who buy them but no more money permits no deals except those to mutual benefit by the unforced judgment of the traders money demands of you the recognition that men must work for their own benefit not for their own injury for their gain not their lossthe recognition that they are not beasts of burden born to carry the weight of your miserythat you must offer them values not woundsthat the common bond among men is not the exchange of suffering but the exchange of goods money demands that you sell not your weakness to mens stupidity but your talent to their reason it demands that you buy not the shoddiest they offer but the best that your money can find and when men live by tradewith reason not force as their final arbiterit is the best product that wins the best performance the man of best judgment and highest abilityand the degree of a mans productiveness is the degree of his reward this is the code of existence whose tool and symbol is money is this what you consider evil but money is only a tool it will take you wherever you wish but it will not replace you as the driver it will give you the means for the satisfaction of your desires but it will not provide you with desires money is the scourge of the men who attempt to reverse the law of causalitythe men who seek to replace the mind by seizing the products of the mind money will not purchase happiness for the man who has no concept of what he wants money will not give him a code of values if hes evaded the knowledge of what to value and it will not provide him with a purpose if hes evaded the choke of what to seek money will not buy intelligence for the fool or admiration for the coward or respect for the incompetent the man who attempts to purchase the brains of his superiors to serve him with his money replacing his judgment ends up by becoming the victim of his inferiors the men of intelligence desert him but the cheats and the frauds come flocking to him drawn by a law which he has not discovered that no man may be smaller than his money is this the reason why you call it evil only the man who does not need it is fit to inherit wealththe man who would make his own fortune no matter where he started if an heir is equal to his money it serves him if not it destroys him but you look on and you cry that money corrupted him did it or did he corrupt his money do not envy a worthless heir his wealth is not yours and you would have done no better with it do not think that it should have been distributed among you loading the world with fifty parasites instead of one would not bring back the dead virtue which was the fortune money is a living power that dies without its root money will not serve the mind that cannot match it is this the reason why you call it evil money is your means of survival the verdict you pronounce upon the source of your livelihood is the verdict you pronounce upon your life if the source is corrupt you have damned your own existence did you get your money by fraud by pandering to mens vices or mens stupidity by catering to fools in the hope of getting more than your ability deserves by lowering your standards by doing work you despise for purchasers you scorn if so then your money will not give you a moments or a pennys worth of joy then all the things you buy will become not a tribute to you but a reproach not an achievement but a reminder of shame then youll scream that money is evil evil because it would not pinchhit for your selfrespect evil because it would not let you enjoy your depravity is this the root of your hatred of money money will always remain an effect and refuse to replace you as the cause money is the product of virtue but it will not give you virtue and it will not redeem your vices money will not give you the unearned neither in matter nor in spirit is this the root of your hatred of money or did you say its the love of money thats the root of all evil to love a thing is to know and love its nature to love money is to know and love the fact that money is the creation of the best power within you and your passkey to trade your effort for the effort of the best among men its the person who would sell his soul for a nickel who is loudest in proclaiming his hatred of moneyand he has good reason to hate it the lovers of money are willing to work for it they know they are able to deserve it let me give you a tip on a clue to mens characters the man who damns money has obtained it dishonorably the man who respects it has earned it run for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil that sentence is the lepers bell of an approaching looter so long as men live together on earth and need means to deal with one anothertheir only substitute if they abandon money is the muzzle of a gun but money demands of you the highest virtues if you wish to make it or to keep it men who have no courage pride or selfesteem men who have no moral sense of their right to their money and are not willing to defend it as they defend their life men who apologize for being richwill not remain rich for long they are the natural bait for the swarms of looters that stay under rocks for centuries but come crawling out at the first smell of a man who begs to be forgiven for the guilt of owning wealth they will hasten to relieve him of the guiltand of his life as he deserves then you will see the rise of the men of the double standardthe men who live by force yet count on those who live by trade to create the value of their looted moneythe men who are the hitchhikers of virtue in a moral society these are the criminals and the statutes are written to protect you against them but when a society establishes criminalsbyright and lootersbylawmen who use force to seize the wealth of disarmed victimsthen money becomes its creators avenger such looters believe it safe to rob defenseless men once theyve passed a law to disarm them but their loot becomes the magnet for other looters who get it from them as they got it then the race goes not to the ablest at production but to those most ruthless at brutality when force is the standard the murderer wins over the pickpocket and then that society vanishes in a spread of ruins and slaughter do you wish to know whether that day is coming watch money money is the barometer of a societys virtue when you see that trading is done not by consent but by compulsionwhen you see that in order to produce you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothingwhen you see that money is flowing to those who deal not in goods but in favorswhen you see that men get richer by graft and by pull than by work and your laws dont protect you against them but protect them against youwhen you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a selfsacrificeyou may know that your society is doomed money is so noble a medium that it does not compete with guns and it does not make terms with brutality it will not permit a country to survive as halfproperty halfloot whenever destroyers appear among men they start by destroying money for money is mens protection and the base of a moral existence destroyers seize gold and leave to its owners a counterfeit pile of paper this kills all objective standards and delivers men into the arbitrary power of an arbitrary setter of values gold was an objective value an equivalent of wealth produced paper is a mortgage on wealth that does not exist backed by a gun aimed at those who are expected to produce it paper is a check drawn by legal looters upon an account which is not theirs upon the virtue of the victims watch for the day when it bounces marked account overdrawn when you have made evil the means of survival do not expect men to remain good do not expect them to stay moral and lose their lives for the purpose of becoming the fodder of the immoral do not expect them to produce when production is punished and looting rewarded do not ask who is destroying the world you are you stand in the midst of the greatest achievements of the greatest productive civilization and you wonder why its crumbling around you while youre damning its lifebloodmoney you look upon money as the savages did before you and you wonder why the jungle is creeping back to the edge of your cities throughout mens history money was always seized by looters of one brand or another whose names changed but whose method remained the same to seize wealth by force and to keep the producers bound demeaned defamed deprived of honor that phrase about the evil of money which you mouth with such righteous recklessness comes from a time when wealth was produced by the labor of slavesslaves who repeated the motions once discovered by somebodys mind and left unimproved for centuries so long as production was ruled by force and wealth was obtained by conquest there was little to conquer yet through all the centuries of stagnation and starvation men exalted the looters as aristocrats of the sword as aristocrats of birth as aristocrats of the bureau and despised the producers as slaves as traders as shopkeepersas industrialists to the glory of mankind there was for the first and only time in history a country of moneyand i have no higher more reverent tribute to pay to america for this means a country of reason justice freedom production achievement for the first time mans mind and money were set free and there were no fortunesbyconquest but only fortunesbywork and instead of swordsmen and slaves there appeared the real maker of wealth the greatest worker the highest type of human beingthe selfmade manthe american industrialist if you ask me to name the proudest distinction of americans i would choosebecause it contains all the othersthe fact that they were the people who created the phrase to make money no other language or nation had ever used these words before men had always thought of wealth as a static quantityto be seized begged inherited shared looted or obtained as a favor americans were the first to understand that wealth has to be created the words to make money hold the essence of human morality yet these were the words for which americans were denounced by the rotted cultures of the looters continents now the looters credo has brought you to regard your proudest achievements as a hallmark of shame your prosperity as guilt your greatest men the industrialists as blackguards and your magnificent factories as the product and property of muscular labor the labor of whipdriven slaves like the pyramids of egypt the rotter who simpers that he sees no difference between the power of the dollar and the power of the whip ought to learn the difference on his own hideas i think he will until and unless you discover that money is the root of all good you ask for your own destruction when money ceases to be the tool by which men deal with one another then men become the tools of men blood whips and gunsor dollars take your choicethere is no otherand your time is running out francisco had not glanced at rearden once while speaking but the moment he finished his eyes went straight to reardens face rearden stood motionless seeing nothing but francisco danconia across the moving figures and angry voices between them there were people who had listened but now hurried away and people who said its horribleits not truehow vicious and selfishsaying it loudly and guardedly at once as if wishing that their neighbors would hear them but hoping that francisco would not senor danconia declared the woman with the earrings i dont agree with you if you can refute a single sentence i uttered madame i shall hear it gratefully oh i cant answer you i dont have any answers my mind doesnt work that way but i dont feel that youre right so i know that youre wrong how do you know it i feel it i dont go by my head but by my heart you might be good at logic but youre heartless madame when well see men dying of starvation around us your heart wont be of any earthly use to save them and im heartless enough to say that when youll scream but i didnt know ityou will not be forgiven the woman turned away a shudder running through the flesh of her cheeks and through the angry tremor of her voice well its certainly a funny way to talk at a party a portly man with evasive eyes said loudly his tone of forced cheerfulness suggesting that his sole concern in any issue was not to let it become unpleasant if this is the way you feel about money senor i think im darn glad that ive got a goodly piece of danconia copper stock francisco said gravely i suggest that you think twice sir rearden started toward himand francisco who had not seemed to look in his direction moved to meet him at once as if the others had never existed hello said rearden simply easily as to a childhood friend he was smiling he saw his own smile reflected in franciscos face hello i want to speak to you to whom do you think ive been speaking for the last quarter of an hour rearden chuckled in the manner of acknowledging an opponents round i didnt think you had noticed me i noticed when i came in that you were one of the only two persons in this room who were glad to see me arent you being presumptuous nograteful who was the other person glad to see you francisco shrugged and said lightly a woman rearden noticed that francisco had led him aside away from the group in so skillfully natural a manner that neither he nor the others had known it was being done intentionally i didnt expect to find you here said francisco you shouldnt have come to this party why not may i ask what made you come my wife was anxious to accept the invitation forgive me if i put it in such form but it would have been more proper and less dangerous if she had asked you to take her on a tour of whorehouses what danger are you talking about mr rearden you do not know these peoples way of doing business or how they interpret your presence here in your code but not in theirs accepting a mans hospitality is a token of good will a declaration that you and your host stand on terms of a civilized relationship dont give them that kind of sanction then why did you come here francisco shrugged gaily oh iit doesnt matter what i do im only a party hound what are you doing at this party just looking for conquests found any his face suddenly earnest francisco answered gravely almost solemnly yeswhat i think is going to be my best and greatest reardens anger was involuntary the cry not of reproach but of despair how can you waste yourself that way the faint suggestion of a smile like the rise of a distant light came into franciscos eyes as he asked do you care to admit that you care about it youre going to hear a few more admissions if thats what youre after before i met you i used to wonder how you could waste a fortune such as yours now its worse because i cant despise you as i did as id like to yet the question is much more terrible how can you waste a mind such as yours i dont think im wasting it right now i dont know whether theres ever been anything that meant a damn to youbut im going to tell you what ive never said to anyone before when i met you do you remember that you said you wanted to offer me your gratitude there was no trace of amusement left in franciscos eyes rearden had never faced so solemn a look of respect yes mr rearden he answered quietly i told you that i didnt need it and i insulted you for it all right youve won that speech you made tonightthat was what you were offering me wasnt it yes mr rearden it was more than gratitude and i needed the gratitude it was more than admiration and i needed that too it was much more than any word i can find it will take me days to think of all that its given mebut one thing i do know i needed it ive never made an admission of this kind because ive never cried for anyones help if it amused you to guess that i was glad to see you you have something real to laugh about now if you wish it might take me a few years but i will prove to you that these are the things i do not laugh about prove it nowby answering one question why dont you practice what you preach are you sure that i dont if the things you said are true if you have the greatness to know it you should have been the leading industrialist of the world by now francisco said gravely as he had said to the portly man but with an odd note of gentleness in his voice i suggest that you think twice mr rearden ive thought about you more than i care to admit i have found no answer let me give you a hint if the things i said are true who is the guiltiest man in this room tonight i supposejames taggart no mr rearden it is not james taggart but you must define the guilt and choose the man yourself a few years ago i would have said that its you i still think that thats what i ought to say but im almost in the position of that fool woman who spoke to you every reason i know tells me that youre guiltyand yet i cant feel it you are making the same mistake as that woman mr rearden though in a nobler form what do you mean i mean much more than just your judgment of me that woman and all those like her keep evading the thoughts which they know to be good you keep pushing out of your mind the thoughts which you believe to be evil they do it because they want to avoid effort you do it because you wont permit yourself to consider anything that would spare yu they indulge their emotions at any cost you sacrifice your emotions as the first cost of any problem they are willing to bear nothing you are willing to bear anything they keep evading responsibility you keep assuming it but dont you see that the essential error is the same any refusal to recognize reality for any reason whatever has disastrous consequences there are no evil thoughts except one the refusal to think dont ignore your own desires mr rearden dont sacrifice them examine their cause there is a limit to how much you should have to bear how did you know this about me i made the same mistake once but not for long i wish rearden began and stopped abruptly francisco smiled afraid to wish mr rearden i wish i could permit myself to like you as much as i do id give francisco stopped inexplicably rearden saw the look of an emotion which he could not define yet felt certain to be pain he saw franciscos first moment of hesitation mr rearden do you own any danconia copper stock rearden looked at him bewildered no some day youll know what treason im committing right now but dont ever buy any danconia copper stock dont ever deal with danconia copper in any way why when youll learn the full reason youll know whether theres ever been anythingor anyonethat meant a damn to me and and how much he did mean rearden frowned he had remembered something i wouldnt deal with your company didnt you call them the men of the double standard arent you one of the looters who is growing rich right now by means of directives inexplicably the words did not hit francisco as an insult but cleared his face back into his look of assurance did you think that it was i who wheedled those directives out of the robberplanners if not then who did it my hitchhikers without your consent without my knowledge id hate to admit how much i want to believe youbut theres no way for you to prove it now no ill prove it to you within the next fifteen minutes how the fact remains that youve profited the most from those directives thats true ive profited more than mr mouch and his gang could ever imagine after my years of work they gave me just the chance i needed are you boasting you bet i am rearden saw incredulously that franciscos eyes had a hard bright look the look not of a party hound but of a man of action mr rearden do you know where most of those new aristocrats keep their hidden money do you know where most of the fair share vultures have invested their profits from rearden metal no but in danconia copper stock safely out of the way and out of the country danconia copperan old invulnerable company so rich that it would last for three more generations of looting a company managed by a decadent playboy who doesnt give a damn wholl let them use his property in any way they please and just continue to make money for themautomatically as did his ancestors wasnt that a perfect setup for the looters mr rearden onlywhat one single point did they miss rearden was staring at him what are you driving at francisco laughed suddenly its too bad about those profiteers on rearden metal you wouldnt want them to lose the money you made for them would you mr rearden but accidents do happen in the worldyou know what they say man is only a helpless plaything at the mercy of natures disasters for instance there was a fire at the danconia ore docks in valparaiso tomorrow morning a fire that razed them to the ground along with half of the port structures what time is it mr rearden oh did i mix my tenses tomorrow afternoon there will be a rock slide in the danconia mines at oranono lives lost no casualties except the mines themselves it will be found that the mines are done for because they had been worked in the wrong places for monthswhat can you expect from a playboys management the great deposits of copper will be buried under tons of mountain where a sebastian danconia would not be able to reclaim them in less than three years and a peoples state will never reclaim them at all when the stockholders begin to look into things they will find that the mines at campos at san felix at las heras have been worked in exactly the same manner and have been running at a loss for over a year only the playboy juggled the books and kept it out of the newspapers shall i tell you what they will discover about the management of the danconia foundries or of the danconia ore fleet but all these discoveries wont do the stockholders any good anyway because the stock of danconia copper will have crashed tomorrow morning crashed like an electric bulb against concrete crashed like an express elevator spattering pieces of hitchhikers all over the gutters the triumphant rise of franciscos voice merged with a matching sound rearden burst out laughing rearden did not know how long that moment lasted or what he had felt it had been like a blow hurling him into another kind of consciousness then a second blow returning him to his ownall that was left as at the awakening from a narcotic was the feeling that he had known some immense kind of freedom never to be matched in reality this was like the wyatt fire again he thought this was his secret danger he found himself backing away from francisco danconia francisco stood watching him intently and looked as if he had been watching him all through that unknown length of time there are no evil thoughts mr rearden francisco said softly except one the refusal to think no said rearden it was almost a whisper he had to keep his voice down he was afraid that he would hear himself scream it no if this is the key to you no dont expect me to cheer you you didnt have the strength to fight them you chose the easiest most vicious way deliberate destruction the destruction of an achievement you hadnt produced and couldnt match thats not what youll read in the newspapers tomorrow there wont be any evidence of deliberate destruction everything happened in the normal explicable justifiable course of plain incompetence incompetence isnt supposed to be punished nowadays is it the boys in buenos aires and the boys in santiago will probably want to hand me a subsidy by way of consolation and reward theres still a great part of the danconia copper company left though a great part of it is gone for good nobody will say that ive done it intentionally you may think what you wish i think youre the guiltiest man in this room said rearden quietly wearily even the fire of his anger was gone he felt nothing but the emptiness left by the death of a great hope i think youre worse than anything i had supposed francisco looked at him with a strange halfsmile of serenity the serenity of a victory over pain and did not answer it was their silence that let them hear the voices of the two men who stood a few steps away and they turned to look at the speakers the stocky elderly man was obviously a businessman of the conscientious unspectacular kind his formal dress suit was of good quality but of a cut fashionable twenty years before with the faintest tinge of green at the seams he had had few occasions to wear it his shirt studs were ostentatiously too large but it was the pathetic ostentation of an heirloom intricate pieces of oldfashioned workmanship that had probably come to him through four generations like his business his face had the expression which these days was the mark of an honest man an expression of bewilderment he was looking at his companion trying hardconscientiously helplessly hopelesslyto understand his companion was younger and shorter a small man with lumpy flesh with a chest thrust forward and the thin points of a mustache thrust up he was saying in a tone of patronizing boredom well i dont know all of you are crying about rising costs it seems to be the stock complaint nowadays its the usual whine of people whose profits are squeezed a little i dont know well have to see well have to decide whether well permit you to make any profits or not rearden glanced at franciscoand saw a face that went beyond his conception of what the purity of a single purpose could do to a human countenance it was the most merciless face one could ever be permitted to see he had thought of himself as ruthless but he knew that he could not match this level naked implacable look dead to all feeling but justice whatever the rest of himthought reardenthe man who could experience this was a giant it was only a moment francisco turned to him his face normal and said very quietly ive changed my mind mr rearden im glad that you came to this party i want you to see this then raising his voice francisco said suddenly in the gay loose piercing tone of a man of complete irresponsibility you wont grant me that loan mr rearden it puts me on a terrible spot i must get the moneyi must raise it tonighti must raise it before the stock exchange opens in the morning because otherwise he did not have to continue because the little man with the mustache was clutching at his arm rearden had never believed that a human body could change dimensions within ones sight but he saw the man shrinking in weight in posture in form as if the air were let out of his lumps and what had been an arrogant ruler was suddenly a piece of scrap that could not be a threat to anyone is is there something wrong senor danconia i mean on on the stock exchange francisco jerked his finger to his lips with a frightened glance keep quiet he whispered for gods sake keep quiet the man was shaking somethings wrong you dont happen to own any danconia copper stock do you the man nodded unable to speak oh my thats too bad well listen ill tell you if you give me your word of honor that you wont repeat it to anyone you dont want to start a panic word of honor gasped the man what youd better do is run to your stockbroker and sell as fast as you canbecause things havent been going too well for danconia copper im trying to raise some money but if i dont succeed youll be lucky if youll have ten cents on your dollar tomorrow morningoh my i forgot that you cant reach your stockbroker before tomorrow morningwell its too bad but the man was running across the room pushing people out of his way like a torpedo shot into the crowd watch said francisco austerely turning to rearden the man was lost in the crowd they could not see him they could not tell to whom he was selling his secret or whether he had enough of his cunning left to make it a trade with those who held favorsbut they saw the wake of his passage spreading through the room the sudden cuts splitting the crowd like the first few cracks then like the accelerating branching that runs through a wall about to crumble the streaks of emptiness slashed not by a human touch but by the impersonal breath of terror there were the voices abruptly choked off the pools of silence then sounds of a different nature the rising hysterical inflections of uselessly repeated questions the unnatural whispers a womans scream the few spaced forced giggles of those still trying to pretend that nothing was happening there were spots of immobility in the motion of the crowd like spreading blotches of paralysis there was a sudden stillness as if a motor had been cut off then came the frantic jerking purposeless rudderless movement of objects bumping down a hill by the blind mercy of gravitation and of every rock they hit on the way people were running out running to telephones running to one another clutching or pushing the bodies around them at random these men the most powerful men in the country those who held unanswerable to any power the power over every mans food and every mans enjoyment of his span of years on earththese men had become a pile of rubble clattering in the wind of panic the rubble left of a structure when its key pillar has been cut james taggart his face indecent in its exposure of emotions which centuries had taught men to keep hidden rushed up to francisco and screamed is it true why james said francisco smiling whats the matter why do you seem to be upset money is the root of all evilso i just got tired of being evil taggart ran toward the main exit yelling something to orren boyle on the way boyle nodded and kept on nodding with the eagerness and humility of an inefficient servant then darted of in another direction cherryl her wedding veil coiling like a crystal cloud upon the air as she ran after him caught taggart at the door jim whats the matter he pushed her aside and she fell against the stomach of paul larkin as taggart rushed out three persons stood immovably still like three pillars spaced through the room the lines of their sight cutting across the spread of the wreckage dagny looking at franciscofrancisco and rearden looking at each other chapter iii white blackmail what time is it its running out thought reardenbut he answered i dont know not yet midnight and remembering his wrist watch added twenty of im going to take a train home said lillian he heard the sentence but it had to wait its turn to enter the crowded passages to his consciousness he stood looking absently at the living room of his suite a few minutes elevator ride away from the party in a moment he answered automatically at this hour its still early there are plenty of trains running youre welcome to stay here of course no i think i prefer to go home he did not argue what about you henry do you intend going home tonight no he added i have business appointments here tomorrow as you wish she shrugged her evening wrap off her shoulders caught it on her arm and started toward the door of his bedroom but stopped i hate francisco danconia she said tensely why did he have to come to that party and didnt he know enough to keep his mouth shut at least till tomorrow morning he did not answer its monstrouswhat hes allowed to happen to his company of course hes nothing but a rotten playboystill a fortune of that size is a responsibility theres a limit to the negligence a man can permit himself he glanced at her face it was oddly tense the features sharpened making her look older he owed a certain duty to his stockholders didnt he didnt he henry do you mind if we dont discuss it she made a tightening sidewise movement with her lips the equivalent of a shrug and walked into the bedroom he stood at the window looking down at the streaming roofs of automobiles letting his eyes rest on something while his faculty of sight was disconnected his mind was still focused on the crowd in the ballroom downstairs and on two figures in that crowd but as his living room remained on the edge of his vision so the sense of some action he had to perform remained on the edge of his consciousness he grasped it for a momentit was the fact that he had to remove his evening clothesbut farther beyond the edge there was the feeling of reluctance to undress in the presence of a strange woman in his bedroom and he forgot it again in the next moment lillian came out as trimly groomed as she had arrived the beige traveling suit outlining her figure with efficient tightness the hat tilted over half a head of hair set in waves she carried her suitcase swinging it a little as if in demonstration of her ability to carry it he reached over mechanically and took the suitcase out of her hand what are you doing she asked im going to take you to the station like this you havent changed your clothes it doesnt matter you dont have to escort me im quite able to find my own way if you have business appointments tomorrow youd better go to bed he did not answer but walked to the door held it open for her and followed her to the elevator they remained silent when they rode in a taxicab to the station at such moments as he remembered her presence he noticed that she sat efficiently straight almost flaunting the perfection of her poise she seemed alertly awake and contented as if she were starting out on a purposeful journey of early morning the cab stopped at the entrance to the taggart terminal the bright lights flooding the great glass doorway transformed the lateness of the hour into a sense of active timeless security lillian jumped lightly out of the cab saying no no you dont have to get out drive on back will you be home for dinner tomorrowor next month ill telephone you he said she waved her gloved hand at him and disappeared into the lights of the entrance as the cab started forward he gave the driver the address of dagnys apartment the apartment was dark when he entered but the door to her bedroom was halfopen and he heard her voice saying hello hank he walked in asking were you asleep no he switched on the light she lay in bed her head propped by the pillow her hair falling smoothly to her shoulders as if she had not moved for a long time but her face was untroubled she looked like a schoolgirl with the tailored collar of a pale blue nightgown lying severely high at the base of her throat the nightgowns front was a deliberate contrast to the severity a spread of pale blue embroidery that looked luxuriously adult and feminine he sat down on the edge of the bedand she smiled noticing that the stern formality of his full dress clothes made his action so simply naturally intimate he smiled in answer he had come prepared to reject the forgiveness she had granted him at the party as one rejects a favor from too generous an adversary instead he reached out suddenly and moved his hand over her forehead down the line of her hair in a gesture of protective tenderness in the sudden feeling of how delicately childlike she was this adversary who had borne the constant challenge of his strength but who should have had his protection youre carrying bo much he said and its i who make it harder for you no hank you dont and you know it i know that you have the strength not to let it hurt you but its a strength i have no right to call upon yet i do and i have no solution no atonement to offer i can only admit that i know it and that theres no way i can ask you to forgive me theres nothing to forgive i had no right to bring her into your presence it did not hurt me only yes only seeing the way you suffered was hard to see i dont think that suffering makes up for anything but whatever i felt i didnt suffer enough if theres one thing i loathe its to speak of my own sufferingthat should be no ones concern but mine but if you want to know since you know it alreadyyes it was hell for me and i wish it were worse at least im not letting myself get away with it he said it sternly without emotion as an impersonal verdict upon himself she smiled in amused sadness she took his hand and pressed it to her lips and shook her head in rejection of the verdict holding her face hidden against his hand what do you mean he asked softly nothing then she raised her head and said firmly hank i knew you were married i knew what i was doing i chose to do it theres nothing that you owe me no duty that you have to consider he shook his head slowly in protest hank i want nothing from you except what you wish to give me do you remember that you called me a trader once i want you to come to me seeking nothing but your own enjoyment so long as you wish to remain married whatever your reason i have no right to resent it my way of trading is to know that the joy you give me is paid for by the joy you get from menot by your suffering or mine i dont accept sacrifices and i dont make them if you asked me for more than you meant to me i would refuse if you asked me to give up the railroad id leave you if ever the pleasure of one has to be bought by the pain of the other there better be no trade at all a trade by which one gains and the other loses is a fraud you dont do it in business hank dont do it in your own life like a dim sound track under her words he was hearing the words said to him by lillian he was seeing the distance between the two the difference in what they sought from him and from life dagny what do you think of my marriage i have no right to think of it you must have wondered about it i did before i came to ellis wyatts house not since youve never asked me a question about it and wont he was silent for a moment then said looking straight at her underscoring his first rejection of the privacy she had always granted him theres one thing i want you to know i have not touched her since ellis wyatts house im glad did you think i could ive never permitted myself to wonder about that dagny do you mean that if i had you youd accept that too yes you wouldnt hate it id hate it more than i can tell you but if that were your choice i would accept it i want you hank he took her hand and raised it to his lips she felt the moments struggle in his body in the sudden movement with which he came down halfcollapsing and let his mouth cling to her shoulder then he pulled her forward he pulled the length of her body in the pale blue nightgown to lie stretched across his knees he held it with an unsmiling violence as if in hatred for her words and as if they were the words he had most wanted to hear he bent his face down to hers and she heard the question that had come again and again in the nights of the year behind them always torn out of him involuntarily always as a sudden break that betrayed his constant secret torture who was your first man she strained back trying to draw away from him but he held her no hank she said her face hard the brief taut movement of his lips was a smile i know that you wont answer it but i wont stop askingbecause that is what ill never accept ask yourself why you wont accept it he answered his hand moving slowly from her breasts to her knees as if stressing his ownership and hating it because the things youve permitted me to do i didnt think you could not ever not even for me but to find that you did and more that you had permitted another man had wanted him to had do you understand what youre saying that youve never accepted my wanting you eitheryouve never accepted that i should want you just as i should have wanted him once he said his voice low thats true she tore herself away from him with a brusque twisting movement she stood up but she stood looking down at him with a faint smile and she said softly do you know your only real guilt with the greatest capacity for it youve never learned to enjoy yourself youve always rejected your own pleasure too easily youve been willing to bear too much he said that too who francisco danconia he wondered why he had the impression that the name shocked her and that she answered an instant too late he said that to you we were talking about quite a different subject in a moment she said calmly i saw you talking to him which one of you was insulting the other this time we werent dagny what do you think of him i think that hes done it intentionallythat smashup were in for tomorrow i know he has still what do you think of him as a person i dont know i ought to think that hes the most depraved person ive ever met you ought to but you dont no i cant quite make myself feel certain of it he smiled thats whats strange about him i know that hes a liar a loafer a cheap playboy the most viciously irresponsible waste of a human being i ever imagined possible yet when i look at him i feel that if ever there was a man to whom i would entrust my life hes the one she gasped hank are you saying that you like him im saying that i didnt know what it meant to like a man i didnt know how much i missed ituntil i met him good god hank youve fallen for him yesi think i have he smiled why does it frighten you because because i think hes going to hurt you in some terrible way and the more you see in him the harder it will be to bear and it will take you a long time to get over it if ever i feel that i ought to warn you against him but i cantbecause im certain of nothing about him not even whether hes the greatest or the lowest man on earth im certain of nothing about himexcept that i like him but think of what hes done its not jim and boyle that hes hurt its you and me and ken danagger and the rest of us because jims gang will merely take it out on usand its going to be another disaster like the wyatt fire yes yes like the wyatt fire but you know i dont think i care too much about that whats one more disaster everythings going anyway its only a question of a little faster or a little slower all thats left for us ahead is to keep the ship afloat as long as we can and then go down with it is that his excuse for himself is that what hes made you feel no oh no thats the feeling i lose when i speak to him the strange thing is what he does make me feel what hope she nodded in helpless wonder knowing that she had felt it too i dont know why he said but i look at people and they seem to be made of nothing but pain hes not youre not that terrible hopelessness thats all around us i lose it only in his presence and here nowhere else she came back to him and slipped down to sit at his feet pressing her face to his knees hank we still have so much ahead of us and so much right now he looked at the shape of pale blue silk huddled against the black of his clotheshe bent down to herhe said his voice low dagny the things i said to you that morning in ellis wyatts house i think i was lying to myself i know it through a gray drizzle of rain the calendar above the roofs said september and a clock on another tower said as rearden rode back to the waynefalkland hotel the cabs radio was spitting out shrilly the sounds of a panictinged voice announcing the crash of danconia copper rearden leaned wearily against the seat the disaster seemed to be no more than a stale news story read long ago he felt nothing except an uncomfortable sense of impropriety at finding himself out in the morning streets dressed in evening clothes he felt no desire to return from the world he had left to the world he saw drizzling past the windows of the taxi he turned the key in the door of his hotel suite hoping to get back to a desk as fast as possible and have to see nothing around him they hit his consciousness together the breakfast tablethe door to his bedroom open upon the sight of a bed that had been slept inand lillians voice saying good morning henry she sat in an armchair wearing the suit she had worn yesterday without the jacket or hat her white blouse looked smugly crisp there were remnants of a breakfast on the table she was smoking a cigarette with the air and pose of a long patient vigil as he stood still she took the time to cross her legs and settle down more comfortably then asked arent you going to say anything henry he stood like a man in military uniform at some official proceedings where emotions could not be permitted to exist it is for you to speak arent you going to try to justify yourself no arent you going to start begging my forgiveness there is no reason why you should forgive me there is nothing for me to add you know the truth now it is up to you she chuckled stretching rubbing her shoulder blades against the chairs back didnt you expect to be caught sooner or later she asked if a man like you stays pure as a monk for over a year didnt you think that i might begin to suspect the reason its funny though that that famous brain of yours didnt prevent you from getting caught as simply as this she waved at the room at the breakfast table i felt certain that you werent going to return here last night and it wasnt difficult or expensive at all to find out from a hotel employee this morning that you havent spent a night in these rooms in the past year he said nothing the man of stainless steel she laughed the man of achievement and honor whos so much better than the rest of us does she dance in the chorus or is she a manicurist in an exclusive barber shop patronized by millionaires he remained silent who is she henry i wont answer that i want to know youre not going to dont you think its ridiculous your playing the part of a gentleman whos protecting the ladys nameor of any sort of gentleman from now on who is she i said i wont answer she shrugged i suppose it makes no difference theres only one standard type for the one standard purpose ive always known that under that ascetic look of yours you were a plain crude sensualist who sought nothing from a woman except an animal satisfaction which i pride myself on not having given you i knew that your vaunted sense of honor would collapse some day and you would be drawn to the lowest cheapest type of female just like any other cheating husband she chuckled that great admirer of yours miss dagny taggart was furious at me for the mere hint of a suggestion that her hero wasnt as pure as his stainless noncorrosive rail and she was naive enough to imagine that i could suspect her of being the type men find attractive for a relationship in which what they seek is most notoriously not brains i knew your real nature and inclinations didnt i he said nothing do you know what think of you now you have the right to condemn me in any way you wish she laughed the great man who was so contemptuousin businessof weaklings who trimmed corners or fell by the wayside because they couldnt match his strength of character and steadfastness of purpose how do you feel about it now my feelings need not concern you you have the right to decide what you wish me to do i will agree to any demand you make except one dont ask me to give it up oh i wouldnt ask you to give it up i wouldnt expect you to change your nature this is your true levelunder all that selfmade grandeur of a knight of industry who rose by sheer genius from the ore mine gutters to finger bowls and white tie it fits you welt that white tie to come home in at eleven oclock in the morning you never rose out of the ore mines thats where you belongall of you selfmade princes of the cash registerin the corner saloon on saturday night with the traveling salesmen and the dancehall girls do you wish to divorce me oh wouldnt you like that wouldnt that be a smart trade to pull dont you suppose i know that youve wanted to divorce me since the first month of our marriage if that is what you thought why did you stay with me she answered severely its a question you have lost the right to ask thats true he said thinking that only one conceivable reason her love for him could justify her answer no im not going to divorce you do you suppose that i will allow your romance with a floozie to deprive me of my home my name my social position i shall preserve such pieces of my life as i can whatever does not rest on so shoddy a foundation as your fidelity make no mistake about it i shall never give you a divorce whether you like it or not youre married and youll stay married i will if that is what you wish and furthermore i will not considerincidentally why dont you sit down he remained standing please say what you have to say i will not consider any unofficial divorce such as a separation you may continue your love idyll in the subways and basements where it belongs but in the eyes of the world i will expect you to remember that i am mrs henry rearden you have always proclaimed such an exaggerated devotion to honestynow let me see you be condemned to the life of the hypocrite that you really are i will expect you to maintain your residence at the home which is officially yours but will now be mine if you wish she leaned back loosely in a manner of untidy relaxation her legs spread apart her arms resting in two strict parallels on the arms of the chairlike a judge who could permit himself to be sloppy divorce she said chuckling coldly did you think youd get off as easily as that did you think youd get by at the price of a few of your millions tossed off as alimony youre so used to purchasing whatever you wish by the simple means of your dollars that you cannot conceive of things that are noncommercial nonnegotiable nonsubject to any kind of trade youre unable to believe that there may exist a person who feels no concern for money you cannot imagine what that means well i think youre going to learn oh yes of course youll agree to any demand i make from now on i want you to sit in that office of which youre so proud in those precious mills of yours and play the hero who works eighteen hours a day the giant of industry who keeps the whole country going the genius who is above the common herd of whining lying chiseling humanity then i want you to come home and face the only person who knows you for what you really are who knows the actual value of your word of your honor of your integrity of your vaunted selfesteem i want you to face in your own home the one person who despises you and has the right to do so i want you to look at me whenever you build another furnace or pour another record breaking load of steel or hear applause and admiration whenever you feel proud of yourself whenever you feel clean whenever you feel drunk on the sense of your own greatness i want you to look at me whenever you hear of some act of depravity or feel anger at human corruption or feel contempt for someones knavery or are the victim of a new governmental extortionto look and to know that youre no better that youre superior to no one that theres nothing you have the right to condemn i want you to look at me and to learn the fate of the man who tried to build a tower to the sky or the man who wanted to reach the sun on wings made of waxor you the man who wanted to hold himself as perfect somewhere outside of him and apart as if he were reading it in a brain not his own he observed the thought that there was some flaw in the scheme of the punishment she wanted him to bear something wrong by its own terms aside from its propriety or justice some practical miscalculation that would demolish it all if discovered he did not attempt to discover it the thought went by as a moments notation made in cold curiosity to be brought back in some distant future there was nothing within him now with which to feel interest or to respond his own brain was numb with the effort to hold the last of his sense of justice against so overwhelming a tide of revulsion that it swamped lillian out of human form past all his pleas to himself that he had no right to feel it if she was loathsome he thought it was he who had brought her to it this was her way of taking painno one could prescribe the form of a human beings attempt to bear sufferingno one could blameabove all not he who had caused it but he saw no evidence of pain in her manner then perhaps the ugliness was the only means she could summon to hide it he thought then he thought of nothing except of withstanding the revulsion for the length of the next moment and of the next when she stopped speaking he asked have you finished yes i believe so then you had better take the train home now when he undertook the motions necessary to remove his evening clothes he discovered that his muscles felt as if he were at the end of a long day of physical labor his starched shirt was limp with sweat there was neither thought nor feeling left in him nothing but a sense that merged the remnants of both the sense of congratulation upon the greatest victory he had ever demanded of himself that lillian had walked out of the hotel suite alive entering reardens office dr floyd ferris wore the expression of a man so certain of the success of his quest that he could afford a benevolent smile he spoke with a smooth cheerful assurance rearden had the impression that it was the assurance of a cardsharp who has spent a prodigious effort in memorizing every possible variation of the pattern and is now safe in the knowledge that every card in the deck is marked well mr rearden he said by way of greeting i didnt know that even a hardened hound of public functions and shaker of famous hands like myself could still get a thrill out of meeting an eminent man but thats what i feel right now believe it or not how do you do said rearden dr ferris sat down and made a few remarks about the colors of the leaves in the month of october as he had observed them by the roadside on his long drive from washington undertaken specifically for the purpose of meeting mr rearden in person rearden said nothing dr ferris looked out the window and commented on the inspiring sight of the rearden mills which he said were one of the most valuable productive enterprises in the country that is not what you thought of my product a year and a half ago said rearden dr ferris gave a brief frown as if a dot of the pattern had slipped and almost cost him the game then chuckled as if he had recaptured it that was a year and a half ago mr rearden he said easily times change and people change with the timesthe wise ones do wisdom lies in knowing when to remember and when to forget consistency is not a habit of mind which it is wise to practice or to expect of the human race he then proceeded to discourse upon the foolishness of consistency in a world where nothing was absolute except the principle of compromise he talked earnestly but in a casual manner as if they both understood that this was not the main subject of their interview yet oddly he spoke not in the tone of a foreword but in the tone of a postscript as if the main subject had been settled long ago rearden waited for the first dont you think so and answered please state the urgent matter for which you requested this appointment dr ferris looked astonished and blank for a moment then said brightly as if remembering an unimportant subject which could be disposed of without effort oh that that was in regard to the dates of delivery of rearden metal to the state science institute we should like to have five thousand tons by the first of december and then well be quite agreeable to waiting for the balance of the order until after the first of the year rearden sat looking at him silently for a long time each passing moment had the effect of making the gay intonations of dr ferris voice still hanging in the air of the room seem more foolish when dr ferris had begun to dread that he would not answer at all rearden answered hasnt the traffic cop with the leather leggings whom you sent here given you a report on his conversation with me why yes mr rearden but what else do you want to hear but that was five months ago mr rearden a certain event has taken place since which makes me quite sure that you have changed your mind and that you will make no trouble for us at all just as we will make no trouble for you what event an event of which you have far greater knowledge than ibut you see i do have knowledge of it even though you would much prefer me to have none what event since it is your secret mr rearden why not let it remain a secret who doesnt have secrets nowadays for instance project x is a secret you realize of course that we could obtain your metal simply by having it purchased in smaller quantities by various government offices who would then transfer it to usand you would not be able to prevent it but this would necessitate our letting a lot of lousy bureaucratsdr ferris smiled with disarming franknessoh yes we are as unpopular with one another as we are with you private citizensit would necessitate our letting a lot of other bureaucrats in on the secret of project x which would be highly undesirable at this time and so would any newspaper publicity about the projectif we put you on trial for refusal to comply with a government order but if you had to stand trial on another much more serious charge where project x and the state science institute were not involved and where you could not raise any issue of principle or arouse any public sympathywhy that would not inconvenience us at all but it would cost you more than you would care to contemplate therefore the only practical thing for you to do is to help us keep our secret and get us to help you keep yoursand as im sure you realize we are fully able to keep any of the bureaucrats safely off your trail for as long as we wish what event what secret and what trail oh come mr rearden dont be childish the four thousand tons of rearden metal which you delivered to ken danagger of course said dr ferris lightly rearden did not answer issues of principle are such a nuisance said dr ferris smiling and such a waste of time for all concerned now would you care to be a martyr for an issue of principle only in circumstances where nobody will know that thats what you arenobody but you and mewhere you wont get a chance to breathe a word about the issue or the principlewhere you wont be a hero the creator of a spectacular new metal making a stand against enemies whose actions might appear somewhat shabby in the eyes of the publicwhere you wont be a hero but a common criminal a greedy industrialist whos cheated the law for a plain motive of profit a racketeer of the black market whos broken the national regulations designed to protect the public welfarea hero without glory and without public wholl accomplish no more than about half a column of newsprint somewhere on page fivenow would you still care to be that kind of martyr because thats just what the issue amounts to now either you let us have the metal or you go to jail for ten years and take your friend danagger along too as a biologist dr ferris had always been fascinated by the theory that animals had the capacity to smell fear he had tried to develop a similar capacity in himself watching rearden he concluded that the man had long since decided to give inbecause he caught no trace of any fear who was your informer asked rearden one of your friends mr rearden the owner of a copper mine in arizona who reported to us that you had purchased an extra amount of copper last month above the regular tonnage required for the monthly quota of rearden metal which the law permits you to produce copper is one of the ingredients of rearden metal isnt it that was all the information we needed the rest was easy to trace you mustnt blame that mine owner too much the copper producers as you know are being squeezed so badly right now that the man had to offer something of value in order to obtain a favor an emergency need ruling which suspended a few of the directives in his case and gave him a little breathing spell the person to whom he traded his information knew where it would have the highest value so he traded it to me in return for certain favors he needed so all the necessary evidence as well as the next ten years of your life are now in my possessionand i am offering you a trade im sure you wont object since trade is your specialty the form may be a little different from what it was in your youthbut youre a smart trader youve always known how to take advantage of changing conditions and these are the conditions of our day so it should not be difficult for you to see where your interests lie and to act accordingly rearden said calmly in my youth this was called blackmail dr ferris grinned thats what it is mr rearden weve entered a much more realistic age but there was a peculiar difference thought rearden between the manner of a plain blackmailer and that of dr ferris a blackmailer would show signs of gloating over his victims sin and of acknowledging its evil he would suggest a threat to the victim and a sense of danger to them both dr ferris conveyed none of it his manner was that of dealing with the normal and the natural it suggested a sense of safety it held no tone of condemnation but a hint of comradeship a comradeship basedfor both of themon selfcontempt the sudden feeling that made rearden lean forward in a posture of eager attentiveness was the feeling that he was about to discover another step along his half glimpsed trail seeing reardens look of interest dr ferris smiled and congratulated himself on having caught the right key the game was clear to him now the markings of the pattern were falling in the right order some men thought dr ferris would do anything so long as it was left unnamed but this man wanted frankness this was the tough realist he had expected to find youre a practical man mr rearden said dr ferris amiably i cant understand why you should want to stay behind the times why dont you adjust yourself and play it right youre smarter than most of them youre a valuable person weve wanted you for a long time and when i heard that you were trying to string along with jim taggart i knew you could be had dont bother with jim taggart hes nothing hes just fleabait get into the big game we can use you and you can use us want us to step on orren boyle for you hes given you an awful beating want us to trim him down a little it can be done or want us to keep ken danagger in line look how impractical youve been about that i know why you sold him the metalits because you need him to get coal from so you take a chance on going to jail and paying huge fines just to keep on the good side of ken danagger do you call that good business now make a deal with us and just let mr danagger understand that if he doesnt toe the line hell go to jail but you wont because youve got friends he hasnt gotand youll never have to worry about your coal supply from then on now thats the modern way of doing business ask yourself which way is more practical and whatever anyones said about you nobodys ever denied that youre a great businessman and a hardheaded realist thats what i am said rearden thats what i thought said dr ferris you rose to riches in an age when most men were going bankrupt youve always managed to blast obstacles to keep your mills going and to make moneythats your reputationso you wouldnt want to be impractical now would you what for what do you care so long as you make money leave the theories to people like bertram scudder and the ideals to people like balph eubankand be yourself come down to earth youre not the man whod let sentiment interfere with business no said rearden slowly i wouldnt not any kind of sentiment dr ferris smiled dont you suppose we knew it he said his tone suggesting that he was letting his patentleather hair down to impress a fellow criminal by a display of superior cunning weve waited a long time to get something on you you honest men are such a problem and such a headache but we knew youd slip sooner or laterand this is just what we wanted you seem to be pleased about it dont i have good reason to be but after all i did break one of your laws well what do you think theyre for dr ferris did not notice the sudden look on reardens face the look of a man hit by the first vision of that which he had sought to see dr ferris was past the stage of seeing he was intent upon delivering the last blows to an animal caught in a trap did you really think that we want those laws to be observed said dr ferris we want them broken youd better get it straight that its not a bunch of boy scouts youre up againstthen youll know that this is not the age for beautiful gestures were after power and we mean it you fellows were pikers but we know the real trick and youd better get wise to it theres no way to rule innocent men the only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals well when there arent enough criminals one makes them one declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws who wants a nation of lawabiding citizens whats there in that for anyone but just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced nor objectively interpretedand you create a nation of lawbreakersand then you cash in on guilt now thats the system mr rearden thats the game and once you understand it youll be much easier to deal with watching dr ferris watch him rearden saw the sudden twitch of anxiety the look that precedes panic as if a clean card had fallen on the table from a deck dr ferris had never seen before what dr ferris was seeing in reardens face was the look of luminous serenity that comes from the sudden answer to an old dark problem a look of relaxation and eagerness together there was a youthful clarity in reardens eyes and the faintest touch of contempt in the line of his mouth whatever this meantand dr ferris could not decipher it he was certain of one thing the face held no sign of guilt theres a flaw in your system dr ferris rearden said quietly almost lightly a practical flaw which you will discover when you put me on trial for selling four thousand tons of rearden metal to ken danagger it took twenty secondsrearden could feel them moving past slowlyat the end of which dr ferris became convinced that he had heard reardens final decision do you think were bluffing snapped dr ferris his voice suddenly had the quality of the animals he had spent so much time studying it sounded as if he were baring his teeth i dont know said rearden i dont care one way or the other are you going to be as impractical as that the evaluation of an action as practical dr ferris depends on what it is that one wishes to practice havent you always placed your selfinterest above all else that is what i am doing right now if you think well let you get away with a you will now please get out of here whom do you think youre fooling dr ferris voice had risen close to the edge of a scream the day of the barons of industry is done youve got the goods but weve got the goods on you and youre going to play it our way or youll rearden had pressed a button miss ives entered the office dr ferris has become confused and has lost his way miss ives said rearden will you escort him out please he turned to ferris miss ives is a woman she weighs about a hundred pounds and she has no practical qualifications at all only a superlative intellectual efficiency she would never do for a bouncer in a saloon only in an impractical place such as a factory miss ives looked as if she was performing a duty of no greater emotional significance than taking dictation about a list of shipping invoices standing straight in a disciplined manner of icy formality she held the door open let dr ferris cross the room then walked out first dr ferris followed she came back a few minutes later laughing in uncontrollable exultation mr rearden she asked laughing at her fear for him at their danger at everything but the triumph of the moment what is it youre doing he sat in a pose he had never permitted himself before a pose he had resented as the most vulgar symbol of the businessmanhe sat leaning back in his chair with his feet on his deskand it seemed to her that the posture had an air of peculiar nobility that it was not the pose of a stuffy executive but of a young crusader i think im discovering a new continent owen he answered cheerfully a continent that should have been discovered along with america but wasnt i have to speak of it to you said eddie willers looking at the worker across the table i dont know why it helps me but it doesjust to know that youre hearing me it was late and the lights of the underground cafeteria were low but eddie willers could see the workers eyes looking at him intently i feel as if as if theres no people and no human language left said eddie willers i feel that if i were to scream in the middle of the streets there would be no one to hear it no thats not quite what i feel its this i feel that someone is screaming in the middle of the streets but people are passing by and no sound can reach them and its not hank rearden or ken danagger or i whos screaming and yet it seems as if its all three of us dont you see that somebody should have risen to defend them but nobody has or will rearden and danagger were indicted this morningfor an illegal sale of rearden metal theyll go on trial next month i was there in the courtroom in philadelphia when they read the indictment rearden was very calmi kept feeling that he was smiling but he wasnt danagger was worse than calm he didnt say a word he just stood there as if the room were empty the newspapers are saying that both of them should be thrown in jail no no im not shaking im all right ill be all right in a moment thats why i havent said a word to her i was afraid id explode and i didnt want to make it harder for her i know how she feels oh yes she spoke to me about it and she didnt shake but it was worseyou know the kind of rigidity when a person acts as if she didnt feel anything at all and listen did i ever tell you that i like you i like you very muchfor the way you look right now you hear us you understand what did she say it was strange its not hank rearden that shes afraid for its ken danagger she said that rearden will have the strength to take it but danagger wont not that hell lack the strength but hell refuse to take it she she feels certain that ken danagger will be the next one to go to go like ellis wyatt and all those others to give up and vanish why well she thinks that theres something like a shift of stress involvedeconomic and personal stress as soon as all the weight of the moment shifts to the shoulders of some one manhes the one who vanishes like a pillar slashed off a year ago nothing worse could have happened to the country than to lose ellis wyatt hes the one we lost since then she says its been as if the center of gravity were swinging wildlylike in a sinking cargo ship out of controlshifting from industry to industry from man to man when we lose one another becomes that much more desperately neededand hes the one we lose next well what could be a greater disaster now than to have the countrys coal supply left in the hands of men like boyle or larkin and theres no one left in the coal industry who amounts to much except ken danagger so she says that she feels almost as if hes a marked man as if hes hit by a spotlight right now waiting to be cut down what are you laughing at it might sound preposterous but i think its true what oh yes you bet shes a smart woman and then theres another thing involved she says a man has to come to a certain mental stagenot anger or despair but something much much more than bothbefore he can be cut down she cant tell what it is but she knew long before the fire that ellis wyatt had reached that stage and something would happen to him when she saw ken danagger in the courtroom today she said that he was ready for the destroyer yes thats the words she used he was ready for the destroyer you see she doesnt think its happening by chance or accident she thinks theres a system behind it an intention a man theres a destroyer loose in the country whos cutting down the buttresses one after another to let the structure collapse upon our heads some ruthless creature moved by some inconceivable purpose she says that she wont let him get ken danagger she keeps repeating that she must stop danaggershe wants to speak to him to beg to plead to revive whatever it is that hes losing to arm him against the destroyer before the destroyer comes shes desperately anxious to reach danagger first he has refused to see anyone hes gone back to pittsburgh to his mines but she got him on the phone late today and shes made an appointment to see him tomorrow afternoon yes shell go to pittsburgh tomorrow yes shes afraid for danagger terribly afraid no she knows nothing about the destroyer she has no clue to his identity no evidence of his existenceexcept the trail of destruction but she feels certain that he exists no she cannot guess his purpose she says that nothing on earth could justify him there are times when she feels that shed like to find him more than any other man in the world more than the inventor of the motor she says that if she found the destroyer shed shoot him on sightshed be willing to give her life if she could take his first and by her own hand because hes the most evil creature thats ever existed the man whos draining the brains of the world i guess its getting to be too much for her at timeseven for her i dont think she allows herself to know how tired she is the other morning i came to work very early and i found her asleep on the couch in her office with the light still burning on her desk shed been there all night i just stood and looked at her i wouldnt have awakened her if the whole goddamn railroad collapsed when she was asleep why she looked like a young girl she looked as if she felt certain that she would awaken in a world where no one would harm her as if she had nothing to hide or to fear thats what was terriblethat guiltless purity of her face with her body twisted by exhaustion still lying there as she had collapsed she lookedsay why should you ask me what she looks like when shes asleep yes youre right why do i talk about it i shouldnt i dont know what made me think of it dont pay any attention to me ill be all right tomorrow i guess its just that im sort of shellshocked by that courtroom i keep thinking if men like rearden and danagger are to be sent to jail then what kind of world are we working in and what for isnt there any justice left on earth i was foolish enough to say that to a reporter when we were leaving the courtroomand he just laughed and said who is john galt tell me whats happening to us isnt there a single man of justice left isnt there anyone to defend them oh do you hear me isnt there anyone to defend them mr danagger will be free in a moment miss taggart he has a visitor in his office will you excuse it please said the secretary through the two hours of her flight to pittsburgh dagny had been tensely unable to justify her anxiety or to dismiss it there was no reason to count minutes yet she had felt a blind desire to hurry the anxiety vanished when she entered the anteroom of ken danaggers office she had reached him nothing had happened to prevent it she felt safety confidence and an enormous sense of relief the words of the secretary demolished it youre becoming a cowardthought dagny feeling a causeless jolt of dread at the words out of all proportion to their meaning i am so sorry miss taggart she heard the secretarys respectful solicitous voice and realized that she had stood there without answering mr danagger will be with you in just a moment wont you sit down the voice conveyed an anxious concern over the impropriety of keeping her waiting dagny smiled oh thats quite all right she sat down in a wooden armchair facing the secretarys railing she reached for a cigarette and stopped wondering whether she would have time to finish it hoping that she would not then lighted it brusquely it was an oldfashioned frame building this headquarters of the great danagger coal company somewhere in the hills beyond the window were the pits where ken danagger had once worked as a miner he had never moved his office away from the coal fields she could see the mine entrances cut into the hillsides small frames of metal girders that led to an immense underground kingdom they seemed precariously modest lost in the violent orange and red of the hills under a harsh blue sky in the sunlight of late october the sea of leaves looked like a sea of fire like waves rolling to swallow the fragile posts of the mine doorways she shuddered and looked away she thought of the flaming leaves spread over the hills of wisconsin on the road to starnesville she noticed that there was only a stub left of the cigarette between her fingers she lighted another when she glanced at the clock on the wall of the anteroom she caught the secretary glancing at it at the same time her appointment was for three oclock the white dial said please forgive it miss taggart said the secretary mr danagger will be through any moment now mr danagger is extremely punctual about ms appointments please believe me that this is unprecedented i know it she knew that ken danagger was as rigidly exact about his schedule as a railroad timetable and that he had been known to cancel an interview if a caller permitted himself to arrive five minutes late the secretary was an elderly spinster with a forbidding manner a manner of eventoned courtesy impervious to any shock just as her spotless white blouse was impervious to an atmosphere filled with coal dust dagny thought it strange that a hardened welltrained woman of this type should appear to be nervous she volunteered no conversation she sat still bent over some pages of paper on her desk half of dagnys cigarette had gone in smoke while the woman still sat looking at the same page when she raised her head to glance at the clock the ial said i know that this is inexcusable miss taggart the note of apprehension was obvious in her voice now i am unable to understand it would you mind telling mr danagger that im here i cant it was almost a cry she saw dagnys astonished glance and felt obliged to explain mr danagger called me on the interoffice communicator and told me that he was not to be interrupted under any circumstances or for any reason whatever when did he do that the moments pause was like a small air cushion for the answer two hours ago dagny looked at the closed door of danaggers office she could hear the sound of a voice beyond the door but so faintly that she could not tell whether it was the voice of one man or the conversation of two she could not distinguish the words or the emotional quality of the tone it was only a low even progression of sounds that seemed normal and did not convey the pitch of raised voices how long has mr danagger been in conference she asked since one oclock said the secretary grimly then added in apology it was an unscheduled caller or mr danagger would never have permitted this to happen the door was not locked thought dagny she felt an unreasoning desire to tear it open and walk init was only a few wooden boards with a brass knob it would require only a small muscular contraction of her armbut she looked away knowing that the power of a civilized order and of ken danaggers right was more impregnable a barrier than any lock she found herself staring at the stubs of her cigarettes in the ashtray stand beside her and wondered why it gave her a sharper feeling of apprehension then she realized that she was thinking of hugh akston she had written to him at his diner in wyoming asking him to tell her where he had obtained the cigarette with the dollar sign her letter had come back with a postal inscription to inform her that he had moved away leaving no forwarding address she told herself angrily that this had no connection with the present moment and that she had to control her nerves but her hand jerked to press the button of the ashtray and make the cigarette stubs vanish inside the stand as she looked up her eyes met the glance of the secretary watching her i am sorry miss taggart i dont know what to do about it it was an openly desperate plea i dont dare interrupt dagny asked slowly as a demand in defiance of office etiquette who is with mr danagger i dont know miss taggart i have never seen the gentleman before she noticed the sudden fixed stillness of dagnys eyes and added i think its a childhood friend of mr danagger oh said dagny relieved he came in unannounced and asked to see mr danagger and said that this was an appointment which mr danagger had made with him forty years ago how old is mr danagger fiftytwo said the secretary she added reflectively in the tone of a casual remark mr danagger started working at the age of twelve after another silence she added the strange thing is that the visitor does not look as if hes even forty years old he seems to be a man in his thirties did he give his name no what does he look like the secretary smiled with sudden animation as if she were about to utter an enthusiastic compliment but the smile vanished abruptly i dont know she answered uneasily hes hard to describe he has a strange face they had been silent for a long time and the hands of the dial were approaching when the buzzer rang on the secretarys deskthe bell from danaggers office the signal of permission to enter they both leaped to their feet and the secretary rushed forward smiling with relief hastening to open the door as she entered danaggers office dagny saw the private exit door closing after the caller who had preceded her she heard the knock of the door against the jamb and the faint tinkle of the glass panel she saw the man who had left by his reflection on ken danaggers face it was not the face she had seen in the courtroom it was not the face she had known for years as a countenance of unchanging unfeeling rigidityit was a face which a young man of twenty should hope for but could not achieve a face from which every sign of strain had been wiped out so that the lined cheeks the creased forehead the graying hairlike elements rearranged by a new themewere made to form a composition of hope eagerness and guiltless serenity the theme was deliverance he did not rise when she enteredhe looked as if he had not quite returned to the reality of the moment and had forgotten the proper routinebut he smiled at her with such simple benevolence that she found herself smiling in answer she caught herself thinking that this was the way every human being should greet anotherand she lost her anxiety feeling suddenly certain that all was well and that nothing to be feared could exist how do you do miss taggart he said forgive me i think that i have kept you waiting please sit down he pointed to the chair in front of his desk i didnt mind waiting she said im grateful that you gave me this appointment i was extremely anxious to speak to you on a matter of urgent importance he leaned forward across the desk with a look of attentive concentration as he always did at the mention of an important business matter but she was not speaking to the man she knew this was a stranger and she stopped uncertain about the arguments she had been prepared to use he looked at her in silence and then he said miss taggart this is such a beautiful dayprobably the last this year theres a thing ive always wanted to do but never had time for it lets go back to new york together and take one of those excursion boat trips around the island of manhattan lets take a last look at the greatest city in the world she sat still trying to hold her eyes fixed in order to stop the office from swaying this was the ken danagger who had never had a personal friend had never married had never attended a play or a movie had never permitted anyone the impertinence of taking his time for any concern but business mr danagger i came here to speak to you about a matter of crucial importance to the future of your business and mine i came to speak to you about your indictment oh that dont worry about that it doesnt matter im going to retire she sat still feeling nothing wondering numbly whether this was how it felt to hear a death sentence one had dreaded but had never quite believed possible her first movement was a sudden jerk of her head toward the exit door she asked her voice low her mouth distorted by hatred who was he danagger laughed if youve guessed that much you should have guessed that its a question i wont answer oh god ken danagger she moaned his words made her realize that the barrier of hopelessness of silence of unanswered questions was already erected between them the hatred had been only a thin wire that had held her for a moment and she broke with its breaking oh god youre wrong kid he said gently i know how you feel but youre wrong then added more formally as if remembering the proper manner as if still trying to balance himself between two kinds of reality im sorry miss taggart that you had to come here so soon after i came too late she said thats what i came here to prevent i knew it would happen why i felt certain that hed get you next whoever he is you did thats funny i didnt i wanted to warn you to to arm you against him he smiled take my word for it miss taggart so that you wont torture yourself with regrets about the timing that could not have been done she felt that with every passing minute he was moving away into some great distance where she would not be able to reach him but there was still some thin bridge left between them and she had to hurry she leaned forward she said very quietly the intensity of emotion taking form in the exaggerated steadiness of her voice do you remember what you thought and felt what you were three hours ago do you remember what your mines meant to you do you remember taggart transcontinental or rearden steel in the name of that will you answer me will you help me to understand i will answer whatever i may you have decided to retire to give up your business yes does it mean nothing to you now it means more to me now than it ever did before but youre going to abandon it yes why that i wont answer you who loved your work who respected nothing but work who despised every kind of aimlessness passivity and renunciationhave you renounced the kind of life you loved no i have just discovered how much i do love it but you intend to exist without work or purpose what makes you think that are you going into the coalmining business somewhere else no not into the coalmining business then what are you going to do i havent decided that yet where are you going i wont answer she gave herself a moments pause to gather her strength to tell herself dont feel dont show him that you feel anything dont let it cloud and break the bridgethen she said in the same quiet even voice do you realize what your retirement will do to hank rearden to me to all the rest of us whoever is left yes i realize it more fully than you do at present and it means nothing to you it means more than you will care to believe then why are you deserting us you will not believe it and i will not explain but i am not deserting you were being left to carry a greater burden and youre indifferent to the knowledge that youll see us destroyed by the looters dont be too sure of that of which your indifference or our destruction of either but you know you knew it this morning that its a battle to the death and its weyou were one of usagainst the looters if i answer that know it but you dontyoull think that i attach no meaning to my words so take it as you wish but that is my answer will you tell me the meaning no its for you to discover youre willing to give up the world to the looters we arent dont be too sure of either she remained helplessly silent the strangeness of his manner was its simplicity he spoke as if he were being completely natural andin the midst of unanswered questions and of a tragic mysteryhe conveyed the impression that there were no secrets any longer and no mystery need ever have existed but as she watched him she saw the first break in his joyous calm she saw him struggling against some thought he hesitated then said with effort about hank rearden will you do me a favor of course will you tell him that i you see ive never cared for people yet he was always the man i respected but i didnt know until today that what i felt was that he was the only man i ever loved just tell him this and that i wish i couldno i guess thats all i can tell him hell probably damn me for leaving still maybe he wont ill tell him hearing the dulled hidden sound of pain in his voice she felt so close to him that it seemed impossible he would deliver the blow he was deliveringand she made one last effort mr danagger if i were to plead on my knees if i were to find some sort of words that i havent foundwould there be is there a chance to stop you there isnt after a moment she asked tonelessly when are you quitting tonight what will you do withshe pointed at the hills beyond the windowthe danagger coal company to whom are you leaving it i dont knowor care to nobody or everybody to whoever wants to take it youre not going to dispose of it or appoint a successor no what for to leave it in good hands couldnt you at least name an heir of your own choice i havent any choice it doesnt make any difference to me want me to leave it all to you he reached for a sheet of paper ill write a letter naming you sole heiress right now if you want me to she shook her head in an involuntary recoil of horror im not a looter he chuckled pushing the paper aside you see you gave the right answer whether you knew it or not dont worry about danagger coal it wont make any difference whether i appoint the best successor in the world or the worst or none no matter who takes it over now whether men or weeds it wont make any difference but to walk off and abandon just abandon an industrial enterprise as if we were in the age of landless nomads or of savages wandering in the jungle arent we he was smiling at her half in mockery half in compassion why should i leave a deed or a will i dont want to help the looters to pretend that private property still exists i am complying with the system which they have established they do not need me they say they only need my coal let them take it then youre accepting their system am i she moaned looking at the exit door what has he done to you he told me that i had the right to exist i didnt believe it possible that in three hours one could make a man turn against fiftytwo years of his life if thats what you trunk hes done or if you think that hes told me some inconceivable revelation then i can see how bewildering it would appear to you but thats not what hes done he merely named what i had lived by what every man lives byat and to the extent of such time as he doesnt spend destroying himself she knew that questions were futile and that there was nothing she could say to him he looked at her bowed head and said gently youre a brave person miss taggart i know what youre doing right now and what its costing you dont torture yourself let me go she rose to her feet she was about to speakbut suddenly he saw her stare down leap forward and seize the ashtray that stood on the edge of the desk the ashtray contained a cigarette butt stamped with the sign of the dollar whats the matter miss taggart did he did he smoke this who your callerdid he smoke this cigarette why i dont know i guess so yes i think i did see him smoking a cigarette once let me see no thats not my brand so it must be his were there any other visitors in this office today no but why miss taggart whats the matter may i take this what the cigarette butt he stared at her in bewilderment yes why surebut what for she was looking down at the butt in the palm of her hand as if it were a jewel i dont know i dont know what good it will do me except that its a clue toshe smiled bitterlyto a secret of my own she stood reluctant to leave looking at ken danagger in the manner of a last look at one departing for the realm of no return he guessed it smiled and extended his hand i wont say goodbye he said because ill see you again in the not too distant future oh she said eagerly holding his hand clasped across the desk are you going to return no youre going to join me there was only a faint red breath above the structures in the darkness as if the mills were asleep but alive with the even breathing of the furnaces and the distant heartbeats of the conveyor belts to show it rearden stood at the window of his office his hand pressed to the pane in the perspective of distance his hand covered half a mile of structures as if he were trying to hold them he was looking at a long wall of vertical strips which was the battery of coke ovens a narrow door slid open with a brief gasp of flame and a sheet of redglowing coke came sliding out smoothly like a slice of bread from the side of a giant toaster it held still for an instant then an angular crack shot through the slice and it crumbled into a gondola waiting on the rails below danagger coal he thought these were the only words in his mind the rest was a feeling of loneliness so vast that even its own pain seemed swallowed in an enormous void yesterday dagny had told him the story of her futile attempt and given him danaggers message this morning he had heard the news that danagger had disappeared through his sleepless night then through the taut concentration on the duties of the day his answer to the message had kept beating in his mind the answer he would never have a chance to utter the only man i ever loved it came from ken danagger who had never expressed anything more personal than look here rearden he thought why had we let it go why had we both been condemned in the hours away from our desksto an exile among dreary strangers who had made us give up all desire for rest for friendship for the sound of human voices could i now reclaim a single hour spent listening to my brother philip and give it to ken danagger who made it our duty to accept as the only reward for our work the gray torture of pretending love for those who roused us to nothing but contempt we who were able to melt rock and metal for our purpose why had we never sought that which we wanted from men he tried to choke the words in his mind knowing that it was useless to think of them now but the words were there and they were like words addressed to the dead no i dont damn you for leavingif that is the question and the pain which you took away with you why didnt you give me a chance to tell you what that i approve no but that i can neither blame you nor follow you closing his eyes he permitted himself to experience for a moment the immense relief he would feel if he too were to walk off abandoning everything under the shock of his loss he felt a thin thread of envy why didnt they come for me too whoever they are and give me that irresistible reason which would make me go but in the next moment his shudder of anger told him that he would murder the man whod attempt to approach him he would murder before he could hear the words of the secret that would take him away from his mills it was late his staff had gone but he dreaded the road to his house and the emptiness of the evening ahead he felt as if the enemy who had wiped out ken danagger were waiting for him in the darkness beyond the glow of the mills he was not invulnerable any longer but whatever it was he thought wherever it came from he was safe from it here as in a circle of fires drawn about him to ward off evil he looked at the glittering white splashes on the dark windows of a structure in the distance they were like motionless ripples of sunlight on water it was the reflection of the neon sign that burned on the roof of the building above his head saying rearden steel he thought of the night when he had wished to light a sign above his past saying rearden life why had he wished it for whose eyes to see he thoughtin bitter astonishment and for the first timethat the joyous pride he had once felt had come from his respect for men for the value of their admiration and their judgment he did not feel it any longer there were no men he thought to whose sight he could wish to offer that sign he turned brusquely away from the window he seized his overcoat with the harsh sweep of a gesture intended to jolt him back into the discipline of action he slammed the two folds of the overcoat about his body he jerked the belt tight then hastened to turn off the lights with rapid snaps of his hand on his way out of the office he threw the door openand stopped a single lamp was burning in a corner of the dimmed anteroom the man who sat on the edge of a desk in a pose of casual patient waiting was francisco danconia rearden stood still and caught a brief instant when francisco not moving looked at him with the hint of an amused smile that was like a wink between conspirators at a secret they both understood but would not acknowledge it was only an instant almost too brief to grasp because it seemed to him that francisco rose at once at his entrance with a movement of courteous deference the movement suggested a strict formality the denial of any attempt at presumptionbut it stressed the intimacy of the fact that he uttered no word of greeting or explanation rearden asked his voice hard what are you doing here i thought that you would want to see me tonight mr rearden why for the same reason that has kept you so late in your office you were not working how long have you been sitting here an hour or two why didnt you knock at my door would you have allowed me to come in youre late in asking that question shall i leave mr rearden rearden pointed to the door of his office come in turning the lights on in the office moving with unhurried control rearden thought that he must not allow himself to feel anything but felt the color of life returning to him in the tensely quiet eagerness of an emotion which he would not identify what he told himself consciously was be careful he sat down on the edge of his desk crossed his arms looked at francisco who remained standing respectfully before him and asked with the cold hint of a smile why did you come here you dont want me to answer mr rearden you wouldnt admit to me or to yourself how desperately lonely you are tonight if you dont question me you wont feel obliged to deny it just accept what you do know anyway that i know it taut like a string pulled by anger against the impertinence at one end and by admiration for the frankness at the other rearden answered ill admit it if you wish what should it matter to me that you know it that i know and care mr rearden im the only man around you who does why should you care and why should i need your help tonight because its not easy to have to damn the man who meant most to you i wouldnt damn you if youd only stay away from me franciscos eyes widened a little then he grinned and said i was speaking of mr danagger for an instant rearden looked as if he wanted to slap his own face then he laughed softly and said all right sit down he waited to see what advantage francisco would take of it now but francisco obeyed him in silence with a smile that had an oddly boyish quality a look of triumph and gratitude together i dont damn ken danagger said rearden you dont the two words seemed to fall with a singular emphasis they were pronounced very quietly almost cautiously with no remnant of a smile on franciscos face no i dont try to prescribe how much a man should have to bear if he broke its not for me to judge him if he broke well didnt he francisco leaned back his smile returned but it was not a happy smile what will his disappearance do to you i will just have to work a little harder francisco looked at a steel bridge traced in black strokes against red steam beyond the window and said pointing every one of those girders has a limit to the load it can carry whats yours rearden laughed is that what youre afraid of is that why you came here were you afraid id break did you want to save me as dagny taggart wanted to save ken danagger she tried to reach him in time but couldnt she did i didnt know it miss taggart and i disagree about many things dont worry im not going to vanish let them all give up and stop working i wont i dont know my limit and dont care all i have to know is that i cant be stopped any man can be stopped mr rearden how its only a matter of knowing mans motive power what is it you ought to know mr rearden youre one of the last moral men left to the world rearden chuckled in bitter amusement ive been called just about everything but that and youre wrong you have no idea how wrong are you sure i ought to know moral what on earth made you say it francisco pointed to the mills beyond the window this for a long moment rearden looked at him without moving then asked only what do you mean if you want to see an abstract principle such as moral action in material formthere it is look at it mr rearden every girder of it every pipe wire and valve was put there by a choice in answer to the question right or wrong you had to choose right and you had to choose the best within your knowledgethe best for your purpose which was to make steeland then move on and extend the knowledge and do better and still better with your purpose as your standard of value you had to act on your own judgment you had to have the capacity to judge the courage to stand on the verdict of your mind and the purest the most ruthless consecration to the rule of doing right of doing the best the utmost best possible to you nothing could have made you act against your judgment and you would have rejected as wrongas evilany man who attempted to tell you that the best way to heat a furnace was to fill it with ice millions of men an entire nation were not able to deter you from producing rearden metalbecause you had the knowledge of its superlative value and the power which such knowledge gives but what i wonder about mr rearden is why you live by one code of principles when you deal with nature and by another when you deal with men reardens eyes were fixed on him so intently that the question came slowly as if the effort to pronounce it were a distraction what do you mean why dont you hold to the purpose of your life as clearly and rigidly as you hold to the purpose of your mills what do you mean you have judged every brick within this place by its value to the goal of making steel have you been as strict about the goal which your work and your steel are serving what do you wish to achieve by giving your life to the making of steel by what standard of value do you judge your days for instance why did you spend ten years of exacting effort to produce rearden metal rearden looked away the slight slumping movement of his shoulders like a sigh of release and disappointment if you have to ask that then you wouldnt understand if i told you that i understand it but you dontwould you throw me out of here t should have thrown you out of here anywayso go ahead tell me what you mean are you proud of the rail of the john galt line yes why because its the best rail ever made why did you make it in order to make money there were many easier ways to make money why did you choose the hardest you said it in your speech at taggarts wedding in order to exchange my best effort for the best effort of others if that was your purpose have you achieved it a beat of time vanished in a heavy drop of silence no said rearden have you made any money no when you strain your energy to its utmost in order to produce the best do you expect to be rewarded for it or punished rearden did not answer by every standard of decency of honor of justice known to youare you convinced that you should have been rewarded for it yes said rearden his voice low then if you were punished insteadwhat sort of code have you accepted rearden did not answer it is generally assumed said francisco that living in a human society makes ones life much easier and safer than if one were left alone to struggle against nature on a desert island now wherever there is a man who needs or uses metal in any wayrearden metal has made his life easier for him has it made yours easier for you no said rearden his voice low has it left your life as it was before you produced the metal no said rearden the word breaking off as if he had cut short the thought that followed franciscos voice lashed at him suddenly as a command say it it has made it harder said rearden tonelessly when you felt proud of the rail of the john galt line said francisco the measured rhythm of his voice giving a ruthless clarity to his words what sort of men did you think of did you want to see that line used by your equalsby giants of productive energy such as ellis wyatt whom it would help to reach higher and still higher achievements of their own yes said rearden eagerly did you want to see it used by men who could not equal the power of your mind but who would equal your moral integritymen such as eddie willerswho could never invent your metal but who would do their best work as hard as you did live by their own effort andriding on your railgive a moments silent thanks to the man who gave them more than they could give him yes said rearden gently did you want to see it used by whining rotters who never rouse themselves to any effort who do not possess the ability of a filing clerk but demand the income of a company president who drift from failure to failure and expect you to pay their bills who hold their wishing as an equivalent of your work and their need as a higher claim to reward than your effort who demand that you serve them who demand that it be the aim of your life to serve them who demand that your strength be the voiceless rightless unpaid unrewarded slave of their impotence who proclaim that you are born to serfdom by reason of your genius while they are born to rule by the grace of incompetence that yours is only to give but theirs only to take that yours is to produce but theirs to consume that you are not to be paid neither in matter nor in spirit neither by wealth nor by recognition nor by respect nor by gratitudeso that they would ride on your rail and sneer at you and curse you since they owe you nothing not even the effort of taking off their hats which you paid for would this be what you wanted would you feel proud of it id blast that rail first said rearden his lips white then why dont you do it mr rearden of the three kinds of men i describedwhich men are being destroyed and which are using your line today they heard the distant metal heartbeats of the mills through the long thread of silence what i described last said francisco is any man who proclaims his right to a single penny of another mans effort rearden did not answer he was looking at the reflection of a neon sign on dark windows in the distance you take pride in setting no limit to your endurance mr rearden because you think that you are doing right what if you arent what if youre placing your virtue in the service of evil and letting it become a tool for the destruction of everything you love respect and admire why dont you uphold your own code of values among men as you do among iron smelters you who wont allow one per cent of impurity into an alloy of metalwhat have you allowed into your moral code rearden sat very still the words in his mind were like the beat of steps down the trail he had been seeking the words were the sanction of the victim you who would not submit to the hardships of nature but set out to conquer it and placed it in the service of your joy and your comfortto what have you submitted at the hands of men you who know from your work that one bears punishment only for being wrong what have you been willing to bear and for what reason all your life you have heard yourself denounced not for your faults but for your greatest virtues you have been hated not for your mistakes but for your achievements you have been scorned for all those qualities of character which are your highest pride you have been called selfish for the courage of acting on your own judgment and bearing sole responsibility for your own life you have been called arrogant for your independent mind you have been called cruel for your unyielding integrity you have been called antisocial for the vision that made you venture upon undiscovered roads you have been called ruthless for the strength and selfdiscipline of your drive to your purpose you have been called greedy for the magnificence of your power to create wealth you whove expended an inconceivable flow of energy have been called a parasite you whove created abundance where there had been nothing but wastelands and helpless starving men before you have been called a robber you whove kept them all alive have been called an exploiter you the purest and most moral man among them have been sneered at as a vulgar materialist have you stopped to ask them by what rightby what codeby what standard no you have borne it all and kept silent you bowed to their code and you never upheld your own you knew what exacting morality was needed to produce a single metal nail but you let them brand you as immoral you knew that man needs the strictest code of values to deal with nature but you thought that you needed no such code to deal with men you left the deadliest weapon in the hands of your enemies a weapon you never suspected or understood their moral code is their weapon ask yourself how deeply and in how many terrible ways you have accepted it ask yourself what it is that a code of moral values does to a mans life and why he cant exist without it and what happens to him if he accepts the wrong standard by which the evil is the good shall i tell you why youre drawn to me even though you think you ought to damn me its because im the first man who has given you what the whole world owes you and what you should have demanded of all men before you dealt with them a moral sanction rearden whirled to him then remained still with a stillness like a gasp francisco leaned forward as if he were reaching the landing of a dangerous flight and his eyes were steady but their glance seemed to tremble with intensity youre guilty of a great sin mr rearden much guiltier than they tell you but not in the way they preach the worst guilt is to accept an undeserved guiltand that is what you have been doing all your life you have been paying blackmail not for your vices but for your virtues you have been willing to carry the load of an unearned punishmentand toilet it grow the heavier the greater the virtues you practiced but your virtues were those which keep men alive your own moral codethe one you lived by but never stated acknowledged or defendedwas the code that preserves mans existence if you were punished for it what was the nature of those who punished you yours was the code of life what then is theirs what standard of value lies at its root what is its ultimate purpose do you think that what youre facing is merely a conspiracy to seize your wealth you who know the source of wealth should know its much more and much worse than that did you ask me to name mans motive power mans motive power is his moral code ask yourself where their code is leading you and what it offers you as your final goal a viler evil than to murder a man is to sell him suicide as an act of virtue a viler evil than to throw a man into a sacrificial furnace is to demand that he leap in of his own will and that he build the furnace besides by their own statement it is they who need you and have nothing to offer you in return by their own statement you must support them because they cannot survive without you consider the obscenity of offering their impotence and their needtheir need of youas a justification for your torture are you willing to accept it do you care to purchaseat the price of your great endurance at the price of your agonythe satisfaction of the needs of your own destroyers no mr rearden said francisco his voice solemnly calm if you saw atlas the giant who holds the world on his shoulders if you saw that he stood blood running down his chest his knees buckling his arms trembling but still trying to hold the world aloft with the last of his strength and the greater his effort the heavier the world bore down upon his shoulderswhat would you tell him to do i dont know what could he do what would you tell him to shrug the clatter of the metal came in a flow of irregular sounds without discernible rhythm not like the action of a mechanism but as if some conscious impulse were behind every sudden tearing rise that went up and crashed scattering into the faint moan of gears the glass of the windows tinkled once in a while franciscos eyes were watching rearden as if he were examining the course of bullets on a battered target the course was hard to trace the gaunt figure on the edge of the desk was erect the cold blue eyes showed nothing but the intensity of a glance fixed upon a great distance only the inflexible mouth betrayed a line drawn by pain go on said rearden with effort continue you havent finished have you i have barely begun franciscos voice was hard what are you driving at youll know it before im through but first i want you to answer a question if you understand the nature of your burden how can you the scream of an alarm siren shattered the space beyond the window and shot like a rocket in a long thin line to the sky it held for an instant then fell then went on in rising falling spirals of sound as if fighting for breath against terror to scream louder it was the shriek of agony the call for help the voice of the mills as of a wounded body crying to hold its soul rearden thought that he leaped for the door the instant the scream hit his consciousness but he saw that he was an instant late because francisco had preceded him flung by the blast of the same response as his own francisco was flying down the hall pressing the button of the elevator and not waiting racing on down the stairs rearden followed him and watching the dial of the elevator on the stair landings they met it halfway down the height of the building before the steel cage had ceased trembling at the sill of the ground floor francisco was out racing to meet the sound of the call for help rearden had thought himself a good runner but he could not keep up with the swift figure streaking off through stretches of red glare and darkness the figure of a useless playboy he had hated himself for admiring the stream gushing from a hole low on the side of a blast furnace did not have the red glow of fire but the white radiance of sunlight it poured along the ground branching off at random in sudden streaks it cut through a dank fog of steam with a bright suggestion of morning it was liquid iron and what the scream of the alarm proclaimed was a breakout the charge of the furnace had been hung up and breaking had blown the taphole open the furnace foreman lay knocked unconscious the white flow spurted slowly tearing the hole wider and men were struggling with sand hose and fire clay to stop the glowing streaks that spread in a heavy gliding motion eating everything on their way into jets of acrid smoke in the few moments which rearden needed to grasp the sight and nature of the disaster he saw a mans figure rising suddenly at the foot of the furnace a figure outlined by the red glare almost as if it stood in the path of the torrent he saw the swing of a white shirt sleeved arm that rose and flung a black object into the source of the spurting metal it was francisco danconia and his action belonged to an art which rearden had not believed any man to be trained to perform any longer years before rearden had worked in an obscure steel plant in minnesota where it had been his job after a blast furnace was tapped to close the hole by handby throwing bullets of fire clay to dam the flow of the metal it was a dangerous job that had taken many lives it had been abolished years earlier by the invention of the hydraulic gun but there had been struggling failing mills which on their way down had attempted to use the outworn equipment and methods of a distant past rearden had done the job but in the years since he had met no other man able to do it in the midst of shooting jets of live steam in the face of a crumbling blast furnace he was now seeing the tall slim figure of the playboy performing the task with the skill of an expert it took an instant for rearden to tear off his coat seize a pair of goggles from the first man in sight and join francisco at the mouth of the furnace there was no time to speak to feel or to wonder francisco glanced at him onceand what rearden saw was a smudged face black goggles and a wide grin they stood on a slippery bank of baked mud at the edge of the white stream with the raging hole under their feet flinging clay into the glare where the twisting tongues that looked like gas were boiling metal reardens consciousness became a progression of bending raising the weight aiming and sending it down and before it had reached its unseen destination bending for the next one again a consciousness drawn tight upon watching the aim of his arm to save the furnace and the precarious posture of his feet to save himself he was aware of nothing elseexcept that the sum of it was the exultant feeling of action of his own capacity of his bodys precision of its response to his will and with no time to know it but knowing it seizing it with his senses past the censorship of his mind he was seeing a black silhouette with red rays shooting from behind its shoulders its elbows its angular curves the red rays circling through steam like the long needles of spotlights following the movements of a swift expert confident being whom he had never seen before except in evening clothes under the lights of ballrooms there was no time to form words to think to explain but he knew that this was the real francisco danconia this was what he had seen from the first and lovedthe word did not shock him because there was no word in his mind there was only a joyous feeling that seemed like a flow of energy added to his own to the rhythm of his body with the scorching heat on his face and the winter night on his shoulder blades he was seeing suddenly that this was the simple essence of his universe the instantaneous refusal to submit to disaster the irresistible drive to fight it the triumphant feeling of his own ability to win he was certain that francisco felt it too that he had been moved by the same impulse that it was right to feel it right for both of them to be what they werehe caught glimpses of a sweatstreaked face intent upon action and it was the most joyous face he had ever seen the furnace stood above them a black bulk wrapped in coils of tubes and steam she seemed to pant shooting red gasps that hung on the air above the millsand they fought not to let her bleed to death sparks hung about their feet and burst in sudden sheafs out of the metal dying unnoticed against their clothes against the skin of their hands the stream was coming slower in broken spurts through the dam rising beyond their sight it happened so fast that rearden knew it fully only after it was over he knew that there were two moments the first was when he saw the violent swing of franciscos body in a forward thrust that sent the bullet to continue the line in space then he saw the sudden unrhythmic jerk backward that did not succeed the convulsive beating against a forward pull the extended arms of the silhouette losing its balance he thought that a leap across the distance between them on the slippery crumbling ridge would mean the death of both of themand the second moment was when he landed at franciscos side held him in his arms hung swaying together between space and ridge over the white pit then gained his footing and pulled him back and for an instant still held the length of franciscos body against the length of his own as he would have held the body of an only son his love his terror his relief were in a single sentence be careful you goddamn fool francisco reached for a chunk of clay and went on when the job was done and the gap was closed rearden noticed that there was a twisting pain in the muscles of his arms and legs that his body had no strength left to moveyet that he felt as if he were entering his office in the morning eager for ten new problems to solve he looked at francisco and noticed for the first time that their clothes had bladeringed holes that their hands were bleeding that there was a patch of skin torn on franciscos temple and a red thread winding down his cheekbone francisco pushed the goggles back off his eyes and grinned at him it was a smile of morning a young man with a look of chronic hurt and impertinence together rushed up to him crying i couldnt help it mr rearden and launched into a speech of explanation rearden turned his back on him without a word it was the assistant in charge of the pressure gauge of the furnace a young man out of college somewhere on the outer edge of reardens consciousness there was the thought that accidents of this nature were happening more frequently now caused by the kind of ore he was using but he had to use whatever ore he could find there was the thought that his old workers had always been able to avert disaster any of them would have seen e indications of a hangup and known how to prevent it but there were not many of them left and he had to employ whatever men he could find through the swirling coils of steam around him he observed that it was the older men who had rushed from all over the mills to fight the breakout and now stood in line being given first aid by the medical staff he wondered what was happening to the young men of the country but the wonder was swallowed by the sight of the college boys face which he could not bear to see by a wave of contempt by the wordless thought that if this was the enemy there was nothing to fear all these things came to him and vanished in the outer darkness the sight blotting them out was francisco danconia he saw francisco giving orders to the men around him they did not know who he was or where he came from but they listened they knew he was a man who knew his job francisco broke off in the middle of a sentence seeing rearden approach and listen and said laughing oh i beg your pardon rearden said go right ahead its all correct so far they said nothing to each other when they walked together through the darkness on their way back to the office rearden felt an exultant laughter swelling within him he felt that he wanted in his turn to wink at francisco like a fellow conspirator who had learned a secret francisco would not acknowledge he glanced at his face once in a while but francisco would not look at him after a while francisco said you saved my me the thank you was in the way he said it rearden chuckled you saved my furnace they went on in silence rearden felt himself growing lighter with every step raising his face to the cold air he saw the peaceful darkness bf the sky and a single star above a smokestack with the vertical lettering rearden steel he felt how glad he was to be alive he did not expect the change he saw in franciscos face when he looked at it in the light of his office the things he had seen by the glare of the furnace were gone he had expected a look of triumph of mockery at all the insults francisco had heard from him a look demanding the apology he was joyously eager to offer instead he saw a face made lifeless by an odd dejection are you hurt no no not at all come here ordered rearden opening the door of his bathroom look at yourself never mind you come here for the first time rearden felt that he was the older man he felt the pleasure of taking francisco in charge he felt a confident amused paternal protectiveness he washed the grime off franciscos face he put disinfectants and adhesive bandages on his temple his hands his scorched elbows francisco obeyed him in silence rearden asked in the tone of the most eloquent salute he could offer where did you learn to work like that francisco shrugged i was brought up around smelters of every kind he answered indifferently rearden could not decipher the expression of his face it was only a look of peculiar stillness as if his eyes were fixed on some secret vision of his own that drew his mouth into a line of desolate bitter hurting selfmockery they did not speak until they were back in the office you know said rearden everything you said here was true but that was only part of the story the other part is what weve done tonight dont you see were able to act theyre not so its we wholl win in the long run no matter what they do to us francisco did not answer listen said rearden i know whats been the trouble with you youve never cared to do a real days work in your life i thought you were conceited enough but i see that you have no idea of what youve got in you forget that fortune of yours for a while and come to work for me ill start you as furnace foreman any time you dont know what it will do for you in a few years youll be ready to appreciate and to run danconia copper he expected a burst of laughter and he was prepared to argue instead he saw francisco shaking his head slowly as if he could not trust his voice as if he feared that were he to speak he would accept in a moment he said mr rearden i think i would give the rest of my life for one year as your furnace foreman but i cant why not dont ask me its a personal matter the vision of francisco in reardens mind which he had resented and found irresistibly attractive had been the figure of a man radiantly incapable of suffering what he saw now in franciscos eyes was the look of a quiet tightly controlled patiently borne torture francisco reached silently for his overcoat youre not leaving are you asked rearden yes arent you going to finish what you had to tell me not tonight you wanted me to answer a question what was it francisco shook his head you started asking me how can i how can iwhat franciscos smile was like a moan of pain the only moan he would permit himself i wont ask it mr rearden i know it chapter iv the sanction of the victim the roast turkey had cost the champagne had cost the lace tablecloth a cobweb of grapes and vine leaves iridescent in the candlelight had cost the dinner service with an artists design burned in blue and gold into a translucent white china had cost the silverware which bore the initials lr in empire wreaths of laurels had cost but it was held to be unspiritual to think of money and of what that money represented a peasants wooden shoe gilded stood in the center of the table filled with marigolds grapes and carrots the candles were stuck into pumpkins that were cut as openmouthed faces drooling raisins nuts and candy upon the tablecloth it was thanksgiving dinner and the three who faced rearden about the table were his wife his mother and his brother this is the night to thank the lord for our blessings said reardens mother god has been kind to us there are people all over the country who havent got any food in the house tonight and some that havent even got a house and more of them going jobless every day gives me the creeps to look around in the city why only last week who do you suppose i ran into but lucie judsonhenry do you remember lucie judson used to live next door to us up in minnesota when you were tentwelve years old had a boy about your age i lost track of lucie when they moved to new york must have been all of twenty years ago well it gave me the creeps to see what shes come tojust a toothless old hag wrapped in a mans overcoat panhandling on a street corner and i thought that couldve been me but for the grace of god well if thanks are in order said lillian gaily i think that we shouldnt forget gertrude the new cook shes an artist me im just going to be oldfashioned said philip im just going to thank the sweetest mother in the world well for the matter of that said reardens mother we ought to thank lillian for this dinner and for all the trouble she took to make it so pretty she spent hours fixing the table its real quaint and different its the wooden shoe that does it said philip bending his head sidewise to study it in a manner of critical appreciation thats the real touch anybody can have candles silverware and junk that doesnt take anything but moneybut this shoe that took thought rearden said nothing the candlelight moved over his motionless face as over a portrait the portrait bore an expression of impersonal courtesy you havent touched your wine said his mother looking at him what i think is you ought to drink a toast in gratitude to the people of this country who have given you so much henry is not in the mood for it mother said lillian im afraid thanksgiving is a holiday only for those who have a clear conscience she raised her wine glass but stopped it halfway to her lips and asked youre not going to make some sort of stand at your trial tomorrow are you henry i am she put the glass down what are you going to do youll see it tomorrow you dont really imagine that you can get away with it i dont know what you have in mind as the object im to get away with do you realize that the charge against you is extremely serious i do youve admitted that you sold the metal to ken danagger i have they might send you to jail for ten years i dont think they will but its possible have you been reading the newspapers henry asked philip with an odd kind of smile no oh you should should i why you ought to see the names they call you thats interesting said rearden he said it about the fact that philips smile was one of pleasure i dont understand it said his mother jail did you say jail lillian henry are you going to be sent to jail i might be but thats ridiculous do something about it what i dont know i dont understand any of it respectable people dont go to jail do something youve always known what to do about business not this kind of business i dont believe it her voice had the tone of a frightened spoiled child youre saying it just to be mean hes playing the hero mother said lillian she smiled coldly turning to rearden dont you think that your attitude is perfectly futile no you know that cases of this kind are not intended ever to come to trial there are ways to avoid it to get things settled amicably if one knows the right people i dont know the right people look at orren boyle hes done much more and much worse than your little fling at the black market but hes smart enough to keep himself out of courtrooms then im not smart enough dont you think its time you made an effort to adjust yourself to the conditions of our age no well then i dont see how you can pretend that youre some sort of victim if you go to jail it will be your own fault what pretense are you talking about lillian oh i know that you think youre fighting for some sort of principle but actually its only a matter of your incredible conceit youre doing it for no better reason than because you think youre right do you think theyre right she shrugged thats the conceit im talking aboutthe idea that it matters whos right or wrong its the most insufferable form of vanity this insistence on always doing right how do you know whats right how can anyone ever know it its nothing but a delusion to flatter your own ego and to hurt other people by flaunting your superiority over them he was looking at her with attentive interest why should it hurt other people if its nothing but a delusion is it necessary for me to point out that in your case its nothing but hypocrisy that is why i find your attitude preposterous questions of right have no bearing on human existence and youre certainly nothing but humanarent you henry youre no better than any of the men youre going to face tomorrow i think you should remember that its not for you to make a stand on any sort of principle maybe youre a victim in this particular mess maybe theyre pulling a rotten trick on you but what of it theyre doing it because theyre weak they couldnt resist the temptation to grab your metal and to muscle in on your profits because they had no other way of ever getting rich why should you blame them its only a question of different strains but it s the same shoddy human fabric that gives way just as quickly you wouldnt be tempted by money because its so easy for you to make it but you wouldnt withstand other pressures and youd fall just as ignominiously wouldnt you so you have no right to any righteous indignation against them you have no moral superiority to assert or to defend and if you havent then what is the point of fighting a battle that you cant win i suppose that one might find some satisfaction in being a martyr if one is above reproach but youwho are you to cast the first stone she paused to observe the effect there was none except that his look of attentive interest seemed intensified he listened as if he were held by some impersonal scientific curiosity it was not the response she had expected believe you understand me she said no he answered quietly i dont i think you should abandon the illusion of your own perfection which you know full well to be an illusion i think you should learn to get along with other people the day of the hero is past this is the day of humanity in a much deeper sense than you imagine human beings are no longer expected to be saints nor to be punished for their sins nobody is right or wrong were all in it together were all humanand the human is the imperfect youll gain nothing tomorrow by proving that theyre wrong you ought to give in with good grace simply because its the practical thing to do you ought to keep silent precisely because theyre wrong theyll appreciate it make concessions for others and theyll make concessions for you live and let live give and take give in and take in thats the policy of our ageand its time you accepted it dont tell me youre too good for it you know that youre not you know that i know it the look of his eyes held raptly still upon some point in space was not in answer to her words it was in answer to a mans voice saying to him do you think that what youre facing is merely a conspiracy to seize your wealth you who know the source of wealth should know its much more and much worse than that he turned to look at lillian he was seeing the full extent of her failurein the immensity of his own indifference the droning stream of her insults was like the sound of a distant riveting machine a long impotent pressure that reached nothing within him he had heard her studied reminders of his guilt on every evening he had spent at home in the past three months but guilt had been the one emotion he had found himself unable to feel the punishment she had wanted to inflict on him was the torture of shame what she had inflicted was the torture of boredom he remembered his brief glimpseon that morning in the wayne falkland hotelof a flaw in her scheme of punishment which he had not examined now he stated it to himself for the first time she wanted to force upon him the suffering of dishonorbut his own sense of honor was her only weapon of enforcement she wanted to wrest from him an acknowledgment of his moral depravitybut only his own moral rectitude could attach significance to such a verdict she wanted to injure him by her contemptbut he could not be injured unless he respected her judgment she wanted to punish him for the pain he had caused her and she held her pain as a gun aimed at him as if she wished to extort his agony at the point of his pity but her only tool was his own benevolence his concern for her his compassion her only power was the power of his own virtues what if he chose to withdraw it an issue of guilt he thought had to rest on his own acceptance of the code of justice that pronounced him guilty he did not accept it he never had his virtues all the virtues she needed to achieve his punishment came from another code and lived by another standard he felt no guilt no shame no regret no dishonor he felt no concern for any verdict she chose to pass upon him he had lost respect for her judgment long ago and the sole chain still holding him was only a last remnant of pity but what was the code on which she acted what sort of code permitted the concept of a punishment that required the victims own virtue as the fuel to make it work a codehe thoughtwhich would destroy only those who tried to observe it a punishment from which only the honest would suffer while the dishonest would escape unhurt could one conceive of an infamy lower than to equate virtue with pain to make virtue not vice the source and motive power of suffering if he were the kind of rotter she was struggling to make him believe he was then no issue of his honor and his moral worth would matter to him if he wasnt then what was the nature of her attempt to count upon his virtue and use it as an instrument of torture to practice blackmail with the victims generosity as sole means of extortion to accept the gift of a mans good will and turn it into a tool for the givers destruction he sat very still contemplating the formula of so monstrous an evil that he was able to name it but not to believe it possible he sat very still held by the hammering of a single question did lillian know the exact nature of her schemewas it a conscious policy devised with full awareness of its meaning he shuddered he did not hate her enough to believe it he looked at her she was absorbed at the moment in the task of cutting a plum pudding that stood as a mount of blue flame on a silver platter before her its glow dancing over her face and her laughing mouthshe was plunging a silver knife into the flame with a practiced graceful curve of her arm she had metallic leaves in the red gold and brown colors of autumn scattered over one shoulder of her black velvet gown they glittered in the candlelight he could not get rid of the impression which he had kept receiving and rejecting for three months that her vengeance was not a form of despair as he had supposedthe impression which he regarded as inconceivable that she was enjoying it he could find no trace of pain in her manner she had an air of confidence new to her she seemed to be at home in her house for the first time even though everything within the house was of her own choice and taste she had always seemed to act as the bright efficient resentful manager of a highclass hotel who keeps smiling in bitter amusement at her position of inferiority to the owners the amusement remained but the bitterness was gone she had not gained weight but her features had lost their delicate sharpness in a blurring softening look of satisfaction even her voice sounded as if it had grown plump he did not hear what she was saying she was laughing in the last flicker of the blue flames while he sat weighing the question did she know he felt certain that he had discovered a secret much greater than the problem of his marriage that he had grasped the formula of a policy practiced more widely throughout the world than he dared to contemplate at the moment but to convict a human being of that practice was a verdict of irrevocable damnation and he knew that he would not believe it of anyone so long as the possibility of a doubt remained nohe thought looking at lillian with the last effort of his generosityhe would not believe it of her in the name of whatever grace and pride she possessedin the name of such moments when he had seen a smile of joy on her face the smile of a living beingin the name of the brief shadow of love he had once felt for herhe would not pronounce upon her a verdict of total evil the butter slipped a plate of plum pudding in front of him and he heard lillians voice where have you been for the last five minutes henryor is it for the last century you havent answered me you havent heard a word i said i heard it he answered quietly i dont know what youre trying to accomplish what a question said his mother isnt that just like a man shes trying to save you from going to jailthats what shes trying to accomplish that could be true he thought perhaps by the reasoning of some crude childish cowardice the motive of their malice was a desire to protect him to break him down into the safety of a compromise its possible he thoughtbut knew that he did not believe it youve always been unpopular said lillian and its more than a matter of any one particular issue its that unyielding intractable attitude of yours the men whore going to try you know what youre thinking thats why theyll crack down on you while theyd let another man off why no i dont think they know what im thinking thats what i have to let them know tomorrow unless you show them that youre willing to give in and cooperate you wont have a chance youve been too hard to deal with no ive been too easy but if they put you in jail said his mother whats going to happen to your family have you thought of that no i havent have you thought of the disgrace youll bring upon us mother do you understand the issue in this case no i dont and idont want to understand its all dirty business and dirty politics all business is just dirty politics and all politics is just dirty business i never did want to understand any of it i dont care whos right or wrong but what i think a man ought to think of first is his family dont you know what this will do to us no mother i dont know or care his mother looked at him aghast well i think you have a very provincial attitude all of you said philip suddenly nobody here seems to be concerned with the wider social aspects of the case i dont agree with you lillian i dont see why you say that theyre pulling some sort of rotten trick on henry and that hes in the right i think hes guilty as hell mother i can explain the issue to you very simply theres nothing unusual about it the courts are full of cases of this kind businessmen are taking advantage of the national emergency in order to make money they break the regulations which protect the common welfare of allfor the sake of their own personal gain theyre profiteers of the black market who grow rich by defrauding the poor of their rightful share at a time of desperate shortage they pursue a ruthless grasping grabbing antisocial policy based on nothing but plain selfish greed its no use pretending about it we all know itand i think its contemptible he spoke in a careless offhand manner as if explaining the obvious to a group of adolescents his tone conveyed the assurance of a man who knows that the moral ground of his stand is not open to question rearden sat looking at him as if studying an object seen for the first time somewhere deep in reardens mind as a steady gentle inexorable beat was a mans voice saying by what rightby what codeby what standard philip he said not raising his voice say any of that again and you will find yourself out in the street right now with the suit youve got on your back with whatever change youve got in your pocket and with nothing else he heard no answer no sound no movement he noted that the stillness of the three before him had no element of astonishment the look of shock on their faces was not the shock of people at the sudden explosion of a bomb but the shock of people who had known that they were playing with a lighted fuse there were no outcries no protests no questions they knew that he meant it and they knew everything it meant a dim sickening feeling told him that they had known it long before he did you you wouldnt throw your own brother out on the street would you his mother said at last it was not a demand but a plea i would but hes your brother doesnt that mean anything to you no maybe he goes a bit too far at times but its just loose talk its just that modern jabber he doesnt know what hes saying then let him learn dont be hard on him hes younger than you and and weaker he henry dont look at me that way ive never seen you look like that you shouldnt frighten him you know that he needs you does he know it you cant be hard on a man who needs you it will prey on your conscience for the rest of your life it wont youve got to be kind henry im not youve got to have some pity i havent a good man knows how to forgive i dont you wouldnt want me to think that youre selfish i am philips eyes were darting from one to the other he looked like a man who had felt certain that he stood on solid granite and had suddenly discovered that it was thin ice now cracking open all around him but i he tried and stopped his voice sounded like steps testing the ice but dont i have any freedom of speech in your own house not in mine dont i have a right to my own ideas at your own expense not at mine dont you tolerate any differences of opinion not when im paying the bills isnt there anything involved but money yes the fact that its my money dont you want to consider any hi he was going to say higher but changed his mindany other aspects no but im not your slave am i yours i dont know what you he stopped he knew what was meant no said rearden youre not my slave youre free to walk out of here any time you choose i im not speaking of that i am i dont understand it my political views youve never dont you youve always known my objected before thats true said rearden gravely perhaps i owe you an explanation if i have misled you ive tried never to remind you that youre riving on my charity i thought that it was your place to remember it i thought that any human being who accepts the help of another knows that good will is the givers only motive and that good will is the payment he owes in return but i see that i was wrong you were getting your food unearned and you concluded that affection did not have to be earned either you concluded that i was the safest person in the world for you to spit on precisely because i held you by the throat you concluded that i wouldnt want to remind you of it and that i would be tied by the fear of hurting your feelings all right lets get it straight youre an object of charity whos exhausted his credit long ago whatever affection i might have felt for you once is gone i havent the slightest interest in you your fate or your future i havent any reason whatever for wishing to feed you if you leave my house it wont make any difference to me whether you starve or not now that is your position here and i will expect you to remember it if you wish to stay if not then get out but for the movement of drawing his head a little into his shoulders philip showed no reaction dont imagine that i enjoy living here he said his voice was lifeless and shrill if you think im happy youre mistaken id give anything to get away the words pertained to defiance but the voice had a curiously cautious quality if that is how you feel about it it would be best for me to leave the words were a statement but the voice put a question mark at the end of it and waited there was no answer you neednt worry about my future i dont have to ask favors of anybody i can take care of myself all right the words were addressed to rearden but the eyes were looking at his mother she did not speak she was afraid to move ive always wanted to be on my own ive always wanted to live in new york near all my friends the voice slowed down and added in an impersonal reflective manner as if the words were not addressed to anyone of course id have the problem of maintaining a certain social position its not my fault if ill be embarrassed by a family name associated with a millionaire i would need enough money for a year or two to establish myself in a manner suitable to my you wont get it from me i wasnt asking you for it was dont imagine that i couldnt get it somewhere else if i wanted to dont imagine that i couldnt leave id go in a minute if i had only myself to think about but mother needs me and if i deserted her dont explain and besides you misunderstood me henry i havent said anything to insult you i wasnt speaking in any personal way i was only discussing the general political picture from an abstract sociological viewpoint which dont explain said rearden he was looking at philips face it was halflowered its eyes looking up at him the eyes were lifeless as if they had witnessed nothing they held no spark of excitement no personal sensation neither of defiance nor of regret neither of shame nor of suffering they were filmy ovals that held no response to reality no attempt to understand it to weigh it to reach some verdict of justice ovals that held nothing but a dull still mindless hatred dont explain just keep your mouth shut the revulsion that made rearden turn his face away contained a spasm of pity there was an instant when he wanted to seize his brothers shoulders to shake him to cry how could you do this to yourself how did you come to a stage where this is all thats left of you why did you let the wonderful fact of your own existence go by he looked away he knew it was useless he noted in weary contempt that the three at the table remained silent through all the years past his consideration for them had brought him nothing but their maliciously righteous reproaches where was their righteousness now now was the time to stand on their code of justiceif justice had been any part of their code why didnt they throw at him all those accusations of cruelty and selfishness which he had come to accept as the eternal chorus to his life what had permitted them to do it for years he knew that the words he heard in his mind were the key to the answer the sanction of the victim dont lets quarrel said his mother her voice cheerless and vague its thanksgiving day when he looked at lillian he caught a glance that made him certain she had watched him for a long time its quality was panic he got up you will please excuse me now he said to the table at large where are you going asked lillian sharply he stood looking at her for a deliberate moment as if to confirm the meaning she would read in his answer to new york she jumped to her feet tonight now you cant go to new york tonight her voice was not loud but it had the imperious helplessness of a shriek this is not the time when you can afford it when you can afford to desert your family i mean you ought to think about the matter of clean hands youre not in a position to permit yourself anything which you know to be depravity by what codethought reardenby what standard why do you wish to go to new york tonight i think lillian for the same reason that makes you wish to stop me tomorrow is your trial that is what i mean he made a movement to turn and she raised her voice i dont want you to go he smiled it was the first time he had smiled at her in the past three months it was not the kind of smile she could care to see i forbid you to leave us tonight he turned and left the room sitting at the wheel of his car with the glassy frozen road flying at his face and down under the wheels at sixty miles an hour he let the thought of his family drop away from himand the vision of their faces went rolling back into the abyss of speed that swallowed the bare trees and lonely structures of the roadside there was little traffic and few lights in the distant clusters of the towns he passed the emptiness of inactivity was the only sign of a holiday a hazy glow rusted by frost flashed above the roof of a factory once in a rare while and a cold wind shrieked through the joints of his car beating the canvas top against the metal frame by some dim sense of contrast which he did not define the thought of his family was replaced by the thought of his encounter with the wet nurse the washington boy of his mills at the time of his indictment he had discovered that the boy had known about his deal with danagger yet had not reported it to anyone why didnt you inform your friends about me he had asked the boy had answered brusquely not looking at him didnt want to it was part of your job to watch precisely for things of that kind wasnt it yeah besides your friends would have been delighted to hear it i knew didnt you know what a valuable piece of information it was and what a stupendous trade you could have pulled with those friends of yours in washington whom you offered to me oncerememberthe friends who always occasion expenses the boy had not answered it could have made your career at the very top level dont tell me that you didnt know it i knew it then why didnt you make use of it i didnt want to why not dont know the boy had stood glumly avoiding reardens eyes as if trying to avoid something incomprehensible within himself rearden had laughed listen nonabsolute youre playing with fire better go and murder somebody fast before you let it get youthat reason that stopped you from turning informeror else it will blast your career to hell the boy had not answered this morning rearden had gone to his office as usual even though the rest of the office building was closed at lunch time he had stopped at the rolling mills and had been astonished to find the wet nurse standing there alone in a corner ignored by everybody watching the work with an air of childish enjoyment what are you doing here today rearden had asked dont you know its a holiday oh i let the girls off but i just came in to finish some business what business oh letters and oh hell i signed three letters and sharpened my pencils i know i didnt have to do it today but i had nothing to do at home and i get lonesome away from this place dont you have any family no not to speak of what about you mr rearden dont you have any i guessnot to speak of i like this place i like to hang around you know mr rearden what i studied to be was a metallurgist walking away rearden had turned to glance back and had caught the wet nurse looking after him as a boy would look at the hero of his childhoods favorite adventure story god help the poor little bastardhe had thought god help them allhe thought driving through the dark streets of a small town borrowing in contemptuous pity the words of their belief which he had never shared he saw newspapers displayed on metal stands with the black letters of headlines screaming to empty corners railroad disaster he had heard the news on the radio that afternoon there had been a wreck on the main line of taggart transcontinental near rockland wyoming a split rail had sent a freight train crashing over the edge of a canyon wrecks on the taggart main line were becoming more frequentthe track was wearing outthe track which less than eighteen months ago dagny was planning to rebuild promising him a journey from coast to coast on his own metal she had spent a year picking worn rail from abandoned branches to patch the rail of the main line she had spent months fighting the men of jims board of directors who said that the national emergency was only temporary and a track that had lasted for ten years could well last for another winter until spring when conditions would improve as mr wesley mouch had promised three weeks ago she had made them authorize the purchase of sixty thousand tons of new rail it could do no more than make a few patches across the continent in the worst divisions but it was all she had been able to obtain from them she had had to wrench the money out of men deaf with panic the freight revenues were falling at such a rate that the men of the board had begun to tremble staring at jims idea of the most prosperous year in taggart history she had had to order steel rail there was no hope of obtaining an emergency need permission to buy rearden metal and no time to beg for it rearden looked away from the headlines to the glow at the edge of the sky which was the city of new york far ahead his hands tightened on the wheel a little it was half past nine when he reached the city dagnys apartment was dark when he let himself in with his key he picked up the telephone and called her office her own voice answered taggart transcontinental dont you know its a holiday he asked hello hank railroads have no holidays where are you calling from your place ill be through in another halfhour its all right stay there ill come for you the anteroom of her office was dark when he entered except for the lighted glass cubbyhole of eddie willers eddie was closing his desk getting ready to leave he looked at rearden in puzzled astonishment good evening eddie what is it that keeps you people so busythe rockland wreck eddie sighed yes mr rearden thats what i want to see dagny aboutabout your rail shes still here he started toward her door when eddie called after him hesitantly mr rearden he stopped yes i wanted to say because tomorrow is your trial and whatever they do to you is supposed to be in the name of all the people i just wanted to say that i that it wont be in my name even if theres nothing i can do about it except to tell you even if i know that that doesnt mean anything it means much more than you suspect perhaps more than any of us suspect thanks eddie dagny glanced up from her desk when rearden entered her office he saw her watching him as he approached and he saw the look of weariness disappearing from her eyes he sat down on the edge of the desk she leaned back brushing a strand of hair off her face her shoulders relaxing under her thin white blouse dagny theres something i want to tell you about the rail that you ordered i want you to know this tonight she was watching him attentively the expression of his face pulled hers into the same look of quietly solemn tension i am supposed to deliver to taggart transcontinental on february fifteenth sixty thousand tons of rail which is to give you three hundred miles of track you will receivefor the same sum of moneyeighty thousand tons of rail which will give you five hundred miles of track you know what material is cheaper and lighter than steel your rail will not be steel it will be rearden metal dont argue object or agree i am not asking for your consent you are not supposed to consent or to know anything about it i am doing this and i alone will be responsible we will work it so that those on your staff wholl know that youve ordered steel wont know that youve received rearden metal and those wholl know that youve received rearden metal wont know that you had no permit to buy it we will tangle the bookkeeping in such a way that if the thing should ever blow up nobody will be able to pin anything on anybody except on me they might suspect that i bribed someone on your staff or they might suspect that you were hi on it but they wont be able to prove it i want you to give me your word that you will never admit it no matter what happens its my metal and if there are any chances to take its i wholl take them i have been planning this from the day i received your order i have ordered the copper for it from a source which will not betray me i did not intend to tell you about it till later but i changed my mind i want you to know it tonightbecause i am going on trial tomorrow for the same kind of crime she had listened without moving at his last sentence he saw a faint contraction of her cheeks and lips it was not quite a smile but it gave him her whole answer pain admiration understanding then he saw her eyes becoming softer more painfully dangerously alivehe took her wrist as if the tight grasp of his fingers and the severity of his glance were to give her the support she neededand he said sternly dont thank methis is not a favori am doing it in order to be able to bear my work or else ill break like ken danagger she whispered ah right hank i wont thank you the tone of her voice and the look of her eyes making it a lie by the time it was uttered he smiled give me the word i asked she inclined her head i give you my word he released her wrist she added not raising her head the only thing ill say is that if they sentence you to jail tomorrow ill quitwithout waiting for any destroyer to prompt me you wont and i dont think theyll sentence me to jail i think theyll let me off very lightly i have a hypothesis about itill explain it to you afterwards when ive put it to the test what hypothesis who is john galt he smiled and stood up thats all we wont talk any further about my trial tonight you dont happen to have anything to drink in your office have you no but i think my traffic manager has some sort of a bar on one shelf of his filing closet do you think you could steal a drink for me if he doesnt have it locked ill try he stood looking at the portrait of nat taggart on the wall of her officethe portrait of a young man with a lifted headuntil she returned bringing a bottle of brandy and two glasses he filled the glasses in silence you know dagny thanksgiving was a holiday established by productive people to celebrate the success of their work the movement of his arm as he raised his glass went from the portraitto herto himself to the buildings of the city beyond the window for a month in advance the people who filled the courtroom had been told by the press that they would see the man who was a greedy enemy of society but they had come to see the man who had invented rearden metal he stood up when the judges called upon him to do so he wore a gray suit he had pale blue eyes and blond hair it was not the colors that made his figure seem icily implacable it was the fact that the suit had an expensive simplicity seldom flaunted these days that it belonged in the sternly luxurious office of a rich corporation that his bearing came from a civilized era and clashed with the place around him the crowd knew from the newspapers that he represented the evil of ruthless wealth andas they praised the virtue of chastity then ran to see any movie that displayed a halfnaked female on its postersso they came to see him evil at least did not have the stale hopelessness of a bromide which none believed and none dared to challenge they looked at him without admirationadmiration was a feeling they had lost the capacity to experience long ago they looked with curiosity and with a dim sense of defiance against those who had told them that it was their duty to hate him a few years ago they would have jeered at his air of selfconfident wealth but today there was a slategray sky in the windows of the courtroom which promised the first snowstorm of a long hard winter the last of the countrys oil was vanishing and the coal mines were not able to keep up with the hysterical scramble for winter supplies the crowd in the courtroom remembered that this was the case which had cost them the services of ken danagger there were rumors that the output of the danagger coal company had fallen perceptibly within one month the newspapers said that it was merely a matter of readjustment while danaggers cousin was reorganizing the company he had taken over last week the front pages had carried the story of a catastrophe on the site of a housing project under construction defective steel girders had collapsed killing four workmen the newspapers had not mentioned but the crowd knew that the girders had come from orren boyles associated steel they sat in the courtroom in heavy silence and they looked at the tall gray figure not with hopethey were losing the capacity to hope but with an impassive neutrality spiked by a faint question mark the question mark was placed over all the pious slogans they had heard for years the newspapers had snarled that the cause of the countrys troubles as this case demonstrated was the selfish greed of rich industrialists that it was men like hank rearden who were to blame for the shrinking diet the falling temperature and the cracking roofs in the homes of the nation that if it had not been for men who broke regulations and hampered the governments plans prosperity would have been achieved long ago and that a man like hank rearden was prompted by nothing but the profit motive this last was stated without explanation or elaboration as if the words profit motive were the selfevident brand of ultimate evil the crowd remembered that these same newspapers less than two years ago had screamed that the production of rearden metal should be forbidden because its producer was endangering peoples lives for the sake of his greed they remembered that the man in gray had ridden in the cab of the first engine to run over a track of his own metal and that he was now on trial for the greedy crime of withholding from the public a load of the metal which it had been his greedy crime to offer in the public market according to the procedure established by directives cases of this kind were not tried by a jury but by a panel of three judges appointed by the bureau of economic planning and national resources the procedure the directives had stated was to be informal and democratic the judges bench had been removed from the old philadelphia courtroom for this occasion and replaced by a table on a wooden platform it gave the room an atmosphere suggesting the kind of meeting where a presiding body puts something over on a mentally retarded membership one of the judges acting as prosecutor had read the charges you may now offer whatever plea you wish to make in your own defense he announced facing the platform his voice inflectionless and peculiarly clear hank rearden answered i have no defense do you the judge stumbled he had not expected it to be that easy do you throw yourself upon the mercy of this court i do not recognize this courts right to try me what i do not recognize this courts right to try me but mr rearden this is the legally appointed court to try this particular category of crime i do not recognize my action as a crime but you have admitted that you have broken our regulations controlling the sale of your metal i do not recognize your right to control the sale of my metal is it necessary for me to point out that your recognition was not required no i am fully aware of it and i am acting accordingly he noted the stillness of the room by the rules of the complicated pretense which all those people played for one anothers benefit they should have considered his stand as incomprehensible folly there should have been rustles of astonishment and derision there were none they sat still they understood do you mean that you are refusing to obey the law asked the judge no i am complying with the lawto the letter your law holds that my life my work and my property may be disposed of without my consent very well you may now dispose of me without my participation in the matter i will not play the part of defending myself where no defense is possible and i will not simulate the illusion of dealing with a tribunal of justice but mr rearden the law provides specifically that you are to be given an opportunity to present your side of the case and to defend yourself a prisoner brought to trial can defend himself only if there is an objective principle of justice recognized by his judges a principle upholding his rights which they may not violate and which he can invoke the law by which you are trying me holds that there are no principles that i have no rights and that you may do with me whatever you please very well do it mr rearden the law which you are denouncing is based on the highest principlethe principle of the public good who is the public what does it hold as its good there was a time when men believed that the good was a concept to be defined by a code of moral values and that no man had the right to seek his good through the violation of the rights of another if it is now believed that my fellow men may sacrifice me in any manner they please for the sake of whatever they deem to be their own good if they believe that they may seize my property simply because they need itwell so does any burglar there is only this difference the burglar does not ask me to sanction his act a group of seats at the side of the courtroom was reserved for the prominent visitors who had come from new york to witness the trial dagny sat motionless and her face showed nothing but a solemn attention the attention of listening with the knowledge that the flow of his words would determine the course of her life eddie willers sat beside her james taggart had not come paul larkin sat hunched forward his face thrust out pointed like an animals muzzle sharpened by a look of fear now turning into malicious hatred mr mowen who sat beside him was a man of greater innocence and smaller understanding his fear was of a simpler nature he listened in bewildered indignation and he whispered to larkin good god now hes done it now hell convince the whole country that all businessmen are enemies of the public good are we to understand asked the judge that you hold your own interests above the interests of the public i hold that such a question can never arise except in a society of cannibals what what do you mean i hold that there is no clash of interests among men who do not demand the unearned and do not practice human sacrifices are we to understand that if the public deems it necessary to curtail your profits you do not recognize its right to do so why yes i do the public may curtail my profits any time it wishesby refusing to buy my product we are speaking of other methods any other method of curtailing profits is the method of looters and i recognize it as such mr rearden this is hardly the way to defend yourself i said that i would not defend myself but this is unheard of do you realize the gravity of the charge against you i do not care to consider it do you realize the possible consequences of your stand fully it is the opinion of this court that the facts presented by the prosecution seem to warrant no leniency the penalty which this court has the power to impose on you is extremely severe go ahead i beg your pardon impose it the three judges looked at one another then their spokesman turned back to rearden this is unprecedented he said it is completely irregular said the second judge the law requires you to submit a plea in your own defense your only alternative is to state for the record that you throw yourself upon the mercy of the court i do not but you have to do you mean that what you expect from me is some sort of voluntary action yes i volunteer nothing but the law demands that the defendants side be represented on the record do you mean that you need my help to make this procedure legal well no yes that is to complete the form i will not help you the third and youngest judge who had acted as prosecutor snapped impatiently this is ridiculous and unfair do you want to let it look as if a man of your prominence had been railroaded without a he cut himself off short somebody at the back of the courtroom emitted a long whistle i want said rearden gravely to let the nature of this procedure appear exactly for what it is if you need my help to disguise iti will not help you but we are giving you a chance to defend yourselfand it is you who are rejecting it i will not help you to pretend that i have a chance i will not help you to preserve an appearance of righteousness where rights are not recognized i will not help you to preserve an appearance of rationality by entering a debate in which a gun is the final argument i will not help you to pretend that you are administering justice but the law compels you to volunteer a defense there was laughter at the back of the courtroom that is the flaw in your theory gentlemen said rearden gravely and i will not help you out of it if you choose to deal with men by means of compulsion do so but you will discover that you need the voluntary cooperation of your victims in many more ways than you can see at present and your victims should discover that it is their own volitionwhich you cannot forcethat makes you possible i choose to be consistent and i will obey you in the manner you demand whatever you wish me to do i will do it at the point of a gun if you sentence me to jail you will have to send armed men to carry me therei will not volunteer to move if you fine me you will have to seize my property to collect the finei will not volunteer to pay it if you believe that you have the right to force meuse your guns openly i will not help you to disguise the nature of your action the eldest judge leaned forward across the table and his voice became suavely derisive you speak as if you were fighting for some sort of principle mr rearden but what youre actually fighting for is only your property isnt it yes of course i am fighting for my property do you know the kind of principle that represents you pose as a champion of freedom but its only the freedom to make money that youre after yes of course ah i want is the freedom to make money do you know what that freedom implies surely mr rearden you wouldnt want your attitude to be misunderstood you wouldnt want to give support to the widespread impression that you are a man devoid of social conscience who feels no concern for the welfare of his fellows and works for nothing but his own profit i work for nothing but my own profit i earn it there was a gasp not of indignation but of astonishment in the crowd behind him and silence from the judges he faced he went on calmly no i do not want my attitude to be misunderstood i shall be glad to state it for the record i am in full agreement with the facts of everything said about me in the newspaperswith the facts but not with the evaluation i work for nothing but my own profitwhich i make by selling a product they need to men who are willing and able to buy it i do not produce it for their benefit at the expense of mine and they do not buy it for my benefit at the expense of theirs i do not sacrifice my interests to them nor do they sacrifice theirs to me we deal as equals by mutual consent to mutual advantageand i am proud of every penny that i have earned in this manner i am rich and i am proud of every penny i own i have made my money by my own effort in free exchange and through the voluntary consent of every man i dealt withthe voluntary consent of those who employed me when i started the voluntary consent of those who work for me now the voluntary consent of those who buy my product i shall answer all the questions you are afraid to ask me openly do i wish to pay my workers more than their services are worth to me i do not do i wish to sell my product for less than my customers are willing to pay me i do not do i wish to sell it at a loss or give it away i do not if this is evil do whatever you please about me according to whatever standards you hold these are mine i am earning my own living as every honest man must i refuse to accept as guilt the fact of my own existence and the fact that i must work in order to support it i refuse to accept as guilt the fact that i am able to do it and to do it well i refuse to accept as guilt the fact that i am able to do it better than most peoplethe fact that my work is of greater value than the work of my neighbors and that more men are willing to pay i refuse to apologize for my abilityi refuse to apologize for my me successi refuse to apologize for my money if this is evil make the most of it if this is what the public finds harmful to its interests let the public destroy me this is my codeand i will accept no other i could say to you that i have done more good for my fellow men than you can ever hope to accomplishbut i will not say it because i do not seek the good of others as a sanction for my right to exist nor do i recognize the good of others as a justification for their seizure of my property or their destruction of my life i will not say that the good of others was the purpose of my workmy own good was my purpose and i despise the man who surrenders his i could say to you that you do not serve the public goodthat nobodys good can be achieved at the price of human sacrificesthat when you violate the rights of one man you have violated the rights of all and a public of rightless creatures is doomed to destruction i could say to you that you will and can achieve nothing but universal devastationas any looter must when he runs out of victims i could say it but i wont it is not your particular policy that i challenge but your moral premise if it were true that men could achieve their good by means of turning some men into sacrificial animals and i were asked to immolate myself for the sake of creatures who wanted to survive at the price of my blood if i were asked to serve the interests of society apart from above and against my owni would refuse i would reject it as the most contemptible evil i would fight it with every power i possess i would fight the whole of mankind if one minute were all i could last before i were murdered i would fight in the full confidence of the justice of my battle and of a living beings right to exist let there be no misunderstanding about me if it is now the belief of my fellow men who call themselves the public that their good requires victims then i say the public good be damned i will have no part of it the crowd burst into applause rearden whirled around more startled than his judges he saw faces that laughed in violent excitement and faces that pleaded for help he saw their silent despair breaking out into the open he saw the same anger and indignation as his own finding release in the wild defiance of their cheering he saw the looks of admiration and the looks of hope there were also the faces of loosemouthed young men and maliciously unkempt females the kind who led the booing in newsreel theaters at any appearance of a businessman on the screen they did not attempt a counterdemonstration they were silent as he looked at the crowd people saw in his face what the threats of the judges had not been able to evoke the first sign of emotion it was a few moments before they heard the furious beating of a gavel upon the table and one of the judges yelling or i shall have the courtroom cleared as he turned back to the table reardens eyes moved over the visitors section his glance paused on dagny a pause perceptible only to her as if he were saying it works she would have appeared calm except that her eyes seemed to have become too large for her face eddie willers was smiling the kind of smile that is a mans substitute for breaking into tears mr mowen looked stupefied paul larkin was staring at the floor there was no expression on bertram scudders face on lillians she sat at the end of a row her legs crossed a mink stole slanting from her right shoulder to her left hip she looked at rearden not moving in the complex violence of all the things he felt he had time to recognize a touch of regret and of longing there was a face he had hoped to see had looked for from the start of the session had wanted to be present more than any other face around him but francisco danconia had not come lmr rearden said the eldest judge smiling affably reproachfully and spreading his arms it is regrettable that you should have misunderstood us so completely thats the troublethat businessmen refuse to approach us in a spirit of trust and friendship they seem to imagine that we are their enemies why do you speak of human sacrifices what made you go to such an extreme we have no intention of seizing your property or destroying your life we do not seek to harm your interests we are fully aware of your distinguished achievements our purpose is only to balance social pressures and do justice to all this hearing is really intended not as a trial but as a friendly discussion aimed at mutual understanding and cooperation i do not cooperate at the point of a gun why speak of guns this matter is not serious enough to warrant such references we are fully aware that the guilt in this case lies chiefly with mr kenneth danagger who instigated this infringement of the law who exerted pressure upon you and who confessed his guilt by disappearing in order to escape trial no we did it by equal mutual voluntary agreement mr rearden said the second judge you may not share some of our ideas but when all is said and done were all working for the same cause for the good of the people we realize that you were prompted to disregard legal technicalities by the critical situation of the coal mines and the crucial importance of fuel to the public welfare no i was prompted by my own profit and my own interests what effect it had on the coal mines and the public welfare is for you to estimate that was not my motive mr mowen stared dazedly about him and whispered to paul larkin somethings gone screwy here oh shut up snapped larkin i am sure mr rearden said the eldest judge that you do not really believenor docs the publicthat we wish to treat you as a sacrificial victim if anyone has been laboring under such a misapprehension we are anxious to prove that it is not true the judges retired to consider their verdict they did not stay out long they returned to an ominously silent courtroomand announced that a fine of was imposed on henry rearden but that the sentence was suspended streaks of jeering laughter ran through the applause that swept the courtroom the applause was aimed at rearden the laughterat the judges rearden stood motionless not turning to the crowd barely hearing the applause he stood looking at the judges there was no triumph in his face no elation only the still intensity of contemplating a vision with a bitter wonder that was almost fear he was seeing the enormity of the smallness of the enemy who was destroying the world he felt as if after a journey of years through a landscape of devastation past the ruins of great factories the wrecks of powerful engines the bodies of invincible men he had come upon the despoiler expecting to find a giantand had found a rat eager to scurry for cover at the first sound of a human step if this is what has beaten us he thought the guilt is ours he was jolted back into the courtroom by the people pressing to surround him he smiled in answer to their smiles to the frantic tragic eagerness of their faces there was a touch of sadness in his smile god bless you mr rearden said an old woman with a ragged shawl over her head cant you save us mr rearden theyre eating us alive and its no use fooling anybody about how its the rich that theyre afterdo you know whats happening to us listen mr rearden said a man who looked like a factory worker its the rich whore selling us down the river tell those wealthy bastards whore so anxious to give everything away that when they give away their palaces theyre giving away the skin off our backs i know it said rearden the guilt is ours he thought if we who were the movers the providers the benefactors of mankind were willing to let the brand of evil be stamped upon us and silently to bear punishment for our virtueswhat sort of good did we expect to triumph in the world he looked at the people around him they had cheered him today they had cheered him by the side of the track of the john galt line but tomorrow they would clamor for a new directive from wesley mouch and a free housing project from orren boyle while boyles girders collapsed upon their heads they would do it because they would be told to forget as a sin that which had made them cheer hank rearden why were they ready to renounce their highest moments as a sin why were they willing to betray the best within them what made them believe that this earth was a realm of evil where despair was their natural fate he could not name the reason but he knew that it had to be named he felt it as a huge question mark within the courtroom which it was now his duty to answer this was the real sentence imposed upon him he thoughtto discover what idea what simple idea available to the simplest man had made mankind accept the doctrines that led it to selfdestruction hank ill never think that its hopeless not ever again said dagny that evening after the trial ill never be tempted to quit youve proved that the right always works and always wins she stopped then added provided one knows what is the right lillian said to him at dinner next day so youve won have you her voice was noncommittal she said nothing else she was watching him as if studying a riddle the wet nurse asked him at the mills mr rearden whats a moral premise what youre going to have a lot of trouble with the boy frowned then shrugged and said laughing god that was a wonderful show what a beating you gave them mr rearden i sat by the radio and howled how do you know it was a beating well it was wasnt it are you sure of it sure im sure the thing that makes you sure is a moral premise the newspapers were silent after the exaggerated attention they had given to the case they acted as if the trial were not worthy of notice they printed brief accounts on unlikely pages worded in such generalities that no reader could discover any hint of a controversial issue the businessmen he met seemed to wish to evade the subject of his trial some made no comment at all but turned away their faces showing a peculiar resentment under the effort to appear noncommittal as if they feared that the mere act of looking at him would be interpreted as taking a stand others ventured to comment in my opinion rearden it was extremely unwise of you it seems to me that this is hardly the time to make enemies we cant afford to arouse resentment whose resentment he asked i dont think the government will like it you saw the consequences of that well i dont know the public wont take it theres bound to be a lot of indignation you saw how the public took it well i dont know weve been trying hard not to give any grounds for all those accusations about selfish greedand youve given ammunition to the enemy would you rather agree with the enemy that you have no right to your profits and your property oh no no certainly notbut why go to extremes theres always a middle ground a middle ground between you and your murderers now why use such words what i said at the trial was it true or not its going to be misquoted and misunderstood was it true or not the public is too dumb to grapple with such issues was it true or not its no time to boast about being richwhen the populace is starving its just goading them on to seize everything but telling them that you have no right to your wealth while they haveis whats going to restrain them well i dont know i dont like the things you said at your trial said another man in my opinion i dont agree with you at all personally im proud to believe that i am working for the public good not just for my own profit i like to think that i have some goal higher than just earning my three meals a day and my hammond limousine and i dont like that idea about no directives and no controls said another i grant you theyre running hogwild and overdoing it butno controls at all i dont go along with that i think some controls are necessary the ones which are for the public good i am sorry gentlemen said rearden that i will be obliged to save your goddamn necks along with mine a group of businessmen headed by mr mowen did not issue any statements about the trial but a week later they announced with an inordinate amount of publicity that they were endowing the construction of a playground for the children of the unemployed bertram scudder did not mention the trial in his column but ten days later he wrote among items of miscellaneous gossip some idea of the public value of mr hank rearden may be gathered from the fact that of all social groups he seems to be most unpopular with his own fellow businessmen his oldfashioned brand of ruthlessness seems to be too much even for those predatory barons of profit on an evening in decemberwhen the street beyond his window was like a congested throat coughing with the horns of prechristmas trafficrearden sat in his room at the waynefalkland hotel fighting an enemy more dangerous than weariness or fear revulsion against the thought of having to deal with human beings he sat unwilling to venture into the streets of the city unwilling to move as if he were chained to his chair and to this room he had tried for hours to ignore an emotion that felt like the pull of homesickness his awareness that the only man whom he longed to see was here in this hotel just a few floors above him he had caught himself in the past few weeks wasting time in the lobby whenever he entered the hotel or left it loitering unnecessarily at the mail counter or the newsstand watching the hurried currents of people hoping to see francisco danconia among them he had caught himself eating solitary dinners in the restaurant of the waynefalkland with his eyes on the curtains of the entrance doorway now he caught himself sitting in his room thinking that the distance was only a few floors he rose to his feet with a chuckle of amused indignation he was acting he thought like a woman who waits for a telephone call and fights against the temptation to end the torture by making the first move there was no reason he thought why he could not go to francisco danconia if that was what he wanted yet when he told himself that he would he felt some dangerous element of surrender in the intensity of his own relief he made a step toward the phone to call franciscos suite but stopped it was not what he wanted what he wanted was simply to walk in unannounced as francisco had walked into his office it was this that seemed to state some unstated right between them on his way to the elevator he thought he wont be in or if he is youll probably find him entertaining some floozie which will serve you right but the thought seemed unreal he could not make it apply to the man he had seen at the mouth of the furnacehe stood confidently in the elevator looking uphe walked confidently down the hall feeling his bitterness relax into gaietyhe knocked at the door franciscos voice snapped come in it had a brusque absentminded sound rearden opened the door and stopped on the threshold one of the hotels costliest satinshaded lamps stood in the middle of the floor throwing a circle of light on wide sheets of drafting paper francisco danconia in shirt sleeves a strand of hair hanging down over his face lay stretched on the floor on his stomach propped up by his elbows biting the end of a pencil in concentration upon some point of the intricate tracing before him he did not look up he seemed to have forgotten the knock rearden tried to distinguish the drawing it looked like the section of a smelter he stood watching in startled wonder had he had the power to bring into reality his own image of francisco danconia this was the picture he would have seen the figure of a purposeful young worker intent upon a difficult task in a moment francisco raised his head in the next instant he flung his body upward to a kneeling posture looking at rearden with a smile of incredulous pleasure in the next he seized the drawings and threw them aside too hastily face down what did i interrupt asked rearden nothing much come in he was grinning happily rearden felt suddenly certain that francisco had waited too had waited for this as for a victory which he had not quite hoped to achieve what were you doing asked rearden just amusing myself let me see it no he rose and kicked the drawings aside rearden noted that if he had resented as impertinence franciscos manner of proprietorship in his office he himself was now guilty of the same attitudebecause he offered no explanation for his visit but crossed the room and sat down in an armchair casually as if he were at home why didnt you come to continue what you had started he asked you have been continuing it brilliantly without my help do you mean my trial i mean your trial how do you know you werent there francisco smiled because the tone of the voice confessed an added sentence i was looking for you dont you suppose i heard every word of it on the radio you did well how did you like hearing your own lines come over the air with me as your stooge you werent mr rearden they werent my lines werent they the things you had always lived by yes i only helped you to see that you should have been proud to live by them i am glad you heard it it was great mr reardenand about three generations too late what do you mean if one single businessman had had the courage then to say that he worked for nothing but his own profitand to say it proudlyhe would have saved the world i havent given up the world as lost it isnt it never can be but oh godwhat he would have spared us well i guess we have to fight no matter what era were caught in yes you know mr rearden i would suggest that you get a transcript of your trial and read what you said then see whether you are practicing it fully and consistentlyor not you mean that im not see for yourself i know that you had a great deal to tell me when we were interrupted that night at the mills why dont you finish what you had to say no its too soon francisco acted as if there were nothing unusual about this visit as if he took it as a matter of natural courseas he had always acted in reardens presence but rearden noted that he was not so calm as he wished to appear he was pacing the room in a manner that seemed a release for an emotion he did not want to confess he had forgotten the lamp and it still stood on the floor as the rooms sole illumination youve been taking an awful beating in the way of discoveries havent you said francisco how did you like the behavior of your fellow businessmen i suppose it was to be expected his voice tense with the anger of compassion francisco said its been twelve years and yet im still unable to see it indifferently the sentence sounded involuntary as if trying to suppress the sound of emotion he had uttered suppressed words twelve yearssince what asked rearden there was an instants pause but francisco answered calmly since i understood what those men were doing he added i know what youre going through right now and whats still ahead thanks said rearden for what for what youre trying so hard not to show but dont worry about me im still able to stand it you know i didnt come here because i wanted to talk about myself or even about the trial ill agree to any subject you choosein order to have you here he said it in the tone of a courteous joke but the tone could not disguise it he meant it what did you want to talk about you francisco stopped he looked at rearden for a moment then answered quietly all right if that which rearden felt could have gone directly into words past the barrier of his will he would have cried dont let me downi need youi am fighting all of them i have fought to my limit and am condemned to fight beyond itand as sole ammunition possible to me i need the knowledge of one single man whom i can trust respect and admire instead he said calmly very simplyand the only note of a personal bond between them was that tone of sincerity which comes with a direct unqualifiedly rational statement and implies the same honesty of mind in the listeneryou know i think that the only real moral crime that one man can commit against another is the attempt to create by his words or actions an impression of the contradictory the impossible the irrational and thus shake the concept of rationality in his victim thats true if i say that that is the dilemma youve put me in would you help me by answering a personal question i will try i dont have to tell youi think you know itthat you are the man of the highest mind i have ever met i am coming to accept not as right but at least as possible the fact that you refuse to exercise your great ability in the world of today but what a man does out of despair is not necessarily a key to his character i have always thought that the real key is in that which he seeks for his enjoyment and this is what i find inconceivable no matter what youve given up so long as you chose to remain alive how can you find any pleasure in spending a life as valuable as yours on running after cheap women and on an imbeciles idea of diversions francisco looked at him with a fine smile of amusement as if saying no you didnt want to talk about yourself and what is it that youre confessing but the desperate loneliness which makes the question of my character more important to you than any other question right now the smile merged into a soft goodnatured chuckle as if the question involved no problem for him no painful secret to reveal theres a way to solve every dilemma of that kind mr rearden check your premises he sat down on the floor settling himself gaily informally for a conversation he would enjoy is it your own firsthand conclusion that i am a man of high mind yes do you know of your own firsthand knowledge that i spend my life running after women youve never denied it denied it ive gone to a lot of trouble to create that impression do you mean to say that it isnt true do i strike you as a man with a miserable inferiority complex good god no only that kind of man spends his life running after women what do you mean do you remember what i said about money and about the men who seek to reverse the law of cause and effect the men who try to replace the mind by seizing the products of the mind well the mail who despises himself tries to gain selfesteem from sexual adventures which cant be done because sex is not the cause but an effect and an expression of a mans sense of his own value youd better explain that did it ever occur to you that its the same issue the men who think that wealth comes from material resources and has no intellectual root or meaning are the men who thinkfor the same reasonthat sex is a physical capacity which functions independently of ones mind choice or code of values they think that your body creates a desire and makes a choice for youjust about in some such way as if iron ore transformed itself into railroad rails of its own volition love is blind they say sex is impervious to reason and mocks the power of all philosophers but in fact a mans sexual choice is the result and the sum of his fundamental convictions tell me what a man finds sexually attractive and i will tell you his entire philosophy of life show me the woman he sleeps with and i will tell you his valuation of himself no matter what corruption hes taught about the virtue of selflessness sex is the most profoundly selfish of all acts an act which he cannot perform for any motive but his own enjoymentjust try to think of performing it in a spirit of selfless charityan act which is not possible in selfabasement only in selfexaltation only in the confidence of being desired and being worthy of desire it is an act that forces him to stand naked in spirit as well as in body and to accept his real ego as his standard of value he will always be attracted to the woman who reflects his deepest vision of himself the woman whose surrender permits him to experienceor to fakea sense of selfesteem the man who is proudly certain of his own value will want the highest type of woman he can find the woman he admires the strongest the hardest to conquerbecause only the possession of a heroine will give him the sense of an achievement not the possession of a brainless slut he does not seek to whats the matter he asked seeing the look on reardens face a look of intensity much beyond mere interest in an abstract discussion go on said rearden tensely he does not seek to gain his value he seeks to express it there is no conflict between the standards of his mind and the desires of his body but the man who is convinced of his own worthlessness will be drawn to a woman he despisesbecause she will reflect his own secret self she will release him from that objective reality in which he is a fraud she will give him a momentary illusion of his own value and a momentary escape from the moral code that damns him observe the ugly mess which most men make of their sex livesand observe the mess of contradictions which they hold as their moral philosophy one proceeds from the other love is our response to our highest valuesand can be nothing else let a man corrupt his values and his view of existence let him profess that love is not selfenjoyment but selfdenial that virtue consists not of pride but of pity or pain or weakness or sacrifice that the noblest love is born not of admiration but of charity not in response to values but in response to flawsand he will have cut himself in two his body will not obey him it will not respond it will make him impotent toward the woman he professes to love and draw him to the lowest type of whore he can find his body will always follow the ultimate logic of his deepest convictions if he believes that flaws are values he has damned existence as evil and only the evil will attract him he has damned himself and he will feel that depravity is all he is worthy of enjoying he has equated virtue with pain and he will feel that vice is the only realm of pleasure then he will scream that his body has vicious desires of its own which his mind cannot conquer that sex is sin that true love is a pure emotion of the spirit and then he will wonder why love brings him nothing but boredom and sexnothing but shame rearden said slowly looking off not realizing that he was thinking aloud at least ive never accepted that other tenet ive never felt guilty about making money francisco missed the significance of the first two words he smiled and said eagerly you do see that its the same issue no youd never accept any part of their vicious creed you wouldnt be able to force it upon yourself if you tried to damn sex as evil youd still find yourself against your will acting on the proper moral premise youd be attracted to the highest woman you met youd always want a heroine youd be incapable of selfcontempt youd be unable to believe that existence is evil and that youre a helpless creature caught in an impossible universe youre the man whos spent his life shaping matter to the purpose of his mind youre the man who would know that just as an idea unexpressed in physical action is contemptible hypocrisy so is platonic loveand just as physical action unguided by an idea is a fools selffraud so is sex when cut off from ones code of values its the same issue and you would know it your inviolate sense of selfesteem would know it you would be incapable of desire for a woman you despised only the man who extols the purity of a love devoid of desire is capable of the depravity of a desire devoid of love but observe that most people are creatures cut in half who keep swinging desperately to one side or to the other one kind of half is the man who despises money factories skyscrapers and his own body he holds undefined emotions about nonconceivable subjects as the meaning of life and as his claim to virtue and he cries with despair because he can feel nothing for the women he respects but finds himself in bondage to an irresistible passion for a slut from the gutter he is the man whom people call an idealist the other kind of half is the man whom people call practical the man who despises principles abstractions art philosophy and his own mind he regards the acquisition of material objects as the only goal of existenceand he laughs at the need to consider their purpose or their source he expects them to give him pleasureand he wonders why the more he gets the less he feels he is the man who spends his time chasing women observe the triple fraud which he perpetrates upon himself he will not acknowledge his need of selfesteem since he scoffs at such a concept as moral values yet he feels the profound selfcontempt which comes from believing that he is a piece of meat he will not acknowledge but he knows that sex is the physical expression of a tribute to personal values so he tries by going through the motions of the effect to acquire that which should have been the cause he tries to gain a sense of his own value from the women who surrender to himand he forgets that the women he picks have neither character nor judgment nor standard of value he tells himself that all hes after is physical pleasurebut observe that he tires of his women in a week or a night that he despises professional whores and that he loves to imagine he is seducing virtuous girls who make a great exception for his sake it is the feeling of achievement that he seeks and never finds what glory can there be in the conquest of a mindless body now that is your womanchaser does the description fit me god no then you can judge without asking my word for it how much chasing of women ive done in my life but what on earth have you been doing on the front pages of newspapers for the lastisnt it twelveyears ive spent a lot of money on the most ostentatiously vulgar parties i could think of and a miserable amount of time on being seen with the appropriate sort of women as for the rest he stopped then said i have some friends who know this but you are the first person to whom i am confiding it against my own rules i have never slept with any of those women i have never touched one of them what is more incredible than that is that i believe you the lamp on the floor beside him threw broken bits of light across franciscos face as he leaned forward the face had a look of guiltless amusement if you care to glance over those front pages youll see that ive never said anything it was the women who were eager to rush into print with stories insinuating that being seen with me at a restaurant was the sign of a great romance what do you suppose those women are after but the same thing as the chaserthe desire to gain their own value from the number and fame of the men they conquer only its one step phonier because the value they seek is not even in the actual fact but in the impression on and the envy of other women well i gave those bitches what they wantedbut what they literally wanted without the pretense that they expected the pretense that hides from them the nature of their wish do you think they wanted to sleep with me or with any man they wouldnt be capable of so real and honest a desire they wanted food for their vanityand i gave it to them i gave them the chance to boast to their friends and to see themselves in the scandal sheets in the roles of great seductresses but do you know that it works in exactly the same way as what you did at your trial if you want to defeat any kind of vicious fraudcomply with it literally adding nothing of your own to disguise its nature those women understood they saw whether theres any satisfaction in being envied by others for a feat one has not achieved instead of selfesteem their publicized romances with me have given them a deeper sense of inferiority each one of them knows that shes tried and failed if dragging me into bed is supposed to be her public standard of value she knows that she couldnt live up to it i think those women hate me more than any other man on earth but my secret is safebecause each one of them thinks that she was the only one who failed while all the others succeeded so shell be the more vehement in swearing to our romance and will never admit the truth to anybody but what have you done to your own reputation francisco shrugged those whom i respect will know the truth about me sooner or later the othershis face hardenedthe others consider that which i really am as evil let them have what they preferwhat i appear to be on the front pages but what for why did you do it just to teach them a lesson hell no i wanted to be known as a playboy why a playboy is a man who just cant help letting money run through his fingers why did you want to assume such an ugly sort of role camouflage for what for a purpose of my own what purpose francisco shook his head dont ask me to tell you that ive told you more than i should youll come to know the rest of it soon anyway if its more than you should why did you tell me because youve made me become impatient for the first time in years the note of a suppressed emotion came back into his voice because ive never wanted anyone to know the truth about me as i wanted you to know it because i knew that youd despise a playboy more than any other sort of manas i would too playboy ive never loved but one woman in my life and still do and always will it was an involuntary break and he added his voice low ive never confessed that to anyone not even to her have you lost her francisco sat looking off into space in a moment he answered tonelessly i hope not the light of the lamp hit his face from below and rearden could not see his eyes only his mouth drawn in lines of endurance and oddly solemn resignation rearden knew that this was a wound not to be probed any further with one of his swift changes of mood francisco said oh well its just a little longer and rose to his feet smiling since you trust me said rearden i want to tell you a secret of mine in exchange i want you to know how much i trusted you before i came here and i might need your help later youre the only man left whom id like to help theres a great deal that i dont understand about you but im certain of one thing that youre not a friend of the looters im not there was a hint of amusement in franciscos face as at an understatement so i know that you wont betray me if i tell you that im going to continue selling rearden metal to customers of my own choice in any amount i wish whenever i see a chance to do it right now im getting ready to pour an order twenty times the size of the one they tried me for sitting on the arm of a chair a few feet away francisco leaned forward to look at him silently frowning for a long moment do you think that youre fighting them by doing it he asked well what would you call it cooperating you were willing to work and produce rearden metal for them at the price of losing your profits losing your friends enriching stray bastards who had the pull to rob you and taking their abuse for the privilege of keeping them alive now youre willing to do it at the price of accepting the position of a criminal and the risk of being thrown in jail at any momentfor the sake of keeping in existence a system which can be kept going only by its victims only by the breaking of its own laws its not for their system but for customers whom i cant abandon to the mercy of their systemi intend to outlast that system of theirs i dont intend to let them stop me no matter how hard they make it for meand i dont intend to give up the world to them even if i am the last man left right now that illegal order is more important to me than the whole of my mills francisco shook his head slowly and did not answer then he asked to which one of your friends in the copper industry are you going to give the valuable privilege of informing on you this time rearden smiled not this time this time im dealing with a man i can trust really who is it you francisco sat up straight what he asked his voice so low that he almost succeeded in hiding the sound of a gasp rearden was smiling you didnt know that im one of your customers now it was done through a couple of stooges and under a phony namebut ill need your help to prevent anyone on your staff from becoming inquisitive about it i need that copper i need it on timeand i dont care if they arrest me later so long as i get this through i know that youve lost all concern for your company your wealth your work because you dont care to deal with looters like taggart and boyle but if you meant all the things you taught me if i am the last man left whom you respect youll help me to survive and to beat them ive never asked for anyones help im asking for yours i need you i trust you youve always professed your admiration for me well theres my life in your handsif you want it an order of danconia copper is being shipped to me right now it left san juan on december fifth what it was a scream of plain shock francisco had shot to his feet past any attempt to hide anything on december fifth yes said rearden stupefied francisco leaped to the telephone i told you not to deal with danconia copper it was the halfmoaning halffurious cry of despair his hand was reaching for the telephone but jerked back he grasped the edge of the table as if to stop himself from lifting the receiver and he stood head down for how long a time neither he nor rearden could tell rearden was held numb by the fact of watching an agonized struggle with the motionless figure of a man as its only evidence he could not guess the nature of the struggle he knew only that there was something which francisco had the power to prevent in that moment and that it was a power which he would not use when francisco raised his head rearden saw a face drawn by so great a suffering that its lines were almost an audible cry of pain the more terrible because the face had a look of firmness as if the decision had been made and this was the price of it francisco whats the matter hank i he shook his head stopped then stood up straight mr rearden he said in a voice that had the strength the despair and the peculiar dignity of a plea he knew to be hopeless for the time when youre going to damn me when youre going to doubt every word i said i swear to youby the woman i lovethat i am your friend the memory of franciscos face as it looked in that moment came back to rearden three days later through a blinding shock of loss and hatredit came back even though standing by the radio in his office he thought that he must now keep away from the waynefalkland or he would kill francisco danconia on sightit kept coming back to him through the words he was hearinghe was hearing that three ships of danconia copper bound from san juan to new york had been attacked by ragnar danneskjold and sent to the bottom of the oceanit kept coming back even though he knew that much more than the copper had gone down for him with those ships chapter v account overdrawn it was the first failure in the history of rearden steel for the first time an order was not delivered as promised but by february when the taggart rail was due it made no difference to anyone any longer winter had come early in the last days of november people said that it was the hardest winter on record and that no one could be blamed for the unusual severity of the snowstorms they did not care to remember that there had been a time when snowstorms did not sweep unresisted down unlighted roads and upon the roofs of unheated houses did not stop the movement of trains did not leave a wake of corpses counted by the hundreds the first time that danagger coal was late in delivering fuel to taggart transcontinental in the last week of december danaggers cousin explained that he could not help it he had had to cut the workday down to six hours he said in order to raise the morale of the men who did not seem to function as they had in the days of his cousin kenneth the men had become listless and sloppy he said because they were exhausted by the harsh discipline of the former management he could not help it if some of the superintendents and foremen had quit him without reason men who had been with the company for ten to twenty years he could not help it if there seemed to be some friction between his workers and his new supervisory staff even though the new men were much more liberal than the old slave drivers it was only a matter of readjustment he said he could not help it he said if the tonnage intended for taggart transcontinental had been turned over on the eve of its scheduled delivery to the bureau of global relief for shipment to the peoples state of england it was an emergency the people of england were starving with all of their state factories closing downand miss taggart was being unreasonable since it was only a matter of one days delay it was only one days delay it caused a three days delay in the run of freight train number bound from california to new york with fiftynine carloads of lettuce and oranges freight train number waited on sidings at coaling stations for the fuel that had not arrived when the train reached new york the lettuce and oranges had to be dumped into the east river they had waited their turn too long in the freight houses of california with the train schedules cut and the engines forbidden by directive to pull a train of more than sixty cars nobody but their friends and trade associates noticed that three orange growers in california went out of business as well as two lettuce farmers in imperial valley nobody noticed the closing of a commission house in new york of a plumbing company to which the commission house owed money of a leadpipe wholesaler who had supplied the plumbing company when people were starving said the newspapers one did not have to feel concern over the failures of business enterprises which were only private ventures for private profit the coal shipped across the atlantic by the bureau of global relief did not reach the peoples state of england it was seized by ragnar danneskjold the second time that danagger coal was late in delivering fuel to taggart transcontinental in midjanuary danaggers cousin snarled over the telephone that he could not help it his mines had been shut down for three days due to a shortage of lubricating oil for the machinery the supply of coal to taggart transcontinental was four days late mr quinn of the quinn ball bearing company which had once moved from connecticut to colorado waited a week for the freight train that carried his order of rearden steel when the train arrived the doors of the quinn ball bearing companys plant were closed nobody traced the closing of a motor company in michigan that had waited for a shipment of ball bearings its machinery idle its workers on full pay or the closing of a sawmill in oregon that had waited for a new motor or the closing of a lumber yard in iowa left without supply or the bankruptcy of a building contractor in illinois who failing to get his lumber on time found his contracts cancelled and the purchasers of his homes sent wandering off down snowswept roads in search of that which did not exist anywhere any longer the snowstorm that came at the end of january blocked the passes through the rocky mountains raising white walls thirty feet high across the mainline track of taggart transcontinental the men who attempted to clear the track gave up within the first few hours the rotary plows broke down one after another the plows had been kept in precarious repair for two years past the span of their usefulness the new plows had not been delivered the manufacturer had quit unable to obtain the steel he needed from orren boyle three westbound trains were trapped on the sidings of winston station high in the rockies where the main line of taggart transcontinental cut across the northwest corner of colorado for five days they remained beyond the reach of help trains could not approach them through the storm the last of the trucks made by lawrence hammond broke down on the frozen grades of the mountain highways the best of the airplanes once made by dwight sanders were sent out but never reached winston station they were worn past the stage of fighting a storm through the driving mesh of snow the passengers trapped aboard the trains looked out at the lights of winstons shanties the lights died in the night of the second day by the evening of the third the lights the heat and the food had given out aboard the trains in the brief lulls of the storm when the white mesh vanished and left behind it the stillness of a black void merging a lightless earth with a starless skythe passengers could see many miles away to the south a small tongue of flame twisting in the wind it was wyatts torch by the morning of the sixth day when the trains were able to move and proceeded down the slopes of utah of nevada of california the trainmen observed the smokeless stacks and the closed doors of small trackside factories which had not been closed on their last run storms are an act of god wrote bertram scudder and nobody can be held socially responsible for the weather the rations of coal established by wesley mouch permitted the heating of homes for three hours a day there was no wood to burn no metal to make new stoves no tools to pierce the walls of the houses for new installations in makeshift contraptions of bricks and oil cans professors were burning the books of their libraries and fruit growers were burning the trees of their orchards privations strengthen a peoples spirit wrote bertram scudder and forge the fine steel of social discipline sacrifice is the cement which unites human bricks into the great edifice of society the nation which had once held the creed that greatness is achieved by production is now told that it is achieved by squalor said francisco danconia in a press interview but this was not printed the only business boom that winter came to the amusement industry people wrenched their pennies out of the quicksands of their food and heat budgets and went without meals in order to crowd into movie theaters in order to escape for a few hours the state of animals reduced to the single concern of terror over their crudest needs in january all movie theaters night clubs and bowling alleys were closed by order of wesley mouch for the purpose of conserving fuel pleasure is not an essential of existence wrote bertram scudder you must learn to take a philosophical attitude said dr simon pritchett to a young girl student who broke down into sudden hysterical sobs in the middle of a lecture she had just returned from a volunteer relief expedition to a settlement on lake superior she had seen a mother holding the body of a grown son who had died of hunger there are no absolutes said dr pritchett reality is only an illusion how does that woman know that her son is dead how does she know that he ever existed people with pleading eyes and desperate faces crowded into tents where evangelists cried in triumphant gloating that man was unable to cope with nature that his science was a fraud that his mind was a failure that he was reaping punishment for the sin of pride for his confidence in his own intellectand that only faith in the power of mystic secrets could protect him from the fissure of a rail or from the blowout of the last tire on his last truck love was the key to the mystic secrets they cried love and selfless sacrifice to the needs of others orren boyle made a selfless sacrifice to the needs of others he sold to the bureau of global relief for shipment to the peoples state of germany ten thousand tons of structural steel shapes that had been intended for the atlantic southern railroad it was a difficult decision to make he said with a moist unfocused look of righteousness to the panicstricken president of the atlantic southern but i weighed the fact that youre a rich corporation while the people of germany are in a state of unspeakable misery so i acted on the principle that need comes first when in doubt its the weak that must be considered not the strong the president of the atlantic southern had heard that orren boyles most valuable friend in washington had a friend in the ministry of supply of the peoples state of germany but whether this had been boyles motive or whether it had been the principle of sacrifice no one could tell and it made no difference if boyle had been a saint of the creed of selflessness he would have had to do precisely what he had done this silenced the president of the atlantic southern he dared not admit that he cared for his railroad more than for the people of germany he dared not argue against the principle of sacrifice the waters of the mississippi had been rising all through the month of january swollen by the storms driven by the wind into a restless grinding of current against current and against every obstruction in their way on a night of lashing sleet in the first week of february the mississippi bridge of the atlantic southern collapsed under a passenger train the engine and the first five sleepers went down with the cracking girders into the twisting black spirals of water eighty feet below the rest of the train remained on the first three spans of the bridge which held you cant have your cake and let your neighbor eat it too said francisco danconia the fury of denunciations which the holders of public voices unleashed against him was greater than their concern over the horror at the river it was whispered that the chief engineer of the atlantic southern in despair over the companys failure to obtain the steel he needed to reinforce the bridge had resigned six months ago telling the company that the bridge was unsafe he had written a letter to the largest newspaper in new york warning the public about it the letter had not been printed it was whispered that the first three spans of the bridge had held because they had been reinforced with structural shapes of rearden metal but five hundred tons of the metal was all that the railroad had been able to obtain under the fair share law as the sole result of official investigations two bridges across the mississippi belonging to smaller railroads were condemned one of the railroads went out of business the other closed a branch line tore up its rail and laid a track to the mississippi bridge of taggart transcontinental so did the atlantic southern the great taggart bridge at bedford illinois had been built by nathaniel taggart he had fought the government for years because the courts had ruled on the complaint of river shippers that railroads were a destructive competition to shipping and thus a threat to the public welfare and that railroad bridges across the mississippi were to be forbidden as a material obstruction the courts had ordered nathaniel taggart to tear down his bridge and to carry his passengers across the river by means of barges he had won that battle by a majority of one voice on the supreme court his bridge was now the only major link left to hold the continent together his last descendant had made it her strictest rule that whatever else was neglected the taggart bridge would always be maintained in flawless shape the steel shipped across the atlantic by the bureau of global relief had not reached the peoples state of germany it had been seized by ragnar danneskjoldbut nobody heard of it outside the bureau because the newspapers had long since stopped mentioning the activities of ragnar danneskjold it was not until the public began to notice the growing shortage then the disappearance from the market of electric irons toasters washing machines and all electrical appliances that people began to ask questions and to hear whispers they heard that no ship loaded with danconia copper was able to reach a port of the united states it could not get past ragnar danneskjold in the foggy winter nights on the waterfront sailors whispered the story that ragnar danneskjold always seized the cargoes of relief vessels but never touched the copper he sank the danconia ships with their loads he let the crews escape in lifeboats but the copper went to the bottom of the ocean they whispered it as a dark legend beyond mens power to explain nobody could find a reason why danneskjold did not choose to take the copper in the second week of february for the purpose of conserving copper wire and electric power a directive forbade the running of elevators above the twentyfifth floor the upper floors of the buildings had to be vacated and partitions of unpainted boards went up to cut off the stairways by special permit exceptions were grantedon the grounds of essential needto a few of the larger business enterprises and the more fashionable hotels the tops of the cities were cut down the inhabitants of new york had never had to be aware of the weather storms had been only a nuisance that slowed the traffic and made puddles in the doorways of brightly lighted shops stepping against the wind dressed in raincoats furs and evening slippers people had felt that a storm was an intruder within the city now facing the gusts of snow that came sweeping down the narrow streets people felt in dim terror that they were the temporary intruders and that the wind had the rightofway it wont make any difference to us now forget it hank it doesnt matter said dagny when rearden told her that he would not be able to deliver the rail he had not been able to find a supplier of copper forget it hank he did not answer her he could not forget the first failure of rearden steel on the evening of february a plate cracked on a rail joint and sent an engine off the track half a mile from winston colorado on a division which was to have been relaid with the new rail the station agent of winston sighed and sent for a crew with a crane it was only one of the minor accidents that were happening in his section every other day or so he was getting used to it rearden that evening his coat collar raised his hat slanted low over his eyes the snow drifts rising to his knees was tramping through an abandoned openpit coal mine in a forsaken corner of pennsylvania supervising the loading of pirated coal upon the trucks which he had provided nobody owned the mine nobody could afford the cost of working it but a young man with a brusque voice and dark angry eyes who came from a starving settlement had organized a gang of the unemployed and made a deal with rearden to deliver the coal they mined it at night they stored it in hidden culverts they were paid in cash with no questions asked or answered guilty of a fierce desire to remain alive they and rearden traded like savages without rights titles contracts or protection with nothing but mutual understanding and a ruthlessly absolute observance of ones given word rearden did not even know the name of the young leader watching him at the job of loading the trucks rearden thought that this boy if born a generation earlier would have become a great industrialist now he would probably end his brief life as a plain criminal in a few more years dagny that evening was facing a meeting of the taggart board of directors they sat about a polished table in a stately board room which was inadequately heated the men who through the decades of their careers had relied for their security upon keeping their faces blank their words inconclusive and their clothes impeccable were thrown offkey by the sweaters stretched over their stomachs by the mufflers wound about their necks by the sound of coughing that cut through the discussion too frequently like the rattle of a machine gun she noted that jim had lost the smoothness of his usual performance he sat with his head drawn into his shoulders and his eyes kept darting too rapidly from face to face a man from washington sat at the table among them nobody knew his exact job or title but it was not necessary they knew that he was the man from washington his name was mr weatherby he had graying temples a long narrow face and a mouth that looked as if he had to stretch his facial muscles in order to keep it closed this gave a suggestion of primness to a face that displayed nothing else the directors did not know whether he was present as the guest the adviser or the ruler of the board they preferred not to find out it seems to me said the chairman that the top problem for us to consider is the fact that the track of our main line appears to be in a deplorable not to say critical condition he paused then added cautiously while the only good rail we own is that of the john galti mean the rio norteline in the same cautious tone of waiting for someone else to pick up the intended purpose of his words another man said if we consider our critical shortage of equipment and if we consider that we are letting it wear out in the service of a branch line running at a loss he stopped and did not state what would occur if they considered it in my opinion said a thin pallid man with a neat mustache the rio norte line seems to have become a financial burden which the company might not be able to carrythat is not unless certain readjustments are made which he did not finish but glanced at mr weatherby mr weatherby looked as if he had not noticed it jim said the chairman i think you might explain the picture to mr weatherby taggarts voice still retained a practiced smoothness but it was the smoothness of a piece of cloth stretched tight over a broken glass object and the sharp edges showed through once in a while i think it is generally conceded that the main factor affecting every railroad in the country is the unusual rate of business failures while we all realize of course that this is only temporary still for the moment it has made the railroad situation approach a stage that may well be described as desperate specifically the number of factories which have closed throughout the territory of the taggart transcontinental system is so large that it has wrecked our entire financial structure districts and divisions which had always brought us our steadiest revenues are now showing an actual operating loss a train schedule geared to a heavy volume of freight cannot be maintained for three shippers where there had once been seven we cannot give them the same serviceat least not at our present rates he glanced at mr weatherby but mr weatherby did not seem to notice it seems to me said taggart the sharp edges becoming sharper in his voice that the stand taken by our shippers is unfair most of them have been complaining about their competitors and have passed various local measures to eliminate competition in their particular fields now most of them are practically in sole possession of their markets yet they refuse to realize that a railroad cannot give to one lone factory the freight rates which had been made possible by the production of a whole region we are running our trains for them at a loss yet they have taken a stand against any raise in rates against any raise said mr weatherby mildly with a good imitation of astonishment that is not the stand they have taken if certain rumors which i refuse to credit are true said the chairman and stopped one syllable after the tone of panic had become obvious in his voice jim said mr weatherby pleasantly i think it would be best if we just didnt mention the subject of raising the rates i wasnt suggesting an actual raise at this time said taggart hastily i merely referred to it to round out the picture but jim said an old man with a quavering voice i thought that your influencei mean your friendshipwith mr mouch would insure he stopped because the others were looking at him severely in reproof for the breach of an unwritten law one did not mention a failure of this kind one did not discuss the mysterious ways of jims powerful friendships or why they had failed him fact is said mr weatherby easily that mr mouch sent me here to discuss the demand of the railway unions for a raise in wages and the demand of the shippers for a cut in rates he said it in a tone of casual firmness he knew that all these men had known it that the demands had been discussed in the newspapers for months he knew that the dread in these mens minds was not of the fact but of his naming itas if the fact had not existed but his words held the power to make it exist he knew that they had waited to see whether he would exercise that power he was letting them know that he would their situation warranted an outcry of protest there was none nobody answered him then james taggart said in that biting nervous tone which is intended to convey anger but merely confesses uncertainty i wouldnt exaggerate the importance of buzzy watts of the national shippers council hes been making a lot of noise and giving a lot of expensive dinners in washington but i wouldnt advise taking it too seriously oh i dont know said mr weatherby listen clem i do know that wesley refused to see him last week thats true wesley is a pretty busy man and i know that when gene lawson gave that big party ten days ago practically everybody was there but buzzy watts was not invited thats so said mr weatherby peaceably so i wouldnt bet on mr buzzy watts clem and i wouldnt let it worry me wesleys an impartial man said mr weatherby a man devoted to public duty its the interests of the country as a whole that hes got to consider above everything else taggart sat up of all the danger signs he knew this line of talk was the worst nobody can deny it jim that wesley feels a high regard for you as an enlightened businessman a valuable adviser and one of his closest personal friends taggarts eyes shot to him swiftly this was still worse but nobody can say that wesley would hesitate to sacrifice his personal feelings and friendshipswhere the welfare of the public is concerned taggarts face remained blank his terror came from things never allowed to reach expression in words or in facial muscles the terror was his struggle against an unadmitted thought he himself had been the public for so long and in so many different issues that he knew what it would mean if that magic title that sacred title no one dared to oppose were transferred along with its welfare to the person of buzzy watts but what he asked and he asked it hastily was youre not implying that i would place my personal interests above the public welfare are you no of course not said mr weatherby with a look that was almost a smile certainly not not you jim your publicspirited attitudeand understandingare too well known thats why wesley expects you to see every side of the picture yes of course said taggart trapped well consider the unions side of it maybe you cant afford to give them a raise but how can they afford to exist when the cost of living has shot skyhigh theyve got to eat dont they that comes first railroad or no railroad mr weatherbys tone had a kind of placid righteousness as if he were reciting a formula required to convey another meaning clear to all of them he was looking straight at taggart in special emphasis of the unstated there are almost a million members in the railway unions with families dependents and poor relativesand who hasnt got poor relatives these daysit amounts to about five million votes persons i mean wesley has to bear that in mind he has to think of their psychology and then consider the public the rates youre charging were established at a time when everybody was making money but the way things are now the cost of transportation has become a burden nobody can afford people arc screaming about it all over the country he looked straight at taggart he merely looked but his glance had the quality of a wink theres an awful lot of them jim theyre not very happy at the moment about an awful lot of things a government that would bring the railroad rates down would make a lot of folks grateful the silence that answered him was like a hole so deep that no sound could be heard of the things crashing down to its bottom taggart knew as they all knew to what disinterested motive mr mouch would always be ready to sacrifice his personal friendships it was the silence and the fact that she did not want to say it had come here resolved not to speak but could not resist it that made dagnys voice sound so vibrantly harsh got what youve been asking for all these years gentlemen the swiftness with which their eyes moved to her was an involuntary answer to an unexpected sound but the swiftness with which they moved awayto look down at the table at the walls anywhere but at herwas the conscious answer to the meaning of the sounds in the silence of the next moment she felt their resentment like a starch thickening the air of the room and she knew that it was not resentment against mr weatherby but against her she could have borne it if they had merely let her question go unanswered but what made her feel a sickening tightness in her stomach was their double fraud of pretending to ignore her and then answering in their own kind of manner the chairman said not looking at her his voice pointedly noncommittal yet vaguely purposeful at the same time it would have been all right everything would have worked out fine if it werent for the wrong people in positions of power such as buzzy watts and chick morrison oh i wouldnt worry about chick morrison said the pallid man with the mustache he hasnt any toplevel connections not really its tinky holloway thats poison i dont see the picture as hopeless said a portly man who wore a green muffler joe dunphy and bud hazleton are very close to wesley if their influence prevails well be all right however kip chalmers and tinky holloway are dangerous i can take care of kip chalmers said taggart mr weatherby was the only person in the room who did not mind looking at dagny but whenever his glance rested upon her it registered nothing she was the only person in the room whom he did not see i am thinking said mr weatherby casually looking at taggart that you might do wesley a favor wesley knows that he can always count on me well my thought is that if you granted the unions wage raiseswe might drop the question of cutting the rates for the time being i cant do that it was almost a cry the national alliance of railroads has taken a unanimous stand against the raises and has committed every member to refuse thats just what i mean said mr weatherby softly wesley needs to drive a wedge into that alliance stand if a railroad like taggart transcontinental were to give in the rest would be easy you would help wesley a great deal he would appreciate it but good god clemid be open to court action for it by the alliance rules mr weatherby smiled what court let wesley take care of that but listen clem you knowyou know just as well as i dothat we cant afford it mr weatherby shrugged thats a problem for you to work out how for christs sake i dont know thats your job not ours you wouldnt want the government to start telling you how to run your railroad would you no of course not but our job is only to see that the people get fair wages and decent transportation its up to you to deliver but of course if you say that you cant do the job why then i havent said it taggart cried hastily i havent said it at all good said mr weatherby pleasantly we know that you have the ability to find some way to do it he was looking at taggart taggart was looking at dagny well it was just a thought said mr weatherby leaning back in his chair in a manner of modest withdrawal just a thought for you to mull over im only a guest here i dont want to interfere the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the situation of the branch lines i believe yes said the chairman and sighed yes now if anyone has a constructive suggestion to offer he waited no one answered i believe the picture is clear to all of us he waited it seems to be established that we cannot continue to afford the operation of some of our branch lines the rio norte line in particular and therefore some form of action seems to be indicated i think said the pallid man with the mustache his voice unexpectedly confident that we should now hear from miss taggart he leaned forward with a look of hopeful craftiness as dagny did not answer but merely turned to him he asked what do you have to say miss taggart nothing i beg your pardon all i had to say was contained in the report which jim has read to you she spoke quietly her voice clear and flat but you did not make any recommendations i have none to make but after all as our operating vicepresident you have a vital interest in the policies of this railroad i have no authority over the policies of this railroad oh but we are anxious to consider your opinion i have no opinions miss taggart he said in the smoothly formal tone of an order you cannot fail to realize that our branch lines are running at a disastrous deficitand that we expect you to make them pay how i dont know that is your job not ours i have stated in my report the reasons why that is now impossible if there are facts which i have overlooked please name them oh i wouldnt know we expect you to find some way to make it possible our job is only to see that the stockholders get a fair profit its up to you to deliver you wouldnt want us to think that youre unable to do the job and i am unable to do it the man opened his mouth but found nothing else to say he looked at her in bewilderment wondering why the formula had failed miss taggart asked the man with the green muffler did you imply in your report that the situation of the rio norte line was critical i stated that it was hopeless then what action do you propose i propose nothing arent you evading a responsibility what is it that you think youre doing she spoke evenly addressing them all are you counting on my not saying that the responsibilityis yours that it was your goddamn policies that brought us where we are well im saying it miss taggart miss taggart said the chairman in a tone of pleading reproach there shouldnt be any hard feelings among us does it matter now who was to blame we dont want to quarrel over past mistakes we must all pull together as a team to carry our railroad through this desperate emergency a grayhaired man of patrician bearing who had remained silent throughout the session with a look of the quietly bitter knowledge that the entire performance was futile glanced at dagny in a way which would have been sympathy had he still felt a remnant of hope he said raising his voice just enough to betray a note of controlled indignation mr chairman if it is practical solutions that we are considering i should like to suggest that we discuss the limitation placed upon the length and speed of our trains of any single practice that is the most disastrous one its repeal would not solve all of our problems but it would be an enormous relief with the desperate shortage of motive power and the appalling shortage of fuel it is criminal insanity to send an engine out on the road with sixty cars when it could pull a hundred and to take four days on a run which could be made in three i suggest that we compute the number of shippers we have ruined and the districts we have destroyed through the failures shortages and delays of transportation and then we dont think of it mr weatherby cut in snappily dont try dreaming about any repeals we wouldnt consider it we wouldnt even consider listening to any talk on the subject mr chairman the grayhaired man asked quietly shall i continue the chairman spread out his hands with a smooth smile indicating helplessness it would be impractical he answered i think wed better confine the discussion to the status of the rio norte line snapped james taggart there was a long silence the man with the green muffler turned to dagny miss taggart he asked sadly and cautiously would you say that ifthis is just a hypothetical questionif the equipment now in use on the rio norte line were made available it would fill the needs of our transcontinental mainline traffic it would help the rail of the rio norte line said the pallid man with the mustache is unmatched anywhere in the country and could not now be purchased at any price we have three hundred miles of track which means well over four hundred miles of rail of pure rearden metal in that line would you say miss taggart that we cannot afford to waste that superlative rail on a branch that carries no major traffic any longer that is for you to judge let me put it this way would it be of value if that rail were made available for our mainline track which is in such urgent need of repair it would help miss taggart asked the man with the quavering voice would you say that there are any shippers of consequence left on the rio norte line theres ted nielsen of nielsen motors no one else would you say that the operating costs of the rio norte line could be used to relieve the financial strain on the rest of the system it would help then as our operating vicepresident he stopped she waited looking at him he said well what was your question i meant to say that is well as our operating vicepresident dont you have certain conclusions to draw she stood up she looked at the faces around the table gentlemen she said i do not know by what sort of selffraud you expect to feel that if its i who name the decision you intend to make it will be i wholl bear the responsibility for it perhaps you believe that if my voice delivers the final blow it will make me the murderer involvedsince you know that this is the last act of a longdrawnout murder i cannot conceive what it is you think you can accomplish by a pretense of this kind and i will not help you to stage it the final blow will be delivered by you as were all the others she turned to go the chairman halfrose asking helplessly but miss taggart please remain seated please continue the discussionand take the vote in which i shall have no voice i shall abstain from voting ill stand by if you wish me to but only as an employee i will not pretend to be anything else she turned away once more but it was the voice of the grayhaired man that stopped her miss taggart this is not an official question it is only my personal curiosity but would you tell me your view of the future of the taggart transcontinental system she answered looking at him in understanding her voice gentler i have stopped thinking of a future or of a railroad system i intend to continue running trains so long as it is still possible to run them i dont think that it will be much longer she walked away from the table to the window to stand aside and let them continue without her she looked at the city jim had obtained the permit which allowed them the use of electric power to the top of the taggart building from the height of the room the city looked like a flattened remnant with but a few rare lonely streaks of lighted glass still rising through the darkness to the sky she did not listen to the voices of the men behind her she did not know for how long the broken snatches of their struggle kept rolling past herthe sounds that nudged and prodded one another trying to edge back and leave someone pushed forwarda struggle not to assert ones own will but to squeeze an assertion from some unwilling victim a battle in which the decision was to be pronounced not by the winner but by the loser it seems to me it is i think it must in my opinion if we were to suppose i am merely suggesting i am not implying but if we consider both sides it is in my opinion indubitable it seems to me to be an unmistakable fact she did not know whose voice it was but she heard it when the voice pronounced and therefore i move that the john galt line be closed something she thought had made him call the line by its right name you had to bear it too generations agoit was just as hard for you just as bad but you did not let it stop youwas it really as bad as this as uglynever mind its different forms but its only pain and you were not stopped by pain not by whatever kind it was that you had to bearyou were not stoppedyou did not give in to ityou faced it and this is the kind i have to faceyou fought and i will have to you did iti will try she heard in her own mind the quiet intensity of the words of dedicationand it was some time before she realized that she was speaking to nat taggart the next voice she heard was mr weatherbys wait a minute boys do you happen to remember that you need to obtain permission before you can close a branch line good god clem taggarts cry was open panic surely theres not going to be any trouble about i wouldnt be too sure of it dont forget that youre a public service and youre expected to provide transportation whether you make money or not but you know that its impossible well thats fine for you that solves your problem if you close that linebut what will it do to us leaving a whole state like colorado practically without transportationwhat sort of public sentiment will it arouse now of course if you gave wesley something in return to balance it if you granted the unions wage raises i cant i gave my word to the national alliance your word well suit yourself we wouldnt want to force the alliance we much prefer to have things happen voluntarily but these are difficult times and its hard telling whats liable to happen with everybody going broke and the tax receipts falling we mightfact being that we hold well over fifty per cent of the taggart bondswe might be compelled to call for the payment of railroad bonds within six months what screamed taggart or sooner but you cant oh god you cant it was understood that the moratorium was for five years it was a contract an obligation we were counting on it an obligation arent you oldfashioned jim there arent any obligations except the necessity of the moment the original owners of those bonds were counting on their payments too dagny burst out laughing she could not stop herself she could not resist it she could not reject a moments chance to avenge ellis wyatt andrew stockton lawrence hammond all the others she said torn by laughter thanks mr weatherby mr weatherby looked at her in astonishment yes he asked coldly i knew that we would have to pay for those bonds one way or another were paying miss taggart said the chairman severely dont you think that i toldyousos are futile to talk of what would have happened if we had acted differently is nothing but purely theoretical speculation we cannot indulge in theory we have to deal with the practical reality of the moment right said mr weatherby thats what you ought to bepractical now we offer you a trade you do something for us and well do something for you you give the unions their wage raises and well give you permission to close the rio norte line all right said james taggart his voice choked standing at the window she heard them vote on their decision she heard them declare that the john galt line would end in six weeks on march its only a matter of getting through the next few moments she thought take care of the next few moments and then the next a few at a time and after a while it will be easier youll get over it after a while the assignment she gave herself for the next few moments was to put on her coat and be first to leave the room then there was the assignment of riding in an elevator down the great silent length of the taggart building then there was the assignment of crossing the dark lobby halfway through the lobby she stopped a man stood leaning against the wall in a manner of purposeful waitingand it was she who was his purpose because he was looking straight at her she did not recognize him at once because she felt certain that the face she saw could not possibly be there in that lobby at this hour hi slug he said softly she answered groping for some great distance that had once been hers hi frisco have they finally murdered john galt she struggled to place the moment into some orderly sequence of time the question belonged to the present but the solemn face came from those days on the hill by the hudson when he would have understood all that the question meant to her how did you know that theyd do it tonight she asked its been obvious for months that that would be the next step at their next meeting why did you come here to see how youd take it want to laugh about it no dagny i dont want to laugh about it she saw no hint of amusement in his face she answered trustingly i dont know how im taking it i do i was expecting it i knew theyd have to do it so now its only a matter of getting throughtonight she wanted to say but saidall the work and details he took her arm lets go some place where we can have a drink together francisco why dont you laugh at me youve always laughed about that line i willtomorrow when i see you going on with all the work and details not tonight why not come on youre in no condition to talk about it i she wanted to protest but said no i guess im not he led her out to the street and she found herself walking silently in time with the steady rhythm of his steps the grasp of his fingers on her arm unstressed and firm he signaled a passing taxicab and held the door open for her she obeyed him without questions she felt relief like a swimmer who stops struggling the spectacle of a man acting with assurance was a life belt thrown to her at a moment when she had forgotten the hope of its existence the relief was not in the surrender of responsibility but in the sight of a man able to assume it dagny he said looking at the city as it moved past their taxi window think of the first man who thought of making a steel girder he knew what he saw what he thought and what he wanted he did not say it seems to me and he did not take orders from those who say in my opinion she chuckled wondering at his accuracy he had guessed the nature of the sickening sense that held her the sense of a swamp which she had to escape look around you he said a city is the frozen shape of human couragethe courage of those men who thought for the first time of every bolt rivet and power generator that went to make it the courage to say not it seems to me but it isand to stake ones life on ones judgment youre not alone those men exist they have always existed there was a time when human beings crouched in caves at the mercy of any pestilence and any storm could men such as those on your board of directors have brought them out of the cave and up to this he pointed at the city god no then theres your proof that another kind of men do exist yes she said avidly yes think of them and forget your board of directors francisco where are they nowthe other kind of men now theyre not wanted i want them oh god how i want them when you do youll find them he did not question her about the john galt line and she did not speak of it until they sat at a table in a dimly lighted booth and she saw the stem of a glass between her fingers she had barely noticed how they had come here it was a quiet costly place that looked like a secret retreat she saw a small lustrous table under her hand the leather of a circular seat behind her shoulders and a niche of dark blue mirror that cut them off from the sight of whatever enjoyment or pain others had come here to hide francisco was leaning against the table watching her and she felt as if she were leaning against the steady attentiveness of his eyes they did not speak of the line but she said suddenly looking down at the liquid in her glass im thinking of the night when nat taggart was told that he had to abandon the bridge he was building the bridge across the mississippi he had been desperately short of moneybecause people were afraid of the bridge they called it an impractical venture that morning he was told that the river steamboat concerns had filed suit against him demanding that his bridge be destroyed as a threat to the public welfare there were three spans of the bridge built advancing across the river that same day a local mob attacked the structure and set fire to the wooden scaffolding his workers deserted him some because they were scared some because they were bribed by the steamboat people and most of them because he had had no money to pay them for weeks throughout that day he kept receiving word that men who had subscribed to buy the stock of the taggart transcontinental railroad were cancelling their subscriptions one after another toward evening a committee representing two banks that were his last hope of support came to see him it was right there on the construction site by the river in the old railway coach where he lived with the door open to the view of the blackened ruin with the wooden remnants still smoking over the twisted steel he had negotiated a loan from those banks but the contract had not been signed the committee told him that he would have to give up his bridge because he was certain to lose the suit and the bridge would be ordered torn down by the time he completed it if he was willing to give it up they said and to ferry his passengers across the river on barges as other railroads were doing the contract would stand and he would get the money to continue his line west on the other shore if not then the loan was off what was his answerthey asked he did not say a word he picked up the contract tore it across handed it to them and walked out he walked to the bridge along the spans down to the last girder he knelt he picked up the tools his men had left and he started to clear the charred wreckage away from the steel structure his chief engineer saw him there axe in hand alone over the wide river with the sun setting behind him in that west where his line was to go he worked there all night by morning he had thought out a plan of what he would do to find the right men the men of independent judgmentto find them to convince them to raise the money to continue the bridge she spoke in a low flat voice looking down at the spot of light that shimmered in the liquid as her fingers turned the stem of her glass once in a while she showed no emotion but her voice had the intense monotone of a prayer francisco if he could live through that night what right have i to complain what does it matter how i feel just now he built that bridge i have to hold it for him i cant let it go the way of the bridge of the atlantic southern i feel almost as if hed know it if i let that happen hed know it that night when he was alone over the river no thats nonsense but heres what i feel any man who knows what nat taggart felt that night any man living now and capable of knowing itits him that i would betray if i let it happen and i cant dagny if nat taggart were living now what would he do she answered involuntarily with a swift bitter chuckle he wouldnt last a minutethen corrected herself no he would he would find a way to fight them how i dont know she noticed some tense cautious quality in the attentive way he watched her as he leaned forward and asked dagny the men of your board of directors are no match for nat taggart are they theres no form of contest in which they could beat him theres nothing hed have to fear from them theres no mind no will no power in the bunch of them to equal onethousandth of his no of course not then why is it that throughout mens history the nat taggarts who make the world have always wonand always lost it to the men of the board i dont know how could men whore afraid to hold an unqualified opinion about the weather fight nat taggart how could they seize his achievement if he chose to defend it dagny he fought with every weapon he possessed except the most important one they could not have won if we he and the rest of ushad not given the world away to them yes you gave it away to them ellis wyatt did ken danagger did i wont he smiled who built the john galt line for them he saw only the faintest contraction of her mouth but he knew that the question was like a blow across an open wound yet she answered quietly i did for this kind of end for the men who did not hold out would not fight and gave up dont you see that no other end was possible no how much injustice are you willing to take as much as im able to fight what will you do now tomorrow she said calmly looking straight at him with the faintly proud look of stressing her calm start to tear it up what the john galt line start to tear it up as good as with my own handswith my own mind by my own instructions get it ready to be closed then tear it up and use its pieces to reinforce the transcontinental track theres a lot of work to do it will keep me busy the calm cracked a little in the faintest change of her voice you know im looking forward to it im glad that ill have to do it myself thats why nat taggart worked all that nightjust to keep going its not so bad as long as theres something one can do and ill know at least that im saving the main line dagny he asked very quietlyand she wondered what made her feel that he looked as if his personal fate hung on her answer what if it were the main line that you had to dismember she answered irresistibly then id let the last engine run over mebut added no thats just selfpity i wouldnt he said gently i know you wouldnt but youd wish you could yes he smiled not looking at her it was a mocking smile but it was a smile of pain and the mockery was directed at himself she wondered what made her certain of it but she knew his face so well that she would always know what he felt even though she could not guess his reasons any longer she knew his face as well she thought as she knew every line of his body as she could still see it as she was suddenly aware of it under his clothes a few feet away in the crowding intimacy of the booth he turned to look at her and some sudden change in his eyes made her certain that he knew what she was thinking he looked away and picked up his glass well he said to nat taggart and to sebastian danconia she askedthen regretted it because it had sounded like mockery which she had not intended but she saw a look of odd bright clarity in his eyes and he answered firmly with the faintly proud smile of stressing his firmness yesand to sebastian danconia her hand trembled a little and she spilled a few drops on the square of paper lace that lay on the dark shining plastic of the table she watched him empty his glass in a single gesture the brusque brief movement of his hand made it look like the gesture of some solemn pledge she thought suddenly that this was the first time in twelve years that he had come to her of his own choice he had acted as if he were confidently in control as if his confidence were a transfusion to let her recapture hers he had given her no time to wonder that they should be here together now she felt unaccountably that the reins he had held were gone it was only the silence of a few blank moments and the motionless outline of his forehead cheekbone and mouth as he sat with his face turned away from herbut she felt as if it were he who was now struggling for something he had to recapture she wondered what had been his purpose tonightand noticed that he had perhaps accomplished it he had carried her over the worst moment he had given her an invaluable defense against despairthe knowledge that a living intelligence had heard her and understood but why had he wanted to do it why had he cared about her hour of despairafter the years of agony he had given her why had it mattered to him how she would take the death of the john galt line she noticed that this was the question she had not asked him in the lobby of the taggart building this was the bond between them she thought that she would never be astonished if he came when she needed him most and that he would always know when to come this was the danger that she would trust him even while knowing that it could be nothing but some new kind of trap even while remembering that he would always betray those who trusted him he sat leaning forward with his arms crossed on the table looking straight ahead he said suddenly not turning to her am thinking of the fifteen years that sebastian danconia had to wait for the woman he loved he did not know whether he would ever find her again whether she would survive whether she would wait for him but he knew that she could not live through his battle and that he could not call her to him until it was won so he waited holding his love in the place of the hope which he had no right to hold but when he carried her across the threshold of his house as the first senora danconia of a new world he knew that the battle was won that they were free that nothing threatened her and nothing would ever hurt her again in the days of their passionate happiness he had never given her a hint that he would come to think of her as senora danconia for one moment she wondered whether she had known what she had meant to him but the moment ended in an invisible shudder she would not believe that the past twelve years could allow the things she was hearing to be possible this was the new trap she thought francisco she asked her voice hard what have you done to hank rearden he looked startled that she should think of that name at that moment why he asked he told me once that you were the only man hed ever liked but last time i saw him he said that he would kill you on sight he did not tell you why no he told you nothing about it no she saw him smiling strangely a smile of sadness gratitude and longing i warned him that you would hurt himwhen he told me that you were the only man he liked his words came like a sudden explosion he was the only manwith one exceptionto whom i could have given my life who is the exception the man to whom i have what do you mean he shook his head as if he had said more than he intended and did not answer what did you do to rearden ill tell you some time not now is that what you always do to those who mean a great deal to you he looked at her with a smile that had the luminous sincerity of innocence and pain you know he said gently i could say that that is what they always do to me he added but i wont the actionsand the knowledgewere mine he stood up shall we go ill take you home she rose and he held her coat for her it was a wide loose garment and his hands guided it to enfold her body she felt his arm remain about her shoulders a moment longer than he intended her to notice she glanced back at him but he was standing oddly still staring intently down at the table in rising they had brushed aside the mats of paper lace and she saw an inscription cut into the plastic of the table top attempts had been made to erase it but the inscription remained as the graven voice of some unknown drunks despair who is john galt with a brusque movement of anger she flicked the mat back to cover the words he chuckled i can answer it he said i can tell you who is john galt really everybody seems to know him but they never tell the same story twice theyre all true thoughall the stories youve heard about him well whats yours who is he john galt is prometheus who changed his mind after centuries of being torn by vultures in payment for having brought to men the fire of the gods he broke his chains and he withdrew his fireuntil the day when men withdraw their vultures the band of crossties swept in wide curves around granite corners clinging to the mountainsides of colorado dagny walked down the ties keeping her hands in her coat pockets and her eyes on the meaningless distance ahead only the familiar movement of straining her steps to the spacing of the ties gave her the physical sense of an action pertaining to a railroad a gray cotton which was neither quite fog nor clouds hung in sloppy wads between sky and mountains making the sky look like an old mattress spilling its stuffing down the sides of the peaks a crusted snow covered the ground belonging neither to winter nor to spring a net of moisture hung in the air and she felt an icy pinprick on her face once in a while which was neither a raindrop nor a snowflake the weather seemed afraid to take a stand and clung noncommittally to some sort of roads middle board of directors weather she thought the light seemed drained and she could not tell whether this was the afternoon or the evening of march but she was very certain that it was march that was a certainty not to be escaped she had come to colorado with hank rearden to buy whatever machinery could still be found in the closed factories it had been like a hurried search through the sinking hulk of a great ship before it was to vanish out of reach they could have given the task to employees but they had come both prompted by the same unconfessed motive they could not resist the desire to attend the run of the last train as one cannot resist the desire to give a last salute by attending a funeral even while knowing that it is only an act of selftorture they had been buying machinery from doubtful owners in sales of dubious legality since nobody could tell who had the right to dispose of the great dead properties and nobody would come to challenge the transactions they had bought everything that could be moved from the gutted plant of nielsen motors ted nielsen had quit and vanished a week after the announcement that the line was to be closed she had felt like a scavenger but the activity of the hunt had made her able to bear these past few days when she had found that three empty hours remained before the departure of the last train she had gone to walk through the countryside to escape the stillness of the town she had walked at random through twisting mountain trails alone among rocks and snow trying to substitute motion for thought knowing that she had to get through this day without thinking of the summer when she had ridden the engine of the first train but she found herself walking back along the roadbed of the john galt lineand she knew that she had intended it that she had gone out for that purpose it was a spur track which had already been dismembered there were no signal lights no switches no telephone wires nothing but a long band of wooden strips left on the grounda chain of ties without rail like the remnant of a spineand as its lonely guardian at an abandoned grade crossing a pole with slanted arms saying stop look listen an early darkness mixed with fog was slipping down to fill the valleys when she came upon the factory there was an inscription high on the lustrous tile of its front wall roger marsh electrical appliances the man who had wanted to chain himself to his desk in order not to leave this she thought the building stood intact like a corpse in that instant when its eyes have just closed and one still waits to see them open again she felt that the lights would flare up at any moment behind the great sheets of windows under the long flat roofs then she saw one broken pane pierced by a stone for some young morons enjoymentand she saw the tall dry stem of a single weed rising from the steps of the main entrance hit by a sudden blinding hatred in rebellion against the weeds impertinence knowing of what enemy this was the scout she ran forward she fell on her knees and jerked the weed up by its roots then kneeling on the steps of a closed factory looking at the vast silence of mountains brush and dusk she thought what do you think youre doing it was almost dark when she reached the end of the ties that led her back to the town of marshville marshville had been the end of the line for months past service to wyatt junction had been discontinued long ago dr ferris reclamation project had been abandoned this winter the street lights were on and they hung in midair at the intersections in a long diminishing line of yellow globes over the empty streets of marshville all the better homes were closedthe neat sturdy houses of modest cost well built and well kept there were faded for sale signs on their lawns but she saw lights in the windows of the cheap garish structures that had acquired within a few years the slovenly dilapidation of slum hovels the homes of people who had not moved the people who never looked beyond the span of one week she saw a large new television set in the lighted room of a house with a sagging roof and cracking walls she wondered how long they expected the electric power companies of colorado to remain in existence then she shook her head those people had never known that power companies existed the main street of marshville was lined by the black windows of shops out of business all the luxury stores are goneshe thought looking at their signs and then she shuddered realizing what things she now called luxury realizing to what extent and in what manner those things once available to the poorest had been luxuries dry cleaningelectrical appliancesgas stationdrug storefive and ten the only ones left open were grocery stores and saloons the platform of the railroad station was crowded the glaring arc lights seemed to pick it out of the mountains to isolate and focus it like a small stage on which every movement was naked to the sight of the unseen tiers rising in the vast encircling night people were carting luggage bundling their children haggling at ticket windows the stifled panic of their manner suggesting that what they really wanted to do was to fall down on the ground and scream with terror their terror had the evasive quality of guilt it was not the fear that comes from understanding but from the refusal to understand the last train stood at the platform its windows a long lone streak of light the steam of the locomotive gasping tensely through the wheels did not have its usual joyous sound of energy released for a sprint it had the sound of a panting breath that one dreads to hear and dreads more to stop hearing far at the end of the lighted windows she saw the small red dot of a lantern attached to her private car beyond the lantern there was nothing but a black void the train was loaded to capacity and the shrill notes of hysteria in the confusion of voices were the pleas for space in vestibules and aisles some people were not leaving but stood in vapid curiosity watching the show they had come as if knowing that this was the last event they would ever witness in their community and perhaps in their lives she walked hastily through the crowd trying not to look at anyone some knew who she was most of them did not she saw an old woman with a ragged shawl on her shoulders and the graph of a lifetimes struggle on the cracked skin of her face the womans glance was a hopeless appeal for help an unshaved young man with goldrimmed glasses stood on a crate under an arc light yelling to the faces shifting past him what do they mean no business look at that train its full of passengers theres plenty of business its just that theres no profits for themthats why theyre letting you perish those greedy parasites a disheveled woman rushed up to dagny waving two tickets and screaming something about the wrong date dagny found herself pushing people out of the way fighting to reach the end of the trainbut an emaciated man with the staring eyes of years of malicious futility rushed at her shouting its all right for you youve got a good overcoat and a private car but you wont give us any trains you and all the selfish he stopped abruptly looking at someone behind her she felt a hand grasping her elbow it was hank rearden he held her arm and led her toward her car seeing the look on his face she understood why people got out of their way at the end of the platform a pallid plumpish man stood saying to a crying woman thats how its always been in this world there will be no chance for the poor until the rich are destroyed high above the town hanging in black space like an uncooled planet the flame of wyatts torch was twisting in the wind rearden went inside her car but she remained on the steps of the vestibule delaying the finality of turning away she heard the all aboard she looked at the people who remained on the platform as one looks at those who watch the departure of the last lifeboat the conductor stood below at the foot of the steps with his lantern in one hand and his watch in the other he glanced at the watch then glanced up at her face she answered by the silent affirmation of closing her eyes and inclining her head she saw his lantern circling through the air as she turned awayand the first jolt of the wheels on the rails of rearden metal was made easier for her by the sight of rearden as she pulled the door open and went into her car when james taggart telephoned lillian rearden from new york and said why nono special reason just wondered how you were and whether you ever came to the cityhavent seen you for ages and just thought we might have lunch together next time youre in new yorkshe knew that he had some very special reason in mind when she answered lazily oh let me seewhat day is this april secondlet me look at my calendarwhy it just so happens that i have some shopping to do in new york tomorrow so ill be delighted to let you save me my lunch moneyhe knew that she had no shopping to do and that the luncheon would be the only purpose of her trip to the city they met in a distinguished highpriced restaurant much too distinguished and highpriced ever to be mentioned in the gossip columns not the kind of place which james taggart always eager for personal publicity was in the habit of patronizing he did not want them to be seen together she concluded the halfhint of halfsecret amusement remained on her face while she listened to him talking about their friends the theater and the weather carefully building for himself the protection of the unimportant she sat gracefully not quite straight as if she were leaning back enjoying the futility of his performance and the fact that he had to stage it for her benefit she waited with patient curiosity to discover his purpose i do think that you deserve a pat on the back or a medal or something jim she said for being remarkably cheerful in spite of all the messy trouble youre having didnt you just close the best branch of your railroad oh its only a slight financial setback nothing more one has to expect retrenchments at a time like this considering the general state of the country were doing quite well better than the rest of them he added shrugging besides its a matter of opinion whether the rio norte line was our best branch it is only my sister who thought so it was her pet project she caught the tone of pleasure blurring the drawl of his syllables she smiled and said i see looking up at her from under his lowered forehead as if stressing that he expected her to understand taggart asked how is he taking it who she understood quite well your husband taking what the closing of that line she smiled gaily your guess is as good as mine jimand mine is very good indeed what do you mean you know how he would take itjust as you know how your sister is taking it so your cloud has a double silver lining hasnt it what has he been saying in the last few days hes been away in colorado for over a week so i she stopped she had started answering lightly but she noticed that taggarts question had been too specific while his tone had been too casual and she realized that he had struck the first note leading toward the purpose of the luncheon she paused for the briefest instant then finished still more lightly so i wouldnt know but hes coming back any day now would you say that his attitude is still what one might call recalcitrant why jim that would be an understatement it was to be hoped that events had perhaps taught him the wisdom of a mellower approach it amused her to keep him in doubt about her understanding oh yes she said innocently it would be wonderful if anything could ever make him change he is making things exceedingly hard for himself he always has but events have a way of beating us all into a more pliable frame of mind sooner or later ive heard many characteristics ascribed to him but pliable has never been one of them well things change and people change with them after all it is a law of nature that animals must adapt themselves to their background and i might add that adaptability is the one characteristic most stringently required at present by laws other than those of nature were in for a very difficult time and i would hate to see you suffer the consequences of his intransigent attitude i would hateas your friendto see you in the kind of danger hes headed for unless he learns to cooperate how sweet of you jim she said sweetly he was doling his sentences out with cautious slowness balancing himself between word and intonation to hit the right degree of semi clarity he wanted her to understand but he did not want her to understand fully explicitly down to the rootsince the essence of that modern language which he had learned to speak expertly was never to let oneself or others understand anything down to the root he had not needed many words to understand mr weatherby on his last trip to washington he had pleaded with mr weatherby that a cut in the rates of the railroads would be a deathblow the wage raises had been granted but the demands for the cut in rates were still heard in the pressand taggart had known what it meant if mr mouch still permitted them to be heard he had known that the knife was still poised at his throat mr weatherby had not answered his pleas but had said in a tone of idly irrelevant speculation wesley has so many tough problems if he is to give everybody a breathing spell financially speaking hes got to put into operation a certain emergency program of which you have some inkling but you know what hell the unprogressive elements of the country would raise about it a man like rearden for instance we dont want any more stunts of the sort hes liable to pull wesley would give a lot for somebody who could keep rearden in line but i guess thats something nobody can deliver though i may be wrong you may know better jim since rearden is a sort of friend of yours who comes to your parties and all that looking at lillian across the table taggart said friendship i find is the most valuable thing in lifeand i would be amiss if i didnt give you proof of mine but ive never doubted it he lowered his voice to the tone of an ominous warning i think i should tell you as a favor to a friend although its confidential that your husbands attitude is being discussed in high placesvery high places im sure you know what i mean this was why he hated lillian rearden thought taggart she knew the game but she played it with unexpected variations of her own it was against all rules to look at him suddenly to laugh in his face and after all those remarks showing that she understood too littleto say bluntly showing that she understood too much why darling of course i know what you mean you mean that the purpose of this very excellent luncheon was not a favor you wanted to do me but a favor you wanted to get from me you mean that its you who are in danger and could use that favor to great advantage for a trade in high places and you mean that you are reminding me of my promise to deliver the goods the sort of performance he put on at his trial was hardly what id call delivering the goods he said angrily it wasnt what you had led me to expect oh my no it wasnt she said placidly it certainly wasnt but darling did you expect me not to know that after that performance of his he wouldnt be very popular in high places did you really think you had to tell me that as a confidential favor but its true i heard him discussed so i thought id tell you im sure its true i know that they would be discussing him i know also that if there were anything they could do to him they would have done it right after his trial my would they have been glad to do it so i know that hes the only one among you who is in no danger whatever at the moment i know that its they who are afraid of him do you see how well i understand what you mean darling well if you think you do i must say that for my part i dont understand you at all i dont know what it is youre doing why im just setting things straightso that youll know that i know how much you need me and now that its straight ill tell you the truth in my turn i didnt doublecross you i merely failed his performance at the triali didnt expect it any more than you did less i had good reason not to expect it but something went wrong i dont know what it was i am trying to find out when i do i will keep my promise then youll be free to take full credit for it and to tell your friends in high places that its you whove disarmed him lillian he said nervously i meant it when i said that i was anxious to give you proof of my friendshipso if theres anything can do for she laughed there isnt i know you meant it but theres nothing you can do for me no favor of any kind no trade im a truly noncommercial person i want nothing in return tough luck jim youll just have to remain at my mercy but then why should you want to do it at all what are you getting out of it she leaned back smiling this lunch just seeing you here just knowing that you had to come to me an angry spark flashed in taggarts veiled eyes then his eyelids narrowed slowly and he too leaned back in his chair his face relaxing to a faint look of mockery and satisfaction even from within that unstated unnamed undefined muck which represented his code of values he was able to realize which one of them was the more dependent on the other and the more contemptible when they parted at the door of the restaurant she went to reardens suite at the waynefalkland hotel where she stayed occasionally in his absence she paced the room for about half an hour in a leisurely manner of reflection then she picked up the telephone with a smoothly casual gesture but with the purposeful air of a decision reached she called reardens office at the mills and asked miss ives when she expected him to return mr rearden will be in new york tomorrow arriving on the comet mrs rearden said miss ives clear courteous voice tomorrow thats wonderful miss ives would you do me a favor would you call gertrude at the house and tell her not to expect me for dinner im staying in new york overnight she hung up glanced at her watch and called the florist of the waynefalkland this is mrs henry rearden she said i should like to have two dozen roses delivered to mr reardens drawing room aboard the comet yes today this afternoon when the comet reaches chicago no without any cardjust the flowers thank you ever so much she telephoned james taggart jim will you send me a pass to your passenger platforms i want to meet my husband at the station tomorrow she hesitated between balph eubank and bertram scudder chose balph eubank telephoned him and made a date for this evenings dinner and a musical show then she went to take a bath and lay relaxing in a tub of warm water reading a magazine devoted to problems of political economy it was late afternoon when the florist telephoned her our chicago office sent word that they were unable to deliver the flowers mrs rearden he said because mr rearden is not aboard the comet are you sure she asked quite sure mrs rearden our man found at the station in chicago that there was no compartment on the train reserved in mr reardens name we checked with the new york office of taggart transcontinental just to make certain and were told that mr reardens name is not on the passenger list of the comet i see then cancel the order please thank you she sat by the telephone for a moment frowning then called miss ives please forgive me for being slightly scatterbrained miss ives but i was rushed and did not write it down and now im not quite certain of what you said did you say that mr rearden was coming back tomorrow on the comet yes mrs rearden you have not heard of any delay or change in his plans why no in fact i spoke to mr rearden about an hour ago he telephoned from the station in chicago and he mentioned that he had to hurry back aboard as the comet was about to leave i see thank you she leaped to her feet as soon as the click of the instrument restored her to privacy she started pacing the room her steps now unrhythmically tense then she stopped struck by a sudden thought there was only one reason why a man would make a train reservation under an assumed name if he was not traveling alone her facial muscles went flowing slowly into a smile of satisfaction this was an opportunity she had not expected standing on the terminal platform at a point halfway down the length of the train lillian rearden watched the passengers descending from the comet her mouth held the hint of a smile there was a spark of animation in her lifeless eyes she glanced from one face to another jerking her head with the awkward eagerness of a schoolgirl she was anticipating the look on reardens face when with his mistress beside him he would see her standing there her glance darted hopefully to every flashy young female stepping off the train it was hard to watch within an instant after the first few figures the train had seemed to burst at the seams flooding the platform with a solid current that swept in one direction as if pulled by a vacuum she could barely distinguish separate persons the lights were more glare than illumination picking this one strip out of a dusty oily darkness she needed an effort to stand still against the invisible pressure of motion her first sight of rearden in the crowd came as a shock she had not seen him step out of a car but there he was walking in her direction from somewhere far down the length of the train he was alone he was walking with his usual purposeful speed his hands in the pockets of his trenchcoat there was no woman beside him no companion of any kind except a porter hurrying along with a bag she recognized as his in a fury of incredulous disappointment she looked frantically for any single feminine figure he could have left behind she felt certain that she would recognize his choice she saw none that could be possible and then she saw that the last car of the train was a private car and that the figure standing at its door talking to some station officiala figure wearing not minks and veils but a rough sports coat that stressed the incomparable grace of a slender body in the confident posture of this stations owner and centerwas dagny taggart then lillian rearden understood lillian whats the matter she heard reardens voice she felt his hand grasping her arm she saw him looking at her as one looks at the object of a sudden emergency he was looking at a blank face and an unfocused glance of terror what happened what are you doing here i hello henry i just came to meet you no special reason i just wanted to meet you the terror was gone from her face but she spoke in a strange flat voice i wanted to see you it was an impulse a sudden impulse and i couldnt resist it because but you look looked ill no no maybe i felt faint its stuffy here i couldnt resist coming because it made me think of the days when you would have been glad to see me it was a moments illusion to recreate for myself the words sounded like a memorized lesson she knew that she had to speak while her mind was fighting to grasp the full meaning of her discovery the words were part of the plan she had intended to use if she had met him after he had found the roses in his compartment he did not answer he stood watching her frowning i missed you henry i know what i am confessing but i dont expect it to mean anything to you any longer the words did not fit the tight face the lips that moved with effort the eyes that kept glancing away from him down the length of the platform i wanted i merely wanted to surprise you a look of shrewdness and purpose was returning to her face he took her arm but she drew back a little too sharply arent you going to say a word to me henry what do you wish me to say do you hate it as much as thathaving your wife come to meet you at the station she glanced down the platform dagny taggart was walking toward them he did not see her lets go he said she would not move do you she asked what do you hate it no i dont hate it i merely dont understand it tell me about your trip im sure youve had a very enjoyable trip come on we can talk at home when do i ever have a chance to talk to you at home she was drawling her words impassively as if she were stretching them to fill time for some reason which he could not imagine i had hoped to catch a few moments of your attentionlike thisbetween trains and business appointments and all those important matters that hold you day and night all those great achievements of yours such as hello miss taggart she said sharply her voice loud and bright rearden whirled around dagny was walking past them but she stopped how do you do she said to lillian bowing her face expressionless i am so sorry miss taggart said lillian smiling you must forgive me if i dont know the appropriate formula of condolences for the occasion she noted that dagny and rearden had not greeted each other youre returning from what was in effect the funeral of your child by my husband arent you dagnys mouth showed a faint line of astonishment and of contempt she inclined her head by way of leavetaking and walked on lillian glanced sharply at reardens face as if in deliberate emphasis he looked at her indifferently puzzled she said nothing she followed him without a word when he turned to go she remained silent in the taxicab her face halfturned away from him while they rode to the waynefalkland hotel he felt certain as he looked at the tautly twisted set of her mouth that some uncustomary violence was raging within her he had never known her to experience a strong emotion of any kind she whirled to face him the moment they were alone in his room so thats who it is she asked he had not expected it he looked at her not quite believing that he had understood it correctly its dagny taggart whos your mistress isnt she he did not answer i happen to know that you had no compartment on that train so i know where youve slept for the last four nights do you want to admit it or do you want me to send detectives to question her train crews and her house servants is it dagny taggart yes he answered calmly her mouth twisted into an ugly chuckle she was staring past him i should have known it i should have guessed thats why it didnt work he asked in blank bewilderment what didnt work she stepped back as if to remind herself of his presence had youwhen she was in our house at the partyhad you then no since the great businesswoman she said above reproach and feminine weaknesses the great mind detached from any concern with the body she chuckled the bracelet she said with the still look that made it sound as if the words were dropped accidentally out of the torrent in her mind thats what she meant to you thats the weapon she gave you if you really understand what youre sayingyes do you think ill let you get away with it get away he was looking at her incredulously in cold astonished curiosity thats why at your trial she stopped what about my trial she was trembling you know of course that i wont allow this to continue what does it have to do with my trial i wont permit you to have her not her anyone but her he let a moment pass then asked evenly why i wont permit it youll give it up he was looking at her without expression but the steadiness of his eyes hit her as his most dangerous answer youll give it up youll leave her youll never see her again lillian if you wish to discuss it theres one thing youd better understand nothing on earth will make me give it up but i demand it i told you that you could demand anything but that he saw the look of a peculiar panic growing in her eyes it was not the look of understanding but of a ferocious refusal to understandas if she wanted to turn the violence of her emotion into a fog screen as if she hoped not that it would blind her to reality but that her blindness would make reality cease to exist but i have the right to demand it i own your life its my property my propertyby your own oath you swore to serve my happiness not yoursmine what have you done for me youve given me nothing youve sacrificed nothing youve never been concerned with anything but yourselfyour work your mills your talent your mistress what about me i hold first claim im presenting it for collection youre the account i own it was the look on his face that drove her up the rising steps of her voice scream by scream into terror she was seeing not anger or pain or guilt but the one inviolate enemy indifference have you thought of me she screamed her voice breaking against his face have you thought of what youre doing to me you have no right to go on if you know that youre putting me through hell every time you sleep with that woman i cant stand it i cant stand one moment of knowing it will you sacrifice me to your animal desire are you as vicious and selfish as that can you buy your pleasure at the price of my suffering can you have it if this is what it does to me feeling nothing but the emptiness of wonder he observed the thing which he had glimpsed briefly in the past and was now seeing in the full ugliness of its futility the spectacle of pleas for pity delivered in snarling hatred as threats and as demands lillian he said very quietly i would have it even if it took your life she heard it she heard more than he was ready to know and to hear in his own words the shock to him was that she did not scream in answer but that he saw her instead shrinking down into calm you have no right she said dully it had the embarrassing helplessness of the words of a person who knows her own words to be meaningless whatever claim you may have on me he said no human being can hold on another a claim demanding that he wipe himself out of existence does she mean as much as that to you much more than that the look of thought was returning to her face but in her face it had the quality of a look of cunning she remained silent lillian im glad that you know the truth now you can make a choice with full understanding you may divorce meor you may ask that we continue as we are that is the only choice you have it is all i can offer you i think you know that i want you to divorce me but i dont ask for sacrifices i dont know what sort of comfort you can find in our marriage but if you do i wont ask you to give it up i dont know why you should want to hold me now i dont know what it is that i mean to you i dont know what youre seeking what form of happiness is yours or what you will obtain from a situation which i see as intolerable for both of us by every standard of mine you should have divorced me long ago by every standard of mine to maintain our marriage will be a vicious fraud but my standards are not yours i do not understand yours i never have but i will accept them if this is the manner of your love for me if bearing the name of my wife will give you some form of contentment i wont take it away from you its i whove broken my word so i will atone for it to the extent i can you know of course that i could buy one of those modern judges and obtain a divorce any time i wished i wont do it i will keep my word if you so desire but this is the only form in which i can keep it now make your choicebut if you choose to hold me you must never speak to me about her you must never show her that you know if you meet her in the future you must never touch that part of my life she stood still looking up at him the posture of her body slouched and loose as if its sloppiness were a form of defiance as if she did not care to resume for his sake the discipline of a graceful bearing miss dagny taggart she said and chuckled the superwoman whom common average wives were not supposed to suspect the woman who cared for nothing but business and dealt with men as a man the woman of great spirit who admired you platonically just for your genius your mills and your metal she chuckled i should have known that she was just a bitch who wanted you in the same way as any bitch would want youbecause you are fully as expert in bed as you are at a desk if i am a judge of such matters but she would appreciate that better than i since she worships expertness of any kind and since she has probably been laid by every section hand on her railroad she stopped because she saw for the first time in her life by what sort of look one learns that a man is capable of killing but he was not looking at her she was not sure whether he was seeing her at all or hearing her voice he was hearing his own voice saying her wordssaying them to dagny in the sunstriped bedroom of ellis wyatts house he was seeing in the nights behind him dagnys face in those moments when his body leaving hers she lay still with a look of radiance that was more than a smile a look of youth of early morning of gratitude to the fact of ones own existence and he was seeing lillians face as he had seen it in bed beside him a lifeless face with evasive eyes with some feeble sneer on its lips and the look of sharing some smutty guilt he saw who was the accuser and who the accusedhe saw the obscenity of letting impotence hold itself as virtue and damn the power of living as a sinhe saw with the clarity of direct perception in the shock of a single instant the terrible ugliness of that which had once been his own belief it was only an instant a conviction without words a knowledge grasped as a feeling left unsealed by his mind the shock brought him back to the sight of lillian and to the sound of her words she appeared to him suddenly as some inconsequential presence that had to be dealt with at the moment lillian he said in an unstressed voice that did not grant her even the honor of anger you are not to speak of her to me if you ever do it again i will answer you as i would answer a hoodlum i will beat you up neither you nor anyone else is to discuss her she glanced at him really she said it had an odd casual sound as if the word were tossed away leaving some hook implanted in her mind she seemed to be considering some sudden vision of her own he said quietly in weary astonishment i thought you would be glad to discover the truth i thought you would prefer to knowfor the sake of whatever love or respect you felt for methat if i betrayed you it was not cheaply and casually it was not for a chorus girl but for the cleanest and most serious feeling of my life the ferocious spring with which she whirled to him was involuntary as was the naked twist of hatred in her face oh you goddamn fool he remained silent her composure returned with the faint suggestion of a smile of secret mockery i believe youre waiting for my answer she said no i wont divorce you dont ever hope for that we shall continue as we areif that is what you offered and if you think it can continue see whether you can flout all moral principles and get away with it he did not listen to her while she reached for her coat telling him that she was going back to their home he barely noticed it when the door closed after her he stood motionless held by a feeling he had never experienced before he knew that he would have to think later to think and understand but for the moment he wanted nothing but to observe the wonder of what he felt it was a sense of freedom as if he stood alone in the midst of an endless sweep of clean air with only the memory of some weight that had been torn off his shoulders it was the feeling of an immense deliverance it was the knowledge that it did not matter to him what lillian felt what she suffered or what became of her and more not only that it did not matter but the shining guiltless knowledge that it did not have to matter chapter vi miracle metal but can we get away with it asked wesley mouch his voice was high with anger and thin with fear nobody answered him james taggart sat on the edge of an armchair not moving looking up at him from under his forehead orren boyle gave a vicious tap against an ashtray shaking the ash off his cigar dr floyd ferris smiled mr weatherby folded his lips and hands fred kinnan head of the amalgamated labor of america stopped pacing the office sat down on the window sill and crossed his arms eugene lawson who had sat hunched downward absentmindedly rearranging a display of flowers on a low glass table raised his torso resentfully and glanced up mouch sat at his desk with his fist on a sheet of paper it was eugene lawson who answered thats not it seems to me the way to put it we must not let vulgar difficulties obstruct our feeling that its a noble plan motivated solely by the public welfare its for the good of the people the people need it need comes first so we dont have to consider anything else nobody objected or picked it up they looked as if lawson had merely made it harder to continue the discussion but a small man who sat unobtrusively in the best armchair of the room apart from the others content to be ignored and fully aware that none of them could be unconscious of his presence glanced at lawson then at mouch and said with brisk cheerfulness thats the line wesley tone it down and dress it up and get your press boys to chant itand you wont have to worry yes mr thompson said mouch glumly mr thompson the head of the state was a man who possessed the quality of never being noticed in any group of three his person became indistinguishable and when seen alone it seemed to evoke a group of its own composed of the countless persons he resembled the country had no clear image of what he looked like his photographs had appeared on the covers of magazines as frequently as those of his predecessors in office but people could never be quite certain which photographs were his and which were pictures of a mail clerk or a whitecollar worker accompanying articles about the daily life of the undifferentiatedexcept that mr thompsons collars were usually wilted he had broad shoulders and a slight body he had stringy hair a wide mouth and an elastic age range that made him look like a harassed forty or an unusually vigorous sixty holding enormous official powers he schemed ceaselessly to expand them because it was expected of him by those who had pushed him into office he had the cunning of the unintelligent and the frantic energy of the lazy the sole secret of his rise in life was the fact that he was a product of chance and knew it and aspired to nothing else its obvious that measures have to be taken drastic measures said james taggart speaking not to mr thompson but to wesley mouch we cant let things go the way theyre going much longer his voice was belligerent and shaky take it easy jim said orren boyle somethings got to be done and done fast dont look at me snapped wesley mouch i cant help it i cant help it if people refuse to cooperate im tied i need wider powers mouch had summoned them all to washington as his friends and personal advisers for a private unofficial conference on the national crisis but watching him they were unable to decide whether his manner was overbearing or whining whether he was threatening them or pleading for their help fact is said mr weatherby primly in a statistical tone of voice that in the twelvemonth period ending on the first of this year the rate of business failures has doubled as compared with the preceding twelvemonth period since the first of this year it has trebled be sure they think its their own fault said dr ferris casually huh said wesley mouch his eyes darting to ferris whatever you do dont apologize said dr ferris make them feel guilty im not apologizing snapped mouch im not to blame i need wider powers but it is their own fault said eugene lawson turning aggressively to dr ferris its their lack of social spirit they refuse to recognize that production is not a private choice but a public duty they have no right to fail no matter what conditions happen to come up theyve got to go on producing its a social imperative a mans work is not a personal matter its a social matter theres no such thing as a personal matteror a personal life thats what weve got to force them to learn gene lawson knows what im talking about said dr ferris with a slight smile even though he hasnt the faintest idea that he does what do you think you mean asked lawson his voice rising skip it ordered wesley mouch i dont care what you decide to do wesley said mr thompson and i dont care if the businessmen squawk about it just be sure youve got the press with you be damn sure about that ive got em said mouch one editor whod open his trap at the wrong time could do us more harm than ten disgruntled millionaires thats true mr thompson said dr ferris but can you name one editor who knows it guess not said mr thompson he sounded pleased whatever type of men were counting on and planning for said dr ferris theres a certain oldfashioned quotation which we may safely forget the one about counting on the wise and the honest we dont have to consider them theyre out of date james taggart glanced at the window there were patches of blue in the sky above the spacious streets of washington the faint blue of midapril and a few beams breaking through the clouds a monument stood shining in the distance hit by a ray of sun it was a tall white obelisk erected to the memory of the man dr ferris was quoting the man in whose honor this city had been named james taggart looked away i dont like the professors remarks said lawson loudly and sullenly keep still said wesley mouch dr ferris is not talking theory but practice well if you want to talk practice said fred kinnan then let me tell you that we cant worry about businessmen at a time like this what weve got to think about is jobs more jobs for the people in my unions every man whos working is feeding five who arent not counting his own pack of starving relatives if you want my adviceoh i know you wont go for it but its just a thoughtissue a directive making it compulsory to add say onethird more men to every payroll in the country good god yelled taggart are you crazy we can barely meet our payrolls as it is theres not enough work for the men weve got now onethird more we wouldnt have any use for them whatever who cares whether youd have any use for them said fred kinnan they need jobs thats what comes firstneeddoesnt itnot your profits its not a question of profits yelled taggart hastily i havent said anything about profits i havent given you any grounds to insult me its just a question of where in hell wed get the money to pay your menwhen half our trains are running empty and theres not enough freight to fill a trolley car his voice slowed down suddenly to a tone of cautious thoughtfulness however we do understand the plight of the working men andits just a thought we could perhaps take on a certain extra number if we were permitted to double our freight rates which have you lost your mind yelled orren boyle im going broke on the rates youre charging now i shudder every time a damn boxcar pulls in or out of the mills theyre bleeding me to death i cant afford itand you want to double it it is not essential whether you can afford it or not said taggart coldly you have to be prepared to make some sacrifices the public needs railroads need conies firstabove your profits what profits yelled orren boyle when did i ever make any profits nobody can accuse me of running a profitmaking business just look at my balance sheetand then look at the books of a certain competitor of mine whos got all the customers all the raw materials all the technical advantages and a monopoly on secret formulasthen tell me whos the profiteer but of course the public does need railroads and perhaps i could manage to absorb a certain raise in rates if i were to getits just a thoughtif i were to get a subsidy to carry me over the next year or two until i catch my stride and what again yelled mr weatherby losing his primness how many loans have you got from us and how many extensions suspensions and moratoriums you havent repaid a pennyand with all of you boys going broke and the tax receipts crashing where do you expect us to get the money to hand you a subsidy there are people who arent broke said boyle slowly you boys have no excuse for permitting all that need and misery to spread through the countryso long as there are people who arent broke i cant help it yelled wesley mouch i cant do anything about it i need wider powers they could not tell what had prompted mr thompson to attend this particular conference he had said little but had listened with interest it seemed as if there were something which he had wanted to learn and now he looked as if he had learned it he stood up and smiled cheerfully go ahead wesley he said go ahead with number you wont have any trouble at all they had all risen to their feet in gloomily reluctant deference wesley mouch glanced down at his sheet of paper then said in a petulant tone of voice if you want me to go ahead youll have to declare a state of total emergency ill declare it any time youre ready there are certain difficulties which ill leave it up to you work it out any way you wish its your job let me see the rough draft tomorrow or next day but dont bother me about the details ive got a speech to make on the radio in half an hour the chief difficulty is that im not sure whether the law actually grants us the power to put into effect certain provisions of directive number fear they might be open to challenge oh hell weve passed so many emergency laws that if you hunt through them youre sure to dig up something that will cover it mr thompson turned to the others with a smile of good fellowship ill leave you boys to iron out the wrinkles he said i appreciate your coming to washington to help us out glad to have seen you they waited until the door closed after him then resumed their seats they did not look at one another they had not heard the text of directive no but they knew what it would contain they had known it for a long time in that special manner which consisted of keeping secrets from oneself and leaving knowledge untranslated into words and by the same method they now wished it were possible for them not to hear the words of the directive it was to avoid moments such as this that all the complex twistings of their minds had been devised they wished the directive to go into effect they wished it could be put into effect without words so that they would not have to know that what they were doing was what it was nobody had ever announced that directive no was the final goal of his efforts yet for generations past men had worked to make it possible and for months past every provision of it had been prepared for by countless speeches articles sermons editorialsby purposeful voices that screamed with anger if anyone named their purpose the picture now is this said wesley mouch the economic condition of the country was better the year before last than it was last year and last year it was better than it is at present its obvious that we would not be able to survive another year of the same progression therefore our sole objective must now be to hold the line to stand still in order to catch our stride to achieve total stability freedom has been given a chance and has failed therefore more stringent controls are necessary since men are unable and unwilling to solve their problems voluntarily they must be forced to do it he paused picked up the sheet of paper then added in a less formal tone of voice hell what it comes down to is that we can manage to exist as and where we are but we cant afford to move so weve got to stand still weve got to stand still weve got to make those bastards stand still his head drawn into his shoulders he was looking at them with the anger of a man declaring that the countrys troubles were a personal affront to him so many men seeking favors had been afraid of him that he now acted as if his anger were a solution to everything as if his anger were omnipotent as if all he had to do was to get angry yet facing him the men who sat in a silent semicircle before his desk were uncertain whether the presence of fear in the room was their own emotion or whether the hunched figure behind the desk generated the panic of a cornered rat wesley mouch had a long square face and a flattopped skull made more so by a brush haircut his lower lip was a petulant bulb and the pale brownish pupils of his eyes looked like the yolks of eggs smeared under the not fully translucent whites his facial muscles moved abruptly and the movement vanished having conveyed no expression no one had ever seen him smile wesley mouch came from a family that had known neither poverty nor wealth nor distinction for many generations it had clung however to a tradition of its own that of being collegebred and therefore of despising men who were in business the familys diplomas had always hung on the wall in the manner of a reproach to the world because the diplomas had not automatically produced the material equivalents of their attested spiritual value among the familys numerous relatives there was one rich uncle he had married his money and in his widowed old age he had picked wesley as his favorite from among his many nephews and nieces because wesley was the least distinguished of the lot and therefore thought uncle julius the safest uncle julius did not care for people who were brilliant he did not care for the trouble of managing his money either so he turned the job over to wesley by the time wesley graduated from college there was no money left to manage uncle julius blamed it on wesleys cunning and cried that wesley was an unscrupulous schemer but there had been no scheme about it wesley could not have said just where the money had gone in high school wesley mouch had been one of the worst students and had passionately envied those who were the best college taught him that he did not have to envy them at all after graduation he took a job in the advertising department of a company that manufactured a bogus corncure the cure sold well and he rose to be the head of his department he left it to take charge of the advertising of a hairrestorer then of a patented brassiere then of a new soap then of a soft drinkand then he became advertising vicepresident of an automobile concern he tried to sell automobiles as if they were a bogus corncure they did not sell he blamed it on the insufficiency of his advertising budget it was the president of the automobile concern who recommended him to rearden it was rearden who introduced him to washingtonrearden who knew no standard by which to judge the activities of his washington man it was james taggart who gave him a start in the bureau of economic planning and national resourcesin exchange for double crossing rearden in order to help orren boyle in exchange for destroying dan conway from then on people helped wesley mouch to advance for the same reason as that which had prompted uncle julius they were people who believed that mediocrity was safe the men who now sat in front of his desk had been taught that the law of causality was a superstition and that one had to deal with the situation of the moment without considering its cause by the situation of the moment they had concluded that wesley mouch was a man of superlative skill and cunning since millions aspired to power but he was the one who had achieved it it was not within their method of thinking to know that wesley mouch was the zero at the meeting point of forces unleashed in destruction against one another this is just a rough draft of directive number said wesley mouch which gene clem and i have dashed off just to give you the general idea we want to hear your opinions suggestions and so forthyou being the representatives of labor industry transportation and the professions fred kinnan got off the window sill and sat down on the arm of a chair orren boyle spit out the butt of his cigar james taggart looked down at his own hands dr ferris was the only one who seemed to be at ease in the name of the general welfare read wesley mouch to protect the peoples security to achieve full equality and total stability it is decreed for the duration of the national emergency that point one

this directive shall be settled and determined by the unification board whose decisions will be final there was even within the four men who had listened a remnant of human dignity which made them sit still and feel sick for the length of one minute james taggart spoke first his voice was low but it had the trembling intensity of an involuntary scream well why not why should they have it if we dont why should they stand above us if we are to perish lets make sure that we all perish together lets make sure that we leave them no chance to survive thats a damn funny thing to say about a very practical plan that will benefit everybody said orren boyle shrilly looking at taggart in frightened astonishment dr ferris chuckled taggarts eyes seemed to focus and he said his voice louder yes of course its a very practical plan its necessary practical and just it will solve everybodys problems it will give everybody a chance to feel safe a chance to rest it will give security to the people said eugene lawson his mouth slithering into a smile securitythats what the people want if they want it why shouldnt they have it just because a handful of rich will object its not the rich wholl object said dr ferris lazily the rich drool for security more than any other sort of animalhavent you discovered that yet well wholl object snapped lawson dr ferris smiled pointedly and did not answer lawson looked away to hell with them why should we worry about them weve got to run the world for the sake of the little people its intelligence thats caused all the troubles of humanity mans mind is the root of all evil this is the day of the heart its the weak the meek the sick and the humble that must be the only objects of our concern his lower up was twisting in soft lecherous motions those whore big are here to serve those who arent if they refuse to do their moral duty weve got to force them there once was an age of reason but weve progressed beyond it this is the age of love shut up screamed james taggart they all stared at him for christs sake jim whats the matter said orren boyle shaking nothing said taggart nothing wesley keep him still will you mouch said uncomfortably but i fail to see just keep him still we dont have to listen to him do we why no but then lets go on what is this demanded lawson i resent it i most emphatically but he saw no support in the faces around him and stopped his mouth sagging into an expression of pouting hatred lets go on said taggart feverishly whats the matter with you asked orren boyle trying not to know what was the matter with himself and why he felt frightened genius is a superstition jim said dr ferris slowly with an odd kind of emphasis as if knowing that he was naming the unnamed in all their minds theres no such thing as the intellect a mans brain is a social product a sum of influences that hes picked up from those around him nobody invents anything he merely reflects whats floating in the social atmosphere a genius is an intellectual scavenger and a greedy hoarder of the ideas which rightfully belong to society from which he stole them all thought is theft if we do away with private fortunes well have a fairer distribution of wealth if we do away with the genius well have a faker distribution of ideas are we here to talk business or are we here to kid one another asked fred kinnan they turned to him he was a muscular man with large features but his face had the astonishing property of finely drawn lines that raised the corners of his mouth into the permanent hint of a wise sardonic grin he sat on the arm of the chair hands in pockets looking at mouch with the smiling glance of a hardened policeman at a shoplifter all ive got to say is that youd better staff that unification board with my men he said better make sure of it brotheror ill blast your point one to hell i intend of course to have a representative of labor on that board said mouch dryly as well as a representative of industry of the professions and of every crosssection of no crosssections said fred kinnan evenly just representatives of labor period what the hell yelled orren boyle thats stacking the cards isnt it sure said fred kinnan but that will give you a stranglehold on every business in the country what do you think im after thats unfair yelled boyle i wont stand for it you have no right you right said kinnan innocently are we talking about rights but i mean after all there are certain fundamental property rights which listen pal you want point three dont you well i then youd better keep your trap shut about property rights from now on keep it shut tight mr kinnan said dr ferris you must not make the old fashioned mistake of drawing wide generalizations our policy has to be flexible there are no absolute principles which save it for jim taggart doc said fred kinnan i know what im talking about thats because i never went to college i object said boyle to your dictatorial method of kinnan turned his back on him and said listen wesley my boys wont like point one if i get to run things ill make them swallow it if not not just make up your mind well said mouch and stopped for christs sake wesley what about us yelled taggart youll come to me said kinnan when youll need a deal to fix the board but ill run that board me and wesley do you think the country will stand for it yelled taggart stop kidding yourself said kinnan the country if there arent any principles any moreand i guess the doc is right because there sure arentif there arent any rules to this game and its only a question of who robs whomthen ive got more votes than the bunch of you there are more workers than employers and dont you forget it boys thats a funny attitude to take said taggart haughtily about a measure which after all is not designed for the selfish benefit of workers or employers but for the general welfare of the public okay said kinnan amiably lets talk your lingo who is the public if you go by qualitythen it aint you jim and it aint orrie boyle if you go by quantitythen it sure is me because quantity is what ive got behind me his smile disappeared and with a sudden bitter look of weariness he added only im not going to say that im working for the welfare of my public because i know im not i know that im delivering the poor bastards into slavery and thats all there is to it and they know it too but they know that ill have to throw them a crumb once in a while if i want to keep my racket while with the rest of you they wouldnt have a chance in hell so thats why if theyve got to be under a whip theyd rather i held it not youyou drooling tearjerking mealymouthed bastards of the public welfare do you think that outside of your collegebred pansies theres one village idiot whom youre fooling im a racketeerbut i know it and my boys know it and they know that ill pay off not out of the kindness of my heart either and not a cent more than i can get away with but at least they can count on that much sure it makes me sick sometimes it makes me sick right now but its not me whos built this kind of worldyou didso im playing the game as youve set it up and im going to play it for as long as it lastswhich isnt going to be long for any of us he stood up no one answered him he let his eyes move slowly from face to face and stop on wesley mouch do i get the board wesley he asked casually the selection of the specific personnel is only a technical detail said mouch pleasantly suppose we discuss it later you and i everybody in the room knew that this meant the answer yes okay pal said kinnan he went back to the window sat down on the sill and lighted a cigarette for some unadmitted reason the others were looking at dr ferris as if seeking guidance dont be disturbed by oratory said dr ferris smoothly mr kinnan is a fine speaker but he has no sense of practical reality he is unable to think dialectically there was another silence then james taggart spoke up suddenly i dont care it doesnt matter hell have to hold things still everything will have to remain as it is just as it is nobody will be permitted to change anything except he turned sharply to wesley mouch wesley under point four well have to close all research departments experimental laboratories scientific foundations and all the rest of the institutions of that kind theyll have to be forbidden yes thats right said mouch i hadnt thought of that well have to stick in a couple of lines about that he hunted around for a pencil and made a few scrawls on the margin of his paper it will end wasteful competition said james taggart well stop scrambling to beat one another to the untried and the unknown we wont have to worry about new inventions upsetting the market we wont have to pour money down the drain in useless experiments just to keep up with over ambitious competitors yes said orren boyle nobody should be allowed to waste money on the new until everybody has plenty of the old close all those damn research laboratoriesand the sooner the better yes said wesley mouch well close them all of them the state science institute too asked fred kinnan oh no said mouch thats different thats government besides its a nonprofit institution and it will be sufficient to take care of all scientific progress quite sufficient said dr ferris and what will become of all the engineers professors and such when you close all those laboratories asked fred kinnan what are they going to do for a living with all the other jobs and businesses frozen oh said wesley mouch he scratched his head he turned to mr weatherby do we put them on relief clem no said mr weatherby what for theres not enough of them to raise a squawk not enough to matter i suppose said mouch turning to dr ferris that youll be able to absorb some of them floyd some said dr ferris slowly as if relishing every syllable of his answer those who prove cooperative what about the rest asked fred kinnan theyll have to wait till the unification board finds some use for them said wesley mouch what will they eat while theyre waiting mouch shrugged theres got to be some victims in times of national emergency it cant be helped we have the right to do it cried taggart suddenly in defiance to the stillness of the room we need it we need it dont we there was no answer we have the right to protect our livelihood nobody opposed him but he went on with a shrill pleading insistence well be safe for the first time in centuries everybody will know his place and job and everybody elses place and joband we wont be at the mercy of every stray crank with a new idea nobody will push us out of business or steal our markets or undersell us or make us obsolete nobody will come to us offering some damn new gadget and putting us on the spot to decide whether well lose our shirt if we buy it or whether well lose our shirt if we dont but somebody else does we wont have to decide nobody will be permitted to decide anything it will be decided once and for all his glance moved pleadingly from face to face theres been enough invented alreadyenough for everybodys comfortwhy should they be allowed to go on inventing why should we permit them to blast the ground from under our feet every few steps why should we be kept on the go in eternal uncertainty just because of a few restless ambitious adventurers should we sacrifice the contentment of the whole of mankind to the greed of a few nonconformists we dont need them we dont need them at all i wish wed get rid of that hero worship heroes theyve done nothing but harm all through history theyve kept mankind running a wild race with no breathing spell no rest no ease no security running to catch up with them always without end just as we catch up theyre years ahead they leave us no chance theyve never left us a chance his eyes were moving restlessly he glanced at the window but looked hastily away he did not want to see the white obelisk in the distance were through with them weve won this is our age our world were going to have securityfor the first time in centuriesfor the first time since the beginning of the industrial revolution well this i guess said fred kinnan is the antiindustrial revolution thats a damn funny thing for you to say snapped wesley mouch we cant be permitted to say that to the public dont worry brother i wont say it to the public its a total fallacy said dr ferris its a statement prompted by ignorance every expert has conceded long ago that a planned economy achieves the maximum of productive efficiency and that centralization leads to superindustrialization centralization destroys the blight of monopoly said boyle hows that again drawled kinnan boyle did not catch the tone of mockery and answered earnestly it destroys the blight of monopoly it leads to the democratization of industry it makes everything available to everybody now for instance at a time like this when theres such a desperate shortage of iron ore is there any sense in my wasting money labor and national resources on making oldfashioned steel when there exists a much better metal that i could be making a metal that everybody wants but nobody can get now is that good economics or sound social efficiency or democratic justice why shouldnt i be allowed to manufacture that metal and why shouldnt the people get it when they need it just because of the private monopoly of one selfish individual should we sacrifice our rights to his personal interests skip it brother said fred kinnan ive read it all in the same newspapers you did i dont like your attitude said boyle in a sudden tone of righteousness with a look which in a barroom would have signified a prelude to a fist fight he sat up straight buttressed by the columns of paragraphs on yellowtinged paper which he was seeing in his mind at a time of crucial public need are we to waste social effort on the manufacture of obsolete products are we to let the many remain in want while the few withhold from us the better products and methods available are we to be stopped by the superstition of patent rights is it not obvious that private industry is unable to cope with the present economic crisis how long for instance are we going to put up with the disgraceful shortage of rearden metal there is a crying public demand for it which rearden has failed to supply when are we going to put an end to economic injustice and special privileges why should rearden be the only one permitted to manufacture rearden metal i dont like your attitude said orren boyle so long as we respect the rights of the workers well want you to respect the rights of the industrialists which rights of which industrialists drawled kinnan im inclined to think said dr ferris hastily that point two perhaps is the most essential one of all at present we must put an end to that peculiar business of industrialists retiring and vanishing we must stop them its playing havoc with our entire economy why are they doing it asked taggart nervously where are they all going nobody knows said dr ferris weve been unable to find any information or explanation but it must be stopped in times of crisis economic service to the nation is just as much of a duty as military service anyone who abandons it should be regarded as a deserter i have recommended that we introduce the death penalty for those men but wesley wouldnt agree to it take it easy boy said fred kinnan in an odd slow voice he sat suddenly and perfectly still his arms crossed looking at ferris in a manner that made it suddenly real to the room that ferris had proposed murder dont let me hear you talk about any death penalties in industry dr ferris shrugged we dont have to go to extremes said mouch hastily we dont want to frighten people we want to have them on our side our top problem is will they will they accept it at all they will said dr ferris im a little worried said eugene lawson about points three and four taking over the patents is fine nobodys going to defend industrialists but im worried about taking over the copyrights thats going to antagonize the intellectuals its dangerous its a spiritual issue doesnt point four mean that no new books are to be written or published from now on yes said mouch it does but we cant make an exception for the bookpublishing business its an industry like any other when we say no new products its got to mean no new products but this is a matter of the spirit said lawson his voice had a tone not of rational respect but of superstitious awe were not interfering with anybodys spirit but when you print a book on paper it becomes a material commodityand if we grant an exception to one commodity we wont be able to hold the others in line and we wont be able to make anything stick yes thats true but dont be a chump gene said dr ferris you dont want some recalcitrant hacks to come out with treatises that will wreck our entire program do you if you breathe the word censorship now theyll all scream bloody murder theyre not ready for itas yet but if you leave the spirit alone and make it a simple material issuenot a matter of ideas but just a matter of paper ink and printing pressesyou accomplish your purpose much more smoothly youll make sure that nothing dangerous gets printed or heardand nobody is going to fight over a material issue yes but but i dont think the writers will like it are you sure asked wesley mouch with a glance that was almost a smile dont forget that under point five the publishers will have to publish as many books as they did in the basic year since there will be no new ones they will have to reprintand the public will have to buysome of the old ones there are many very worthy books that have never had a fair chance oh said lawson he remembered that he had seen mouch lunching with balph eubank two weeks ago then he shook his head and frowned still im worried the intellectuals are our friends we dont want to lose them they can make an awful lot of trouble they wont said fred kinnan your kind of intellectuals are the first to scream when its safeand the first to shut their traps at the first sign of danger they spend years spitting at the man who feeds themand they lick the hand of the man who slaps their drooling faces didnt they deliver every country of europe one after another to committees of goons just like this one here didnt they scream their heads off to shut out every burglar alarm and to break every padlock open for the goons have you heard a peep out of them since didnt they scream that they were the friends of labor do you hear them raising their voices about the chain gangs the slave camps the fourteenhour workday and the mortality from scurvy in the peoples states of europe no but you do hear them telling the whipbeaten wretches that starvation is prosperity that slavery is freedom that torture chambers arc brotherlove and that if the wretches dont understand it then its their own fault that they suffer and its the mangled corpses in the jail cellars whore to blame for all their troubles not the benevolent leaders intellectuals you might have to worry about any other breed of men but not about the modern intellectuals theyll swallow anything i dont feel so safe about the lousiest wharf rat in the longshoremens union hes liable to remember suddenly that he is a manand then i wont be able to keep him in line but the intellectuals thats the one thing theyve forgotten long ago i guess its the one thing that all their education was aimed to make them forget do anything you please to the intellectuals theyll take it for once said dr ferns i agree with mr kinnan i agree with his facts if not with his feelings you dont have to worry about the intellectuals wesley just put afew of them on the government payroll and send them out to preach precisely the sort of thing mr kinnan mentioned that the blame rests on the victims give them moderately comfortable salaries and extremely loud titlesand theyll forget their copyrights and do a better job for you than whole squads of enforcement officers yes said mouch i know the danger that im worried about will come from a different quarter said dr ferris thoughtfully you might run into quite a bit of trouble on that voluntary gift certificate business wesley i know said mouch glumly thats the point i wanted thompson to help us out on but i guess he cant we dont actually have the legal power to seize the patents oh theres plenty of clauses in dozens of laws that can be stretched to cover italmost but not quite any tycoon whod want to make a test case would have a very good chance to beat us and we have to preserve a semblance of legalityor the populace wont take it precisely said dr ferris its extremely important to get those patents turned over to us voluntarily even if we had a law permitting outright nationalization it would be much better to get them as a gift we want to leave to people the illusion that theyre still preserving their private property rights and most of them will play along theyll sign the gift certificates just raise a lot of noise about its being a patriotic duty and that anyone who refuses is a prince of greed and theyll sign but he stopped i know said mouch he was growing visibly more nervous there will be i think a few oldfashioned bastards here and there wholl refuse to signbut they wont be prominent enough to make a noise nobody will hear about it their own communities and friends will turn against them for their being selfish so it wont give us any trouble well just take the patents over anywayand those guys wont have the nerve or the money to start a test case but he stopped james taggart leaned back in his chair watching them he was beginning to enjoy the conversation yes said dr ferris im thinking of it too im thinking of a certain tycoon who is in a position to blast us to pieces whether well recover the pieces or not is hard to tell god knows what is liable to happen at a hysterical time like the present and in a situation as delicate as this anything can throw everything off balance blow up the whole works and if theres anyone who wants to do it he does he does and can he knows the real issue he knows the things which must not be saidand he is not afraid to say them he knows the one dangerous fatally dangerous weapon he is our deadliest adversary who asked lawson dr ferris hesitated shrugged and answered the guiltless man lawson stared blankly what do you mean and whom are you talking about james taggart smiled i mean that there is no way to disarm any man said dr ferris except through guilt through that which he himself has accepted as guilt if a man has ever stolen a dime you can impose on him the punishment intended for a bank robber and he will take it hell bear any form of misery hell feel that he deserves no better if theres not enough guilt in the world we must create it if we teach a man that its evil to look at spring flowers and he believes us and then does it well be able to do whatever we please with him he wont defend himself he wont feel hes worth it he wont fight but save us from the man who lives up to his own standards save us from the man of clean conscience hes the man wholl beat us are you talking about henry rearden asked taggart his voice peculiarly clear the one name they had not wanted to pronounce struck them into an instants silence what if i were asked dr ferris cautiously oh nothing said taggart only if you were i would tell you that i can deliver henry rearden hell sign by the rules of their unspoken language they all knewfrom the tone of his voicethat he was not bluffing god jim no gasped wesley mouch yes said taggart i was stunned too when i learnedwhat i learned i didnt expect that anything but that i am glad to hear it said mouch cautiously its a constructive piece of information it might be very valuable indeed valuableyes said taggart pleasantly when do you plan to put the directive into effect oh we have to move fast we dont want any news of it to leak out i expect you all to keep this most strictly confidential id say that well be ready to spring it on them in a couple of weeks dont you think that it would be advisablebefore all prices are frozento adjust the matter of the railroad rates i was thinking of a raise a small but most essentially needed raise well discuss it you and i said mouch amiably it might be arranged he turned to the others boyles face was sagging there are many details still to be worked out but im sure that our program wont encounter any major difficulties he was assuming the tone and manner of a public address he sounded brisk and almost cheerful rough spots are to be expected if one thing doesnt work well try another trialanderror is the only pragmatic rule of action well just keep on trying if any hardships come up remember that its only temporary only for the duration of the national emergency say asked kinnan how is the emergency to end if everything is to stand still dont be theoretical said mouch impatiently weve got to deal with the situation of the moment dont bother about minor details so long as the broad outlines of our policy are clear well have the power well be able to solve any problem and answer any question fred kinnan chuckled who is john galt dont say that cried taggart i have a question to ask about point seven said kinnan it says that al wages prices salaries dividends profits and so forth will be frozen on the date of the directive taxes too oh no cried mouch how can we tell what funds well need in the future kinnan seemed to be smiling well snapped mouch what about it nothing said kinnan i just asked mouch leaned back in his chair i must say to all of you that i appreciate your coming here and giving us the benefit of your opinions it has been very helpful he leaned forward to look at his desk calendar and sat over it for a moment toying with his pencil then the pencil came down struck a date and drew a circle around it directive will go into effect on the morning of may first all nodded approval none looked at his neighbor james taggart rose walked to the window and pulled the blind down over the white obelisk in the first moment of awakening dagny was astonished to find herself looking at the spires of unfamiliar buildings against a glowing pale blue sky then she saw the twisted seam of the thin stocking on her own leg she felt a wrench of discomfort in the muscles of her waistline and she realized that she was lying on the couch in her office with the clock on her desk saying and the first rays of the sun giving silver edges to the silhouettes of the skyscrapers beyond the window the last thing she remembered was that she had dropped down on the couch intending to rest for ten minutes when the window was black and the clock stood at she twisted herself to her feet feeling an enormous exhaustion the lighted lamp on the desk looked futile in the glow of the morning over the piles of paper which were her cheerless unfinished task she tried not to think of the work for a few minutes longer while she dragged herself past the desk to her washroom and let handfuls of cold water run over her face the exhaustion was gone by the time she stepped back into the office no matter what night preceded it she had never known a morning when she did not feel the rise of a quiet excitement that became a tightening energy in her body and a hunger for action in her mindbecause this was the beginning of day and it was a day of her life she looked down at the city the streets were still empty it made them look wider and in the luminous cleanliness of the spring air they seemed to be waiting for the promise of all the greatness that would take form in the activity about to pour through them the calendar in the distance said may she sat down at her desk smiling in defiance at the distastefulness of her job she hated the reports that she had to finish reading but it was her job it was her railroad it was morning she lighted a cigarette thinking that she would finish this task before breakfast she turned off the lamp and pulled the papers forward there were reports from the general managers of the four regions of the taggart system their pages a typewritten cry of despair over the breakdowns of equipment there was a report about a wreck on the main line near winston colorado there was the new budget of the operating department the revised budget based on the raise in rates which jim had obtained last week she tried to choke the exasperation of hopelessness as she went slowly over the budgets figures all those calculations had been made on the assumption that the volume of freight would remain unchanged and that the raise would bring them added revenue by the end of the year she knew that the freight tonnage would go on shrinking that the raise would make little difference that by the end of this year their losses would be greater than ever when she looked up from the pages she saw with a small jolt of astonishment that the clock said she had been dimly aware of the usual sound of movement and voices in the anteroom of her office as her staff had arrived to begin their day she wondered why nobody had entered her office and why her telephone had remained silent as a daily rule there should have been a rush of business by this hour she glanced at her calendar there was a note that the mcneil car foundry of chicago was to phone her at nine am in regard to the new freight cars which taggart transcontinental had been expecting for six months she flicked the switch of the interoffice communicator to call her secretary the girls voice answered with a startled little gasp miss taggart are you here in your office i slept here last night again didnt intend to but did was there a call for me from the mcneil car foundry no miss taggart put them through to me immediately when they call yes miss taggart switching the communicator off she wondered whether she imagined it or whether there had been something strange in the girls voice it had sounded unnaturally tense she felt the faint lightheadedness of hunger and thought that she should go down to get a cup of coffee but there was still the report of the chief engineer to finish so she lighted one more cigarette the chief engineer was out on the road supervising the reconstruction of the main track with the rearden metal rail taken from the corpse of the john galt line she had chosen the sections most urgently in need of repair opening his report she readwith a shock of incredulous angerthat he had stopped work in the mountain section of winston colorado he recommended a change of plans he suggested that the rail intended for winston be used instead to repair the track of their washingtontomiami branch he gave his reasons a derailment had occurred on that branch last week and mr tinky holloway of washington traveling with a party of friends had been delayed for three hours it had been reported to the chief engineer that mr holloway had expressed extreme displeasure although from a purely technological viewpointsaid the chief engineers reportthe rail of the miami branch was in better condition than that of the winston section one had to remember from a sociological viewpoint that the miami branch carried a much more important class of passenger traffic therefore the chief engineer suggested that winston could be kept waiting a little longer and recommended the sacrifice of an obscure section of mountain trackage for the sake of a branch where taggart transcontinental could not afford to create an unfavorable impression she read slashing furious pencil marks on the margins of the pages thinking that her first duty of the day ahead of any other was to stop this particular piece of insanity the telephone rang yes she asked snatching the receiver mcneil car foundry no said the voice of her secretary senor francisco danconia she looked at the phones mouthpiece for the instant of a brief shock all right put him on the next voice she heard was franciscos i see that youre in your office just the same he said his voice was mocking harsh and tense where did you expect me to be how do you like the new suspension what suspension the moratorium on brains what are you talking about havent you seen todays newspapers no there was a pause then his voice came slowly changed and grave better take a look at them dagny all right ill call you later she hung up and pressed the switch of the communicator on her desk get me a newspaper she said to her secretary yes miss taggart the secretarys voice answered grimly it was eddie willers who came in and put the newspaper down on her desk the meaning of the look on his face was the same as the tone she had caught in franciscos voice the advance notice of some inconceivable disaster none of us wanted to be first to tell you he said very quietly and walked out when she rose from her desk a few moments later she felt that she had full control of her body and that she was not aware of her bodys existence she felt lifted to her feet and it seemed to her that she stood straight not touching the ground there was an abnormal clarity about every object in the room yet she was seeing nothing around her but she knew that she would be able to see the thread of a cobweb if her purpose required it just as she would be able to walk with a somnambulists assurance along the edge of a roof she could not know that she was looking at the room with the eyes of a person who had lost the capacity and the concept of doubt and what remained to her was the simplicity of a single perception and of a single goal she did not know that the thing which seemed so violent yet felt like such a still unfamiliar calm within her was the power of full certaintyand that the anger shaking her body the anger which made her ready with the same passionate indifference either to kill or to die was her love of rectitude the only love to which all the years of her life had been given holding the newspaper in her hand she walked out of her office and on toward the hall she knew crossing the anteroom that the faces of her staff were turned to her but they seemed to be many years away she walked down the hall moving swiftly but without effort with the same sensation of knowing that her feet were probably touching the ground but that she did not feel it she did not know how many rooms she crossed to reach jims office or whether there had been any people in her way she knew the direction to take and the door to pull open to enter unannounced and walk toward his desk the newspaper was twisted into a roll by the time she stood before him she threw it at his face it struck his cheek and fell down to the carpet theres my resignation jim she said i wont work as a slave or as a slavedriver she did not hear the sound of his gasp it came with the sound of the door closing after her she went back to her office and crossing the anteroom signaled eddie to follow her inside she said her voice calm and clear i have resigned he nodded silently i dont know as yet what ill do in the future im going away to think it over and to decide if you want to follow me ill be at the lodge in woodstock it was an old hunting cabin in a forest of the berkshire mountains which she had inherited from her father and had not visited for years i want to follow he whispered i want to quit and and i cant i cant make myself do it then will you do me a favor of course dont communicate with me about the railroad i dont want to hear it dont tell anyone where i am except hank rearden if he asks tell him about the cabin and how to get there but no one else i dont want to see anybody au right promise of course when i decide whats to become of me ill let you know ill wait thats all eddie he knew that every word was measured and that nothing else could be said between them at this moment he inclined his head letting it say the rest then walked out of the office she saw the chief engineers report still lying open on her desk and thought that she had to order him at once to resume the work on the winston section then remembered that it was not her problem any longer she felt no pain she knew that the pain would come later and that it would be a tearing agony of pain and that the numbness of this moment was a rest granted to her not after but before to make her ready to bear it but it did not matter if that is required of me then ill bear itshe thought she sat down at her desk and telephoned rearden at his mills in pennsylvania hello dearest he said he said it simply and clearly as if he wanted to say it because it was real and right and he needed to hold on to the concepts of reality and tightness hank ive quit i see he sounded as if he had expected it nobody came to get me no destroyer perhaps there never was any destroyer after all i dont know what ill do next but i have to get away so that i wont have to see any of them for a while then ill decide i know that you cant go with me right now no i have two weeks in which they expect me to sign their gift certificate i want to be right here when the two weeks expire do you need mefor the two weeks no its worse for you than for me you have no way to fight them i have i think im glad they did it its clear and final dont worry about me rest rest from all of it first yes where are you going to the country to a cabin i own in the berkshires if you want to see me eddie willers will tell you the way to get there ill be back in two weeks will you do me a favor yes dont come back until i come for you but i want to be here when it happens leave that up to me whatever they do to you i want it done to me also leave it up to me dearest dont you understand i think that what i want most right now is what you want not to see any of them but i have to stay here for a while so it will help me if i know that you at least are out of their reach i want to keep one clean point in my mind to lean against it will be only a short whileand then ill come for you do you understand yes my darling so long it was weightlessly easy to walk out of her office and down the stretching halls of taggart transcontinental she walked looking ahead her steps advancing with the unbroken unhurried rhythm of finality her face was held level and it had a look of astonishment of acceptance of repose she walked across the concourse of the terminal she saw the statue of nathaniel taggart but she felt no pain from it and no reproach only the rising fullness of her love only the feeling that she was going to join him not in death but in that which had been his life the first man to quit at rearden steel was tom colby rolling mill foreman head of the rearden steel workers union for ten years he had heard himself denounced throughout the country because his was a company union and because he had never engaged in a violent conflict with the management this was true no conflict had ever been necessary rearden paid a higher wage scale than any union scale in the country for which he demandedand gotthe best labor force to be found anywhere when tom colby told him that he was quitting rearden nodded without comment or questions i wont work under these conditions myself colby added quietly and i wont help to keep the men working they trust me i wont be the judas goat leading them to the stockyards what are you going to do for a living asked rearden ive saved enough to last me for about a year and after that colby shrugged rearden thought of the boy with the angry eyes who mined coal at night as a criminal he thought of all the dark roads the alleys the back yards of the country where the best of the countrys men would now exchange their services in jungle barter in chance jobs in unrecorded transactions he thought of the end of that road tom colby seemed to know what he was thinking youre on your way to end up right alongside of me mr rearden he said are you going to sign your brains over to them no and after that rearden shrugged colbys eyes watched him for a moment pale shrewd eyes in a furnacetanned face with sootengraved wrinkles theyve been telling us for years that its you against me mr rearden but it isnt its orren boyle and fred kinnan against you and me i know it the wet nurse had never entered reardens office as if sensing that that was a place he had no right to enter he always waited to catch a glimpse of rearden outside the directive had attached him to his job as the mills official watchdog of overorunderproduction he stopped rearden a few days later in an alley between the rows of openhearth furnaces there was an odd look of fierceness on the boys face mr rearden he said i wanted to tell you that if you want to pour ten times the quota of rearden metal or steel or pig iron or anything and bootleg it all over the place to anybody at any pricei wanted to tell you to go ahead ill fix it up ill juggle the books ill fake the reports ill get phony witnesses ill forge affidavits ill commit perjuryso you dont have to worry there wont be any trouble now why do you want to do that asked rearden smiling but his smile vanished when he heard the boy answer earnestly because i want for once to do something moral thats not the way to be moral rearden started and stopped abruptly realizing that it was the way the only way left realizing through how many twists of intellectual corruption upon corruption this boy had to struggle toward his momentous discovery i guess thats not the word the boy said sheepishly i know its a stuffy oldfashioned word thats not what i meant i meant it was a sudden desperate cry of incredulous anger mr rearden they have no right to do it what take rearden metal away from you rearden smiled and prompted by a desperate pity said forget it nonabsolute there are no rights i know there arent but i mean what i mean is that they cant do it why not he could not help smiling mr rearden dont sign the gift certificate dont sign it on principle i wont sign it but there arent any principles i know there arent he was reciting it in full earnestness with the honesty of a conscientious student i know that everything is relative and that nobody can know anything and that reason is an illusion and that there isnt any reality but im just talking about rearden metal dont sign mr rearden morals or no morals principles or no principles just dont sign itbecause it isnt right no one else mentioned the directive in reardens presence silence was the new aspect about the mills the men did not speak to him when he appeared in the workshops and he noticed that they did not speak to one another the personnel office received no formal resignations but every other morning one or two men failed to appear and never appeared again inquiries at their homes found the homes abandoned and the men gone the personnel office did not report these desertions as the directive required instead rearden began to see unfamiliar faces among the workers the drawn beaten faces of the long unemployed and heard them addressed by the names of the men who had quit he asked no questions there was silence throughout the country he did not know how many industrialists had retired and vanished on may i and leaving their plants to be seized he counted ten among his own customers including mcneil of the mcneil car foundry in chicago he had no way of learning about the others no reports appeared in the newspapers the front pages of the newspapers were suddenly full of stories about spring floods traffic accidents school picnics and goldenwedding anniversaries there was silence in his own home lillian had departed on a vacation trip to florida in midapril it had astonished him as an inexplicable whim it was the first trip she had taken alone since their marriage philip avoided him with a look of panic his mother stared at rearden in reproachful bewilderment she said nothing but she kept bursting into tears in his presence her manner suggesting that her tears were the most important aspect to consider in whatever disaster it was that she sensed approaching on the morning of may he sat at the desk in his office above the spread of the mills and watched the colors of the smoke rising to the clear blue sky there were spurts of transparent smoke like waves of heat invisible but for the structures that shivered behind them there were streaks of red smoke and sluggish columns of yellow and light floating spirals of blueand the thick tight swiftly pouring coils that looked like twisted bolts of satin tinged a motherofpearl pink by the summer sun the buzzer rang on his desk and miss ives voice said dr floyd ferris to see you without appointment mr rearden in spite of its rigid formality her tone conveyed the question shall i throw him out there was a faint movement of astonishment in reardens face barely above the line of indifference he had not expected that particular emissary he answered evenly ask him to come in dr ferris did not smile as he walked toward reardens desk he merely wore a look suggesting that rearden knew full well that he had good reason to smile and so he would abstain from the obvious he sat down in front of the desk not waiting for an invitation he carried a briefcase which he placed across his knees he acted as if words were superfluous since his reappearance in this office had made everything clear rearden sat watching him in patient silence since the deadline for the signing of the national gift certificates expires tonight at midnight said dr ferris in the tone of a salesman extending a special courtesy to a customer i have come to obtain your signature mr rearden he paused with an air of suggesting that the formula now called for an answer go on said rearden i am listening yes i suppose i should explain said dr ferris that we wish to get your signature early in the day in order to announce the fact on a national news broadcast although the gift program has gone through quite smoothly there are still a few stubborn individualists left who have failed to signsmall fry really whose patents are of no crucial value but we cannot let them remain unbound as a matter of principle you understand they are we believe waiting to follow your lead you have a great popular following mr rearden much greater than you suspected or knew how to use therefore the announcement that you have signed will remove the last hopes of resistance and by midnight will bring in the last signatures thus completing the program on schedule rearden knew that of all possible speeches this was the last dr ferris would make if any doubt of his surrender remained in the mans mind go on said rearden evenly you havent finished you knowas you have demonstrated at your trialhow important it is and why that we obtain all that property with the voluntary consent of the victims dr ferris opened his briefcase here is the gift certificate mr rearden we have filled it out and all you have to do is to sign your name at the bottom the piece of paper which he placed in front of rearden looked like a small college diploma with the text printed in oldfashioned script and the particulars inserted by typewriter the thing stated that he henry rearden hereby transferred to the nation all rights to the metal alloy now known as rearden metal which would henceforth be manufactured by all who so desired and which would bear the name of miracle metal chosen by the representatives of the people glancing at the paper rearden wondered whether it was a deliberate mockery of decency or so low an estimate of their victims intelligence that had made the designers of this paper print the text across a faint drawing of the statue of liberty his eyes moved slowly to dr ferris face you would not have come here he said unless you had some extraordinary kind of blackjack to use on me what is it of course said dr ferris i would expect you to understand that that is why no lengthy explanations are necessary he opened his briefcase do you wish to see my blackjack i have brought a few samples in the manner of a cardsharp whisking out a long fan of cards with one snap of the hand he spread before rearden a line of glossy photographic prints they were photostats of hotel and auto court registers bearing in reardens handwriting the names of mr and mrs j smith you know of course said dr ferris softly but you might wish to see whether we know it that mrs j smith is miss dagny taggart he found nothing to observe in reardens face rearden had not moved to bend over the prints but sat looking down at them with grave attentiveness as if from the perspective of distance he were discovering something about them which he had not known we have a great deal of additional evidence said dr ferris and tossed down on the desk a photostat of the jewelers bill for the ruby pendant you wouldnt care to see the sworn statements of apartment house doormen and night clerksthey contain nothing that would be new to you except the number of witnesses who know where you spent your nights in new york for about the last two years you mustnt blame those people too much its an interesting characteristic of epochs such as ours that people begin to be afraid of saying the things they want to sayand afraid when questioned to remain silent about things theyd prefer never to utter that is to be expected but you would be astonished if you knew who gave us the original tip i know it said rearden his voice conveyed no reaction the trip to florida was not inexplicable to him any longer there is nothing in this blackjack of mine that can harm you personally said dr ferris we knew that no form of personal injury would ever make you give in therefore i am telling you frankly that this will not hurt you at all it will only hurt miss taggart rearden was looking straight at him now but dr ferris wondered why it seemed to him that the calm closed face was moving away into a greater and greater distance if this affair of yours is spread from one end of the country to the other said dr ferris by such experts in the art of smearing as bertram scudder it will do no actual damage to your reputation beyond a few glances of curiosity and a few raised eyebrows in a few of the stuffier drawing rooms you will get off quite easily affairs of this sort are expected of a man in fact it will enhance your reputation it will give you an aura of romantic glamour among the women and among the men it will give you a certain kind of prestige in the nature of envy for an unusual conquest but what it will do to miss taggartwith her spotless name her reputation for being above scandal her peculiar position of a woman in a strictly masculine businesswhat it will do to her what she will see in the eyes of everyone she meets what she will hear from every man she deals withi will leave that up to your own mind to imagine and to consider rearden felt nothing but a great stillness and a great clarity it was as if some voice were telling him sternly this is the timethe scene is lightednow look and standing naked in the great light he was looking quietly solemnly stripped of fear of pain of hope with nothing left to him but the desire to know dr ferris was astonished to hear him say slowly in the dispassionate tone of an abstract statement that did not seem to be addressed to his listener but all your calculations rest on the fact that miss taggart is a virtuous woman not the slut youre going to call her yes of course said dr ferris and that this means much more to me than a casual affair of course if she and i were the kind of scum youre going to make us appear your blackjack wouldnt work no it wouldnt if our relationship were the depravity youre going to proclaim it to be youd have no way to harm us no wed be outside your power actuallyyes it was not to dr ferris that rearden was speaking he was seeing a long line of men stretched through the centuries from plato onward whose heir and final product was an incompetent little professor with the appearance of a gigolo and the soul of a thug i offered you once a chance to join us said dr ferris you refused now you can see the consequences how a man of your intelligence thought that he could win by playing it straight i cant imagine but if i had joined you said rearden with the same detachment as if he were not speaking about himself what would i have found worth looting from orren boyle oh hell theres always enough suckers to expropriate in the world such as miss taggart as ken danagger as ellis wyatt as i such as any man who wants to be impractical you mean that it is not practical to live on earth is it he did not know whether dr ferris answered him he was not listening any longer he was seeing the pendulous face of orren boyle with the small slits of pigs eyes the doughy face of mr mowen with the eyes that scurried away from any speaker and any facthe was seeing them go through the jerky motions of an ape performing a routine it had learned to copy by muscular habit performing it in order to manufacture rearden metal with no knowledge and no capacity to know what had taken place in the experimental laboratory of rearden steel through ten years of passionate devotion to an excruciating effort it was proper that they should now call it miracle metala miracle was the only name they could give to those ten years and to that faculty from which rearden metal was borna miracle was all that the metal could be in their eyes the product of an unknown unknowable cause an object in nature not to be explained but to be seized like a stone or a weed theirs for the seizingare we to let the many remain in want while the few withhold from us the better products and methods available if i had not known that my life depends on my mind and my efforthe was saying soundlessly to the line of men stretched through the centuriesif i had not made it my highest moral purpose to exercise the best of my effort and the fullest capacity of my mind in order to support and expand my life you would have found nothing to loot from me nothing to support your own existence it is not my sins that youre using to injure me but my virtuesmy virtues by your own acknowledgment since your own life depends on them since you need them since you do not seek to destroy my achievement but to seize it he remembered the voice of the gigolo of science saying to him were after power and we mean it you fellows were pikers but we know the real trick we were not after powerhe said to the gigolos ancestorsinspiritand we did not live by means of that which we condemned we regarded productive ability as virtueand we let the degree of his virtue be the measure of a mans reward we drew no advantage from the things we regarded as evilwe did not require the existence of bank robbers in order to operate our banks or of burglars in order to provide for our homes or of murderers in order to protect our lives but you need the products of a mans abilityyet you proclaim that productive ability is a selfish evil and you turn the degree of a mans productiveness into the measure of his loss we lived by that which we held to be good and punished that which we held to be evil you live by that which you denounce as evil and punish that which you know to be good he remembered the formula of the punishment that lillian had sought to impose on him the formula he had considered too monstrous to believeand he saw it now in its full application as a system of thought as a way of life and on a world scale there it was the punishment that required the victims own virtue as the fuel to make it workhis invention of rearden metal being used as the cause of his expropriationdagnys honor and the depth of their feeling for each other being used as a tool of blackmail a blackmail from which the depraved would be immuneand in the peoples states of europe millions of men being held in bondage by means of their desire to live by means of their energy drained in forced labor by means of their ability to feed their masters by means of the hostage system of their love for their children or wives or friendsby means of love ability and pleasure as the fodder for threats and the bait for extortion with love tied to fear ability to punishment ambition to confiscation with blackmail as law with escape from pain not quest for pleasure as the only incentive to effort and the only reward of achievementmen held enslaved by means of whatever living power they possessed and of whatever joy they found in life such was the code that the world had accepted and such was the key to the code that it hooked mans love of existence to a circuit of torture so that only the man who had nothing to offer would have nothing to fear so that the virtues which made life possible and the values which gave it meaning became the agents of its destruction so that ones best became the tool of ones agony and mans life on earth became impractical yours was the code of life said the voice of a man whom he could not forget what then is theirs why had the world accepted ithe thought how had the victims come to sanction a code that pronounced them guilty of the fact of existing and then the violence of an inner blow became the total stillness of his body as he sat looking at a sudden vision hadnt he done it also hadnt he given his sanction to the code of self damnation dagnyhe thoughtand the depth of their feeling for each other the blackmail from which the depraved would be immune hadnt he too once called it depravity hadnt he been first to throw at her all the insults which the human scum was now threatening to throw at her in public hadnt he accepted as guilt the highest happiness he had ever found you who wont allow one per cent of impurity into an alloy of metal the unforgotten voice was saying to him what have you allowed into your moral code well mr rearden said the voice of dr ferris do you understand me now do we get the metal or do we make a public showplace out of miss taggarts bedroom he was not seeing dr ferris he was seeingin the violent clarity that was like a spotlight tearing every riddle open to himthe day he met dagny for the first time it was a few months after she had become vicepresident of taggart transcontinental he had been hearing skeptically for some time the rumors that the railroad was run by jim taggarts sister that summer when he grew exasperated at taggarts delays and contradictions over an order of rail for a new cutoff an order which taggart kept placing altering and withdrawing somebody told him that if he wished to get any sense or action out of taggart transcontinental hed better speak to jims sister he telephoned her office to make an appointment and insisted on having it that same afternoon her secretary told him that miss taggart would be at the construction site of the new cutoff that afternoon at milford station between new york and philadelphia but would be glad to see him there if he wished he went to the appointment resentfully he did not like such businesswomen as he had met and he felt that railroads were no business for a woman to play with he expected a spoiled heiress who used her name and sex as substitute for ability some eyebrowplucked over groomed female like the lady executives of department stores he got off the last car of a long train far beyond the platform of milford station there was a clutter of sidings freight cars cranes and steam shovels around him descending from the main track down the slope of a ravine where men were grading the roadbed of the new cutoff he started walking between the sidings toward the station building then he stopped he saw a girl standing on top of a pile of machinery on a flatcar she was looking off at the ravine her head lifted strands of disordered hair stirring in the wind her plain gray suit was like a thin coating of metal over a slender body against the spread of sunflooded space and sky her posture had the lightness and unselfconscious precision of an arrogantly pure selfconfidence she was watching the work her glance intent and purposeful the glance of competence enjoying its own function she looked as if this were her place her moment and her world she looked as if enjoyment were her natural state her face was the living form of an active living intelligence a young girls face with a womans mouth she seemed unaware of her body except as of a taut instrument ready to serve her purpose in any manner she wished had he asked himself a moment earlier whether he carried in his mind an image of what he wanted a woman to look like he would have answered that he did not yet seeing her he knew that this was the image and that it had been for years but he was not looking at her as at a woman he had forgotten where he was and on what errand he was held by a childs sensation of joy in the immediate moment by the delight of the unexpected and undiscovered he was held by the astonishment of realizing how seldom he came upon a sight he truly liked liked in complete acceptance and for its own sake he was looking up at her with a faint smile as he would have looked at a statue or a landscape and what he felt was the sheer pleasure of the sight the purest esthetic pleasure he had ever experienced he saw a switchman going by and he asked pointing who is that dagny taggart said the man walking on rearden felt as if the words struck him inside his throat he felt the start of a current that cut his breath for a moment then went slowly down his body carrying in its wake a sense of weight a drained heaviness that left him no capacity but one he was awarewith an abnormal clarityof the place the womans name and everything it implied but all of it had receded into some outer ring and had become a pressure that left him alone in the center as the rings meaning and essenceand his only reality was the desire to have this woman now here on top of the flatcar in the open sunto have her before a word was spoken between them as the first act of their meeting because it would say everything and because they had earned it long ago she turned her head in the slow curve of the movement her eyes came to his and stopped he felt certain that she saw the nature of his glance that she was held by it yet did not name it to herself her eyes moved on and he saw her speak to some man who stood beside the flatcar taking notes two things struck him together his return to his normal reality and the shattering impact of guilt he felt a moments approach to that which no man may feel fully and survive a sense of selfhatredthe more terrible because some part of him refused to accept it and made him feel guiltier it was not a progression of words but the instantaneous verdict of an emotion a verdict that told him this then was his nature this was his depravitythat the shameful desire he had never been able to conquer came to him in response to the only sight of beauty he had found that it came with a violence he had not known to be possible and that the only freedom now left to him was to hide it and to despise himself but never to be rid of it so long as he and this woman were alive he did not know how long he stood there or what devastation that span of time left within him all that he could preserve was the will to decide that she must never know it he waited until she had descended to the ground and the man with the notes had departed then he approached her and said coldly miss taggart i am henry rearden oh it was just a small break then he heard the quietly natural how do you do mr rearden he knew not admitting it to himself that the break came from some faint equivalent of his own feeling she was glad that a face she had liked belonged to a man she could admire when he proceeded to speak to her about business his manner was more harshly abrupt than it had ever been with any of his masculine customers now looking from the memory of the girl on the flatcar to the gift certificate lying on his desk he felt as if the two met in a single shock fusing all the days and doubts he had lived between them and by the glare of the explosion in a moments vision of a final sum he saw the answer to all his questions he thought guiltyguiltier than i had known far guiltier than i had thought that dayguilty of the evil of damning as guilt that which was my best i damned the fact that my mind and body were a unit and that my body responded to the values of my mind i damned the fact that joy is the core of existence the motive power of every living being that it is the need of ones body as it is the goal of ones spirit that my body was not a weight of inanimate muscles but an instrument able to give me an experience of superlative joy to unite my flesh and my spirit that capacity which i damned as shameful had left me indifferent to sluts but gave me my one desire in answer to a womans greatness that desire which i damned as obscene did not come from the sight of her body but from the knowledge that the lovely form i saw did express the spirit i was seeingit was not her body that i wanted but her personit was not the girl in gray that i had to possess but the woman who ran a railroad but i damned my bodys capacity to express what i felt i damned as an affront to her the highest tribute i could give herjust as they damn my ability to translate the work of my mind into rearden metal just as they damn me for the power to transform matter to serve my needs i accepted their code and believed as they taught me that the values of ones spirit must remain as an impotent longing unexpressed in action untranslated into reality while the life of ones body must be lived in misery as a senseless degrading performance and those who attempt to enjoy it must be branded as inferior animals i broke their code but i fell into the trap they intended the trap of a code devised to be broken i took no pride in my rebellion i took it as guilt i did not damn them i damned myself i did not damn their code i damned existenceand i hid my happiness as a shameful secret i should have lived it openly as of our rightor made her my wife as in truth she was but i branded my happiness as evil and made her bear it as a disgrace what they want to do to her now i did it first i made it possible i did itin the name of pity for the most contemptible woman i know that too was their code and i accepted it i believed that one person owes a duty to another with no payment for it in return i believed that it was my duty to love a woman who gave me nothing who betrayed everything i lived for who demanded her happiness at the price of mine i believed that love is some static gift which once granted need no longer be deservedjust as they believe that wealth is a static possession which can be seized and held without further effort i believed that love is a gratuity not a reward to be earnedjust as they believe it is their right to demand an unearned wealth and just as they believe that their need is a claim on my energy so i believed that her unhappiness was a claim on my life for the sake of pity not justice t endured ten years of selftorture i placed pity above my own conscience and this is the core of my guilt my crime was committed when i said to her by every standard of mine to maintain our marriage will be a vicious fraud but my standards are not yours i do not understand yours i never have but i will accept them here they are lying on my desk those standards i accepted without understanding here is the manner of her love for me that love which i never believed but tried to spare here is the final product of the unearned i thought that it was proper to commit injustice so long as i would be the only one to suffer but nothing can justify injustice and this is the punishment for accepting as proper that hideous evil which is selfimmolation i thought that i would be the only victim instead ive sacrificed the noblest woman to the vilest when one acts on pity against justice it is the good whom one punishes for the sake of the evil when one saves the guilty from suffering it is the innocent whom one forces to suffer there is no escape from justice nothing can be unearned and unpaid for in the universe neither in matter nor in spiritand if the guilty do not pay then the innocent have to pay it it was not the cheap little looters of wealth who have beaten meit was i they did not disarm mei threw away my weapon this is a battle that cannot be fought except with clean handsbecause the enemys sole power is in the sores of ones conscienceand i accepted a code that made me regard the strength of my hands as a sin and a stain do we get the metal mr rearden he looked from the gift certificate on his desk to the memory of the girl on the flatcar he asked himself whether he could deliver the radiant being he had seen in that moment to the looters of the mind and the thugs of the press could he continue to let the innocent bear punishment could he let her take the stand he should have taken could he now defy the enemys code when the disgrace would be hers not hiswhen the muck would be thrown at her not at himwhen she would have to fight while hed be spared could he let her existence be turned into a hell he would have no way of sharing he sat still looking up at her i love you he said to the girl on the flatcar silently pronouncing the words that had been the meaning of that moment four years ago feeling the solemn happiness that belonged with the words even though this was how he had to say it to her for the first time he looked down at the gift certificate dagny he thought you would not let me do it if you knew you will hate me for it if you learnbut i cannot let you pay my debts the fault was mine and i will not shift to you the punishment which is mine to take even if i have nothing else now left to me i have this much that i see the truth that i am free of their guilt that i can now stand guiltless in my own eyes that i know i am right right fully and for the first timeand that i will remain faithful to the one commandment of my code which i have never broken to be a man who pays his own way i love you he said to the girl on the flatcar feeling as if the light of that summers sun were touching his forehead as if he too were standing under an open sky over an unobstructed earth with nothing left to him except himself well mr rearden are you going to sign asked dr ferris reardens eyes moved to him he had forgotten that ferris was there he did not know whether ferris had been speaking arguing or waiting in silence oh that said rearden he picked up a pen and with no second glance with the easy gesture of a millionaire signing a check he signed his name at the foot of the statue of liberty and pushed the gift certificate across the desk chapter vii the moratorium on brains where have you been all this time eddie willers asked the worker in the underground cafeteria and added with a smile that was an appeal an apology and a confession of despair oh i know its i whove stayed away from here for weeks the smile looked like the effort of a crippled child groping for a gesture that he could not perform any longer i did come here once about two weeks ago but you werent here that night i was afraid youd gone so many people are vanishing without notice i hear theres hundreds of them roving around the country the police have been arresting them for leaving their jobstheyre called desertersbut theres too many of them and no food to feed them in jail so nobody gives a damn any more one way or another i hear the deserters are just wandering about doing odd jobs or worsewhos got any odd jobs to offer these days its our best men that were losing the kind whove been with the company for twenty years or more why did they have to chain them to their jobs those men never intended to quitbut now theyre quitting at the slightest disagreement just dropping their tools and walking off any hour of the day or night leaving us in all sorts of jamsthe men who used to leap out of bed and come running if the railroad needed them you should see the kind of human driftwood were getting to fill the vacancies some of them mean well but theyre scared of their own shadows others are the kind of scum i didnt think existedthey get the jobs and they know that we cant throw them out once theyre in so they make it clear that they dont intend to work for their pay and never did intend theyre the kind of men who like itwho like the way things are now can you imagine that there are human beings who like it well there are you know i dont think that i really believe itall thats happening to us these days its happening all right but i dont believe it i keep thinking that insanity is a state where a person cant tell whats real well whats real now is insaneand if i accepted it as real id have to lose my mind wouldnt i i go on working and i keep telling myself that this is taggart transcontinental i keep waiting for her to come backfor die door to open at any moment andoh god im not supposed to say that what you knew it you knew that shes gone theyre keeping it secret but i guess everybody knows it only nobody is supposed to say it theyre telling people that shes away on a leave of absence shes still listed as our vicepresident in charge of operation i think jim and i are the only ones who know that she has resigned for good jim is scared to death that his friends in washington will take it out on him if it becomes known that shes quit its supposed to be disastrous for public morale if any prominent person quits and jim doesnt want them to know that hes got a deserter right in his own family but thats not all jim is scared that the stockholders the employees and whoever we do business with will lose the last of their confidence in taggart transcontinental if they learn that shes gone confidence youd think that it wouldnt matter now since theres nothing any of them can do about it and yet jim knows that we have to preserve some semblance of the greatness that taggart transcontinental once stood for and he knows that the last of it went with her no they dont know where she is yes i do but i wont tell them im the only one who knows oh yes theyve been trying to find out theyve tried to pump me in every way they could think of but its no use i wont tell anyone you should see the trained seal that we now have in her placeour new operating vicepresident oh sure we have onethat is we have and we havent its like everything they do todayit is and it aint at the same tune his name is clifton loceyhes from jims personal staffa bright progressive young man of fortyseven and a friend of jims hes only supposed to be pinchhitting for her but he sits in her office and we all know that thats the new operating vicepresident he gives the ordersthat is he sees to it that hes never caught actually giving an order he works very hard at making sure that no decision can ever be pinned down on him so that he wont be blamed for anything you see his purpose is not to operate a railroad but to hold a job he doesnt want to run trainshe wants to please jim he doesnt give a damn whether theres a single train moving or not so long as he can make a good impression on jim and on the boys in washington so far mr clifton locey has managed to frame up two men a young third assistant for not relaying an order which mr locey had never givenand the freight manager for issuing an order which mr locey did give only the freight manager couldnt prove it both men were fired officially by ruling of the unification board when things go wellwhich is never longer than half an hourmr locey makes it a point to remind us that these are not the days of miss taggart at the first sign of trouble he calls me into his office and asks mecasually in the midst of the most irrelevant drivelwhat miss taggart used to do in such an emergency i tell him whenever i can i tell myself that its taggart transcontinental and and theres thousands of lives on dozens of trains that hang on our decisions between emergencies mr locey goes out of his way to be rude to methats so i wouldnt think that he needs me hes made it a point to change everything she used to do in every respect that doesnt matter but hes damn cautious not to change anything that matters the only trouble is that he cant always tell which is which on his first day in her office he told me that it wasnt a good idea to have a picture of nat taggart on the wallnat taggart he said belongs to a dark past to the age of selfish greed he is not exactly a symbol of our modern progressive policies so it could make a bad impression people could identify me with him no they couldnt i saidbut i took the picture off his wall what no she doesnt know any of it i havent communicated with her not once she told me not to last week i almost quit it was over chicks special mr chick morrison of washington whoever the hell he is has gone on a speaking tour of the whole countryto speak about the directive and build up the peoples morale as things are getting to be pretty wild everywhere he demanded a special train for himself and partya sleeper a parlor car and a diner with barroom and lounge the unification board gave him permission to travel at a hundred miles an hourby reason the ruling said of this being a nonprofit journey well so it is its just a journey to talk people into continuing to break their backs at making profits in order to support men who are superior by reason of not making any well our trouble came when mr chick morrison demanded a diesel engine for his train we had none to give him every diesel we own is out on the road pulling the comet and the transcontinental freights and there wasnt a spare one anywhere on the system exceptwell that was an exception i wasnt going to mention to mr clifton locey mr locey raised the roof screaming that come hell or high water we couldnt refuse a demand of mr chick morrison i dont know what damn fool finally told him about the extra diesel that was kept at winston colorado at the mouth of the tunnel you know the way our diesels break down nowadays theyre all breathing their lastso you can understand why that extra diesel had to be kept at the tunnel i explained it to mr locey i threatened him i pleaded i told him that she had made it our strictest rule that winston station was never to be left without an extra diesel he told me to remember that he was not miss taggartas if i could ever forget itand that the rule was nonsense because nothing had happened all these years so winston could do without a diesel for a couple of months and he wasnt going to worry about some theoretical disaster in the future when we were up against the very real practical immediate disaster of getting mr chick morrison angry at us well chicks special got the diesel the superintendent of the colorado division quit mr locey gave that job to a friend of his own i wanted to quit i had never wanted to so badly but i didnt no i havent heard from her i havent heard a word since she left why do you keep questioning me about her forget it she wont be back i dont know what it is that im hoping for nothing i guess i just go day by day and i try not to look ahead at first i hoped that somebody would save us i thought maybe it would be hank rearden but he gave in i dont know what they did to him to make him sign but i know that it must have been something terrible everybody thinks so everybodys whispering about it wondering what sort of pressure was used on him no nobody knows hes made no public statements and hes refused to see anyone but listen ill tell you something else that everybodys whispering about lean closer will youi dont want to speak too loudly they say that orren boyle seems to have known about that directive long ago weeks or months in advance because he had started quietly and secretly to reconstruct his furnaces for the production of rearden metal in one of his lesser steel plants an obscure little place way out on the coast of maine he was ready to start pouring the metal the moment reardens extortion paperi mean gift certificatewas signed butlistenthe night before they were to start boyles men were heating the furnaces in that place on the coast when they heard a voice they didnt know whether it came from a plane or a radio or some sort of loudspeaker but it was a mans voice and it said that he would give them ten minutes to get out of the place they got out they started going and they kept on goingbecause the mans voice had said that he was ragnar danneskjold in the next halfhour boyles mills were razed to the ground razed wiped out not a brick of them left standing they say it was done by longrange naval guns from somewhere way out on the atlantic nobody saw danneskjolds ship thats what people are whispering the newspapers havent printed a word about it the boys in washington say that its only a rumor spread by panicmongers i dont know whether the story is true i think it is i hope it is you know when i was fifteen years old i used to wonder how any man could become a criminal i couldnt understand what would make it possible nownow im glad that ragnar danneskjold has blown up those mills may god bless him and never let them find him whatever and wherever he is yes thats what ive come to feel well how much do they think people can take its not so bad for me in the daytime because i can keep busy and not think but it gets me at night i cant sleep any more i lie awake for hours yesif you want to know ityes its because im worried about her im scared to death for her woodstock is just a miserable little hole of a place miles away from everything and the taggart lodge is twenty miles farther twenty miles of a twisting trail in a godforsaken forest how do i know what might happen to her there alone and with the kind of gangs that are roving all through the country these nightsjust through such desolate parts of the country as the berkshires i know i shouldnt think about it i know that she can take care of herself only i wish shed drop me a line i wish i could go there but she told me not to i told her id wait you know im glad youre here tonight it helps metalking to you and just seeing you here you wont vanish like all the others will you what next week oh on your vacation for how long how do you rate a whole months vacation i wish i could do that tootake a month off at my own expense but they wouldnt let me really i envy you i wouldnt have envied you a few years ago but nownow id like to get away now i envy youif youve been able to take a month off every summer for twelve years it was a dark road but it led in a new direction rearden walked from his mills not toward his house but toward the city of philadelphia it was a great distance to walk but he had wanted to do it tonight as he had done it every evening of the past week he felt at peace in the empty darkness of the countryside with nothing but the black shapes of trees around him with no motion but that of his own body and of branches stirring in the wind with no lights but the slow sparks of the fireflies flickering through the hedges the two hours between mills and city were his span of rest he had moved out of his home to an apartment in philadelphia he had given no explanation to his mother and philip he had said nothing except that they could remain in the house if they wished and that miss ives would take care of their bills he had asked them to tell lillian when she returned that she was not to attempt to see him they had stared at him in terrified silence he had handed to his attorney a signed blank check and said get me a divorce on any grounds and at any cost i dont care what means you use how many of their judges you purchase or whether you find it necessary to stage a frameup of my wife do whatever you wish but there is to be no alimony and no property settlement the attorney had looked at him with the hint of a wise sad smile as if this were an event he had expected to happen long ago he had answered okay hank it can be done but it will take some time make it as fast as you can no one had questioned him about his signature on the gift certificate but he had noticed that the men at the mills looked at him with a kind of searching curiosity almost as if they expected to find the scars of some physical torture on his body he felt nothingnothing but the sense of an even restful twilight like a spread of slag over a molten metal when it crusts and swallows the last brilliant spurt of the white glow within he felt nothing at the thought of the looters who were now going to manufacture rearden metal his desire to hold his right to it and proudly to be the only one to sell it had been his form of respect for his fellow men his belief that to trade with them was an act of honor the belief the respect and the desire were gone he did not care what men made what they sold where they bought his metal or whether any of them would know that it had been his the human shapes moving past him in the streets of the city were physical objects without any meaning the countryside with the darkness washing away all traces of human activity leaving only an untouched earth which he had once been able to handlewas real he carried a gun in his pocket as advised by the policemen of the radio car that patrolled the roads they had warned him that no road was safe after dark these days he felt with a touch of mirthless amusement that the gun had been needed at the mills not in the peaceful safety of loneliness and night what could some starving vagrant take from him compared to what had been taken by men who claimed to be his protectors he walked with an effortless speed feeling relaxed by a form of activity that was natural to him this was his period of training for solitude he thought he had to learn to live without any awareness of people the awareness that now paralyzed him with revulsion he had once built his fortune starting out with empty hands now he had to rebuild his life starting out with an empty spirit he would give himself a short span of time for the training he thought and then he would claim the one incomparable value still left to him the one desire that had remained pure and whole he would go to dagny two commandments had grown in his mind one was a duty the other a passionate wish the first was never to let her learn the reason of his surrender to the looters the second was to say to her the words which he should have known at their first meeting and should have said on the gallery of ellis wyatts house there was nothing but the strong summer starlight to guide him as he walked but he could distinguish the highway and the remnant of a stone fence ahead at the corner of a country crossroad the fence had nothing to protect any longer only a spread of weeds a willow tree bending over the road and farther in the distance the ruin of a farmhouse with the starlight showing through its roof he walked thinking that even this sight still retained the power to be of value it gave him the promise of a long stretch of space undisturbed by human intrusion the man who stepped suddenly out into the road must have come from behind the willow tree but so swiftly that it seemed as if he had sprung up from the middle of the highway reardens hand went to the gun in his pocket but stopped he knewby the proud posture of the body standing in the open by the straight line of the shoulders against the starlit skythat the man was not a bandit when he heard the voice he knew that the man was not a beggar i should like to speak to you mr rearden the voice had the firmness the clarity and the special courtesy peculiar to men who are accustomed to giving orders go ahead said rearden provided you dont intend to ask me for help or money the mans garments were rough but efficiently trim he wore dark trousers and a dark blue windbreaker closed tight at his throat prolonging the lines of his long slender figure he wore a dark blue cap and all that could be seen of him in the night were his hands his face and a patch of goldblond hair on his temple the hands held no weapon only a package wrapped in burlap the size of a carton of cigarettes no mr rearden he said i dont intend to ask you for money but to return it to you to return money yes what money a small refund on a very large debt owed by you no not by me it is only a token payment but i want you to accept it as proof that if we live long enough you and i every dollar of that debt will be returned to you what debt the money that was taken from you by force he extended the package to rearden flipping the burlap open rearden saw the starlight run like fire along a mirrorsmooth surface he knew by its weight and texture that what he held was a bar of solid gold he looked from the bar to the mans face but the face seemed harder and less revealing than the surface of the metal who are you asked rearden the friend of the friendless did you come here to give this to me yes do you mean that you had to stalk me at night on a lonely road in order not to rob me but to hand me a bar of gold yes why when robbery is done in open daylight by sanction of the law as it is done today then any act of honor or restitution has to be hidden underground what made you think that id accept a gift of this kind it is not a gift mr rearden it is your own money but i have one favor to ask of you it is a request not a condition because there can be no such thing as conditional property the gold is yours so you are free to use it as you please but i risked my life to bring it to you tonight so i am asking as a favor that you save it for the future or spend it on yourself on nothing but your own comfort and pleasure do not give it away and above all do not put it into your business why because i dont want it to be of any benefit to anybody but you otherwise i will have broken an oath taken long agoas i am breaking every rule i had set for myself by speaking to you tonight what do you mean i have been collecting this money for you for a long time but i did not intend to see you or tell you about it or give it to you until much later then why did you because i couldnt stand it any longer stand what i thought that i had seen everything one could see and that there was nothing i could not stand seeing but when they took rearden metal away from you it was too much even for me i know that you dont need this gold at present what you need is the justice which it represents and the knowledge that there are men who care for justice struggling not to give in to an emotion which he felt rising through his bewilderment past all his doubts rearden tried to study the mans face searching for some clue to help him understand but the face had no expression it had not changed once while speaking it looked as if the man had lost the capacity to feel long ago and what remained of him were only features that seemed implacable and dead with a shudder of astonishment rearden found himself thinking that it was not the face of a man but of an avenging angel why did you care asked rearden what do i mean to you much more than you have reason to suspect and i have a friend to whom you mean much more than you will ever learn he would have given anything to stand by you today but he cant come to you so i came in his place what friend i prefer not to name him did you say that youve spent a long time collecting this money for me i have collected much more than this he pointed at the gold i am holding it in your name and i will turn it over to you when the time comes this is only a sample as proof that it does exist and if you reach the day when you find yourself robbed of the last of your fortune i want you to remember that you have a large bank account waiting for you what account if you try to think of all the money that has been taken from you by force you will know that your account represents a considerable sum how did you collect it where did this gold come from it was taken from those who robbed you taken by whom by me who are you ragnar danneskjold rearden looked at him for a long still moment then let the gold fall out of his hands danneskjolds eyes did not follow it to the ground but remained fixed on rearden with no change of expression would you rather i were a lawabiding citizen mr rearden if so which law should i abide by directive ragnar danneskjold said rearden as if he were seeing the whole of the past decade as if he were looking at the enormity of a crime spread through ten years and held within two words look more carefully mr rearden there are only two modes of living left to us today to be a looter who robs disarmed victims or to be a victim who works for the benefit of his own despoilers i did not choose to be either you chose to live by means of force like the rest of them yesopenly honestly if you will i do not rob men who are tied and gagged i do not demand that my victims help me i do not tell them that i am acting for their own good i stake my life in every encounter with men and they have a chance to match their guns and their brains against mine in fair battle fair its i against the organized strength the guns the planes the battleships of five continents if its a moral judgment that you wish to pronounce mr rearden then who is the man of higher morality i or wesley mouch i have no answer to give you said rearden his voice low why should you be shocked mr rearden i am merely complying with the system which my fellow men have established if they believe that force is the proper means to deal with one another i am giving them what they ask for if they believe that the purpose of my life is to serve them let them try to enforce their creed if they believe that my mind is their propertylet them come and get it but what sort of life have you chosen to what purpose are you giving your mind to the cause of my love which is what justice served by being a pirate by working for the day when i wont have to be a pirate any longer which day is that the day when youll be free to make a profit on rearden metal oh god said rearden laughing his voice desperate is that your ambition danneskjolds face did not change it is do you expect to live to see that day yes dont you no then what are you looking forward to mr rearden nothing what are you working for rearden glanced at him why do you ask that to make you understand why im not dont expect me ever to approve of a criminal i dont expect it but there are a few things i want to help you to see even if theyre true the things you said why did you choose to be a bandit why didnt you simply step out like he stopped like ellis wyatt mr rearden like andrew stockton like your friend ken danagger yes would you approve of that i he stopped shocked by his own words the shock that came next was to see danneskjold smile it was like seeing the first green of spring on the sculptured planes of an iceberg rearden realized suddenly for the first time that danneskjolds face was more than handsome that it had the startling beauty of physical perfectionthe hard proud features the scornful mouth of a vikings statueyet he had not been aware of it almost as if the dead sternness of the face had forbidden the impertinence of an appraisal but the smile was brilliantly alive i do approve of it mr rearden but ive chosen a special mission of my own im after a man whom i want to destroy he died many centuries ago but until the last trace of him is wiped out of mens minds we will not have a decent world to live in what man robin hood rearden looked at him blankly not understanding he was the man who robbed the rich and gave to the poor well im the man who robs the poor and gives to the richor to be exact the man who robs the thieving poor and gives back to the productive rich what in blazes do you mean if you remember the stories youve read about me in the newspapers before they stopped printing them you know that i have never robbed a private ship and never taken any private property nor have i ever robbed a military vesselbecause the purpose of a military fleet is to protect from violence the citizens who paid for it which is the proper function of a government but i have seized every loot carrier that came within range of my guns every government relief ship subsidy ship loan ship gift ship every vessel with a cargo of goods taken by force from some men for the unpaid unearned benefit of others i seized the boats that sailed under the flag of the idea which i am fighting the idea that need is a sacred idol requiring human sacrificesthat the need of some men is the knife of a guillotine hanging over othersthat all of us must live with our work our hopes our plans our efforts at the mercy of the moment when that knife will descend upon usand that the extent of our ability is the extent of our danger so that success will bring our heads down on the block while failure will give us the right to pull the cord this is the horror which robin hood immortalized as an ideal of righteousness it is said that he fought against the looting rulers and returned the loot to those who had been robbed but that is not the meaning of the legend which has survived he is remembered not as a champion of property but as a champion of need not as a defender of the robbed but as a provider of the poor he is held to be the first man who assumed a halo of virtue by practicing charity with wealth which he did not own by giving away goods which he had not produced by making others pay for the luxury of his pity he is the man who became the symbol of the idea that need not achievement is the source of rights that we dont have to produce only to want that the earned does not belong to us but the unearned does he became a justification for every mediocrity who unable to make his own living has demanded the power to dispose of the property of his betters by proclaiming his willingness to devote his life to his inferiors at the price of robbing his superiors it is this foulest of creaturesthe doubleparasite who lives on the sores of the poor and the blood of the richwhom men have come to regard as a moral ideal and this has brought us to a world where the more a man produces the closer he comes to the loss of all his rights until if his ability is great enough he becomes a rightless creature delivered as prey to any claimantwhile in order to be placed above rights above principles above morality placed where anything is permitted to him even plunder and murder all a man has to do is to be in need do you wonder why the world is collapsing around us that is what i am fighting mr rearden until men learn that of all human symbols robin hood is the most immoral and the most contemptible there will be no justice on earth and no way for mankind to survive rearden listened feeling numb but under the numbness like the first thrust of a seed breaking through he felt an emotion he could not identify except that it seemed familiar and very distant like something experienced and renounced long ago what i actually am mr rearden is a policeman it is a policemans duty to protect men from criminalscriminals being those who seize wealth by force it is a policemans duty to retrieve stolen property and return it to its owners but when robbery becomes the purpose of the law and the policemans duty becomes not the protection but the plunder of propertythen it is an outlaw who has to become a policeman i have been selling the cargoes i retrieved to some special customers of mine in this country who pay me in gold also i have been selling my cargoes to the smugglers and the blackmarket traders of the peoples states of europe do you know the conditions of existence in those peoples states since production and tradenot violencewere decreed to be crimes the best men of europe had no choice but to become criminals the slavedrivers of those states are kept in power by the handouts from their fellow looters in countries not yet fully drained such as this country i do not let the handouts reach them i sell the goods to europes lawbreakers at the highest prices i can get and i make them pay me in gold gold is the objective value the means of preserving ones wealth and ones future nobody is permitted to have gold in europe except the whipwielding friends of humanity who claim that they spend it for the welfare of their victims that is the gold which my smugglercustomers obtain to pay me how by the same method i use to obtain the goods and then i return the gold to those from whom the goods were stolento you mr rearden and to other men like you rearden grasped the nature of the emotion he had forgotten it was the emotion he had felt when at the age of fourteen he had looked at his first pay checkwhen at the age of twentyfour he had been made superintendent of the ore mineswhen as the owner of the mines he had placed in his own name his first order for new equipment from the best concern of the time twentieth century motorsan emotion of solemn joyous excitement the sense of winning his place in a world he respected and earning the recognition of men he admired for almost two decades that emotion had been buried under a mount of wreckage as the years had added layer upon gray layer of contempt of indignation of his struggle not to look around him not to see those he dealt with not to expect anything from men and to keep as a private vision within the four walls of his office the sense of that world into which he had hoped to rise yet there it was again breaking through from under the wreckage that feeling of quickened interest of listening to the luminous voice of reason with which one could communicate and deal and live but it was the voice of a pirate speaking about acts of violence offering him this substitute for his world of reason and justice he could not accept it he could not lose whatever remnant of his vision he still retained he listened wishing he could escape yet knowing that he would not miss a word of it i deposit the gold in a bankin a goldstandard bank mr rearden to the account of men who are its rightful owners they are the men of superlative ability who made their fortunes by personal effort in free trade using no compulsion no help from the government they are the great victims who have contributed the most and suffered the worst injustice in return their names are written in my book of restitution every load of gold which i bring back is divided among them and deposited to their accounts who are they youre one of them mr rearden i cannot compute all the money that has been extorted from youin hidden taxes in regulations in wasted time in lost effort in energy spent to overcome artificial obstacles i cannot compute the sum but if you wish to see its magnitude look around you the extent of the misery now spreading through this once prosperous country is the extent of the injustice which you have suffered if men refuse to pay the debt they owe you this is the manner in which they will pay for it but there is one part of the debt which is computed and on record that is the part which i have made it my purpose to collect and return to you what is that your income tax mr rearden what your income tax for the last twelve years you intend to refund that in full and in gold mr rearden rearden burst out laughing he laughed like a young boy in simple amusement in enjoyment of the incredible good god youre a policeman and a collector of internal revenue too yes said danneskjold gravely youre not serious about this are you do i look as if im joking but this is preposterous any more preposterous than directive its not real or possible is only evil real and possible but are you thinking that death and taxes are our only certainty mr rearden well theres nothing i can do about the first but if i lift the burden of the second men might learn to see the connection between the two and what a longer happier life they have the power to achieve they might learn to hold not death and taxes but life and production as their two absolutes and as the base of their moral code rearden looked at him not smiling the tall slim figure with the windbreaker stressing its trained muscular agility was that of a highwayman the stern marble face was that of a judge the dry clear voice was that of an efficient bookkeeper the looters are not the only ones who have kept records on you mr rearden so have i i have in my files copies of all your income tax returns for the last twelve years as well as the returns of all my other clients i have friends in some astonishing places who obtain the copies i need i divide the money among my clients in proportion to the sums extorted from them most of my accounts have now been paid to their owners yours is the largest one left to settle on the day when you will be ready to claim itthe day when ill know that no penny of it will go back to support the lootersi will turn your account over to you until then he glanced down at the gold on the ground pick it up mr rearden its not stolen its yours rearden would not move or answer or look down much more than that lies in the bank in your name what bank do you remember midas mulligan of chicago yes of course all my accounts are deposited at the mulligan bank there is no mulligan bank in chicago it is not in chicago rearden let a moment pass where is it i think that you will know it before long mr rearden but i cannot tell you now he added i must tell you however that i am the only one responsible for this undertaking it is my own personal mission no one is involved in it but me and the men of my ships crew even my banker has no part in it except for keeping the money i deposit many of my friends do not approve of the course ive chosen but we all choose different ways to fight the same battleand this is mine rearden smiled contemptuously arent you one of those damn altruists who spends his time on a nonprofit venture and risks his life merely to serve others no mr rearden i am investing my time in my own future when we are free and have to start rebuilding from out of the ruins i want to see the world reborn as fast as possible if there is then some working capital in the right handsin the hands of our best our most productive menit will save years for the rest of us and incidentally centuries for the history of the country did you ask what you meant to me everything i admire everything i want to be on the day when the earth will have a place for such state of being everything i want to deal witheven if this is the only way i can deal with you and be of use to you at present why whispered rearden because my only love the only value i care to live for is that which has never been loved by the world has never won recognition or friends or defenders human ability that is the love i am servingand if i should lose my life to what better purpose could i give it the man who had lost the capacity to feelthought rearden and knew that the austerity of the marble face was the form of a disciplined capacity to feel too deeply the even voice was continuing dispassionately i wanted you to know this i wanted you to know it now when it most seem to you that youre abandoned at the bottom of a pit among subhuman creatures who are all thats left of mankind i wanted you to know in your most hopeless hour that the day of deliverance is much closer than you think and there was one special reason why i had to speak to you and tell you my secret ahead of the proper time have you heard of what happened to orren boyles steel mills on the coast of maine yes said reardenand was shocked to hear that the word came as a gasp out of the sudden jolt of eagerness within him i didnt know whether it was true its true i did it mr boyle is not going to manufacture rearden metal on the coast of maine he is not going to manufacture it anywhere neither is any other looting louse who thinks that a directive can give him a right to your brain whoever attempts to produce that metal will find his furnaces blown up his machinery blasted his shipments wrecked his plant set on fireso many things will happen to any man who tries it that people will say theres a curse on it and there will soon be no worker in the country willing to enter the plant of any new producer of rearden metal if men like boyle think that force is all they need to rob their betterslet them see what happens when one of their betters chooses to resort to force i wanted you to know mr rearden that none of them will produce your metal nor make a penny on it because he felt an exultant desire to laughas he had laughed at the news of wyatts fire as he had laughed at the crash of danconia copperand knew that if he did the thing he feared would hold him would not release him this time and he would never see his mills againrearden drew back and for a moment kept his lips closed tight to utter no sound when the moment was over he said quietly his voice firm and dead take that gold of yours and get away from here i wont accept the help of a criminal danneskjolds face showed no reaction i cannot force you to accept the gold mr rearden but i will not take it back you may leave it lying where it is if you wish i dont want your help and i dont intend to protect you if i were within reach of a phone i would call the police i would and i will if you ever attempt to approach me again ill do itin selfprotection i understand exactly what you mean you knowbecause ive listened to you because youve seen me eager to hear itthat i havent damned you as i should i cant damn you or anyone else there are no standards left for men to live by so i dont care to judge anything they do today or in what manner they attempt to endure the unendurable if this is your manner i will let you go to hell in your own way but i want no part of it neither as your inspiration nor as your accomplice dont expect me ever to accept your bank account if it does exist spend it on some extra armor plate for yourselfbecause im going to report this to the police and give them every clue i can to set them on your trail danneskjold did not move or answer a freight train was rolling by somewhere in the distance and darkness they could not see it but they heard the pounding beat of wheels filling the silence and it seemed close as if a disembodied train reduced to a long string of sound were going past them in the night you wanted to help me in my most hopeless hour said rearden if i am brought to where my only defender is a pirate then i dont care to be defended any longer you speak some remnant of a human language so in the name of that ill tell you that i have no hope left but i have the knowledge that when the end comes i will have lived by my own standards even while i was the only one to whom they remained valid i will have lived in the world in which i started and j will go down with the last of it i dont think youll want to understand me but a beam of light hit them with the violence of a physical blow the clangor of the train had swallowed the noise of the motor and they had not heard the approach of the car that swept out of the side road from behind the farmhouse they were not in the cars path yet they heard the screech of brakes behind the two headlights pulling an invisible shape to a stop it was rearden who jumped back involuntarily and had time to marvel at his companion the swiftness of danneskjolds selfcontrol was that he did not move it was a police car and it stopped beside them the driver leaned out oh its you mr rearden he said touching his fingers to his cap good evening sir hello said rearden fighting to control the unnatural abruptness of his voice there were two patrolmen in the front seat of the car and their faces had a tight look of purpose not the look of their usual friendly intention to stop for a chat mr rearden did you walk from the mills by way of edgewood road past blacksmith cove yes why did you happen to see a man anywhere around these parts a stranger moving along in a hurry where hed be either on foot or in a battered wreck of a car thats got a milliondollar motor what man a tall man with blond hair who is he you wouldnt believe it if i told you mr rearden did you see him rearden was not aware of his own questions only of the astonishing fact that he was able to force sounds past some beating barrier inside his throat he was looking straight at the policeman but he felt as if the focus of his eyes had switched to his side vision and what he saw most clearly was danneskjolds face watching him with no expression with no lines no muscles worth of feeling he saw danneskjolds arms hanging idly by his sides the hands relaxed with no sign of intention to reach for a weapon leaving the tall straight body defenseless and openopen as to a firing squad he saw in the light that the face looked younger than he had thought and that the eyes were skyblue he felt that his one danger would be to glance directly at danneskjoldand he kept his eyes on the policeman on the brass buttons of a blue uniform but the object filling his consciousness more forcefully than a visual perception was danneskjolds body the naked body under the clothes the body that would be wiped out of existence he did not hear his own words because he kept hearing a single sentence in his mind without context except the feeling that it was the only thing that mattered to him in the world if i should lose my life to what better purpose could i give it did you see him mr rearden no said rearden i didnt the policeman shrugged regretfully and closed his hands about the steering wheel you didnt see any man that looked suspicious no nor any strange car passing you on the road no the policeman reached for the starter they got word that he was seen ashore in these parts tonight and theyve thrown a dragnet over five counties were not supposed to mention his name not to scare the folks but hes a man whose head is worth three million dollars in rewards from all over the world he had pressed the starter and the motor was churning the air with bright cracks of sound when the second policeman leaned forward he had been looking at the blond hair under danneskjolds cap who is that mr rearden he asked my new bodyguard said rearden oh a sensible precaution mr rearden in times like these good night sir the motor jerked forward the red taillights of the car went shrinking down the road danneskjold watched it go then glanced pointedly at reardens right hand rearden realized that he had stood facing the policemen with his hand clutching the gun in his pocket and that he had been prepared to use it he opened his fingers and drew his hand out hastily danneskjold smiled it was a smile of radiant amusement the silent laughter of a clear young spirit greeting a moment it was glad to have lived and although the two did not resemble each other the smile made rearden think of francisco danconia you havent told a lie said ragnar danneskjold your bodyguardthats what i am and what ill deserve to be in many more ways than you can know at present thanks mr rearden and so longwell meet again much sooner than i had hoped he was gone before rearden could answer he vanished beyond the stone fence as abruptly and soundlessly as he had come when rearden turned to look through the farm field there was no trace of him and no sign of movement anywhere in the darkness rearden stood on the edge of an empty road in a spread of loneliness vaster than it had seemed before then he saw lying at his feet an object wrapped in burlap with one corner exposed and glistening in the moonlight the color of the pirates hair he bent picked it up and walked on kip chalmers swore as the train lurched and spilled his cocktail over the table top he slumped forward his elbow in the puddle and said god damn these railroads whats the matter with their track youd think with all the money theyve got theyd disgorge a little so we wouldnt have to bump like farmers on a hay cart his three companions did not take the trouble to answer it was late and they remained in the lounge merely because an effort was needed to retire to their compartments the lights of the lounge looked like feeble portholes in a fog of cigarette smoke dank with the odor of alcohol it was a private car which chalmers had demanded and obtained for his journey it was attached to the end of the comet and it swung like the tail of a nervous animal as the comet coiled through the curves of the mountains im going to campaign for the nationalization of the railroads said kip chalmers glaring defiantly at a small gray man who looked at him without interest thats going to be my platform plank ive got to have a platform plank i dont like jim taggart he looks like a softboiled clam to hell with the railroads its time we took them over go to bed said the man if you expect to look like anything human at the big rally tomorrow do you think well make it youve got to make it i know ive got to but i dont think well get there on time this goddamn snail of a superspecial is hours late youve got to get there kip said the man ominously in that stubborn monotone of the unthinking which asserts an end without concern for the means god damn you dont you suppose i know it kip chalmers had curly blond hair and a shapeless mouth he came from a semiwealthy semidistinguished family but he sneered at wealth and distinction in a manner which implied that only a top rank aristocrat could permit himself such a degree of cynical indifference he had graduated from a college which specialized in breeding that kind of aristocracy the college had taught him that the purpose of ideas is to fool those who are stupid enough to think he had made his way in washington with the grace of a catburglar climbing from bureau to bureau as from ledge to ledge of a crumbling structure he was ranked as semipowerful but his manner made laymen mistake him for nothing less than wesley mouch for reasons of his own particular strategy kip chalmers had decided to enter popular politics and to run for election as legislator from california though he knew nothing about that state except the movie industry and the beach clubs his campaign manager had done the preliminary work and chalmers was now on his way to face his future constituents for the first time at an over publicized rally in san francisco tomorrow night the manager had wanted him to start a day earlier but charmers had stayed in washington to attend a cocktail party and had taken the last train possible he had shown no concern about the rally until this evening when he noticed that the comet was running six hours late his three companions did not mind his mood they liked his liquor tester tuck his campaign manager was a small aging man with a face that looked as if it had once been punched in and had never rebounded he was an attorney who some generations earlier would have represented shoplifters and people who stage accidents on the premises of rich corporations now he found that he could do better by representing men like kip chalmers laura bradford was chalmers current mistress he liked her because his predecessor had been wesley mouch she was a movie actress who had forced her way from competent featured player to incompetent star not by means of sleeping with studio executives but by taking the longdistance short cut of sleeping with bureaucrats she talked economics instead of glamor for press interviews in the belligerently righteous style of a thirdrate tabloid her economics consisted of the assertion that weve got to help the poor gilbert keithworthing was chalmers guest for no reason that either of them could discover he was a british novelist of world fame who had been popular thirty years ago since then nobody bothered to read what he wrote but everybody accepted him as a walking classic he had been considered profound for uttering such things as freedom do lets stop talking about freedom freedom is impossible man can never be free of hunger of cold of disease of physical accidents he can never be free of the tyranny of nature so why should he object to the tyranny of a political dictatorship when all of europe put into practice the ideas which he bad preached he came to live in america through the years his style of writing and his body had grown flabby at seventy he was an obese old man with retouched hair and a manner of scornful cynicism retouched by quotations from the yogis about the futility of all human endeavor kip chalmers had invited him because it seemed to look distinguished gilbert keith worthing had come along because he had no particular place to go god damn these railroad people said kip chalmers theyre doing it on purpose they want to ruin my campaign i cant miss that rally for christs sake lester do something ive tried said lester tuck at the trains last stop he had tried by longdistance telephone to find air transportation to complete their journey but there were no commercial flights scheduled for the next two days if they dont get me there on time ill have their scalps and their railroad cant we tell that damn conductor to hurry youve told him three times ill get him fired hes given me nothing but a lot of alibis about all their messy technical troubles i expect transportation not alibis they cant treat me like one of their daycoach passengers i expect them to get me where i want to go when i want it dont they know that im on this train they know it by now said laura bradford shut up kip you bore me chalmers refilled his glass the car was rocking and the glassware tinkled faintly on the shelves of the bar the patches of starlit sky in the windows kept swaying jerkily and it seemed as if the stars were tinkling against one another they could see nothing beyond the glass bay of the observation window at the end of the car except the small halos of red and green lanterns marking the rear of the train and a brief stretch of rail running away from them into the darkness a wall of rock was racing the train and the stars dipped occasionally into a sudden break that outlined high above them the peaks of the mountains of colorado mountains said gilbert keithworthing with satisfaction it is a spectacle of this kind that makes one feel the insignificance of man what is this presumptuous little bit of rail which crude materialists are so proud of buildingcompared to that eternal grandeur no more than the basting thread of a seamstress on the hem of the garment of nature if a single one of those granite giants chose to crumble it would annihilate this train why should it choose to crumble asked laura bradford without any particular interest i think this damn train is going slower said kip chalmers those bastards are slowing down in spite of what i told them well its the mountains you know said lester tuck mountains be damned lester what day is this with all those damn changes of time i cant tell which its may twentyseventh sighed lester tuck its may twentyeighth said gilbert keithworthing glancing at his watch it is now twelve minutes past midnight jesus cried chalmers then the rally is today yep said lester tuck we wont make it we the train gave a sharper lurch knocking the glass out of his hand the thin sound of its crash against the floor mixed with the screech of the wheelflanges tearing against the rail of a sharp curve i say asked gilbert keithworthing nervously are your railroads safe hell yes said kip chalmers weve got so many rules regulations and controls that those bastards wouldnt dare not to be safe lester how far are we now whats the next stop there wont be any stop till salt lake city i mean whats the next station lester tuck produced a soiled map which he had been consulting every few minutes since nightfall winston he said winston colorado kip chalmers reached for another glass tinky holloway said that wesley said that if you dont win this election youre through said laura bradford she sat sprawled in her chair looking past chalmers studying her own face in a mirror on the wall of the lounge she was bored and it amused her to needle his impotent anger oh he did did he uhhuh wesley doesnt want whatshisnamewhoevers running against youto get into the legislature if you dont win wesley will be sore as hell tinky said damn that bastard hed better watch his own neck oh i dont know wesley likes him very much she added tinky holloway wouldnt allow some miserable train to make him miss an important meeting they wouldnt dare to hold him up kip chalmers sat staring at his glass im going to have the government seize all the railroads he said his voice low really said gilbert keithworthing i dont see why you havent done it long ago this is the only country on earth backward enough to permit private ownership of railroads well were catching up with you said kip chalmers your country is so incredibly naive its such an anachronism all that talk about liberty and human rightsi havent heard it since the days of my greatgrandfather its nothing but a verbal luxury of the rich after all it doesnt make any difference to the poor whether their livelihood is at the mercy of an industrialist or of a bureaucrat s the day of the industrialists is over this is the day of the jolt felt as if the air within the car smashed them forward while the floor stopped under their feet kip chalmers was flung down to the carpet gilbert keithworthing was thrown across the table top the lights were blasted out glasses crashed off the shelves the steel of the walls screamed as if about to rip open while a long distant thud went like a convulsion through the wheels of the train when he raised his head chalmers saw that the car stood intact and still he heard the moans of his companions and the first shriek of laura bradfords hysterics he crawled along the floor to the doorway wrenched it open and tumbled down the steps far ahead on the side of a curve he saw moving flashlights and a red glow at a spot where the engine had no place to be he stumbled through the darkness bumping into halfclothed figures that waved the futile little flares of matches somewhere along the line he saw a man with a flashlight and seized his arm it was the conductor what happened gasped chalmers split rail the conductor answered impassively the engine went off the track off m on its side anybody killed no the engineers all right the fireman is hurt split rail what do you mean split rail the conductors face had an odd look it was grim accusing and closed rail wears out mr chalmers he answered with a strange kind of emphasis particularly on curves didnt you know that it was worn out we knew well why didnt you have it replaced it was going to be replaced but mr locey cancelled that who is mr locey the man who is not our operating vicepresident chalmers wondered why the conductor seemed to look at him as if something about the catastrophe were his fault well well arent you going to put the engine back on the track that engines never going to be put back on any track from the looks of it but but its got to move us it cant beyond the few moving flares and the dulled sounds of screams chalmers sensed suddenly not wanting to look at it the black immensity of the mountains the silence of hundreds of uninhabited miles and the precarious strip of a ledge hanging between a wall of rock and an abyss he gripped the conductors arm tighter but but what are we going to do the engineers gone to call winston call how theres a phone couple of miles down the track will they get us out of here they will but then his mind made a connection with the past and the future and his voice rose to a scream for the first time how long will we have to wait i dont know said the conductor he threw chalmers hand off his arm and walked away the night operator of winston station listened to the phone message dropped the receiver and raced up the stairs to shake the station agent out of bed the station agent was a husky surly drifter who had been assigned to the job ten days ago by order of the new division superintendent he stumbled dazedly to his feet but he was knocked awake when the operators words reached his brain what he gasped jesus the comet well dont stand there shaking call silver springs the night dispatcher of the division headquarters at silver springs listened to the message then telephoned dave mitchum the new superintendent of the colorado division the comet gasped mitchum his hand pressing the telephone receiver to his ear his feet hitting the floor and throwing him upright out of bed the engine done for the diesel yes sir oh god oh god almighty what are we going to do then remembering his position he added well send out the wrecking train i have call the operator at sherwood to hold all traffic i have what have you got on the sheet the army freight special westbound but its not due for about four hours its running late ill be right down wait listen get bill sandy and clarence down by the time i get there theres going to be hell to pay dave mitchum had always complained about injustice because he said he had always had bad luck he explained it by speaking darkly about the conspiracy of the big fellows who would never give him a chance though he did not explain just whom he meant by the big fellows seniority of service was his favorite topic of complaint and sole standard of value he had been in the railroad business longer than many men who had advanced beyond him this he said was proof of the social systems injusticethough he never explained just what he meant by the social system he had worked for many railroads but had not stayed long with any one of them his employers had had no specific misdeeds to charge against him but had simply eased him out because he said nobody told me to too often he did not know that he owed his present job to a deal between james taggart and wesley mouch when taggart traded to mouch the secret of his sisters private life in exchange for a raise in rates mouch made him throw in an extra favor by their customary rules of bargaining which consisted of squeezing all one could out of any given trade the extra was a job for dave mitchum who was the brotherinlaw of claude slagenhop who was the president of the friends of global progress who were regarded by mouch as a valuable influence on public opinion james taggart pushed the responsibility of finding a job for mitchum onto clifton locey locey pushed mitchum into the first job that came upsuperintendent of the colorado divisionwhen the man holding it quit without notice the man quit when the extra diesel engine of winston station was given to chick morrisons special what are we going to do cried dave mitchum rushing halfdressed and groggy with sleep into his office where the chief dispatcher the trainmaster and the road foreman of engines were waiting for him the three men did not answer they were middleaged men with years of railroad service behind them a month ago they would have volunteered their advice in any emergency but they were beginning to learn that things had changed and that it was dangerous to speak what in hell are we going to do one thing is certain said bill brent the chief dispatcher we cant send a train into the tunnel with a coalburning engine dave mitchums eyes grew sullen he knew that this was the one thought on all their minds he wished brent had not named it well where do we get a diesel he asked angrily we dont said the road foreman but we cant keep the comet waiting on a siding all night looks like well have to said the trainmaster whats the use of talking about it dave you know that there is no diesel anywhere on the division but christ almighty how do they expect us to move trains without engines miss taggart didnt said the road foreman mr locey does bill asked mitchum in the tone of pleading for a favor isnt there anything transcontinental thats due tonight with any sort of a diesel the first one to come said bill brent implacably will be number the fast freight from san francisco which is due at winston at seveneighteen am he added thats the diesel closest to us at this moment ive checked what about the army special better not think about it dave that one has superiority over everything on the line including the comet by order of the army theyre running late as it isjournal boxes caught fire twice theyre carrying munitions for the west coast arsenals better pray that nothing stops them on your division if you think well catch hell for holding the comet its nothing to what well catch if we try to stop that special they remained silent the windows were open to the summer night and they could hear the ringing of the telephone in the dispatchers office downstairs the signal lights winked over the deserted yards that had once been a busy division point mitchum looked toward the roundhouse where the black silhouettes of a few steam engines stood outlined in a dim light the tunnel he said and stopped is eight miles long said the trainmaster with a harsh emphasis i was only thinking snapped mitchum better not think of it said brent softly i havent said anything what was that talk you had with dick horton before he quit the road foreman asked too innocently as if the subject were irrelevant wasnt it something about the ventilation system of the tunnel being on the bum didnt he say that that tunnel was hardly safe nowadays even for diesel engines why do you bring that up snapped mitchum i havent said anything dick horton the division chief engineer had quit three days after mitchums arrival i thought id just mention it the road foreman answered innocently look dave said bill brent knowing that mitchum would stall for another hour rather than formulate a decision you know that theres only one thing to do hold the comet at winston till morning wait for number have her diesel take the comet through the tunnel then let the comet finish her run with the best coalburner we can give her on the other side but how late will that make her brent shrugged twelve hourseighteen hourswho knows eighteen hoursfor the comet christ thats never happened before none of whats been happening to us has ever happened before said brent with an astonishing sound of weariness in his brisk competent voice but theyll blame us for it in new york theyll put all the blame on us brent shrugged a month ago he would have considered such an injustice inconceivable today he knew better i guess said mitchum miserably i guess theres nothing else that we can do there isnt dave oh god why did this have to happen to us who is john galt it was halfpast two when the comet pulled by an old switch engine jerked to a stop on a siding of winston station kip chalmers glanced out with incredulous anger at the few shanties on a desolate mountainside and at the ancient hovel of a station now what what in hell are they stopping here for he cried and rang for the conductor with the return of motion and safety his terror had turned into rage he felt almost as if he had been cheated by having been made to experience an unnecessary fear his companions were still clinging to the tables of the lounge they felt too shaken to sleep how long the conductor said impassively in answer to his question till morning mr chalmers chalmers stared at him stupefied were going to stand here till morning yes mr chalmers here yes but i have a rally in san francisco in the evening the conductor did not answer why why do we have to stand why in hell what happened slowly patiently with contemptuous politeness the conductor gave him an exact account of the situation but years ago in grammar school in high school in college kip chalmers had been taught that man does not and need not live by reason damn your tunnel he screamed do you think im going to let you hold me up because of some miserable tunnel do you want to wreck vital national plans on account of a tunnel tell your engineer that i must be in san francisco by evening and that hes got to get me there how thats your job not mine there is no way to do it then find a way god damn you the conductor did not answer do you think ill let your miserable technological problems interfere with crucial social issues do you know who i am tell that engineer to start moving if he values his job the engineer has his orders orders be damned i give the orders these days tell him to start at once perhaps youd better speak to the station agent mr chalmers i have no authority to answer you as id like to said the conductor and walked out chalmers leaped to his feet say kip said lester tuck uneasily maybe its true maybe they cant do it they can if they have to snapped chalmers marching resolutely to the door years ago in college he had been taught that the only effective means to impel men to action was fear in the dilapidated office of winston station he confronted a sleepy man with slack worn features and a frightened young boy who sat at the operators desk they listened in silent stupor to a stream of profanity such as they had never heard from any section gang and its not my problem how you get the train through the tunnel thats for you to figure out chalmers concluded but if you dont get me an engine and dont start that train you can kiss goodbye to your jobs your work permits and this whole goddamn railroad the station agent had never heard of kip chalmers and did not know the nature of his position but he knew that this was the day when unknown men in undefined positions held unlimited powerthe power of life or death its not up to us mr chalmers he said pleadingly we dont issue the orders out here the order came from silver springs suppose you telephone mr mitchum and whos mr mitchum hes the division superintendent at silver springs suppose you send him a message to i should bother with a division superintendent ill send a message to jim taggartthats what im going to do before the station agent had time to recover chalmers whirled to the boy ordering youtake this down and send it at once it was a message which a month ago the station agent would not have accepted from any passenger the rules forbade it but he was not certain about any rules any longer mr james taggart new york city am held up on the comet at winston colorado by the incompetence of your men who refuse to give me an engine have meeting in san francisco in the evening of toplevel national importance if you dont move my train at once ill let you guess the consequences kip chalmers after the boy had transmitted the words onto the wires that stretched from pole to pole across a continent as guardians of the taggart trackafter kip chalmers had returned to ms car to wait for an answerthe station agent telephoned dave mitchum who was his friend and read to him the text of the message he heard mitchum groan in answer i thought id tell you dave i never heard of the guy before but maybe hes somebody important i dont know moaned mitchum kip chalmers you see his name in the newspapers all the time right in with all the toplevel boys i dont know what he is but if hes from washington we cant take any chances oh christ what are we going to do we cant take any chancesthought the taggart operator in new york and transmitted the message by telephone to james taggarts home it was close to six am in new york and james taggart was awakened out of the fitful sleep of a restless night he listened to the telephone his face sagging he felt the same fear as the station agent of winston and for the same reason he called the home of clifton locey all the rage which he could not pour upon kip chalmers was poured over the telephone wire upon clifton locey do something screamed taggart i dont care what you do its your job not mine but see to it that that train gets through what in hell is going on i never heard of the comet being held up is that how you run your department its a fine thing when important passengers have to start sending messages to me at least when my sister ran the place i wasnt awakened in the middle of the night over every spike that broke in iowacolorado i mean im so sorry jim said clifton locey smoothly in a tone that balanced apology reassurance and the right degree of patronizing confidence its just a misunderstanding its somebodys stupid mistake dont worry take care of it i was as a matter of fact in bed but ill attend to it at once clifton locey was not in bed he had just returned from a round of night clubs in the company of a young lady he asked her to wait and hurried to the offices of taggart transcontinental none of the night staff who saw him there could say why he chose to appear in person but neither could they say that it had been unnecessary he rushed in and out of several offices was seen by many people and gave an impression of great activity the only physical result of it was an order that went over the wires to dave mitchum superintendent of the colorado division give an engine to mr chalmers at once send the comet through safely and without unnecessary delay if you are unable to perform your duties i shall hold you responsible before the unification board clifton locey then calling his girl friend to join him clifton locey drove to a country roadhouseto make certain that no one would be able to find him in the next few hours the dispatcher at silver springs was baffled by the order that he handed to dave mitchum but dave mitchum understood he knew that no railroad order would ever speak in such terms as giving an engine to a passenger he knew that the thing was a show piece he guessed what sort of show was being staged and he felt a cold sweat at the realization of who was being framed as the goat of the show whats the matter dave asked the trainmaster mitchum did not answer he seized the telephone his hands shaking as he begged for a connection to the taggart operator in new york he looked like an animal in a trap he begged the new york operator to get him mr clifton loceys home the operator tried there was no answer he begged the operator to keep on trying and to try every number he could think of where mr locey might be found the operator promised and mitchum hung up but knew that it was useless to wait or to speak to anyone in mr loceys department whats the matter dave mitchum handed him the orderand saw by the look on the trainmasters face that the trap was as bad as he had suspected he called the region headquarters of taggart transcontinental at omaha nebraska and begged to speak to the general manager of the region there was a brief silence on the wire then the voice of the omaha operator told him that the general manager had resigned and vanished three days agoover a little trouble with mr locey the voice added he asked to speak to the assistant general manager in charge of his particular district but the assistant was out of town for the week end and could not be reached get me somebody else mitchum screamed anybody of any district for christs sake get me somebody wholl tell me what to do the man who came on the wire was the assistant general manager of the iowaminnesota district what he interrupted at mitchums first words at winston colorado why in hell are you calling me no dont tell me what happened i dont want to know it no i said no youre not going to frame me into having to explain afterwards why i did or didnt do anything about whatever it is its not my problem speak to some region executive dont pick on me what do i have to do with colorado oh hell i dont know get the chief engineer speak to him the chief engineer of the central region answered impatiently yes what what is itand mitchum rushed desperately to explain when the chief engineer heard that there was no diesel he snapped then hold the train of course when he heard about mr chalmers he said his voice suddenly subdued hm kip chalmers of washington well i dont know that would be a matter for mr locey to decide when mitchum said mr locey ordered me to arrange it but the chief engineer snapped in great relief then do exactly as mr locey says and hung up dave mitchum replaced the telephone receiver cautiously he did not scream any longer instead hetiptoed to a chair almost as if he were sneaking he sat looking at mr loceys order for a long time then he snatched a glance about the room the dispatcher was busy at his telephone the trainmaster and the road foreman were there but they pretended that they were not waiting he wished bill brent the chief dispatcher would go home bill brent stood in a corner watching him brent was a short thin man with broad shoulders he was forty but looked younger he had the pale face of an office worker and the hard lean features of a cowboy he was the best dispatcher on the system mitchum rose abruptly and walked upstairs to his office clutching loceys order in his hand dave mitchum was not good at understanding problems of engineering and transportation but he understood men like clifton locey he understood the kind of game the new york executives were playing and what they were now doing to him the order did not tell him to give mr chalmers a coalburning enginejust an engine if the time came to answer questions wouldnt mr locey gasp in shocked indignation that he had expected a division superintendent to know that only a diesel engine could be meant in that order the order stated that he was to send the comet through safelywasnt a division superintendent expected to know what was safeand without unnecessary delay what was an unnecessary delay if the possibility of a major disaster was involved wouldnt a delay of a week or a month be considered necessary the new york executives did not care thought mitchum they did not care whether mr chalmers reached his meeting on time or whether an unprecedented catastrophe struck their rails they cared only about making sure that they would not be blamed for either if he held the train they would make him the scapegoat to appease the anger of mr chalmers if he sent the train through and it did not reach the western portal of the tunnel they would put the blame on his incompetence they would claim that he had acted against their orders in either case what would he be able to prove to whom one could prove nothing to a tribunal that had no stated policy no defined procedure no rules of evidence no binding principlesa tribunal such as the unification board that pronounced men guilty or innocent as it saw fit with no standard of guilt or innocence dave mitchum knew nothing about the philosophy of law but he knew that when a court is not bound by any rules it is not bound by any facts and then a hearing is not an issue of justice but an issue of men and your fate depends not on what you have or have not done but on whom you do or do not know he asked himself what chance he would have at such a hearing against mr james taggart mr clifton locey mr kip chalmers and their powerful friends dave mitchum had spent his life slipping around the necessity of ever making a decision he had done it by waiting to be told and never being certain of anything all that he now allowed into his brain was a long indignant whine against injustice fate he thought had singled him out for an unfair amount of bad luck he was being framed by his superiors on the only good job he had ever held he had never been taught to understand that the manner in which he obtained this job and the frameup were inextricable parts of a single whole as he looked at loceys order he thought that he could hold the comet attach mr chalmers car to an engine and send it into the tunnel alone but he shook his head before the thought was fully formed he knew that this would force mr chalmers to recognize the nature of the risk mr chalmers would refuse he would continue to demand a safe and nonexistent engine and more this would mean that he mitchum would have to assume responsibility admit full knowledge of the danger stand in the open and identify the exact nature of the situationthe one act which the policy of his superiors was based on evading the one key to their game dave mitchum was not the man to rebel against his background or to question the moral code of those in charge the choice he made was not to challenge but to follow the policy of his superiors bill brent could have beaten him in any contest of technology but here was an endeavor at which he could beat bill brent without effort there had once been a society where men needed the particular talents of bill brent if they wished to survive what they needed now was the talent of dave mitchum dave mitchum sat down at his secretarys typewriter and by means of two fingers carefully typed out an order to the trainmaster and another to the road foreman the first instructed the trainmaster to summon a locomotive crew at once for a purpose described only as an emergency the second instructed the road foreman to send the best engine available to winston to stand by for emergency assistance he put carbon copies of the orders into his own pocket then opened the door yelled for the night dispatcher to come up and handed him the two orders for the two men downstairs the night dispatcher was a conscientious young boy who trusted his superiors and knew that discipline was the first rule of the railroad business he was astonished that mitchum should wish to send written orders down one flight of stairs but he asked no questions mitchum waited nervously after a while he saw the figure of the road foreman walking across the yards toward the roundhouse he felt relieved the two men had not come up to confront him in person they had understood and they would play the game as he was playing it the road foreman walked across the yards looking down at the ground he was thinking of his wife his two children and the house which he had spent a lifetime to own he knew what his superiors were doing and he wondered whether he should refuse to obey them he had never been afraid of losing his job with the confidence of a competent man he had known that if he quarreled with one employer he would always be able to find another now he was afraid he had no right to quit or to seek a job if he defied an employer he would be delivered into the unanswerable power of a single board and if the board ruled against him it would mean being sentenced to the slow death of starvation it would mean being barred from any employment he knew that the board would rule against him he knew that the key to the dark capricious mystery of the boards contradictory decisions was the secret power of pull what chance would he have against mr chalmers there had been a time when the selfinterest of his employers had demanded that he exercise his utmost ability now ability was not wanted any longer there had been a time when he had been required to do his best and rewarded accordingly now he could expect nothing but punishment if he tried to follow his conscience there had been a time when he had been expected to think now they did not want him to think only to obey they did not want him to have a conscience any longer then why should he raise his voice for whose sake he thought of the passengersthe three hundred passengers aboard the comet he thought of his children he had a son in high school and a daughter nineteen of whom he was fiercely painfully proud because she was recognized as the most beautiful girl in town he asked himself whether he could deliver his children to the fate of the children of the unemployed as he had seen them in the blighted areas in the settlements around closed factories and along the tracks of discontinued railroads he saw in astonished horror that the choice which he now had to make was between the lives of his children and the lives of the passengers on the comet a conflict of this kind had never been possible before it was by protecting the safety of the passengers that he had earned the security of his children he had served one by serving the other there had been no clash of interests no call for victims now if he wanted to save the passengers he had to do it at the price of his children he remembered dimly the sermons he had heard about the beauty of selfimmolation about the virtue of sacrificing to others that which was ones dearest he knew nothing about the philosophy of ethics but he knew suddenlynot in words but in the form of a dark angry savage painthat if this was virtue then he wanted no part of it he walked into the roundhouse and ordered a large ancient coal burning locomotive to be made ready for the run to winston the trainmaster reached for the telephone in the dispatchers office to summon an engine crew as ordered but his hand stopped holding the receiver it struck him suddenly that he was summoning men to their death and that of the twenty lives listed on the sheet before him two would be ended by his choice he felt a physical sensation of cold nothing more he felt no concern only a puzzled indifferent astonishment it had never been his job to call men out to die his job had been to call them out to earn their living it was strange he thought and it was strange that his hand had stopped what made it stop was like something he would have felt twenty years agono he thought strange only one month ago not longer he was fortyeight years old he had no family no friends no ties to any living being in the world whatever capacity for devotion he had possessed the capacity which others scatter among many random concerns he had given it whole to the person of his young brother the brother his junior by twentyfive years whom he had brought up he had sent him through a technological college and he had known as had all the teachers that the boy had the mark of genius on the forehead of his grim young face with the same singletracked devotion as his brothers the boy had cared for nothing but his studies not for sports or parties or girls only for the vision of the things he was going to create as an inventor he had graduated from college and had gone on a salary unusual for his age into the research laboratory of a great electrical concern in massachusetts this was now may thought the trainmaster it was on may that directive had been issued it was on the evening of may i that he had been informed that his brother had committed suicide the trainmaster had heard it said that the directive was necessary to save the country he could not know whether this was true or not he had no way of knowing what was necessary to save a country but driven by some feeling which he could not express he had walked into the office of the editor of the local newspaper and demanded that they publish the story of his brothers death people have to know it had been all he could give as his reason he had been unable to explain that the bruised connections of his mind had formed the wordless conclusion that if this was done by the will of the people then the people had to know it he could not believe that they would do it if they knew the editor had refused he had stated that it would be bad for the countrys morale the trainmaster knew nothing about political philosophy but he knew that that had been the moment when he lost all concern for the life or death of any human being or of the country he thought holding the telephone receiver that maybe he should warn the men whom he was about to call they trusted him it would never occur to them that he could knowingly send them to their death but he shook his head this was only an old thought last years thought a remnant of the time when he had trusted them too it did not matter now his brain worked slowly as if he were dragging his thoughts through a vacuum where no emotion responded to spur them on he thought that there would be trouble if he warned anyone there would be some sort of fight and it was he who had to make some great effort to start it he had forgotten what it was that one started this sort of fight for truth justice brotherlove he did not want to make an effort he was very tired if he warned all the men on his list he thought there would be no one to run that engine so he would save two lives and also three hundred lives aboard the comet but nothing responded to the figures in his mind lives was just a word it had no meaning he raised the telephone receiver to his ear he called two numbers he summoned an engineer and a fireman to report for duty at once engine number had left for winston when dave mitchum came downstairs get a track motor car ready for me he ordered im going to run up to fairmount fairmount was a small station twenty miles east on the line the men nodded asking no questions bill brent was not among them mitchum walked into brents office brent was there sitting silently at his desk he seemed to be waiting im going to fairmount said mitchum his voice was aggressively too casual as if implying that no answer was necessary they had a diesel there couple of weeks ago you know emergency repairs or something im going down to see if we could use it he paused but brent said nothing the way things stack up said mitchum not looking at him we cant hold that train till morning weve got to take a chance one way or another now i think maybe this diesel will do it but thats the last one we can try for so if you dont hear from me in half an hour sign the order and send the comet through with number to pull her whatever brent had thought he could not believe it when he heard it he did not answer at once then he said very quietly no what do you mean no i wont do it what do you mean you wont its an order i wont do it brents voice had the firmness of certainty unclouded by any emotion are you refusing to obey an order i am but you have no right to refuse and im not going to argue about it either its what ive decided its my responsibility and im not asking for your opinion your job is to take my orders will you give me that order in writing why god damn you are you hinting that you dont trust me are you why do you have to go to fairmount dave why cant you telephone them about that diesel if you think that they have one youre not going to tell me how to do my job youre not going to sit there and question me youre going to keep your trap shut and do as youre told or ill give you a chance to talkto the unification board it was hard to decipher emotions on brents cowboy face but mitchum saw something that resembled a look of incredulous horror only it was horror at some sight of his own not at the words and it had no quality of fear not the kind of fear mitchum had hoped for brent knew that tomorrow morning the issue would be his word against mitchums mitchum would deny having given the order mitchum would show written proof that engine number had been sent to winston only to stand by and would produce witnesses that he had gone to fairmount in search of a diesel mitchum would claim that the fatal order had been issued by and on the sole responsibility of bill brent the chief dispatcher it would not be much of a case not a case that could bear close study but it would be enough for the unification board whose policy was consistent only in not permitting anything to be studied closely brent knew that he could play the same game and pass the frameup on to another victim he knew that he had the brains to work it outexcept that he would rather be dead than do it it was not the sight of mitchum that made him sit still in horror it was the realization that there was no one whom he could call to expose this thing and stop itno superior anywhere on the line from colorado to omaha to new york they were in on it all of them they were doing the same they had given mitchum the lead and the method it was dave mitchum who now belonged on this railroad and he bill brent who did not as bill brent had learned to see by a single glance at a few numbers on a sheet of paper the entire trackage of a divisionso he was now able to see the whole of his own life and the full price of the decision he was making he had not fallen in love until he was past his youth he had been thirtysix when he had found the woman he wanted he had been engaged to her for the last four years he had had to wait because he had a mother to support and a widowed sister with three children he had never been afraid of burdens because he had known his ability to carry them and he had never assumed an obligation unless he was certain that he could fulfill it he had waited he had saved his money and now he had reached the time when he felt himself free to be happy he was to be married in a few weeks this coming june he thought of it as he sat at his desk looking at dave mitchum but the thought aroused no hesitation only regret and a distant sadnessdistant because he knew that he could not let it be part of this moment bill brent knew nothing about epistemology but he knew that man must live by his own rational perception of reality that he cannot act against it or escape it or find a substitute for itand that there is no other way for him to live he rose to his feet its true that so long as i hold this job i cannot refuse to obey you he said but i can if i quit so im quitting youre what im quitting as of this moment but you have no right to quit you goddamn bastard dont you know that dont you know that ill have you thrown in jail for it if you want to send the sheriff for me in the morning ill be at home i wont try to escape theres no place to go dave mitchum was sixfoottwo and had the build of a bruiser but he stood shaking with fury and terror over the delicate figure of bill brent you cant quit theres a law against it ive got a law you cant walk out on me i wont let you out i wont let you leave this building tonight brent walked to the door will you repeat that order you gave me in front of the others no then i will as he pulled the door open mitchums fist shot out smashed into his face and knocked him down the trainmaster and the road foreman stood in the open doorway he quit screamed mitchum the yellow bastard quit at a time like this hes a lawbreaker and a coward in the slow effort of rising from the floor through the haze of blood running into his eyes bill brent looked up at the two men he saw that they understood but he saw the closed faces of men who did not want to understand did not want to interfere and hated him for putting them on the spot in the name of justice he said nothing rose to his feet and walked out of the building mitchum avoided looking at the others hey you he called jerking his head at the night dispatcher across the room come here youve got to take over at once with the door closed he repeated to the boy the story of the diesel at fairmount as he had given it to brent and the order to send the comet through with engine number if the boy did not hear from him in half an hour the boy was in no condition to think to speak or to understand anything he kept seeing the blood on the face of bill brent who had been his idol yes sir he answered numbly dave mitchum departed for fairmount announcing to every yardman switchman and wiper in sight as he boarded the track motor car that he was going in search of a diesel for the comet the night dispatcher sat at his desk watching the clock and the telephone praying that the telephone would ring and let him hear from mr mitchum but the halfhour went by in silence and whet there were only three minutes left the boy felt a terror he could not explain except that he did not want to send that order he turned to the trainmaster and the road foreman asking hesitantly mr mitchum gave me an order before he left but i wonder whether i ought to send it because i i dont think its right he said the trainmaster turned away he felt no pity the boy was about the same age as his brother had been the road foreman snapped do just as mr mitchum told you youre not supposed to think and walked out of the room the responsibility that james taggart and clifton locey had evaded now rested on the shoulders of a trembling bewildered boy he hesitated then he buttressed his courage with the thought that one did not doubt the good faith and the competence of railroad executives he did not know that his vision of a railroad and its executives was that of a century ago with the conscientious precision of a railroad man in the moment when the hand of the clock ended the halfhour he signed his name to the order instructing the comet to proceed with engine number and transmitted the order to winston station the station agent at winston shuddered when he looked at the order but he was not the man to defy authority he told himself that the tunnel was not perhaps as dangerous as he thought he told himself that the best policy these days was not to think when he handed their copies of the order to the conductor and the engineer of the comet the conductor glanced slowly about the room from face to face folded the slip of paper put it into his pocket and walked out without a word the engineer stood looking at the paper for a moment then threw it down and said im not going to do it and if its come to where this railroad hands out orders like this one im not going to work for it either just list me as having quit but you cant quit cried the station agent theyll arrest you for it if they find me said the engineer and walked out of the station into the vast darkness of the mountain night the engineer from silver springs who had brought in number was sitting in a corner of the room he chuckled and said hes yellow the station agent turned to him will you do it joe will you take the comet joe scott was drunk there had been a time when a railroad man reporting for duty with any sign of intoxication would have been regarded as a doctor arriving for work with sores of smallpox on his face but joe scott was a privileged person three months ago he had been fired for an infraction of safety rules which had caused a major wreck two weeks ago he had been reinstated in his job by order of the unification board he was a friend of fred kinnan he protected kinnans interests in his union not against the employers but against the membership sure said joe scott ill take the comet ill get her through if i go fast enough the fireman of number had remained in the cab of his engine he looked up uneasily when they came to switch his engine to the head end of the comet he looked up at the red and green lights of the tunnel hanging in the distance above twenty miles of curves but he was a placid amicable fellow who made a good fireman with no hope of ever rising to engineer his husky muscles were his only asset he felt certain that his superiors knew what they were doing so he did not venture any questions the conductor stood by the rear end of the comet he looked at the lights of the tunnel then at the long chain of the comets windows a few windows were lighted but most of them showed only the feeble blue glow of night lamps edging the lowered blinds he thought that he should rouse the passengers and warn them there had been a time when he had placed the safety of the passengers above his own not by reason of love for his fellow men but because that responsibility was part of his job which he accepted and felt pride in fulfilling now he felt a contemptuous indifference and no desire to save them they had asked for and accepted directive he thought they went on living and daily turning away in evasion from the kind of verdicts that the unification board was passing on defenseless victimswhy shouldnt he now turn away from them if he saved their lives not one of them would come forward to defend him when the unification board would convict him for disobeying orders for creating a panic for delaying mr chalmers he had no desire to be a martyr for the sake of allowing people safely to indulge in their own irresponsible evil when the moment came he raised his lantern and signaled the engineer to start see said kip chalmers triumphantly to lester tuck as the wheels under their feet shuddered forward fear is the only practical means to deal with people the conductor stepped onto the vestibule of the last car no one saw him as he went down the steps of the other side slipped off the train and vanished into the darkness of the mountains a switchman stood ready to throw the switch that would send the comet from the siding onto the main track he looked at the comet as it came slowly toward him it was only a blazing white globe with a beam stretching high above his head and a jerky thunder trembling through the rail under his feet he knew that the switch should not be thrown he thought of the night ten years ago when he had risked his life in a flood to save a train from a washout but he knew that times had changed in the moment when he threw the switch and saw the headlight jerk sidewise he knew that he would now hate his job for the rest of his life the comet uncoiled from the siding into a thin straight line and went on into the mountains with the beam of the headlight like an extended arm pointing the way and the lighted glass curve of the observation lounge ending it off some of the passengers aboard the comet were awake as the train started its coiling ascent they saw the small cluster of winstons lights at the bottom of the darkness beyond their windows then the same darkness but with red and green lights by the hole of a tunnel on the upper edge of the windowpanes the lights of winston kept growing smaller each time they appeared the black hole of the tunnel kept growing larger a black veil went streaking past the windows at times dimming the lights it was the heavy smoke from the coalburning engine as the tunnel came closer they saw on the edge of the sky far to the south in a void of space and rock a spot of living fire twisting in the wind they did not know what it was and did not care to learn it is said that catastrophes are a matter of pure chance and there were those who would have said that the passengers of the comet were not guilty or responsible for the thing that happened to them the man in bedroom a car no was a professor of sociology who taught that individual ability is of no consequence that individual effort is futile that

or more of their ideas as the train went into the tunnel the flame of wyatts torch was the last thing they saw on earth chapter viii by our love the sun touched the tree tops on the slope of the hill and they looked a bluishsilver catching the color of the sky dagny stood at the door of the cabin with the first sunrays on her forehead and miles of forest spread under her feet the leaves went down from silver to green to the smoky blue of the shadows on the road below the light trickled down through the branches and shot upward in sudden spurts when it hit a clump of ferns that became a fountain of green rays it gave her pleasure to watch the motion of the light over a stillness where nothing else could move she had marked the date as she did each morning on the sheet of paper she had tacked to the wall of her room the progression of the dates on that paper was the only movement in the stillness of her days like the record kept by a prisoner on a desert island this mornings date was may she had intended the dates to lead to a purpose but she could not say whether she had reached it or not she had come here with three assignments given as orders to herself restlearn to live without the railroadget the pain out of the way get it out of the way were the words she used she felt as if she were tied to some wounded stranger who could be stricken at any moment by an attack that would drown her in his screams she felt no pity for the stranger only a contemptuous impatience she had to fight him and destroy him then her way would be clear to decide what she wished to do but the stranger was not easy to fight the assignment to rest had been easier she found that she liked the solitude she awakened in the morning with a feeling of confident benevolence the sense that she could venture forth and be willing to deal with whatever she found in the city she had lived in chronic tension to withstand the shock of anger indignation disgust contempt the only danger to threaten her here was the simple pain of some physical accident it seemed innocent and easy by comparison the cabin was far from any traveled road it had remained as her father had left it she cooked her meals on a woodburning stove and gathered the wood on the hillsides she cleared the brush from under her walls she reshingled the roof she repainted the door and the frames of the windows rains weeds and brush had swallowed the steps of what had once been a terraced path rising up the hill from the road to the cabin she rebuilt it clearing the terraces relaying the stones bracing the banks of soft earth with walls of boulders it gave her pleasure to devise complex systems of levers and pulleys out of old scraps of iron and rope then to move weights of rock that were much beyond her physical power she planted a few seeds of nasturtiums and morning glories to see one spreading slowly over the ground and the other climbing up the tree trunks to see them grow to see progression and movement the work gave her the calm she needed she had not noticed how she began it or why she had started without conscious intention but she saw it growing under her hands pulling her forward giving her a healing sense of peace then she understood that what she needed was the motion to a purpose no matter how small or in what form the sense of an activity going step by step to some chosen end across a span of time the work of cooking a meal was like a closed circle completed and gone leading nowhere but the work of building a path was a living sum so that no day was left to die behind her but each day contained all those that preceded it each day acquired its immortality on every succeeding tomorrow a circle she thought is the movement proper to physical nature they say that theres nothing but circular motion in the inanimate universe around us but the straight line is the badge of man the straight line of a geometrical abstraction that makes roads rails and bridges the straight line that cuts the curving aimlessness of nature by a purposeful motion from a start to an end the cooking of meals she thought is like the feeding of coal to an engine for the sake of a great run but what would be the imbecile torture of coaling an engine that had no run to make it is not proper for mans life to be a circle she thought or a string of circles dropping off like zeros behind himmans life must be a straight line of motion from goal to farther goal each leading to the next and to a single growing sum like a journey down the track of a railroad from station to station tooh stop it stop itshe told herself in quiet severity when the scream of the wounded stranger was choked offdont think of that dont look too far you like building this path build it dont look beyond the foot of the hill she had driven a few times to the store in woodstock twenty miles away to buy supplies and food woodstock was a small huddle of dying structures built generations ago for some reason and hope long since forgotten there was no railroad to feed it no electric power nothing but a county highway growing emptier year by year the only store was a wooden hovel with spidereaten corners and a rotted patch in the middle of the floor eaten by the rains that came through the leaking roof the storekeeper was a fat pallid woman who moved with effort but seemed indifferent to her own discomfort the stock of food consisted of dusty cans with faded labels some grain and a few vegetables rotting in ancient bins outside the door why dont you move those vegetables out of the sun dagny asked once the woman looked at her blankly as if unable to understand the possibility of such a question theyve always been there she answered indifferently driving back to the cabin dagny looked up at a mountain stream that fell with ferocious force down a sheer granite wall its spray hanging like a mist of rainbows in the sun she thought that one could build a hydroelectric plant just large enough to supply the power for her cabin and for the town of woodstockwoodstock could be made to be productivethose wild apple trees she saw in such unusual numbers among the dense growth on the hillsides were the remnants of orchardssuppose one were to reclaim them then build a small spur to the nearest railroadoh stop it no kerosene today the storekeeper told her on her next trip to woodstock it rained thursday night and when it rains the trucks cant get through fairfield gorge the roads flooded and the kerosene truck wont be back this way till next month if you know that the road gets flooded every time it rains why dont you people repair it the woman answered the roads always been that way driving back dagny stopped on the crest of a hill and looked down at the miles of countryside below she looked at fairfield gorge where the county road twisting through marshy soil below the level of a river got trapped in a crack between two hills it would be simple to bypass those hills she thought to build a road on the other side of the riverthe people of woodstock had nothing to do she could teach themcut a road straight to the southwest save miles connect with the state highway at the freight depot ofoh stop it she put her kerosene lamp aside and sat in her cabin after dark by the light of a candle listening to the music of a small portable radio she hunted for symphony concerts and twisted the dial rapidly past whenever she caught the raucous syllables of a news broadcast she did not want any news from the city dont think of taggart transcontinentalshe had told herself on her first night in the cabindont think of it until youre able to hear the words as if they were atlantic southern or associated steel but the weeks passed and no scar would grow over the wound it seemed to her as if she were fighting the unpredictable cruelty of her own mind she would lie in bed drifting off to sleepthen find herself suddenly thinking that the conveyor belt was worn at the coaling station at willow bend indiana she had seen it from the window of her car on her last trip she must tell them to replace it or theyand then she would be sitting up in bed crying stop itand stopping it but remaining awake for the rest of that night she would sit at the door of the cabin at sunset and watch the motion of the leaves growing still in the twilightthen she would see the sparks of the fireflies rising from the grass flashing on and off in every darkening corner flashing slowly as if holding one moments warningthey were like the lights of signals winking at night over the track of astop it it was the times when she could not stop it that she dreaded the times when unable to stand upas in physical pain with no limit to divide it from the pain of her mindshe would fall down on the floor of the cabin or on the earth of the woods and sit still with her face pressed to a chair or a rock and fight not to let herself scream aloud while they were suddenly as close to her and as real as the body of a lover the two lines of rail going off to a single point in the distancethe front of an engine cutting space apart by means of the letters ttthe sound of the wheels clicking in accented rhythm under the floor of her carthe statue of nat taggart in the concourse of the terminal fighting not to know them not to feel them her body rigid but for the grinding motion of her face against her arm she would draw whatever power over her consciousness still remained to her into the soundless toneless repetition of the words get it over with there were long stretches of calm when she was able to face her problem with the dispassionate clarity of weighing a problem in engineering but she could find no answer she knew that her desperate longing for the railroad would vanish were she to convince herself that it was impossible or improper but the longing came from the certainty that the truth and the right were hersthat the enemy was the irrational and the unrealthat she could not set herself another goal or summon the love to achieve it while her rightful achievement had been lost not to some superior power but to a loathsome evil that conquered by means of impotence she could renounce the railroad she thought she could find contentment here in this forest but she would build the path then reach the road below then rebuild the roadand then she would reach the storekeeper of woodstock and that would be the end and the empty white face staring at the universe in stagnant apathy would be the limit placed on her effort whyshe heard herself screaming aloud there was no answer then stay here until you answer it she thought you have no place to go you cant move you cant start grading a rightofway until until you know enough to choose a terminal there were long silent evenings when the emotion that made her sit still and look at the unattainable distance beyond the fading light to the south was loneliness for hank rearden she wanted the sight of his unyielding face the confident face looking at her with the hint of a smile but she knew that she could not see him until her battle was won his smile had to be deserved it was intended for an adversary who traded her strength against his not for a painbeaten wretch who would seek relief in that smile and thus destroy its meaning he could help her to live he could not help her to decide for what purpose she wished to go on living she had felt a faint touch of anxiety since the morning when she marked may on her calendar she had forced herself to listen to news broadcasts once in a while she had heard no mention of his name her fear for him was her last link to the city it kept drawing her eyes to the horizon at the south and down to the road at the foot of the hill she found herself waiting for him to come she found herself listening for the sound of a motor but the only sound to give her a futile start of hope at times was the sudden crackle of some large birds wings hurtling through the branches into the sky there was another link to the past that still remained as an unsolved question quentin daniels and the motor that he was trying to rebuild by june she would owe him his monthly check should she tell him that she had quit that she would never need that motor and neither would the world should she tell him to stop and to let the remnant of the motor vanish in rust on some such junk pile as the one where she had found it she could not force herself to do it it seemed harder than leaving the railroad that motor she thought was not a link to the past it was her last link to the future to kill it seemed like an act not of murder but of suicide her order to stop it would be her signature under the certainty that there was no terminal for her to seek ahead but it is not trueshe thought as she stood at the door of her cabin on this morning of may it is not true that there is no place in the future for a superlative achievement of mans mind it can never be true no matter what her problem this would always remain to herthis immovable conviction that evil was unnatural and temporary she felt it more clearly than ever this morning the certainty that the ugliness of the men in the city and the ugliness of her suffering were transient accidentswhile the smiling sense of hope within her at the sight of a sunflooded forest the sense of an unlimited promise was the permanent and the real she stood at the door smoking a cigarette in the room behind her the sounds of a symphony of her grandfathers time were coming from the radio she barely listened she was conscious only of the flow of chords that seemed to play an underscoring harmony for the flow of the smoke curving slowly from her cigarette for the curving motion of her arm moving the cigarette to her lips once in a while she closed her eyes and stood still feeling the rays of the sun on her body this was the achievement she thoughtto enjoy this moment to let no memory of pain blunt her capacity to feel as she felt right now so long as she could preserve this feeling she would have the fuel to go on she was barely aware of a faint noise that came through the music like the scratching of an old record the first thing to reach her consciousness was the sudden jerk of her own hand flinging the cigarette aside it came in the same instant as the realization that the noise was growing loader and that it was the sound of a motor then she knew that she had not admitted to herself how much she had wanted to hear that sound how desperately she had waited for hank rearden she heard her own chuckleit was humbly cautiously low as if not to disturb the drone of revolving metal which was now the unmistakable sound of a car rising up the mountain road she could not see the roadthe small stretch under the arch of branches at the foot of the hill was her only view of itbut she watched the cars ascent by the growing imperious strain of the motor against the grades and the screech of the tires on curves the car stopped under the arch of branches she did not recognize it it was not the black hammond but a long gray convertible she saw the driver step out it was a man whose presence here could not be possible it was francisco danconia the shock she felt was not disappointment it was more like the sensation that disappointment would now be irrelevant it was eagerness and an odd solemn stillness the sudden certainty that she was facing the approach of something unknown and of the gravest importance the swiftness of franciscos movements was carrying him toward the hill while he was raising his head to glance up he saw her above at the door of the cabin and stopped she could not distinguish the expression on his face he stood still for a long moment his face raised to her then he started up the hill she feltalmost as if she had expected itthat this was a scene from their childhood he was coming toward her not running but moving upward with a kind of triumphant confident eagerness no she thought this was not their childhoodit was the future as she would have seen it then in the days when she waited for him as for her release from prison it was a moments view of a morning they would have reached if her vision of life had been fulfilled if they had both gone the way she had then been so certain of going held motionless by wonder she stood looking at him taking this moment not in the name of the present but as a salute to their past when he was close enough and she could distinguish his face she saw the look of that luminous gaiety which transcends the solemn by proclaiming the great innocence of a man who has earned the right to be lighthearted he was smiling and whistling some piece of music that seemed to flow like the long smooth rising flight of his steps the melody seemed distantly familiar to her she felt that it belonged with this moment yet she felt also that there was something odd about it something important to grasp only she could not think of it now hi slug hi frisco she knewby the way he looked at her by an instants drop of his eyelids closing his eyes by the brief pull of his head striving to lean back and resist by the faint halfsmiling halfhelpless relaxation of his lips then by the sudden harshness of his arms as he seized herthat it was involuntary that he had not intended it and that it was irresistibly right for both of them the desperate violence of the way he held her the hurting pressure of his mouth on hers the exultant surrender of his body to the touch of hers were not the form of a moments pleasure she knew that no physical hunger could bring a man to thisshe knew that it was the statement she had never heard from him the greatest confession of love a man could make no matter what he had done to wreck his life this was still the francisco danconia in whose bed she had been so proud of belongingno matter what betrayals she had met from the world her vision of life had been true and some indestructible part of it had remained within himand in answer to it her body responded to his her arms and mouth held him confessing her desire confessing an acknowledgment she had always given him and always would then the rest of his years came back to her with a stab of the pain of knowing that the greater his person the more terrible his guilt hi destroying it she pulled herself away from him she shook her head she said in answer to both of them no he stood looking at her disarmed and smiling not yet you have a great deal to forgive me first but i can tell you everything now she had never heard that low breathless quality of helplessness in his voice he was fighting to regain control there was almost a touch of apology in his smile the apology of a child pleading for indulgence but there was also an adults amusement the laughing declaration that he did not have to hide his struggle since it was happiness that he was wrestling with not pain she backed away from him she felt as if emotion had flung her ahead of her own consciousness and questions were now catching up with her groping toward the form of words dagny that torture youve been going through here for the last month answer me as honestly as you can do you think you could have borne it twelve years ago no she answered he smiled why do you ask that to redeem twelve years of my life which i wont have to regret what do you mean andher questions had caught up with herand what do you know about my torture here dagny arent you beginning to see that i would know everything about it how did you francisco what were you whistling when you were coming up the hill why was i i dont know it was the fifth concerto by richard halley wasnt it oh he looked startled then smiled in amusement at himself then answered gravely ill tell you that later how did you find out where i was ill tell you that too you forced it out of eddie i havent seen eddie for over a year he was the only one who knew it it wasnt eddie who told me i didnt want anybody to find me he glanced slowly about him she saw his eyes stop on the path she had built on the planted flowers on the freshshingled roof he chuckled as if he understood and as if it hurt him you shouldnt have been left here for a month he said god you shouldnt have its my first failure at the one time when i didnt want to fail but i didnt think you were ready to quit had i known it i would have watched you day and night really what for to spare youhe pointed at her workall this francisco she said her voice low if youre concerned about my torture dont you know that i dont want to hear you speak of it because she stopped she had never complained to him not in all those years her voice flat she said only that i dont want to hear it because im the one man who has no right to speak of it dagny if you think that i dont know how much ive hurt you ill tell you about the years when i but its over oh darling its over is it forgive me i mustnt say that not until you say it he was trying to control his voice but the look of happiness was beyond his power of control are you happy because ive lost everything i lived for all right ill say it if this is what youve come to hear you were the first thing i lostdoes it amuse you now to see that ive lost the rest he glanced straight at her his eyes drawn narrow by such an intensity of earnestness that the glance was almost a threat and she knew that whatever the years had meant to him amusement was the one word she had no right to utter do you really think that he asked she whispered no dagny we can never lose the things we live for we may have to change their form at times if weve made an error but the purpose remains the same and the forms are ours to make that is what ive been telling myself for a month but theres no way left open toward any purpose whatever he did not answer he sat down on a boulder by the door of the cabin watching her as if he did not want to miss a single shadow of reaction on her face what do you think now of the men who quit and vanished he asked she shrugged with a faint smile of helpless sadness and sat down on the ground beside him you know she said i used to think that there was some destroyer who came after them and made them quit but i guess there wasnt there have been times this past month when ive almost wished he would come for me too but nobody came no no i used to think that he gave them some inconceivable reason to make them betray everything they loved but that wasnt necessary i know how they felt i cant blame them any longer what i dont know is how they learned to exist afterwardif any of them still exist do you feel that youve betrayed taggart transcontinental no i i feel that i would have betrayed it by remaining at work you would have if i had agreed to serve the looters its its nat taggart that i would have delivered to them i couldnt i couldnt let his achievement and mine end up with the looters as our final goal no you couldnt do you call this indifference do you think that you love the railroad less than you did a month ago i think that i would give my life for just one more year on the railroad but i cant go back to it then you know what they felt all the men who quit and what it was that they loved when they gave up francisco she asked not looking at him her head bent why did you ask me whether i could have given it up twelve years ago dont you know what night i am thinking of just as you are yes she whispered that was the night i gave up danconia copper slowly with a long effort she moved her head to glance up at him his face had the expression she had seen then on that next morning twelve years ago the look of a smile though he was not smiling the quiet look of victory over pain the look of a mans pride in the price he paid and in that which made it worth paying but you didnt give it up she said you didnt quit youre still the president of danconia copper only it means nothing to you now it means as much to me now as it did that night then how can you let it go to pieces dagny youre more fortunate than i taggart transcontinental is a delicate piece of precision machinery it will not last long without you it cannot be run by slave labor they will mercifully destroy it for you and you wont have to see it serving the looters but copper mining is a simpler job danconia copper could have lasted for generations of looters and slaves crudely miserably ineptlybut it could have lasted and helped them to last i had to destroy it myself youwhat i am destroying danconia copper consciously deliberately by plan and by my own hand i have to plan it as carefully and work as hard as if i were producing a fortunein order not to let them notice it and stop me in order not to let them seize the mines until it is too late ah the effort and energy i had hoped to spend on danconia copper im spending them only only its not to make it grow i shall destroy every last bit of it and every last penny of my fortune and every ounce of copper that could feed the looters i shall not leave it as i found iti shall leave it as sebastian danconia found itthen let them try to exist without him or me francisco she screamed how could you make yourself do it by the grace of the same love as yours he answered quietly my love for danconia copper for the spirit of which it was the shape wasand some day will be again she sat still trying to grasp all the implications of what she now grasped only as the numbness of shock in the silence the music of the radio symphony went on and the rhythm of the chords reached her like the slow solemn pounding of steps while she struggled to see at once the whole progression of twelve years the tortured boy who called for help on her breaststhe man who sat on the floor of a drawing room playing marbles and laughing at the destruction of great industriesthe man who cried my love i cant while refusing to help herthe man who drank a toast in the dim booth of a barroom to the years which sebastian danconia had had to wait francisco of all the guesses i tried to make about you i never thought of it i never thought that you were one of those men who had quit i was one of the first of them i thought that they always vanished well hadnt i wasnt it the worst of what i did to youthat i left you looking at a cheap playboy who was not the francisco danconia you had known yes she whispered only the worst was that i couldnt believe it i never did it was francisco danconia that i kept seeing every time i saw you i know and i know what it did to you i tried to help you understand but it was too soon to tell you dagny if i had told youthat night or the day when you came to damn me for the san sebastian minesthat i was not an aimless loafer that i was out to speed up the destruction of everything we had held sacred together the destruction of danconia copper of taggart transcontinental of wyatt oil of rearden steelwould you have found it easier to take harder she whispered im not sure t can take it even now neither your kind of renunciation nor my own but franciscoshe threw her head back suddenly to look up at himif this was your secret then of all the hell you had to take i was oh yes my darling yes you were the worst of it it was a desperate cry its sound of laughter and of release confessing all the agony he wanted to sweep away he seized her hand he pressed his mouth to it then his face not to let her see the reflection of what his years had been like if its any kind of atonement which it isnt whatever i made you suffer thats how i paid for it by knowing what i was doing to you and having to do it and waiting waiting to but its over he raised his head smiling he looked down at her and she saw a look of protective tenderness come into his face which told her of the despair he saw in hers dagny dont think of that i wont claim any suffering of mine as my excuse whatever my reason i knew what i was doing and ive hurt you terribly ill need years to make up for it forget whatshe knew that he meant what his embrace had confessedwhat i havent said of all the things i have to tell you that is the one ill say last but his eyes his smile the grasp of his fingers on her wrist were saying it against his will youve borne too much and theres a great deal that you have to learn to understand in order to lose every scar of the torture you never should have had to bear all that matters now is that youre free to recover were free both of us were free of the looters were out of their reach she said her voice quietly desolate thats what i came here forto try to understand but i cant it seems monstrously wrong to surrender the world to the looters and monstrously wrong to live under their rule i can neither give up nor go back i can neither exist without work nor work as a serf i had always thought that any sort of battle was proper anything except renunciation im not sure were right to quit you and f when we should have fought them but there is no way to fight its surrender if we leaveand surrender if we remain i dont know what is right any longer check your premises dagny contradictions dont exist but i cant find any answer i cant condemn you for what youre doing yet its horror that i feeladmiration and horror at the same time you the heir of the danconias who could have surpassed all his ancestors of the miraculous hand that produced youre turning your matchless ability to the job of destruction and iim playing with cobblestones and shingling a roof while a transcontinental railroad system is collapsing in the hands of congenital ward heelers yet you and i were the kind who determine the fate of the world if this is what we let it come to then it must have been our own guilt but i cant see the nature of our error yes dagny it was our own guilt because we didnt work hard enough because we worked too hardand charged too little what do you mean we never demanded the one payment that the world owed usand we let our best reward go to the worst of men the error was made centuries ago it was made by sebastian danconia by nat taggart by every man who fed the world and received no thanks in return you dont know what is right any longer dagny this is not a battle over material goods its a moral crisis the greatest the world has ever faced and the last our age is the climax of centuries of evil we must put an end to it once and for all or perishwe the men of the mind it was our own guilt we produced the wealth of the worldbut we let our enemies write its moral code but we never accepted their code we lived by our own standards yesand paid ransoms for it ransoms in matter and in spiritin money which our enemies received but did not deserve and in honor which we deserved but did not receive that was our guiltthat we were willing to pay we kept mankind alive yet we allowed men to despise us and to worship our destroyers we allowed them to worship incompetence and brutality the recipients and the dispensers of the unearned by accepting punishment not for any sins but for our virtues we betrayed our code and made theirs possible dagny theirs is the morality of kidnappers they use your love of virtue as a hostage they know that youll bear anything in order to work and produce because you know that achievement is mans highest moral purpose that he cant exist without it and your love of virtue is your love of life they count on you to assume any burden they count on you to feel that no effort is too great in the service of your love dagny your enemies are destroying you by means of your own power your generosity and your endurance are their only tools your unrequited rectitude is the only hold they have upon you they know it you dont the day when youll discover it is the only thing they dread you must learn to understand them you wont be free of them until you do but when you do youll reach such a stage of rightful anger that youll blast every rail of taggart transcontinental rather than let it serve them but to leave it to them she moaned to abandon it to abandon taggart transcontinental when its its almost like a living person it was it isnt any longer leave it to them it wont do them any good let it go we dont need it we can rebuild it they cant well survive without it they wont but we brought down to renouncing and giving up dagny we whove been called materialists by the killers of the human spirit were the only ones who know how little value or meaning there is in material objects as such because were the ones who create their value and meaning we can afford to give them up for a short while in order to redeem something much more precious we are the soul of which railroads copper mines steel mills and oil wells are the bodyand they are living entities that beat day and night like our hearts in the sacred function of supporting human life but only so long as they remain our body only so long as they remain the expression the reward and the property of achievement without us they are corpses and their sole product is poison not wealth or food the poison of disintegration that turns men into hordes of scavengers dagny learn to understand the nature of your own power and youll understand the paradox you now see around you you do not have to depend on any material possessions they depend on you you create them you own the one and only tool of production wherever you are you will always be able to produce but the lootersby their own stated theoryare in desperate permanent congenital need and at the blind mercy of matter why dont you take them at their word they need railroads factories mines motors which they cannot make or run of what use will your railroad be to them without you who held it together who kept it alive who saved it time and time again was it your brother james who fed him who fed the looters who produced their weapons who gave them the means to enslave you the impossible spectacle of shabby little incompetents holding control over the products of geniuswho made it possible who supported your enemies who forged your chains who destroyed your achievement the motion that threw her upright was like a silent cry he shot to his feet with the stored abruptness of a spring uncoiling his voice driving on in merciless triumph youre beginning to see arent you dagny leave them the carcass of that railroad leave them all the rusted rails and rotted ties and gutted enginesbut dont leave them your mind dont leave them your mind the fate of the world rests on that decision ladies and gentlemen said the panicpregnant voice of a radio announcer breaking off the chords of the symphony we interrupt this broadcast to bring you a special news bulletin the greatest disaster in railroad history occurred in the early hours of the morning on the main line of taggart transcontinental at winston colorado demolishing the famous taggart tunnel her scream sounded like the screams that had rung out in the one last moment in the darkness of the tunnel its sound remained with him through the rest of the broadcastas they both ran to the radio in the cabin and stood in equal terror her eyes staring at the radio his eyes watching her face the details of the story were obtained from luke beal fireman of the taggart luxury main liner the comet who was found unconscious at the western portal of the tunnel this morning and who appears to be the sole survivor of the catastrophe through some astounding infraction of safety rulesin circumstances not yet fully establishedthe comet westbound for san francisco was sent into the tunnel with a coalburning steam locomotive the taggart tunnel an eightmile bore cut through the summit of the rocky mountains and regarded as an engineering achievement not to be equaled in our time was built by the grandson of nathaniel taggart in the great age of the clean smokeless dieselelectric engine the tunnels ventilation system was not designed to provide for the heavy smoke and fumes of coalburning locomotivesand it was known to every railroad employee in the district that to send a train into the tunnel with such a locomotive would mean death by suffocation for everyone aboard the comet none the less was so ordered to proceed according to fireman beal the effects of the fumes began to be felt when the train was about three miles inside the tunnel engineer joseph scott threw the throttle wide open in a desperate attempt to gain speed but the old worn engine was inadequate for the weight of the long train and the rising grade of the track struggling through the thickening fumes engineer and fireman had barely managed to force the leaking steam boilers up to a speed of forty miles per hourwhen some passenger prompted undoubtedly by the panic of choking pulled the emergency brake cord the sudden jolt of the stop apparently broke the engines airhose for the train could not be started again there were screams coming from the cars passengers were breaking windows engineer scott struggled frantically to make the engine start but collapsed at the throttle overcome by the fumes fireman beal leaped from the engine and ran he was within sight of the western portal when he heard the blast of the explosion which is the last thing he remembers the rest of the story was gathered from railroad employees at winston station it appears that an army freight special westbound carrying a heavy load of explosives had been given no warning about the presence of the comet on the track just ahead both trains had encountered delays and were running off their schedules it appears that the freight special had been ordered to proceed regardless of signals because the tunnels signal system was out of order it is said that in spite of speed regulations and in view of the frequent breakdowns of the ventilating system it was the tacit custom of all engineers to go full speed while in the tunnel it appears as far as can be established at present that the comet was stalled just beyond the point where the tunnel makes a sharp curve it is believed that everyone aboard was dead by that time it is doubted that the engineer of the freight special turning a curve at eighty miles an hour would have been able to see in time the observation window of the comets last car which was brightly lighted when it left winston station what is known is that the freight special crashed into the rear of the comet the explosion of the specials cargo broke windows in a farmhouse five miles away and brought down such a weight of rock upon the tunnel that rescue parties have not yet been able to come within three miles of where either train had been it is not expected that any survivors will be foundand it is not believed that the taggart tunnel can ever be rebuilt she stood still she looked as if she were seeing not the room around her but the scene in colorado her sudden movement had the abruptness of a convulsion with the singletracked rationality of a somnambulist she whirled to find her handbag as if it were the only object in existence she seized it she whirled to the door and ran dagny he screamed dont go back the scream had no more power to reach her than if he were calling to her across the miles between him and the mountains of colorado he ran after her he caught her seizing her by both elbows and he cried dont go back dagny in the name of anything sacred to you dont go back she looked as if she did not know who he was in a contest of physical strength he could have broken the bones of her arms without effort but with the force of a living creature fighting for life she tore herself loose so violently that she threw him off balance for a moment when he regained his footing she was running down the hillrunning as he had run at the sound of the alarm siren in reardens millsrunning to her car on the road below his letter of resignation lay on the desk before himand james taggart sat staring at it hunched by hatred he felt as if his enemy were this piece of paper not the words on it but the sheet and the ink that had given the words a material finality he had always regarded thoughts and words as inconclusive but a material shape was that which he had spent his life escaping a commitment he had not decided to resignnot really he thought he had dictated the letter for a motive which he identified to himself only as just in case the letter he felt was a form of protection but he had not signed it yet and that was his protection against the protection the hatred was directed at whatever had brought him to feel that he would not be able to continue extending this process much longer he had received word of the catastrophe at eight oclock this morning by noon he had arrived at his office an instinct that came from reasons which he knew but spent his whole effort on not knowing had told him that he had to be there this time the men who had been his marked cardsin a game he knew how to playwere gone clifton locey was barricaded behind the statement of a doctor who had announced that mr locey was suffering from a heart condition which made it impossible to disturb him at present one of taggarts executive assistants was said to have left for boston last night and the other was said to have been called unexpectedly to an unnamed hospital to the bedside of a father nobody had ever suspected him of having there was no answer at the home of the chief engineer the vicepresident in charge of public relations could not be found driving through the streets to his office taggart had seen the black letters of the headlines walking down the corridors of taggart transcontinental he had heard the voice of a speaker pouring from a radio in someones office the kind of voice one expects to hear on unlighted street corners it was screaming demands for the nationalization of the railroads he had walked through the corridors his steps noisy in order to be seen and hasty in order not to be stopped for questions he had locked the door of his office ordering his secretary not to admit any person or phone call and to tell all comers that mr taggart was busy then he sat at his desk alone with blank terror he felt as if he were trapped in a subterranean vault and the lock could never be broken againand as if he were held on display in the sight of the whole city below hoping that the lock would hold out for eternity he had to be here in this office it was required of him he had to sit idly and waitwait for the unknown to descend upon him and to determine his actionsand the terror was both of who would come for him and of the fact that nobody came nobody to tell him what to do the ringing of the telephones in the outer office sounded like screams for help he looked at the door with a sensation of malevolent triumph at the thought of all those voices being defeated by the innocuous figure of his secretary a young man expert at nothing but the art of evasion which he practiced with the gray rubber limpness of the amoral the voices thought taggart were coming from colorado from every center of the taggart system from every office of the building around him he was safe so long as he did not have to hear them his emotions had clogged into a still solid opaque ball within him which the thought of the men who operated the taggart system could not pierce those men were merely enemies to be outwitted the sharper bites of fear came from the thought of the men on the board of directors but his letter of resignation was his fire escape which would leave them stuck with the fire the sharpest fear came from the thought of the men in washington if they called he would have to answer his rubber secretary would know whose voices superseded his orders but washington did not call the fear went through him in spasms once in a while leaving his mouth dry he did not know what he dreaded he knew that it was not the threat of the radio speaker what he had experienced at the sound of the snarling voice had been more like a terror which he felt because he was expected to feel it a dutyterror something that went with his position like welltailored suits and luncheon speeches but under it he had felt a sneaking little hope swift and furtive like the course of a cockroach if that threat took form it would solve everything save him from decision save him from signing the letter he would not be president of taggart transcontinental any longer but neither would anyone else neither would anyone else he sat looking down at his desk keeping his eyes and his mind out of focus it was as if he were immersed in a pool of fog struggling not to let it reach the finality of any form that which exists possesses identity he could keep it out of existence by refusing to identify it he did not examine the events in colorado he did not attempt to grasp their cause he did not consider their consequences he did not think the clogged ball of emotion was like a physical weight in his chest filling his consciousness releasing him from the responsibility of thought the bah was hatredhatred as his only answer hatred as the sole reality hatred without object cause beginning or end hatred as his claim against the universe as a justification as a right as an absolute the screaming of the telephones went on through the silence he knew that those pleas for help were not addressed to him but to an entity whose shape he had stolen it was this shape that the screams were now tearing away from him he felt as if the ringing ceased to be sounds and became a succession of slashes hitting his skull the object of the hatred began to take form as if summoned by the bells the solid ball exploded within him and flung him blindly into action rushing out of the room in defiance of all the faces around him he went running down the halls to the operating department and into the anteroom of the operating vicepresidents office the door to the office was open he saw the sky in the great windows beyond an empty desk then he saw the staff in the anteroom around him and the blond head of eddie willers in the glass cubbyhole he walked purposefully straight toward eddie willers he flung the glass door open and from the threshold in the sight and hearing of the room he screamed where is she eddie willers rose slowly to his feet and stood looking at taggart with an odd kind of dutiful curiosity as if this were one more phenomenon to observe among all the unprecedented things he had observed he did not answer where is she i cannot tell you listen you stubborn little punk this is no time for ceremony if youre trying to make me believe that you dont know where she is i dont believe you you know it and youre going to tell me or ill report you to the unification board ill swear to them that you know itthen try and prove that you dont there was a faint tone of astonishment in eddies voice as he answered ive never attempted to imply that i dont know where she is jim i know it but i wont tell you taggarts scream rose to the shrill impotent sound that confesses a miscalculation do you realize what youre saying why yes of course will you repeat ithe waved at the roomfor these witnesses eddie raised his voice a little more in precision and clarity than in volume i know where she is but i will not tell you youre confessing that youre an accomplice whos aiding and abetting a deserter if thats what you wish to call it but its a crime its a crime against the nation dont you know that no its against the law yes this is a national emergency you have no right to any private secrets youre withholding vital information im the president of this railroad im ordering you to tell me you cant refuse to obey an order its a penitentiary offense do you understand yes do you refuse i do years of training had made taggart able to watch any audience around him without appearing to do so he saw the tight closed faces of the staff faces that were not his allies all had a look of despair except the face of eddie willers the feudal serf of taggart transcontinental was the only one who seemed untouched by the disaster he looked at taggart with the lifelessly conscientious glance of a scholar confronted by a field of knowledge he had never wanted to study do you realize that youre a traitor yelled taggart eddie asked quietly to whom to the people its treason to shield a deserter its economic treason your duty to feed the people comes first above anything else whatever every public authority has said so dont you know it dont you know what theyll do to you dont you see that i dont give a damn about that oh you dont ill quote that to the unification board i have all these witnesses to prove that you said dont bother about witnesses jim dont put them on the spot ill write down everything i said ill sign it and you can take it to the board the sudden explosion of taggarts voice sounded as if he had been slapped who are you to stand against the government who are you you miserable little office rat to judge national policies and hold opinions of your own do you think the country has time to bother about your opinions your wishes or your precious little conscience youre going to learn a lessonall of youall of you spoiled selfindulgent undisciplined little twobit clerks who strut as if that crap about your rights was serious youre going to learn that these are not the days of nat taggart eddie said nothing for an instant they stood looking at each other across the desk taggarts face was distorted by terror eddies remained sternly serene james taggart believed the existence of an eddie willers too well eddie willers could not believe the existence of a james taggart do you think the nation will bother about your wishes or hers screamed taggart its her duty to come back its her duty to work what do we care whether she wants to work or not we need her do you jim an impulse pertaining to selfpreservation made taggart back a step away from the sound of that particular tone a very quiet tone in the voice of eddie willers but eddie made no move to follow he remained standing behind his desk in a manner suggesting the civilized tradition of a business office you wont find her he said she wont be back im glad she wont you can starve you can close the railroad you can throw me in jail you can have me shotwhat does it matter i wont tell you where she is if i see the whole country crashing i wont tell you you wont find her you they whirled at the sound of the entrance door flung open they saw dagny standing on the threshold she wore a wrinkled cotton dress and her hair was disheveled by hours of driving she stopped for the duration of a glance around her as if to recapture the place but there was no recognition of persons in her eyes the glance merely swept through the room as if making a swift inventory of physical objects her face was not the face they remembered it had aged not by means of lines but by means of a still naked look stripped of any quality save ruthlessness yet their first response ahead of shock or wonder was a single emotion that went through the room like a gasp of relief it was in all their faces but one eddie willers who alone had been calm a moment ago collapsed with his face down on his desk he made no sound but the movements of his shoulders were sobs her face gave no sign of acknowledgment to anyone no greeting as if her presence here were inevitable and no words were necessary she went straight to the door of her office passing the desk of her secretary she said her voice like the sound of a business machine neither rude nor gentle ask eddie to come in james taggart was the first one to move as if dreading to let her out of his sight he rushed in after her he cried i couldnt help it and then life returning to him his own his normal kind of life he screamed it was your fault you did it youre to blame for it because you left he wondered whether his scream had been an illusion inside his own ears her face remained blank yet she had turned to him she looked as if sounds had reached her but not words not the communication of a mind what he felt for a moment was his closest approach to a sense of his own nonexistence then he saw the faintest change in her face merely the indication of perceiving a human presence but she was looking past him and he turned and saw that eddie willers had entered the office there were traces of tears in eddies eyes but he made no attempt to hide them he stood straight as if the tears or any embarrassment or any apology for them were as irrelevant to him as to her she said get ryan on the telephone tell him im here then let me speak to him ryan had been the general manager of the railroads central region eddie gave her a warning by not answering at once then said his voice as even as hers ryans gone dagny he quit last week they did not notice taggart as they did not notice the furniture around them she had not granted him even the recognition of ordering him out of her office like a paralytic uncertain of his muscles obedience he gathered his strength and slipped out but he was certain of the first thing he had to do he hurried to his office to destroy his letter of resignation she did not notice his exit she was looking at eddie is knowland here she asked no hes gone andrews gone mcguire gone he went on quietly to recite the list of those he knew she would ask for those most needed in this hour who had resigned and vanished within the past month she listened without astonishment or emotion as one listens to the casualty list of a battle where all are doomed and it makes no difference whose names fall first when he finished she made no comment but asked what has been done since this morning nothing nothing dagny any office boy could have issued orders here since this morning and everybody would have obeyed him but even the office boys know that whoever makes the first move today will be held responsible for the future the present and the pastwhen the buck passing begins he would not save the system he would merely lose his job by the time he saved one division nothing has been done its stopped still whatever is moving is moving on anyones blind guessout on the line where they dont know whether theyre to move or to stop some trains are held at stations others are going on waiting to be stopped before they reach colorado its whatever the local dispatchers decide the terminal manager downstairs has cancelled all transcontinental traffic for today including tonights comet i dont know what the manager in san francisco is doing only the wrecking crews are working at the tunnel they havent come anywhere near the wreck as yet i dont think they will phone the terminal manager downstairs and tell him to put all transcontinental trains back on the schedule at once including tonights comet then come back here when he came back she was bending over the maps she had spread on a table and she spoke while he made rapid notes route all westbound trains south from kirby nebraska down the spur track to hastings down the track of the kansas western to laurel kansas then to the track of the atlantic southern at jasper oklahoma west on the atlantic southern to flagstaff arizona north on the track of the flagstaffhomedale to elgin utah north to midland northwest on the track of the wasatch railway to salt lake city the wasatch railway is an abandoned narrowgauge buy it have the gauge spread to standard if the owners are afraid since sales are illegal pay them twice the money and proceed with the work there is no rail between laurel kansas and jasper oklahomathree miles no rail between elgin and midland utahfive and a half miles have the rail laid have construction crews start at oncerecruit every local man available pay twice the legal wages three times anything they askput three shifts onand have the job done overnight for rail tear up the sidings at winston colorado at silver springs colorado at leeds utah at benson nevada if any local stooges of the unification board come to stop the workgive authority to our local men the ones you trust to bribe them dont put that through the accounting department charge it to me ill pay it if they find some case where it doesnt work have them tell the stooge that directive does not provide for local injunctions that an injunction has to be brought against our headquarters and that they have to sue me if they wish to stop us is that true how do i know how can anybody know but by the time they untangle it and decide whatever it is they please to decideour track will be built i see ill go over the lists and give you the names of our local men to put in chargeif theyre still there by the time tonights comet teaches kirby nebraska the track will be ready it will add about thirtysix hours to the transcontinental schedulebut there will be a transcontinental schedule then have them get for me out of the files the old maps of our road as it was before nat taggarts grandson built the tunnel the what he did not raise his voice but the catch of his breath was the break of emotion he had wanted to avoid her face did not change but a fault note in her voice acknowledged him a note of gentleness not reproof the old maps of the days before the tunnel were going back eddie lets hope we can no we wont rebuild the tunnel theres no way to do it now but the old grade that crossed the rockies is still there it can be reclaimed only it will be hard to get the rail for it and the men to do it particularly the men he knew as he had known from the first that she had seen his tears and that she had not walked past in indifference even though her clear toneless voice and unmoving face gave him no sign of feeling there was some quality in her manner which he sensed but could not translate yet the feeling it gave him translated was as if she were saying to him i know i understand i would feel compassion and gratitude if we were alive and free to feel but were not are we eddiewere on a dead planet like the moon where we must move but dare not stop for a breath of feeling or well discover that there is no air to breathe we have today and tomorrow to get things started she said ill leave for colorado tomorrow night if you want to fly ill have to rent a plane for you somewhere yours is still in the shops they cant get the parts for it no ill go by rail i have to see the line ill take tomorrows comet it was two hours later in a brief pause between longdistance phone calls that she asked him suddenly the first question which did not pertain to the railroad what have they done to hank rearden eddie caught himself in the small evasion of looking away forced his glance back to meet hers and answered he gave in he signed their gift certificate at the last moment oh the sound conveyed no shock or censure it was merely a vocal punctuation mark denoting the acceptance of a fact have you heard from quentin daniels no he sent no letter or message for me no he guessed the thing she feared and it reminded him of a matter he had not reported dagny theres another problem thats been growing all over the system since you left since may first its the frozen trains the what weve had trains abandoned on the line on some passing track in the middle of nowhere usually at nightwith the entire crew gone they just leave the train and vanish theres never any warning given or any special reason its more like an epidemic it hits the men suddenly and they go its been happening on other railroads too nobody can explain it but i think that everybody understands its the directive thats doing it its our mens form of protest they try to go on and then they suddenly reach a moment when they cant take it any longer what can we do about it he shrugged oh well who is john galt she nodded thoughtfully she did not look astonished the telephone rang and the voice of her secretary said mr wesley mouch calling from washington miss taggart her lips stiffened a little as at the unexpected touch of an insect it must be for my brother she said no miss taggart for you all right put him on miss taggart said the voice of wesley mouch in the tone of a cocktailparty host i was so glad to hear youve regained your health that i wanted to welcome you back in person i know that your health required a long rest and i appreciate the patriotism that made you cut your leave of absence short in this terrible emergency i wanted to assure you that you can count on our cooperation in any step you now find it necessary to take our fullest cooperation assistance and support if there are any special exceptions you might require please feel certain that they can be granted she let him speak even though he had made several small pauses inviting an answer when his pause became long enough she said i would be much obliged if you would let me speak to mr weatherby why of course miss taggart any time you wish why that is do you mean now yes right now he understood but he said yes miss taggart when mr weatherbys voice came on the wire it sounded cautious yes miss taggart of what service can i be to you you can tell your boss that if he doesnt want me to quit again as he knows i did he is never to call me or speak to me anything your gang has to tell me let them send you to tell it ill speak to you but not to him you may tell him that my reason is what he did to hank rearden when he was on reardens payroll if everybody else has forgotten it i havent it is my duty to assist the nations railroads at any time miss taggart mr weatherby sounded as if he were trying to avoid the commitment of having heard what he had heard but a sudden note of interest crept into his voice as he asked slowly thoughtfully with guarded shrewdness am i to understand miss taggart that it is your wish to deal exclusively with me in all official matters may i take this as your policy she gave a brief harsh chuckle go ahead she said you may list me as your exclusive property use me as a special item of pull and trade me all over washington but i dont know what good that will do you because im not going to play the game im not going to trade favors im simply going to start breaking your laws right nowand you can arrest me when you feel that you can afford to i believe that you have an oldfashioned idea about law miss taggart why speak of rigid unbreakable laws our modern laws are elastic and open to interpretation according to circumstances then start being elastic right now because im not and neither are railroad catastrophes she hung up and said to eddie in the tone of an estimate passed on physical objects theyll leave us alone for a while she did not seem to notice the changes in her office the absence of nat taggarts portrait the new glass coffee table where mr locey had spread for the benefit of visitors a display of the loudest humanitarian magazines with titles of articles headlined on their covers she heardwith the attentive look of a machine equipped to record not to reacteddies account of what one month had done to the railroad she heard his report on what he guessed about the causes of the catastrophe she faced with the same look of detachment a succession of men who went in and out of her office with over hurried steps and hands fumbling in superfluous gestures he thought that she had become impervious to anything but suddenlywhile pacing the office dictating to him a list of tracklaying materials and where to obtain them illegallyshe stopped and looked down at the magazines on the coffee table their headlines said the new social conscience our duty to the underprivileged need versus greed with a single movement of her arm the abrupt explosive movement of sheer physical brutality such as he had never seen from her before she swept the magazines off the table and went on her voice reciting a list of figures without a break as if there were no connection between her mind and the violence of her body late in the afternoon finding a moment alone in her office she telephoned hank rearden she gave her name to his secretaryand she heard in the way he said it the haste with which he had seized the receiver dagny hello hank im back where in my office she heard the things he did not say in the moments silence on the wire then he said suppose id better start bribing people at once to get the ore to start pouring rail for you yes as much of it as you can it doesnt have to be rearden metal it can be the break in her voice was almost too brief to notice but what it held was the thought rearden metal rail for going back to the time before heavy steelperhaps back to the time of wooden rails with strips of iron it can be steel any weight anything you can give me all right dagny do you know that ive surrendered rearden metal to them ive signed the gift certificate yes i know ive given in who am i to blame you havent i he did not answer and she said hank i dont think they care whether theres a train or a blast furnace left on earth we do theyre holding us by our love of it and well go on paying so long as theres still one chance left to keep one single wheel alive and moving in token of human intelligence well go on holding it afloat like our drowning child and when the flood swallows it well go down with the last wheel and the last syllogism i know what were paying butprice is no object any longer i know dont be afraid for me hank ill be all right by tomorrow morning ill never be afraid for you darling ill see you tonight chapter ix the face without pain or fear or guilt the silence of her apartment and the motionless perfection of objects that had remained just as she had left them a month before struck her with a sense of relief and desolation together when she entered her living room the silence gave her an illusion of privacy and ownership the sight of the objects reminded her that they were preserving a moment she could not recapture as she could not undo the events that had happened since there was still a remnant of daylight beyond the windows she had left the office earlier than she intended unable to summon the effort for any task that could be postponed till morning this was new to her and it was new that she should now feel more at home in her apartment than in her office she took a shower and stood for long blank minutes letting the water run over her body but stepped out hastily when she realized that what she wanted to wash off was not the dust of the drive from the country but the feel of the office she dressed lighted a cigarette and walked into the living room to stand at the window looking at the city as she had stood looking at the countryside at the start of this day she had said she would give her life for one more year on the railroad she was back but this was not the joy of working it was only the clear cold peace of a decision reachedand the stillness of unadmitted pain clouds had wrapped the sky and had descended as fog to wrap the streets below as if the sky were engulfing the city she could see the whole of manhattan island a long triangular shape cutting into an invisible ocean it looked like the prow of a sinking ship a few tall buildings still rose above it like funnels but the rest was disappearing under grayblue coils going down slowly into vapor and space this was how they had goneshe thoughtatlantis the city that sank into the ocean and all the other kingdoms that vanished leaving the same legend in all the languages of men and the same longing she feltas she had felt it one spring night slumped across her desk in the crumbling office of the john galt line by a window facing a dark alleythe sense and vision of her own world which she would never reach youshe thoughtwhoever you are whom have always loved and never found you whom i expected to see at the end of the rails beyond the horizon you whose presence i had always felt in the streets of the city and whose world i had wanted to build it is my love for you that had kept me moving my love and my hope to reach you and my wish to be worthy of you on the day when i would stand before you face to face now i know that i shall never find youthat it is not to be reached or livedbut what is left of my life is still yours and i will go on in your name even though it is a name ill never learn i will go on serving you even though im never to win i will go on to be worthy of you on the day when i would have met you even though i wont she had never accepted hopelessness but she stood at the window and addressed to the shape of a fogbound city it was her selfdedication to unrequited love the doorbell rang she turned with indifferent astonishment to open the doorbut she knew that she should have expected him when she saw that it was francisco danconia she felt no shock and no rebellion only the cheerless serenity of her assuranceand she raised her head to face him with a slow deliberate movement as if telling him that she had chosen her stand and that she stood in the open his face was grave and calm the look of happiness was gone but the amusement of the playboy had not returned he looked as if all masks were down he looked direct tightly disciplined intent upon a purpose he looked like a man able to know the earnestness of action as she had once expected him to lookhe had never seemed so attractive as he did in this momentand she noted in astonishment her sudden feeling that he was not a man who had deserted her but a man whom she had deserted dagny are you able to talk about it now yesif you wish come in he glanced briefly at her living room her home which he had never entered then his eyes came back to her he was watching her attentively he seemed to know that the quiet simplicity of her manner was the worst of all signs for his purpose that it was like a spread of ashes where no flicker of pain could be revived that even pain would have been a form of fire sit down francisco she remained standing before him as if consciously letting him see that she had nothing to hide not even the weariness of her posture the price she had paid for this day and her carelessness of price i dont think i can stop you now he said if youve made your choice but if theres one chance left to stop you its a chance i have to take she shook her head slowly there isnt andwhat for francisco youve given up what difference does it make to you whether i perish with the railroad or away from it i havent given up the future what future the day when the looters will perish but we wont if taggart transcontinental is to perish with the looters then so am i he did not take his eyes off her face and he did not answer she added dispassionately i thought i could live without it i cant ill never try it again francisco do you rememberwe both believed when we started that the only sin on earth was to do things badly i still believe it the first note of life shuddered in her voice i cant stand by and watch what they did at that tunnel i cant accept what theyre all acceptingfrancisco its the thing we thought so monstrous you and ithe belief that disasters are ones natural fate to be borne not fought i cant accept submission i cant accept helplessness i cant accept renunciation so long as theres a railroad left to run ill run it in order to maintain the looters world in order to maintain the last strip of mine dagny he said slowly i know why one loves ones work i know what it means to you the job of running trains but you would not run them if they were empty dagny what is it you see when you think of a moving train she glanced at the city the life of a man of ability who might have perished in that catastrophe but will escape the next one which ill preventa man who has an intransigent mind and an unlimited ambition and is in love with his own life the kind of man who is what we were when we started you and i you gave him up i cant he closed his eyes for an instant and the tightening movement of his mouth was a smile a smile substituting for a moan of understanding amusement and pain he asked his voice gravely gentle do you think that you can still serve himthat kind of manby running the railroad yes all right dagny i wont try to stop you so long as you still think that nothing can stop you or should you will stop on the day when youll discover that your work has been placed in the service not of that mans life but of his destruction francisco it was a cry of astonishment and despair you do understand it you know what i mean by that kind of man you see him too oh yes he said simply casually looking at some point in space within the room almost as if he were seeing a real person he added why should you be astonished you said that we were of his kind once you and i we still are but one of us has betrayed him yes she said sternly one of us has we cannot serve him by renunciation we cannot serve him by making terms with his destroyers im not making terms with them they need me they know it its my terms that ill make them accept by playing a game in which they gain benefits in exchange for harming you if i can keep taggart transcontinental in existence its the only benefit i want what do i care if they make me pay ransoms let them have what they want ill have the railroad he smiled do you think so do you think that their need of you is your protection do you think that you can give them what they want no you wont quit until you see of your own sight and judgment what it is that they really want you know dagny we were taught that some things belong to god and others to caesar perhaps their god would permit it but the man you say were servinghe docs not permit it he permits no divided allegiance no war between your mind and your body no gulf between your values and your actions no tributes to caesar he permits no caesars for twelve years she said softly i would have thought it inconceivable that there might come a day when i would have to beg your forgiveness on my knees now i think its possible if i come to see that youre right i will but not until then you will but not on your knees he was looking at her as if he were seeing her body as she stood before him even though his eyes were directed at her face and his glance told her what form of atonement and surrender he was seeing in the future she saw the effort he made to look away his hope that she had not seen his glance or understood it his silent struggle betrayed by the tension of a few muscles under the skin of his facethe face she knew so well until then dagny remember that were enemies i didnt want to tell you this but youre the first person who almost stepped into heaven and came back to earth youve glimpsed too much so you have to know this clearly its you that im fighting not your brother james or wesley mouch its you that i have to defeat i am out to end all the things that are most precious to you right now while youll struggle to save taggart transcontinental i will be working to destroy it dont ever ask me for help or money you know my reasons now you may hate meas from your stand you should she raised her head a little there was no perceptible change in her posture it was no more than her awareness of her own body and of its meaning to him but for the length of one sentence she stood as a woman the suggestion of defiance coming only from the faintly stressed spacing of her words and what will it do to you he looked at her in full understanding but neither admitting nor denying the confession she wanted to tear from him that is no ones concern but mine he answered it was she who weakened but realized while saying it that this was still more cruel i dont hate you ive tried to for years but i never will no matter what we do either one of us i know it he said his voice low so that she did not hear the pain but felt it within herself as if by direct reflection from him francisco she cried in desperate defense of him against herself how can you do what youre doing by the grace of my lovefor you said his eyesfor the man said his voice who did not perish in your catastrophe and who will never perish she stood silently still for a moment as if in respectful acknowledgment i wish i could spare you what youre going to go through he said the gentleness of his voice saying its not me that you should pity but i cant every one of us has to travel that road by his own steps but its the same road where does it lead he smiled as if softly closing a door on the questions that he would not answer to atlantis he said what she asked startled dont you rememberthe lost city that only the spirits of heroes can enter the connection that struck her suddenly had been struggling in her mind since morning like a dim anxiety she had had no time to identify she had known it but she had thought only of his own fate and his personal decision she had thought of him as acting alone now she remembered a wider danger and sensed the vast undefined shape of the enemy she was facing youre one of them she said slowly arent you of whom was it you in ken danaggers office he smiled no but she noted that he did not ask what she meant is thereyou would know itis there actually a destroyer loose in the world of course who is it you she shrugged her face was growing hard the men whove quit are they still alive or dead theyre deadas far as youre concerned but theres to be a second renaissance in the world ill wait for it no the sudden violence of her voice was in personal answer to him to one of the two things he had wanted her to hear in his words no dont wait for me ill always wait for you no matter what we do either one of us the sound they heard was the turning of a key in the lock of the entrance door the door opened and hank rearden came in he stopped briefly on the threshold then walked slowly into the living room his hand slipping the key into his pocket she knew that he had seen franciscos face before he had seen hers he glanced at her but his eyes came back to francisco as if this were the only face he was now able to see it was at franciscos face that she was afraid to look the effort she made to pull her glance along the curve of a few steps felt as if she were pulling a weight beyond her power francisco had risen to his feet as if in the unhurried automatic manner of a danconia trained to the code of courtesy there was nothing that rearden could see in his face but what she saw in it was worse than she had feared what are you doing here asked rearden in the tone one would use to address a menial caught in a drawing room i see that i have no right to ask you the same question said francisco she knew what effort was required to achieve the clear toneless quality of his voice his eyes kept returning to reardens right hand as if he were still seeing the key between his fingers then answer it said rearden hank any questions you wish to ask should be asked of me she said rearden did not seem to see or hear her answer it he repeated there is only one answer which you would have the right to demand said francisco so i will answer you that that is not the reason of my presence here there is only one reason for your presence in the house of any woman said rearden and i mean any womanas far as youre concerned do you think that i believe it now that confession of yours or anything you ever said to me i have given you grounds not to trust me but none to include miss taggart dont tell me that you have no chance here never had and never will i know it but that i should find you here on the first hank if you wish to accuse me she began but rearden whirled to her god no dagny i dont but you shouldnt be seen speaking to him you shouldnt deal with him in any way you dont know him i do he turned to francisco what are you after are you hoping to include her among your kind of conquests or no it was an involuntary cry and it sounded futile with its passionate sincerity offeredto be rejectedas its only proof no then are you here on a matter of business are you setting a trap as you did for me what sort of doublecross are you preparing for her my purpose was not a matter of business then what was it if you still care to believe me i can tell you only that it involved no betrayal of any kind do you think that you may still discuss betrayal in my presence i will answer you some day i cannot answer you now you dont like to be reminded of it do you youve stayed away from me since havent you you didnt expect to see me here you didnt want to face me but he knew that francisco was facing him as no one else did these dayshe saw the eyes held straight to meet his the features composed without emotion without defense or appeal set to endure whatever was cominghe saw the open unprotected look of couragethis was the face of the man he had loved the man who had set him free of guiltand he found himself fighting against the knowledge that this face still held him above all else above his month of impatience for the sight of dagny why dont you defend yourself if you have nothing to hide why are you here why were you stunned to see me enter hank stop it dagnys voice was a cry and she drew back knowing that violence was the most dangerous element to introduce into this moment both men turned to her please let me be the one to answer francisco said quietly i told you that i hoped id never see him again said rearden im sorry if it has to be here it doesnt concern you but theres something he must be paid for if that is your purpose francisco said with effort havent you achieved it already whats the matter reardens face was frozen his lips barely moving but his voice had the sound of a chuckle is this your way of asking for mercy the instant of silence was franciscos strain to a greater effort yes if you wish he answered did you grant it when you held my future in your hands you are justified in anything you wish to think of me but since it doesnt concern miss taggart would you now permit me to leave no do you want to evade it like all those other cowards do you want to escape i will come anywhere you require any time you wish but i would rather it were not in miss taggarts presence why not i want it to be in her presence since this is the one place you had no right to come i have nothing left to protect from you youve taken more than the looters can ever take youve destroyed everything youve touched but here is one thing youre not going to touch he knew that the rigid absence of emotion in franciscos face was the strongest evidence of emotion the evidence of some abnormal effort at controlhe knew that this was torture and that he rearden was driven blindly by a feeling which resembled a torturers enjoyment except that he was now unable to tell whether he was torturing francisco or himself youre worse than the looters because you betray with full understanding of that which youre betraying i dont know what form of corruption is your motivebut i want you to learn that there are things beyond your reach beyond your aspiration or your malice you have nothing to fear from me now i want you to learn that you are not to think of her not to look at her not to approach her of all men its you whore not to appear in her presence he knew that he was driven by a desperate anger at his own feeling for this man that the feeling still lived that it was this feeling which he had to outrage and destroy whatever your motive its from any contact with you that she has to be protected ie i gave you my word he stopped rearden chuckled i know what they mean your words your convictions your friendship and your oath by the only woman you ever he stopped they all knew what this meant in the same instant that rearden knew it he made a step toward francisco he asked pointing at dagny his voice low and strangely unlike his own voice as if it neither came from nor were addressed to a living person is this the woman you love francisco closed his eyes dont ask him that the cry was dagnys is this the woman you love francisco answered looking at her yes reardens hand rose swept down and slapped franciscos face the scream came from dagny when she could see againafter an instant that felt as if the blow had struck her own cheekfranciscos hands were the first thing she saw the heir of the danconias stood thrown back against a table clasping the edge behind him not to support himself but to stop his own hands she saw the rigid stillness of his body a body that was pulled too straight but seemed broken with the slight unnatural angles of his waistline and shoulders with his arms held stiff but slanted backhe stood as if the effort not to move were turning the force of his violence against himself as if the motion he resisted were running through his muscles as a tearing pain she saw his convulsed fingers struggling to grow fast to the tables edge she wondered which would break first the wood of the table or the bones of the man and she knew that reardens life hung in the balance when her eyes moved up to franciscos face she saw no sign of struggle only the skin of his temples pulled tight and the planes of his cheeks drawn inward seeming faintly more hollow than usual it made his face look naked pure and young she felt terror because she was seeing in his eyes the tears which were not there his eyes were brilliant and dry he was looking at rearden but it was not rearden that he was seeing he looked as if he were facing another presence in the room and as if his glance were saying if this is what you demand of me then even this is yours yours to accept and mine to endure there is no more than this in me to offer you but let me be proud to know that i can offer so much she sawwith a single artery beating under the skin of his throat with a froth of pink in the corner of his mouththe look of an enraptured dedication which was almost a smile and she knew that she was witnessing francisco danconias greatest achievement when she felt herself shaking and heard her own voice it seemed to meet the last echo of her scream in the air of the roomand she realized how brief a moment had passed between her voice had the savage sound of rising to deliver a blow and it was crying to rearden to protect me from him long before you ever dont franciscos head jerked to her the brief snap of his voice held all of his unreleased violence and she knew it was an order that had to be obeyed motionless but for the slow curve of his head francisco turned to rearden she saw his hands leave the edge of the table and hang relaxed by his sides it was rearden that he was now seeing and there was nothing in franciscos face except the exhaustion of effort but rearden knew suddenly how much this man had loved him within the extent of your knowledge francisco said quietly you are right neither expecting nor permitting an answer he turned to leave he bowed to dagny inclining his head in a manner that appeared as a simple gesture of leavetaking to rearden as a gesture of acceptance to her then he left rearden stood looking after him knowingwithout context and with absolute certaintythat he would give his life for the power not to have committed the action he had committed when he turned to dagny his face looked drained open and faintly attentive as if he were not questioning her about the words she had cut off but were waiting for them to come a shudder of pity ran through her body and ended in the movement of shaking her head she did not know for which of the two men the pity was intended but it made her unable to speak and she shook her head over and over again as if trying desperately to negate some vast impersonal suffering that had made them all its victims if theres something that must be said say it his voice was toneless the sound she made was halfchuckle halfmoanit was not a desire for vengeance but a desperate sense of justice that drove the cutting bitterness of her voice as she cried consciously throwing the words at his face you wanted to know the name of that other man the man i slept with the man who had me first it was francisco danconia she saw the force of the blow by seeing his face swept blank she knew that if justice was her purpose she had achieved itbecause this slap was worse than the one he had dealt she felt suddenly calm knowing that her words had had to be said for the sake of all three of them the despair of a helpless victim left her she was not a victim any longer she was one of the contestants willing to bear the responsibility of action she stood facing him waiting for any answer he would choose to give her feeling almost as if it were her turn to be subjected to violence she did not know what form of torture he was enduring or what he saw being wrecked within him and kept himself the only one to see there was no sign of pain to give her any warning he looked as if he were just a man who stood still in the middle of a room making his consciousness absorb a fact that it refused to absorb then she noticed that he did not change his posture that even his hands hung by his sides with the fingers halfbent as they had been for a long time it seemed to her that she could feel the heavy numbness of the blood stopping in his fingersand this was the only clue to his suffering she was able to find but it told her that that which he felt left him no power to feel anything else not even the existence of his own body she waited her pity vanishing and becoming respect then she saw his eyes move slowly from her face down the length of her body and she knew the sort of torture he was now choosing to experience because it was a glance of a nature he could not hide from her she knew that he was seeing her as she had been at seventeen he was seeing her with the rival he hated he was seeing them together as they would be now a sight he could neither endure nor resist she saw the protection of control dropping from his face but he did not care whether he let her see his face alive and naked because there now was nothing to read in it except an unrevealing violence some part of which resembled hatred he seized her shoulders and she felt prepared to accept that he would now kill her or beat her into unconsciousness and in the moment when she felt certain that he had thought of it she felt her body thrown against him and his mouth falling on hers more brutally than the act of a beating would have permitted she found herself in terror twisting her body to resist and in exultation twisting her arms around him holding him letting her lips bring blood to his knowing that she had never wanted him as she did in this moment when he threw her down on the couch she knew to the rhythm of the beat of his body that it was the act of his victory over his rival and of his surrender to him the act of ownership brought to unendurable violence by the thought of the man whom it was defying the act of transforming his hatred for the pleasure that man had known into the intensity of his own pleasure his conquest of that man by means of her bodyshe felt franciscos presence through reardens mind she felt as if she were surrendering to both men to that which she had worshipped in both of them that which they held in common that essence of character which had made of her love for each an act of loyalty to both she knew also that this was his rebellion against the world around them against its worship of degradation against the long torment of his wasted days and lightless strugglethis was what he wished to assert and alone with her in the halfdarkness high in space above a city of ruins to hold as the last of his property afterwards they lay still his face on her shoulder the reflection of a distant electric sign kept beating in faint flashes on the ceiling above her head he reached for her hand and slipped her fingers under his face to let his mouth rest against her palm for a moment so gently that she felt his motive more than his touch after a while she got up she reached for a cigarette lighted it then held it out to him with a slight questioning lift of her hand he nodded still sitting halfstretched on the couch she placed the cigarette between his lips and lighted another for herself she felt a great sense of peace between them and the intimacy of the unimportant gestures underscored the importance of the things they were not saying to each other everything was said she thoughtbut knew that it waited to be acknowledged she saw his eyes move to the entrance door once in a while and remain on it for long moments as if he were still seeing the man who had left he said quietly he could have beaten me by letting me have the truth any time he wished why didnt he she shrugged spreading her hands in a gesture of helpless sadness because they both knew the answer she asked he did mean a great deal to you didnt he he does the two dots of fire at the tips of their cigarettes had moved slowly to the tips of their fingers with the small glow of an occasional flare and the soft crumbling of ashes as sole movement in the silence when the doorbell rang they knew that it was not the man they wished but could not hope to see return and she frowned with sudden anger as she went to open the door it took her a moment to remember that the innocuously courteous figure she saw bowing to her with a standard smile of welcome was the assistant manager of the apartment house good evening miss taggart were so glad to see you back i just came on duty and heard that you had returned and wanted to greet you in person thank you she stood at the door not moving to admit him i have a letter that came for you about a week ago miss taggart he said reaching into his pocket it looked as if it might be important but being marked personal it was obviously not intended to be sent to your office and besides they did not know your address eitherso not knowing where to forward it i kept it in our safe and i thought id deliver it to you in person the envelope he handed to her was marked registeredair mail special deliverypersonal the return address said quentin daniels utah institute of technology afton utah oh thank you the assistant manager noted that her voice went dropping toward a whisper the polite disguise for a gasp he noted that she stood looking down at the senders name much longer than was necessary so he repeated his good wishes and departed she was tearing the envelope open as she walked toward rearden and she stopped in the middle of the room to read the letter it was typewritten on thin paperhe could see the black rectangles of the paragraphs through the transparent sheetsand he could see her face as she read them he expected it by the time he saw her come to the end she leaped to the telephone he heard the violent whirl of the dial and her voice saying with trembling urgency longdistance please operator get me the utah institute of technology at afton utah he asked approaching what is it she extended the letter not looking at him her eyes fixed on the telephone as if she could force it to answer the letter said dear miss taggart i have fought it out for three weeks i did not want to do it i know how this will hit you and i know every argument you could offer me because i have used them all against myselfbut this is to tell you that i am quitting i cannot work under the terms of directive though not for the reason its perpetrators intended i know that their abolition of all scientific research does not mean a damn to you or me and that you would want me to continue but i have to quit because i do not wish to succeed any longer i do not wish to work in a world that regards me as a slave i do not wish to be of any value to people if i succeeded in rebuilding the motor i would not let you place it in their service i would not take it upon my conscience that anything produced by my mind should be used to bring them comfort i know that if we succeed they will be only too eager to expropriate the motor and for the sake of that prospect we have to accept the position of criminals you and i and live under the threat of being arrested at any moment at their whim and this is the thing that i cannot take even were i able to take all the rest that in order to give them an inestimable benefit we should be made martyrs to the men who but for us could not have conceived of it i might have forgiven the rest but when i think of this i say may they be damned i will see them all die of starvation myself included rather than forgive them for this or permit it to tell you the full truth i want to succeed to solve the secret of the motor as much as ever so i shall continue to work on it for my own sole pleasure and for as long as i last but if i solve it it will remain my private secret i will not release it for any commercial use therefore i cannot take your money any longer commercialism is supposed to be despicable so all those people should truly approve of my decision and iim tired of helping those who despise me i dont know how long i will last or what i will do in the future for the moment i intend to remain in my job at this institute but if any of its trustees or receivers should remind me that i am now legally forbidden to cease being a janitor i will quit you had given me my greatest chance and if i am now giving you a painful blow perhaps t should ask you to forgive me i think that you love your work as much as i loved mine so you will know that my decision was not easy to make but that i had to make it it is a strange feelingwriting this letter i do not intend to die but i am giving up the world and this feels like the letter of a suicide so i want to say that of all the people i have known you are the only person i regret leaving behind sincerely yours quentin daniels when he looked up from the letter he heard her saying as he had heard her through the words of the typewritten lines her voice rising closer to despair each time keep ringing operator please keep ringing what can you tell him he asked there are no arguments to offer i wont have a chance to tell him hes gone by now it was a week ago im sure hes gone theyve got him who got him yes operator ill hold the line keep trying what would you tell him if he answered id beg him to go on taking my money with no strings attached no conditions just so hell have the means to continue ill promise him that if were still in a looters world when and if he succeeds i wont ask him to give me the motor or even to tell me its secret but if by that time were free she stopped if were free all i want from him now is that he doesnt give up and vanish like like all those others i dont want to let them get him if its not too lateoh god i dont want them to get him yes operator keep ringing what good will it do us even if he continues to work thats all ill beg him to dojust to continue maybe well never get a chance to use the motor in the future but i want to know that somewhere in the world theres still a great brain at work on a great attemptand that we still have a chance at a future if that motor is abandoned again then theres nothing but starnesville ahead of us yes i know she held the receiver pressed to her ear her arm stiff with the effort not to tremble she waited and he heard in the silence the futile clicking of the unanswered call hes gone she said they got him a week is much longer than they need i dont know how they learn when the time is right but this she pointed at the letterthis was their time and they wouldnt have missed it who the destroyers agents are you beginning to think that they really exist yes are you serious i am ive met one of them who ill tell you later i dont know who their leader is but im going to find out one of these days im going to find out ill be damned if i let them she broke off on a gasp he saw the change in her face the moment before he heard the click of a distant receiver being lifted and the sound of a mans voice saying across the wire hello daniels is that you youre alive youre still there why yes is this you miss taggart whats the matter i i thought you were gone oh im sorry i just heard the phone ringing i was out in the back lot gathering carrots carrots she was laughing with hysterical relief i have my own vegetable patch out there used to be the institutes parking lot are you calling from new york miss taggart yes i just

picked it up again in the same sweep of her hand and rapidly dialed a number eddie have them hold the comet for me yes tonights comet give orders to have my car attached then come here to my place at once she glanced at her watch its eighttwelve i have an hour to make it i dont think ill hold them up too long ill talk to you while i pack she hung up and turned to rearden tonight he said i have to

when you get there will you if it looks as if its going to be long ill join you there this was the only expression he could give to the words he had desperately wished to say to her had waited for had come here to say and now wished to pronounce more than ever but knew that it must not be said tonight she knew by a faint solemn stress in the tone of his voice that this was his acceptance of her confession his surrender his forgiveness she asked can you leave the mills it will take me a few days to arrange but i can he knew what her words were admitting acknowledging and forgiving him when she said hank why dont you meet me in colorado in a week if you fly your plane well both get there at the same time and then well come back together all right dearest she dictated a list of instructions while pacing her bedroom gathering her clothes hastily packing a suitcase rearden had left eddie willers sat at her dressing table making notes he seemed to work in his usual manner of unquestioning efficiency as if he were not aware of the perfume bottles and powder boxes as if the dressing table were a desk and the room were only an office ill phone you from chicago omaha flagstaff and afton she said tossing underwear into the suitcase if you need me in between call any operator along the line with orders to flag the train the comet he asked mildly hell yesthe comet okay dont hesitate to call if you have to okay but i dont think ill have to well manage well work by longdistance phone just as we did when we she stopped when we were building the john galt line he asked quietly they glanced at each other but said nothing else whats the latest report on the construction crews she asked everythings under way i got word just after you left the office that the grading gangs have startedout of laurel kansas and out of jasper oklahoma the rail is on its way to them from silver springs it will be all right the hardest thing to find wasm the men yes the men to

know hed have reason to hate our guts but what does it matter now i found himhes living on a ranch out in arizona i phoned him myself and i begged him to save us just to take charge for one night of building five and a half miles of track five and a half miles dagny that were stuck withand hes the greatest railroad builder living i told him that i was asking him to do it as a gesture of charity to us if he would you know i think he understood me he wasnt angry he sounded sad but he wouldnt do it he said one must not try to bring people back out of the grave he wished me luck i think he meant it you know i dont think hes one of those that the destroyer knocked out i think he just broke by himself yes i know he did eddie saw the expression on her face and pulled himself up hastily oh we finally found a man to put in charge at elgin he said forcing his voice to sound confident dont worry the track will be built long before you get there she glanced at him with the faint suggestion of a smile thinking of how often she had said these words to him and of the desperate bravery with which he was now trying to tell her dont worry he caught her glance he understood and the answering hint of his smile had a touch of embarrassed apology he turned back to his note pad feeling anger at himself sensing that he had broken his own unstated commandment dont make it harder for her he should not have told her about dan conway he thought he should not have said anything to remind them both of the despair they would feel if they felt he wondered what was the matter with him he thought it inexcusable that he should find his discipline slipping just because this was a room not an office she went on speakingand he listened looking down at his pad making a brief notation once in a while he did not permit himself to look at her again she threw the door of her closet open jerked a suit off a hanger and folded it rapidly while her voice went on with unhurried precision he did not look up he was aware of her only by means of sound the sound of the swift movements and of the measured voice he knew what was wrong with him he thought he did not want her to leave he did not want to lose her again after so brief a moment of reunion but to indulge any personal loneliness at a time when he knew how desperately the railroad needed her in colorado was an act of disloyalty he had never committed beforeand he felt a vague desolate sense of guilt send out orders that the comet is to stop at every division point she said and that all division superintendents are to prepare for me a report on he glanced upthen his glance stopped and he did not hear the rest of the words he saw a mans dressing gown hanging on the back of the open closet door a dark blue gown with the white initials hr on its breast pocket he remembered where he had seen that gown before he remembered the man facing him across a breakfast table in the waynefalkland hotel he remembered that man coming unannounced to her office late on a thanksgiving nightand the realization that he should have known it came to him as two subterranean jolts of a single earthquake it came with a feeling that screamed no so savagely that the scream not the sight brought down every girder within him it was not the shock of the discovery but the more terrible shock of what it made him discover about himself he hung on to a single thought that he must not let her see what he had noticed or what it had done to him he felt a sensation of embarrassment magnified to the point of physical torture it was the dread of violating her privacy twice by learning her secret and by revealing his own he bent lower over the note pad and concentrated on an immediate purpose to stop his pencil from shaking fifty miles of mountain trackage to build and we can count on nothing but whatever material we own i beg your pardon he said his voice barely audible i didnt hear what you said i said i want a report from all superintendents on every foot of rail and every piece of equipment available on their divisions okay i will confer with each one of them in turn have them meet me in my car aboard the comet okay send word outunofficiallythat the engineers are to make up time for the stops by going seventy eighty a hundred miles an hour anything they wish as and when they need to and that i will eddie yes okay eddie whats the matter he had to look up to face her and desperately to lie for the first time in his life im im afraid of the trouble well get into with the law he said forget it dont you see that there isnt any law left anything goes now for whoever can get away with itand for the moment its we whore setting the terms when she was ready he carried her suitcase to a taxicab then down the platform of the taggart terminal to her office car the last at the end of the comet he stood on the platform saw the train jerk forward and watched the red markers on the back of her car slipping slowly away from him into the long darkness of the exit tunnel when they were gone he felt what one feels at the loss of a dream one had not known till after it was lost there were few people on the platform around him and they seemed to move with selfconscious strain as if a sense of disaster clung to the rails and to the girders above their heads he thought indifferently that after a century of safety men were once more regarding the departure of a train as an event involving a gamble with death he remembered that he had had no dinner and he felt no desire to eat but the underground cafeteria of the taggart terminal was more truly his home than the empty cube of space he now thought of as his apartmentso he walked to the cafeteria because he had no other place to go the cafeteria was almost desertedbut the first thing he saw as he entered was a thin column of smoke rising from the cigarette of the worker who sat alone at a table in a dark corner not noticing what he put on his tray eddie carried it to the workers table said hello sat down and said nothing else he looked at the silverware spread before him wondered about its purpose remembered the use of a fork and attempted to perform the motions of eating but found that it was beyond his power after a while he looked up and saw that the workers eyes were studying him attentively no said eddie no theres nothing the matter with me oh yes a lot has happened but what difference does it make now yes shes back what else do you want me to say about it how did you know shes back oh well i suppose the whole company knew it within the first ten minutes no i dont know whether im glad that shes back sure shell save the railroadfor another year or month what do you want me to say no she didnt she didnt tell me what shes counting on she didnt tell me what she thought or felt well how do you suppose shed feel its hell for herall right for me too only my kind of hell is my own fault no nothing i cant talk about ittalki mustnt even think about it ive got to stop it stop thinking of her andof her i mean he remained silent and he wondered why the workers eyesthe eyes that always seemed to see everything within himmade him feel uneasy tonight he glanced down at the table and he noticed the butts of many cigarettes among the remnants of food on the workers plate are you in trouble too asked eddie oh just that youve sat here for a long time tonight havent you for me why should you have wanted to wait for me you know i never thought you cared whether you saw me or not me or anybody you seemed so complete in yourself and thats why i liked to talk to you because i felt that you always understood but nothing could hurt youyou looked as if nothing had ever hurt youand it made me feel free as if as if there were no pain in the world do you know whats strange about your face you look as if youve never known pain or fear or guilt im sorry im so late tonight i had to see her offshe has just left on the comet yes tonight just now yes shes gone yes it was a sudden decisionwithin the past hour she intended to leave tomorrow night but something unexpected happened and she had to go at once yes shes going to coloradoafterwards to utahfirst because she got a letter from quentin daniels that hes quittingand the one thing she wont give up couldnt stand to give up is the motor you remember the motor i told you about the remnant that she found daniels hes a physicist whos been working for the past year at the utah institute of technology trying to solve the secret of the motor and to rebuild it why do you look at me like that no i havent told you about him before because it was a secret it was a private secret project of her ownand of what interest would it have been to you anyway i guess i can talk about it now because hes quit yes he told her his reasons he said that he wont give anything produced by his mind to a world that regards him as a slave he said that he wont be made a martyr to people in exchange for giving them an inestimable benefit whatwhat are you laughing at stop it will you why do you laugh like that the whole secret what do you mean the whole secret he hasnt found the whole secret of the motor if thats what you meant but he seemed to be doing well he had a good chance now its lost shes rushing to him she wants to plead to hold him to make him go onbut i think its useless once they stop they dont come back again not one of them has no i dont care not any more weve taken so many losses that im getting used to it oh no its not daniels that i cant take itsno drop it dont question me about it the whole world is going to pieces shes still fighting to save it and ii sit here damning her for something i had no right to know no shes done nothing to be damned nothingand besides it doesnt concern the railroad dont pay any attention to me its not true its not her that im damning its myself listen ive always known that you loved taggart transcontinental as i loved it that it meant something special to you something personal and that was why you liked to hear me talk about it but thisthe thing i learned todaythis has nothing to do with the railroad it would be of no importance to you forget it its something that i didnt know about her thats all i grew up with her i thought i knew her i didnt i dont know what it was that i expected i suppose i just thought that she had no private life of any kind to me she was not a person and not not a woman she was the railroad and i didnt think that anyone would ever have the audacity to look at her in any other way well it serves me right forget it forget it i said why do you question me like this its only her private life what can it matter to you drop it for gods sake dont you see that i cant talk about it nothing happened nothings wrong with me i just oh why am i lying i cant lie to you you always seem to see everything its worse than trying to lie to myself i have lied to myself i didnt know what i felt for her the railroad im a rotten hypocrite if the railroad was all she meant to me it wouldnt have hit me like this i wouldnt have felt that i wanted to kill him whats the matter with you tonight why do you look at me like that oh whats the matter with all of us why is there nothing but misery left for anyone why do we suffer so much we werent meant to i always thought that we were to be happy all of us as our natural fate what are we doing what have we lost a year ago i wouldnt have damned her for finding something she wanted but i know that theyre doomed both of them and so am i and so is everybody and she was all i had left it was so great to be alive it was such a wonderful chance i didnt know that i loved it and that that was our love hers and mine and yoursbut the world is perishing and we cannot stop it why are we destroying ourselves who will tell us the truth who will save us oh who is john galt no its no use it doesnt matter now why should i feel anything we wont last much longer why should i care what she does why should i care that shes sleeping with hank rearden oh godwhats the matter with you dont go where are you going chapter x the sign of the dollar she sat at the window of the train her head thrown back not moving wishing she would never have to move again the telegraph poles went racing past the window but the train seemed lost in a void between a brown stretch of prairie and a solid spread of rusty graying clouds the twilight was draining the sky without the wound of a sunset it looked more like the fading of an anemic body in the process of exhausting its last drops of blood and light the train was going west as if it too were pulled to follow the sinking rays and quietly to vanish from the earth she sat still feeling no desire to resist it she wished she would not hear the sound of the wheels they knocked in an even rhythm every fourth knock accentedand it seemed to her that through the rapid running clatter of some futile stampede to escape the beat of the accented knocks was like the steps of an enemy moving toward some inexorable purpose she had never experienced it before this sense of apprehension at the sight of a prairie this feeling that the rail was only a fragile thread stretched across an enormous emptiness like a worn nerve ready to break she had never expected that she who had felt as if she were the motive power aboard a train would now sit wishing like a child or a savage that this train would move that it would not stop that it would get her there on timewishing it not like an act of will but like a plea to a dark unknown she thought of what a difference one month had made she had seen it in the faces of the men at the stations the track workers the switchmen the yardmen who had always greeted her anywhere along the line their cheerful grins boasting that they knew who she washad now looked at her stonily turning away their faces wary and closed she had wanted to cry to them in apology its not i whove done it to youthen had remembered that she had accepted it and that they now had the right to hate her that she was both a slave and a driver of slaves and so was every human being in the country and hatred was the only thing that men could now feel for one another she had found reassurance for two days in the sight of the cities moving past her windowthe factories the bridges the electric signs the billboards pressing down upon the roofs of homesthe crowded grimy active living conflux of the industrial east but the cities had been left behind the train was now diving into the prairies of nebraska the rattle of its couplers sounding as if it were shivering with cold she saw lonely shapes that had been farmhouses in the vacant stretches that had been fields but the great burst of energy in the east generations ago had splattered bright trickles to run through the emptiness some were gone but some still lived she was startled when the lights of a small town swept across her car and vanishing left it darker than it had been before she would not move to turn on the light she sat still watching the rare towns whenever an electric beam went flashing briefly at her face it was like a moments greeting she saw them as they went by written on the walls of modest structures over sooted roofs down slender smokestacks on the curves of tanks reynolds harvestersmacey cementquinlan jones pressed alfalfahome of the crawford mattressbenjamin wylie grain and feedwords raised like flags to the empty darkness of the sky the motionless forms of movement of effort of courage of hope the monuments to how much had been achieved on the edge of natures void by men who had once been free to achieveshe saw the homes built in scattered privacy the small shops the wide streets with electric lighting like a few luminous strokes crisscrossed on the black sheet of the wastelandsshe saw the ghosts between the remnants of towns the skeletons of factories with crumbling smokestacks the corpses of shops with broken panes the slanting poles with shreds of wireshe saw a sudden blaze the rare sight of a gas station a glittering white island of glass and metal under the huge black weight of space and sky she saw an icecream cone made of radiant tubing hanging above the corner of a street and a battered car being parked below with a young boy at the wheel and a girl stepping out her white dress blowing in the summer windshe shuddered for the two of them thinking i cant look at you i who know what it has taken to give you your youth to give you this evening this car and the icecream cone youre going to buy for a quartershe saw on the edge beyond a town a building glowing with tiers of pale blue light the industrial light she loved with the silhouettes of machines in its windows and a billboard in the darkness above its roofand suddenly her head fell on her arm and she sat shaking crying soundlessly to the night to herself to whatever was human in any living being dont let it go dont let it go she jumped to her feet and snapped on the light she stood still fighting to regain control knowing that such moments were her greatest danger the lights of the town were past her window was now an empty rectangle and she heard in the silence the progression of the fourth knocks the steps of the enemy moving on not to be hastened or stopped in desperate need of the sight of some living activity she decided she would not order dinner in her car but would go to the diner as if stressing and mocking her loneliness a voice came back to her mind but you would not run trains if they were empty forget itshe told herself angrily walking hastily to the door of her car she was astonished approaching her vestibule to hear the sound of voices close by as she pulled the door open she heard a shout get off god damn you an aging tramp had taken refuge in the corner of her vestibule he sat on the floor his posture suggesting that he had no strength left to stand up or to care about being caught he was looking at the conductor his eyes observant fully conscious but devoid of any reaction the train was slowing down for a bad stretch of track the conductor had opened the door to a cold gust of wind and was waving at the speeding black void ordering get going get off as you got on or ill kick you off head first there was no astonishment in the tramps face no protest no anger no hope he looked as if he had long since abandoned any judgment of any human action he moved obediently to rise his hand groping upward along the rivets of the cars wall she saw him glance at her and glance away as if she were merely another inanimate fixture of the train he did not seem to be aware of her person any more than of his own he was indifferently ready to comply with an order which in his condition meant certain death she glanced at the conductor she saw nothing in his face except the blind malevolence of pain of some longrepressed anger that broke out upon the first object available almost without consciousness of the objects identity the two men were not human beings to each other any longer the tramps suit was a mass of careful patches on a cloth so stiff and shiny with wear that one expected it to crack like glass if bent but she noticed the collar of his shirt it was bonewhite from repeated laundering and it still preserved a semblance of shape he had pulled himself up to his feet he was looking indifferently at the black hole open upon miles of uninhabited wilderness where no one would see the body or hear the voice of a mangled man but the only gesture of concern he made was to tighten his grip on a small dirty bundle as if to make sure he would not lose it in leaping off the train it was the laundered collar and this gesture for the last of his possessionsthe gesture of a sense of propertythat made her feel an emotion like a sudden burning twist within her wait she said the two men turned to her let him be my guest she said to the conductor and held her door open for the tramp ordering come in the tramp followed her obeying as blankly as he had been about to obey the conductor he stood in the middle of her car holding his bundle looking around him with the same observant unreacting glance sit down she said he obeyedand looked at her as if waiting for further orders there was a kind of dignity in his manner the honesty of the open admission that he had no claim to make no plea to offer no questions to ask that he now had to accept whatever was done to him and was ready to accept it he seemed to be in his early fifties the structure of his bones and the looseness of his suit suggested that he had once been muscular the lifeless indifference of his eyes did not fully hide that they had been intelligent the wrinkles cutting his face with the record of some incredible bitterness had not fully erased the fact that the face had once possessed the kindliness peculiar to honesty when did you eat last she asked yesterday he said and added i think she rang for the porter and ordered dinner for two to be brought to her car from the diner the tramp had watched her silently but when the porter departed he offered the only payment it was in his power to offer i dont want to get you in trouble maam he said she smiled what trouble youre traveling with one of those railroad tycoons arent you no alone then youre the wife of one of them no oh she saw his effort at a look of something like respect as if to make up for having forced an improper confession and she laughed no not that either i guess im one of the tycoons myself my name is dagny taggart and i work for this railroad oh i think ive heard of you maamin the old days it was hard to tell what the old days meant to him whether it was a month or a year or whatever period of time had passed since he had given up he was looking at her with a sort of interest in the past tense as if he were thinking that there had been a time when he would have considered her a personage worth seeing you were the lady who ran a railroad he said yes she said i was he showed no sign of astonishment at the fact that she had chosen to help him he looked as if so much brutality had confronted him that he had given up the attempt to understand to trust or to expect anything when did you get aboard the train she asked back at the division point maam your door wasnt locked he added i figured maybe nobody would notice me till morning on account of it being a private car where are you going i dont know then almost as if he sensed that this could sound too much like an appeal for pity he added i guess i just wanted to keep moving till i saw some place that looked like there might be a chance to find work there this was his attempt to assume the responsibility of a purpose rather than to throw the burden of his aimlessness upon her mercyan attempt of the same order as his shirt collar what kind of work are you looking for people dont look for kinds of work any more maam he answered impassively they just look for work what sort of place did you hope to find oh well where theres factories i guess arent you going in the wrong direction for that the factories are in the east no he said it with the firmness of knowledge there are too many people in the east the factories are too well watched i figured there might be a better chance some place where theres fewer people and less law oh running away a fugitive from the law are you not as youd mean it in the old days maam but as things are now i guess i am i want to work what do you mean there arent any jobs back east and a man couldnt give you a job if he had one to givehed go to jail for it hes watched you cant get work except through the unification board the unification board has a gang of its own friends waiting in line for the jobs more friends than a millionaires got relatives well mei havent got either where did you work last ive been bumming around the country for six monthsno longer i guessi guess its closer to about a yeari cant tell any moremostly day work it was mostly on farms but its getting to be no use now i know how the farmers look at youthey dont like to see a man starving but theyre only one jump ahead of starvation themselves they havent any work to give you they havent any food and whatever they save if the tax collectors dont get it then the raiders doyou know the gangs that rove all through the countrydeserters they call them do you think that its any better in the west no i dont then why are you going there because i havent tried it before thats all there is left to try its somewhere to go just to keep moving you know he added suddenly i dont think it will be any use but theres nothing to do in the east except sit under some hedge and wait to die i dont think id mind it much now the dying i know it would be a lot easier only i think that its a sin to sit down and let your life go without making a try for it she thought suddenly of those modern collegeinfected parasites who assumed a sickening air of moral selfrighteousness whenever they uttered the standard bromides about their concern for the welfare of others the tramps last sentence was one of the most profoundly moral statements she had ever heard but the man did not know it he had said it in his impassive extinguished voice simply dryly as a matter of fact what part of the country do you come from she asked wisconsin he answered the waiter came in bringing their dinner he set a table and courteously moved two chairs showing no astonishment at the nature of the occasion she looked at the table she thought that the magnificence of a world where men could afford the time and the effortless concern for such things as starched napkins and tinkling ice cubes offered to travelers along with their meals for the price of a few dollars was a remnant of the age when the sustenance of ones life had not been made a crime and a meal had not been a matter of running a race with deatha remnant which was soon to vanish like the white filling station on the edge of the weeds of the jungle she noticed that the tramp who had lost the strength to stand up had not lost the respect for the meaning of the things spread before him he did not pounce upon the food he fought to keep his movements slow to unfold his napkin to pick up his fork in tempo with hers his hand shakingas if he still knew that this no matter what indignity was ever forced upon them was the manner proper to men what was your line of workin the old days she asked when the waiter left factories wasnt it yes maam what trade skilled latheoperator where did you work at it last in colorado maam for the hammond car company oh maam no nothing worked there long no maam just two weeks how come well id waited a year for it hanging around colorado just to get that job they had a waiting list too the hammond car company only they didnt go by friendships and they didnt go by seniority they went by a mans record i had a good record but it was just two weeks after i got the job that lawrence hammond quit he quit and disappeared they closed the plant afterwards there was a citizens committee that reopened it i got called back but five days was all it lasted they started layoffs just about at once by seniority so i had to go i heard they lasted for about three months the citizens committee then they had to close the plant for good where did you work before that just about in every eastern state maam but it was never more than a month or two the plants kept closing did that happen on every job youve held he glanced at her as if he understood her question no maam he answered and for the first time she caught a faint echo of pride in his voice the first job i had i held it for twenty years not the same job but the same place i meani got to be shop foreman that was twelve years ago then the owner of the plant died and the heirs who took it over ran it into the ground times were bad then but it was since then that things started going to pieces everywhere faster and faster since then it seems like anywhere i turnedthe place cracked and went at first we thought it was only one state or another a lot of us thought that colorado would last but it went too anything you tried anything you touchedit fell anywhere you looked work was stoppingthe factories were stoppingthe machines were stopping he added slowly in a whisper as if seeing some secret terror of his own the motors were stopping his voice rose oh god who is and broke off john galt she asked yes he said and shook his head as if to dispel some vision only i dont like to say that i dont either i wish i knew why people are saying it and who started it thats it maam thats what im afraid of it might have been me who started it what me or about six thousand others we might have i think we did i hope were wrong what do you mean well there was something that happened at that plant where i worked for twenty years it was when the old man died and his heirs took over there were three of them two sons and a daughter and they brought a new plan to run the factory they let us vote on it too and everybodyalmost everybodyvoted for it we didnt know we thought it was good no thats not true either we thought that we were supposed to think it was good the plan was that everybody in the factory would work according to his ability but would be paid according to his need wewhats the matter maam why do you look like that what was the name of the factory she asked her voice barely audible the twentieth century motor company maam of starnesville wisconsin go on we voted for that plan at a big meeting with all of us present six thousand of us everybody that worked in the factory the starnes heirs made long speeches about it and it wasnt too clear but nobody asked any questions none of us knew just how the plan would work but every one of us thought that the next fellow knew it and if anybody had doubts he felt guilty and kept his mouth shutbecause they made it sound like anyone whod oppose the plan was a child killer at heart and less than a human being they told us that this plan would achieve a noble ideal well how were we to know otherwise hadnt we heard it all our livesfrom our parents and our schoolteachers and our ministers and in every newspaper we ever read and every movie and every public speech hadnt we always been told that this was righteous and just well maybe theres some excuse for what we did at that meeting still we voted for the planand what we got we had it coming to us you know maam we are marked men in a way those of us who lived through the four years of that plan in the twentieth century factory what is it that hell is supposed to be evilplain naked smirking evil isnt it well thats what we saw and helped to makeand i think were damned every one of us and maybe well never be forgiven do you know how it worked that plan and what it did to people try pouring water into a tank where theres a pipe at the bottom draining it out faster than you pour it and each bucket you bring breaks that pipe an inch wider and the harder you work the more is demanded of you and you stand slinging buckets forty hours a week then fortyeight then fiftysixfor your neighbors supperfor his wifes operationfor his childs measlesfor his mothers wheel chair for his uncles shirtfor his nephews schoolingfor the baby next doorfor the baby to be bornfor anyone anywhere around youits theirs to receive from diapers to denturesand yours to work from sunup to sundown month after month year after year with nothing to show for it but your sweat with nothing in sight for you but their pleasure for the whole of your life without rest without hope without end from each according to his ability to each according to his need were all one big family they told us were all in this together but you dont all stand working an acetylene torch ten hours a daytogether and you dont all get a bellyachetogether whats whose ability and which of whose needs comes first when its all one pot you cant let any man decide what his own needs are can you if you did he might claim that he needs a yachtand if his feelings is all you have to go by he might prove it too why not if its not right for me to own a car until ive worked myself into a hospital ward earning a car for every loafer and every naked savage on earthwhy cant he demand a yacht from me too if i still have the ability not to have collapsed no he cant then why can he demand that i go without cream for my coffee until hes replastered his living room oh well well anyway it was decided that nobody had the right to judge his own need or ability we voted on it yes maam we voted on it in a public meeting twice a year how else could it be done do you care to think what would happen at such a meeting it took us just one meeting to discover that we had become beggarsrotten whining sniveling beggars all of us because no man could claim his pay as his rightful earning he had no rights and no earnings his work didnt belong to him it belonged to the family and they owed him nothing in return and the only claim he had on them was his needso he had to beg in public for relief from his needs like any lousy moocher listing all his troubles and miseries down to his patched drawers and his wifes head colds hoping that the family would throw him the alms he had to claim miseries because its miseries not work that had become the coin of the realmso it turned into a contest among six thousand panhandlers each claiming that his need was worse than his brothers how else could it be done do you care to guess what happened what sort of men kept quiet feeling shame and what sort got away with the jackpot but that wasnt all there was something else that we discovered at the same meeting the factorys production had fallen by forty per cent in that first halfyear so it was decided that somebody hadnt delivered according to his ability who how would you tell it the family voted on that too they voted which men were the best and these men were sentenced to work overtime each night for the next six months overtime without paybecause you werent paid by tune and you werent paid by work only by need do i have to tell you what happened after thatand into what sort of creatures we all started turning we who had once been human we began to hide whatever ability we had to slow down and watch like hawks that we never worked any faster or better than the next fellow what else could we do when we knew that if we did our best for the family its not thanks or rewards that wed get but punishment we knew that for every stinker whod ruin a batch of motors and cost the company moneyeither through his sloppiness because he didnt have to care or through plain incompetenceits we whod have to pay with our nights and our sundays so we did our best to be no good there was one young boy who started out full of fire for the noble ideal a bright kid without any schooling but with a wonderful head on his shoulders the first year he figured out a work process that saved us thousands of manhours he gave it to the family didnt ask anything for it either couldnt ask but that was all right with him it was for the ideal he said but when he found himself voted as one of our ablest and sentenced to night work because we hadnt gotten enough from him he shut his mouth and his brain you can bet he didnt come up with any ideas the second year what was it theyd always told us about the vicious competition of the profit system where men had to compete for whod do a better job than his fellows vicious wasnt it well they should have seen what it was like when we all had to compete with one another for whod do the worst job possible theres no surer way to destroy a man than to force him into a spot where he has to aim at not doing his best where he has to struggle to do a bad job day after day that will finish him quicker than drink or idleness or pulling stickups for a living but there was nothing else for us to do except to fake unfitness the one accusation we feared was to be suspected of ability ability was like a mortgage on you that you could never pay off and what was there to work for you knew that your basic pittance would be given to you anyway whether you worked or notyour housing and feeding allowance it was calledand above that pittance you had no chance to get anything no matter how hard you tried you couldnt count on buying a new suit of clothes next yearthey might give you a clothing allowance or they might not according to whether nobody broke a leg needed an operation or gave birth to more babies and if there wasnt enough money for new suits for everybody then you couldnt get yours either there was one man whod worked hard all his life because hed always wanted to send his son through college well the boy graduated from high school in the second year of the planbut the family wouldnt give the father any allowance for the college they said his son couldnt go to college until we had enough to send everybodys sons to collegeand that we first had to send everybodys children through high school and we didnt even have enough for that the father died the following year in a knife fight with somebody in a saloon a fight over nothing in particularsuch fights were beginning to happen among us all the time then there was an old guy a widower with no family who had one hobby phonograph records i guess that was all he ever got out of life in the old days he used to skip meals just to buy himself some new recording of classical music well they didnt give him any allowance for recordspersonal luxury they called it but at that same meeting millie bush somebodys daughter a mean ugly little eightyearold was voted a pair of gold braces for her buck teeththis was medical need because the staff psychologist had said that the poor girl would get an inferiority complex if her teeth werent straightened out the old guy who loved music turned to drink instead he got so you never saw him fully conscious any more but it seems like there was one tiling he couldnt forget one night he came staggering down the street saw millie bush swung his fist and knocked all her teeth out every one of them drink of course was what we all turned to some more some less dont ask how we got the money for it when all the decent pleasures are forbidden theres always ways to get the rotten ones you dont break into grocery stores after dark and you dont pick your fellows pockets to buy classical symphonies or fishing tackle but if its to get stinking drunk and forgetyou do fishing tackle hunting guns snapshot cameras hobbies there wasnt any amusement allowance for anybody amusement was the first thing they dropped arent you always supposed to be ashamed to object when anybody asks you to give up anything if its something that gave you pleasure even our tobacco allowance was cut to where we got two packs of cigarettes a monthand this they told us was because the money had to go into the babies milk fund babies was the only item of production that didnt fall but rose and kept on risingbecause people had nothing else to do i guess and because they didnt have to care the baby wasnt their burden it was the familys in fact the best chance you had of getting a raise and breathing easier for a while was a baby allowance either that or a major disease it didnt take us long to see how it all worked out any man who tried to play straight had to refuse himself everything he lost his taste for any pleasure he hated to smoke a nickels worth of tobacco or chew a stick of gum worrying whether somebody had more need for that nickel he felt ashamed of every mouthful of food he swallowed wondering whose weary nights of overtime had paid for it knowing that his food was not his by right miserably wishing to be cheated rather than to cheat to be a sucker but not a bloodsucker he wouldnt marry he wouldnt help his folks back home he wouldnt put an extra burden on the family besides if he still had some sort of sense of responsibility he couldnt marry or bring children into the world when he could plan nothing promise nothing count on nothing but the shiftless and the irresponsible had a field day of it they bred babies they got girls into trouble they dragged in every worthless relative they had from all over the country every unmarried pregnant sister for an extra disability allowance they got more sicknesses than any doctor could disprove they ruined their clothing their furniture their homeswhat the hell the family was paying for it they found more ways of getting in need than the rest of us could ever imagine they developed a special skill for it which was the only ability they showed god help us maam do you see what we saw we saw that wed been given a law to live by a moral law they called it which punished those who observed itfor observing it the more you tried to live up to it the more you suffered the more you cheated it the bigger reward you got your honesty was like a tool left at the mercy of the next mans dishonesty the honest ones paid the dishonest collected the honest lost the dishonest won how long could men stay good under this sort of a law of goodness we were a pretty decent bunch of fellows when we started there werent many chiselers among us we knew our jobs and we were proud of it and we worked for the best factory in the country where old man starnes hired nothing but the pick of the countrys labor within one year under the new plan there wasnt an honest man left among us that was the evil the sort of hellhorror evil that preachers used to scare you with but you never thought to see alive not that the plan encouraged a few bastards but that it turned decent people into bastards and there was nothing else that it could doand it was called a moral ideal what was it we were supposed to want to work for for the love of our brothers what brothers for the bums the loafers the moochers we saw all around us and whether they were cheating or plain incompetent whether they were unwilling or unablewhat difference did that make to us if we were tied for life to the level of their unfitness faked or real how long could we care to go on we had no way of knowing their ability we had no way of controlling their needsall we knew was that we were beasts of burden struggling blindly in some sort of place that was halfhospital halfstockyardsa place geared to nothing but disability disaster diseasebeasts put there for the relief of whatever whoever chose to say was whichevers need love of our brothers thats when we learned to hate our brothers for the first time in our lives we began to hate them for every meal they swallowed for every small pleasure they enjoyed for one mans new shirt for anothers wifes hat for an outing with their family for a paint job on their houseit was taken from us it was paid for by our privations our denials our hunger we began to spy on one another each hoping to catch the others lying about their needs so as to cut their allowance at the next meeting we began to have stool pigeons who informed on people who reported that somebody had bootlegged a turkey to his family on some sundaywhich hed paid for by gambling most likely we began to meddle into one anothers lives we provoked family quarrels to get somebodys relatives thrown out any time we saw a man starting to go steady with a girl we made life miserable for him we broke up many engagements we didnt want anyone to marry we didnt want any more dependents to feed in the old days we used to celebrate if somebody had a baby we used to chip in and help him out with the hospital bills if he happened to be hardpressed for the moment now if a baby was born we didnt speak to the parents for weeks babies to us had become what locusts were to farmers in the old days we used to help a man if he had a bad illness in the family nowwell ill tell you about just one case it was the mother of a man who had been with us for fifteen years she was a kindly old lady cheerful and wise she knew us all by our first names and we all liked herwe used to like her one day she slipped on the cellar stairs and fell and broke her hip we knew what that meant at her age the staff doctor said that shed have to be sent to a hospital in town for expensive treatments that would take a long time the old lady died the night before she was to leave for town they never established the cause of death no i dont know whether she was murdered nobody said that nobody would talk about it at all all i know is that iand thats what i cant forgeti too had caught myself wishing that she would die thismay god forgive uswas the brotherhood the security the abundance that the plan was supposed to achieve for us was there any reason why this sort of horror would ever be preached by anybody was there anybody who got any profit from it there was the starnes heirs i hope youre not going to remind me that theyd sacrificed a fortune and turned the factory over to us as a gift we were fooled by that one too yes they gave up the factory but profit maam depends on what it is youre after and what the starnes heirs were after no money on earth could buy money is too clean and innocent for that eric starnes the youngesthe was a jellyfish that didnt have the guts to be after anything in particular he got himself voted as director of our public relations department which didnt do anything except that he had a staff for the not doing of anything so he didnt have to bother sticking around the office the pay he gotwell i shouldnt call it pay none of us was paidthe alms voted to him was fairly modest about ten times what i got but that wasnt riches eric didnt care for moneyhe wouldnt have known what to do with it he spent his time hanging around among us showing how chummy he was and democratic he wanted to be loved it seems the way he went about it was to keep reminding us that he had given us the factory we couldnt stand him gerald starnes was our director of production we never learned just what the size of his rakeoffhis almshad been it would have taken a staff of accountants to figure that out and a staff of engineers to trace the way it was piped directly or indirectly into his office none of it was supposed to be for himit was all for company expenses gerald had three cars four secretaries five telephones and he used to throw champagne and caviar parties that no taxpaying tycoon in the country could have afforded he spent more money in one year than his father had earned in profits in the last two years of his life we saw a hundredpound stacka hundred pounds we weighed themof magazines in geralds office full of stories about our factory and our noble plan with big pictures of gerald starnes calling him a great social crusader gerald liked to come into the shops at night dressed in his formal clothes flashing diamond cuff links the size of a nickel and shaking cigar ashes all over any cheap showoff whos got nothing to parade but his cash is bad enoughexcept that he makes no bones about the cash being his and youre free to gape at him or not as you wish and mostly you dont but when a bastard like gerald starnes puts on an act and keeps spouting that he doesnt care for material wealth that hes only serving the family that all the lushness is not for himself but for our sake and for the common good because its necessary to keep up the prestige of the company and of the noble plan in the eyes of the publicthen thats when you learn to hate the creature as youve never hated anything human but his sister ivy was worse she really did not care for material wealth the alms she got was no bigger than ours and she went about in scuffed flatheeled shoes and shirtwaistsjust to show how selfless she was she was our director of distribution she was the lady in charge of our needs she was the one who held us by the throat of course distribution was supposed to be decided by votingby the voice of the people but when the people are six thousand howling voices trying to decide without yardstick rhyme or reason when there are no rules to the game and each can demand anything but has a right to nothing when everybody holds power over everybodys life except his ownthen it turns out as it did that the voice of the people is ivy starnes by the end of the second year we dropped the pretense of the family meetingsin the name of production efficiency and time economy one meeting used to take ten daysand all the petitions of need were simply sent to miss starnes office no not sent they had to be recited to her in person by every petitioner then she made up a distribution list which she read to us for our vote of approval at a meeting that lasted threequarters of an hour we voted approval there was a tenminute period on the agenda for discussion and objections we made no objections we knew better by that time nobody can divide a factorys income among thousands of people without some sort of a gauge to measure peoples value her gauge was bootlicking selfless in her fathers time all of his money wouldnt have given him a chance to speak to his lousiest wiper and get away with it as she spoke to our best skilled workers and their wives she had pale eyes that looked fishy cold and dead and if you ever want to see pure evil you should have seen the way her eyes glinted when she watched some man whod talked back to her once and whod just heard his name on the list of those getting nothing above basic pittance and when you saw it you saw the real motive of any person whos ever preached the slogan from each according to his ability to each according to his need this was the whole secret of it at first i kept wondering how it could be possible that the educated the cultured the famous men of the world could make a mistake of this size and preach as righteousness this sort of abominationwhen five minutes of thought should have told them what would happen if somebody tried to practice what they preached now i know that they didnt do it by any kind of mistake mistakes of this size are never made innocently if men fall for some vicious piece of insanity when they have no way to make it work and no possible reason to explain their choiceits because they have a reason that they do not wish to tell and we werent so innocent either when we voted for that plan at the first meeting we didnt do it just because we believed that the drippy old guff they spewed was good we had another reason but the guff helped us to hide it from our neighbors and from ourselves the guff gave us a chance to pass off as virtue something that wed be ashamed to admit otherwise there wasnt a man voting for it who didnt think that under a setup of this kind hed muscle in on the profits of the men abler than himself there wasnt a man rich and smart enough but that he didnt think that somebody was richer and smarter and this plan would give him a share of his betters wealth and brain but while he was thinking that hed get unearned benefits from the men above he forgot about the men below whod get unearned benefits too he forgot about all his inferiors whod rush to drain him just as he hoped to drain his superiors the worker who liked the idea that his need entitled him to a limousine like his bosss forgot that every bum and beggar on earth would come howling that their need entitled them to an icebox like his own that was our real motive when we votedthat was the truth of itbut we didnt like to think it so the less we liked it the louder we yelled about our love for the common good well we got what we asked for by the time we saw what it was that wed asked for it was too late we were trapped with no place to go the best men among us left the factory in the first week of the plan we lost our best engineers superintendents foremen and highest skilled workers a man of selfrespect doesnt turn into a milch cow for anybody some able fellows tried to stick it out but they couldnt take it for long we kept losing our men they kept escaping from the factory like from a pestholetill we had nothing left except the men of need but none of the men of ability and the few of us who were still any good but stayed on were only those who had been there too long in the old days nobody ever quit the twentieth centuryand somehow we couldnt make ourselves believe that it was gone after a while we couldnt quit because no other employer would have usfor which i cant blame him nobody would deal with us in any way no respectable person or firm all the small shops where we traded started moving out of starnesville fasttill we had nothing left but saloons gambling joints and crooks who sold us trash at gouging prices the alms we got kept falling but the cost of our living went up the list of the factorys needy kept stretching but the list of its customers shrank there was less and less income to divide among more and more people in the old days it used to be said that the twentieth century motor trademark was as good as the karat mark on gold i dont know what it was that the starnes heirs thought if they thought at all but i suppose that like all social planners and like savages they thought that this trademark was a magic stamp which did the trick by some sort of voodoo power and that it would keep them rich as it had kept their father well when our customers began to see that we never delivered an order on time and never put out a motor that didnt have something wrong with itthe magic stamp began to work the other way around people wouldnt take a motor as a gift if it was marked twentieth century and it came to where our only customers were men who never paid and never meant to pay their bills but gerald starnes doped by his own publicity got huffy and went around with an air of moral superiority demanding that businessmen place orders with us not because our motors were good but because we needed the orders so badly by that time a village halfwit could see what generations of professors had pretended not to notice what good would our need do to a power plant when its generators stopped because of our defective engines what good would it do to a man caught on an operating table when the electric light went out what good would it do to the passengers of a plane when its motor failed in midair and if they bought our product not because of its merit but because of our need would that be the good the right the moral thing to do for the owner of that power plant the surgeon in that hospital the maker of that plane yet this was the moral law that the professors and leaders and thinkers had wanted to establish all over the earth if this is what it did in a single small town where we all knew one another do you care to think what it would do on a world scale do you care to imagine what it would be like if you had to live and to work when youre tied to all the disasters and all the malingering of the globe to work and whenever any men failed anywhere its you who would have to make up for it to workwith no chance to rise with your meals and your clothes and your home and your pleasure depending on any swindle any famine any pestilence anywhere on earth to workwith no chance for an extra ration till the cambodians have been fed and the patagonians have been sent through college to workon a blank check held by every creature born by men whom youll never see whose needs youll never know whose ability or laziness or sloppiness or fraud you have no way to learn and no right to question just to work and work and workand leave it up to the ivys and the geralds of the world to decide whose stomach will consume the effort the dreams and the days of your life and this is the moral law to accept thisa moral ideal well we tried itand we learned our agony took four years from our first meeting to our last and it ended the only way it could end in bankruptcy at our last meeting ivy starnes was the one who tried to brazen it out she made a short nasty snippy little speech in which she said that the plan had failed because the rest of the country had not accepted it that a single community could not succeed in the midst of a selfish greedy worldand that the plan was a noble ideal but human nature was not good enough for it a young boythe one who had been punished for giving us a useful idea in our first yeargot up as we all sat silent and walked straight to ivy starnes on the platform he said nothing he spat in her face that was the end of the noble plan and of the twentieth century the man had spoken as if the burden of his years of silence had slipped suddenly out of his grasp she knew that this was his tribute to her he had shown no reaction to her kindness he had seemed numbed to human value or human hope but something within him had been reached and his response was this confession this long desperate cry of rebellion against injustice held back for years but breaking out in recognition of the first person he had met in whose hearing an appeal for justice would not be hopeless it was as if the life he had been about to renounce were given back to him by the two essentials he needed by his food and by the presence of a rational being but what about john galt she asked oh he said remembering oh yes you were going to tell me why people started asking that question yes he was looking off as if at some sight which he had studied for years but which remained unchanged and unsolved his face had an odd questioning look of terror you were going to tell me who was the john galt they meanif there ever was such a person i hope there wasnt maam i mean i hope that its just a coincidence just a sentence that hasnt any meaning you had something in mind what it was it was something that happened at that first meeting at the twentieth century factory maybe that was the start of it maybe not i dont know the meeting was held on a spring night twelve years ago the six thousand of us were crowded on bleachers built way up to the rafters of the plants largest hangar we had just voted for the new plan and we were in an edgy sort of mood making too much noise cheering the peoples victory threatening some kind of unknown enemies and spoiling for a fight like bullies with an uneasy conscience there were white arclights beating down on us and we felt kind of touchy and raw and we were an ugly dangerous mob in that moment gerald starnes who was chairman kept hammering his gavel for order and we quieted down some but not much and you could see the whole place moving restlessly from side to side like water in a pan thats being rocked this is a crucial moment in the history of mankind gerald starnes yelled through the noise remember that none of us may now leave this place for each of us belongs to all the others by the moral law which we all accept i dont said one man and stood up he was one of the young engineers nobody knew much about him hed always kept mostly by himself when he stood up we suddenly turned deadstill it was the way he held his head he was tall and slimand i remember thinking that any two of us could have broken his neck without troublebut what we all felt was fear he stood like a man who knew that he was right i will put an end to this once and for all he said his voice was clear and without any feeling that was all he said and started to walk out he walked down the length of the place in the white light not hurrying and not noticing any of us nobody moved to stop him gerald starnes cried suddenly after him how he turned and answered i will stop the motor of the world then he walked out we never saw him again we never heard what became of him but years later when we saw the lights going out one after another in the great factories that had stood solid like mountains for generations when we saw the gates closing and the conveyor belts turning still when we saw the roads growing empty and the stream of cars draining off when it began to look as if some silent power were stopping the generators of the world and the world was crumbling quietly like a body when its spirit is gonethen we began to wonder and to ask questions about him we began to ask it of one another those of us who had heard him say it we began to think that he had kept his word that he who had seen and known the truth we refused to know was the retribution we had called upon our heads the avenger the man of that justice which we had defied we began to think that he had damned us and there was no escape from his verdict and we would never be able to get away from himand this was the more terrible because he was not pursuing us it was we who were suddenly looking for him and he had merely gone without a trace we found no answer about him anywhere we wondered by what sort of impossible power he could have done what he had promised to do there was no answer to that we began to think of him whenever we saw another collapse in the world which nobody could explain whenever we took another blow whenever we lost another hope whenever we felt caught in this dead gray fog thats descending all over the earth perhaps people heard us crying that question and they did not know what we meant but they knew too well the feeling that made us cry it they too felt that something had gone from the world perhaps this was why they began to say it whenever they felt that there was no hope id like to think that i am wrong that those words mean nothing that theres no conscious intention and no avenger behind the ending of the human race but when i hear them repeating that question i feel afraid i think of the man who said that he would stop the motor of the world you see his name was john galt she awakened because the sound of the wheels had changed it was an irregular beat with sudden screeches and short sharp cracks a sound like the broken laughter of hysteria with the fitful jerking of the car to match it she knew before she glanced at her watch that this was the track of the kansas western and that the train had started on its long detour south from kirby nebraska the train was halfempty few people had ventured across the continent on the first comet since the tunnel disaster she had given a bedroom to the tramp and then had remained alone with his story she had wanted to think of it of all the questions she intended to ask him tomorrowbut she had found her mind frozen and still like a spectator staring at the story unable to function only to stare she had felt as if she knew the meaning of that spectacle knew it with no further questions and had to escape it to movehad been the words beating in her mind with peculiar urgencyto moveas if movement had become an end in itself crucial absolute and doomed through a thin layer of sleep the sound of the wheels had kept running a race with the growth of her tension she had kept awakening as in a causeless start of panic finding herself upright in the darkness thinking blankly what was itthen telling herself in reassurance were moving were still moving the track of the kansas western was worse than she had expectedshe thought listening to the wheels the train was now carrying her hundreds of miles away from utah she had felt a desperate desire to get off the train on the main line abandon all the problems of taggart transcontinental find an airplane and fly straight to quentin daniels it had taken a cheerless effort of will to remain in her car she lay in the darkness listening to the wheels thinking that only daniels and his motor still remained like a point of fire ahead pulling her forward of what use would the motor now be to her she had no answer why did she feel so certain of the desperate need to hurry she had no answer to reach him in time was the only ultimatum left in her mind she held onto it asking no questions wordlessly she knew the real answer the motor was needed not to move trains but to keep her moving she could not hear the beat of the fourth knocks any longer in the jumbled screeching of metal she could not hear the steps of the enemy she was racing only the hopeless stampede of panic ill get there in time she thought ill get there first ill save the motor theres one motor hes not going to stop she thought hes not going to stop hes not going to stop hes not going to stop she thoughtawakening with a jolt jerking her head off the pillow the wheels had stopped for a moment she remained still trying to grasp the peculiar stillness around her it felt like the impossible attempt to create a sensory image of nonexistence there were no attributes of reality to perceive nothing but their absence no sound as if she were alone on the trainno motion as if this were not a train but a room in a buildingno light as if this were neither train nor room but space without objectsno sign of violence or physical disaster as if this were the state where disaster is no longer possible in the moment when she grasped the nature of the stillness her body sprang upright with a single curve of motion immediate and violent like a cry of rebellion the loud screech of the window shade went like a knifecut through the silence as she threw the shade upward there was nothing outside but anonymous stretches of prairie a strong wind was breaking the clouds and a shaft of moonlight fell through but it fell upon plains that seemed as dead as those from which it came the sweep of her hand pressed the light switch and the bell to summon the porter the electric light came on and brought her back to a rational world she glanced at her watch it was a few minutes past midnight she looked out of the rear window the track went off in a straight line and at the prescribed distance she saw the red lanterns left on the ground placed conscientiously to protect the rear of the train the sight seemed reassuring she pressed the porters bell once more she waited she went to the vestibule unlocked the door and leaned out to look down the line of the train a few windows were lighted in the long tapering band of steel but she saw no figures no sign of human activity she slammed the door came back and started to dress her movements suddenly calm and swift no one came to answer her bell when she hastened across to the next car she felt no fear no uncertainty no despair nothing but the urgency of action there was no porter in the cubbyhole of the next car no porter in the car beyond she hurried down the narrow passageways meeting no one but a few compartment doors were open the passengers sat inside dressed or halfdressed silently as if waiting they watched her rush by with oddly furtive glances as if they knew what she was after as if they had expected someone to come and to face what they had not faced she went on running down the spinal cord of a dead train noting the peculiar combination of lighted compartments open doors and empty passages no one had ventured to step out no one had wanted to ask the first question she ran through the trains only coach where some passengers slept in contorted poses of exhaustion while others awake and still sat hunched like animals waiting for a blow making no move to avert it in the vestibule of the coach she stopped she saw a man who had unlocked the door and was leaning out looking inquiringly ahead through the darkness ready to step off he turned at the sound of her approach she recognized his face it was owen kellogg the man who had rejected the future she had once offered him kellogg she gasped the sound of laughter in her voice like a cry of relief at the sudden sight of a man in a desert hello miss taggart he answered with an astonished smile that held a touch of incredulous pleasureand of wistfulness i didnt know you were aboard come on she ordered as if he were still an employee of the railroad i think were on a frozen train we are he said and followed her with prompt disciplined obedience no explanations were necessary it was as if in unspoken understanding they were answering a call to dutyand it seemed natural that of the hundreds aboard it was the two of them who should be partnersindanger any idea how long weve been standing she asked as they hurried on through the next car no he said we were standing when i woke up they went the length of the train finding no porters no waiters in the diner no brakemen no conductor they glanced at each other once in a while but kept silent they knew the stories of abandoned trains of the crews that vanished in sudden bursts of rebellion against serfdom they got off at the head end of the train with no motion around them save the wind on their faces and they climbed swiftly aboard the engine the engines headlight was on stretching like an accusing arm into the void of the night the engines cab was empty her cry of desperate triumph broke out in answer to the shock of the sight good for them theyre human beings she stopped aghast as at the cry of a stranger she noticed that kellogg stood watching her curiously with the faint hint of a smile it was an old steam engine the best that the railroad had been able to provide for the comet the fire was banked in the grates the steam gauge was low and in the great windshield before them the headlight fell upon a band of ties that should have been running to meet them but lay still instead like a ladders steps counted numbered and ended she reached for the logbook and looked at the names of the trains last crew the engineer had been pat logan her head dropped slowly and she closed her eyes she thought of the first run on a greenblue track that must have been in pat logans mindas it was now in hersthrough the silent hours of his last run on any rail miss taggart said owen kellogg softly she jerked her head up yes she said yes wellher voice had no color except the metallic tinge of decisionwell have to get to a phone and call for another crew she glanced at her watch at the rate we were running i think we must be about eighty miles from the oklahoma state line i believe bradshaw is this roads nearest division point to call were somewhere within thirty miles of it are there any taggart trains following us the next one is number the transcontinental freight but it wont get here till about seven am if its running on time which doubt only one freight in seven hours he said it involuntarily with a note of outraged loyalty to the great railroad he had once been proud to serve her mouth moved in the brief snap of a smile our transcontinental traffic is not what it was in your day he nodded slowly i dont suppose there are any kansas western trains coming tonight either i cant remember offhand but i think not he glanced at the poles by the side of the track i hope that the kansas western people have kept their phones in order you mean that the chances are they havent if we judge by the state of their track but well have to try it yes she turned to go but stopped she knew it was useless to comment but the words came involuntarily you know she said its those lanterns our men put behind the train to protect us thats the hardest thing to take they they felt more concern for human lives than their country had shown for theirs his swift glance at her was like a shot of deliberate emphasis then he answered gravely yes miss taggart climbing down the ladder on the side of the engine they saw a cluster of passengers gathered by the track and more figures emerging from the train to join them by some special instinct of their own the men who had sat waiting knew that someone had taken charge someone had assumed the responsibility and it was now safe to show signs of life they all looked at her with an air of inquiring expectation as she approached the unnatural pallor of the moonlight seemed to dissolve the differences of their faces and to stress the quality they all had in common a look of cautious appraisal part fear part plea part impertinence held in abeyance is there anyone here who wishes to be spokesman for the passengers she asked they looked at one another there was no answer very well she said you dont have to speak im dagny taggart the operating vicepresident of this railroad andthere was a rustle of response from the group halfmovement halfwhisper resembling reliefand ill do the speaking we are on a train that has been abandoned by its crew there was no physical accident the engine is intact but there is no one to run it this is what the newspapers call a frozen train you all know what it meansand you know the reasons perhaps you knew the reasons long before they were discovered by the men who deserted you tonight the law forbade them to desert but this will not help you now a woman shrieked suddenly with the demanding petulance of hysteria what are we going to do dagny paused to look at her the woman was pushing forward to squeeze herself into the group to place some human bodies between herself and the sight of the great vacuumthe plain stretching off and dissolving into moonlight the dead phosphorescence of impotent borrowed energy the woman had a coat thrown over a nightgown the coat was slipping open and her stomach protruded under the gowns thin cloth with that loose obscenity of manner which assumes all human selfrevelation to be ugliness and makes no effort to conceal it for a moment dagny regretted the necessity to continue i shall go down the track to a telephone she continued her voice clear and as cold as the moonlight there are emergency telephones at intervals of five miles along the rightofway i shall call for another crew to be sent here this will take some time you will please stay aboard and maintain such order as you are capable of maintaining what about the gangs of raiders asked another womans nervous voice thats true said dagny id better have someone to accompany me who wishes to go she had misunderstood the womans motive there was no answer there were no glances directed at her or at one another there were no eyesonly moist ovals glistening in the moonlight there they were she thought the men of the new age the demanders and recipients of selfsacrifice she was struck by a quality of anger in their silencean anger saying that she was supposed to spare them moments such as thisand with a feeling of cruelty new to her she remained silent by conscious intention she noticed that owen kellogg too was waiting but he was not watching the passengers he was watching her face when he became certain that there would be no answer from the crowd he said quietly ill go with you of course miss taggart thank you what about us snapped the nervous woman dagny turned to her answering in the formal inflectionless monotone of a business executive there have been no cases of raider gang attacks upon frozen trainsunfortunately just where are we asked a bulky man with too expensive an overcoat and too flabby a face his voice had a tone intended for servants by a man unfit to employ them in what part of what state i dont know she answered how long will we be kept here asked another in the tone of a creditor who is imposed upon by a debtor dont know when will we get to san francisco asked a third in the manner of a sheriff addressing a suspect i dont know the demanding resentment was breaking loose in small crackling puffs like chestnuts popping open in the dark oven of the minds who now felt certain that they were taken care of and safe this is perfectly outrageous yelled a woman springing forward throwing her words at dagnys face you have no right to let this happen i dont intend to be kept waiting in the middle of nowhere i expect transportation keep your mouth shut said dagny or ill lock the train doors and leave you where you are you cant do that youre a common carrier you have no right to discriminate against me ill report it to the unification board if i give you a train to get you within sight or hearing of your board said dagny turning away she saw kellogg looking at her his glance like a line drawn under her words underscoring them for her own attention get a flashlight somewhere she said while i go to get my handbag then well start when they started out on their way to the track phone walking past the silent line of cars they saw another figure descending from the train and hurrying to meet them she recognized the tramp trouble maam he asked stopping the crew has deserted oh whats to be done im going to a phone to call the division point you cant go alone maam not these days id better go with you she smiled thanks but ill be all right mr kellogg here is going with me saywhats your name jeff alien maam listen alien have you ever worked for a railroad no maam well youre working for one now youre deputyconductor and proxyvicepresidentinchargeofoperation your job is to take charge of this train in my absence to preserve order and to keep the cattle from stampeding tell them that i appointed you you dont need any proof theyll obey anybody who expects obedience yes maam he answered firmly with a look of understanding she remembered that money inside a mans pocket had the power to turn into confidence inside his mind she took a hundreddollar bill from her bag and slipped it into his hand as advance on wages she said yes maam she had started off when he called after her miss taggart she turned yes thank you he said she smiled halfraising her hand in a parting salute and walked on who is that asked kellogg a tramp who was caught stealing a ride hell do the job i think he will they walked silently past the engine and on in the direction of its headlight at first stepping from tie to tie with the violent light beating against them from behind they still felt as if they were at home in the normal realm of a railroad then she found herself watching the light on the ties under her feet watching it ebb slowly trying to hold it to keep seeing its fading glow until she knew that the hint of a glow on the wood was no longer anything but moonlight she could not prevent the shudder that made her turn to look back the headlight still hung behind them like the liquid silver globe of a planet deceptively close but belonging to another orbit and another system owen kellogg walked silently beside her and she felt certain that they knew each others thoughts he couldnt have oh god he couldnt she said suddenly not realizing that she had switched to words who nathaniel taggart he couldnt have worked with people like those passengers he couldnt have run trains for them he couldnt have employed them he couldnt have used them at all neither as customers nor as workers kellogg smiled you mean that he couldnt have grown rich by exploiting them miss taggart she nodded they she said and he heard the faint trembling of her voice which was love and pain and indignation theyve said for years that he rose by thwarting the ability of others by leaving them no chance and that that human incompetence was to his selfish interest but he it wasnt obedience that he required of people miss taggart he said with an odd note of sternness in his voice just remember that he represented a code of existence whichfor a brief span in all human historydrove slavery out of the civilized world remember it when you feel baffled by the nature of his enemies have you ever heard of a woman named ivy starnes oh yes i keep thinking that this was what she would have enjoyedthe spectacle of those passengers tonight this was what shes after but wewe cant live with it you and i can we no one can live with it its not possible to live with it what makes you think that ivy starness purpose is life somewhere on the edge of her mindlike the wisps she saw floating on the edges of the prairie neither quite rays nor fog nor cloudshe felt some shape which she could not grasp halfsuggested and demanding to be grasped she did not speak andlike the links of a chain unrolling through their silencethe rhythm of their steps went on spaced to the ties scored by the dry swift beat of heels on wood she had not had time to be aware of him except as of a providential comradeincompetence now she glanced at him with conscious attention his face had the clear hard look she remembered having liked in the past but the face had grown calmer as if more serenely at peace his clothes were threadbare he wore an old leather jacket and even in the darkness she could distinguish the scuffed blotches streaking across the leather what have you been doing since you left taggart transcontinental she asked oh many things where are you working now on special assignments more or less of what kind of every kind youre not working for a railroad no the sharp brevity of the sound seemed to expand it into an eloquent statement she knew that he knew her motive kellogg if i told you that i dont have a single firstrate man left on the taggart system if i offered you any job any terms any money you cared to namewould you come back to us no you were shocked by our loss of traffic i dont think you have any idea of what our loss of men has done to us i cant tell you the sort of agony i went through three days ago trying to find somebody able to build five miles of temporary track i have fifty miles to build through the rockies i see no way to do it but it has to be done ive combed the country for men there arent any and then to run into you suddenly to find you here in a day coach when id give half the system for one employee like youdo you understand why i cant let you go choose anything you wish want to be general manager of a region or assistant operating vicepresident no youre still working for a living arent you yes you dont seem to be making very much im making enough for my needsand for nobody elses why are you willing to work for anyone but taggart transcontinental because you wouldnt give me the kind of job id want i she stopped still good god kellogghavent you understood id give you any job you name all right track walker what section hand engine wiper he smiled at the look on her face no you see i said you wouldnt do you mean that youd take a day laborers job any time you offered it but nothing better thats right nothing better dont you understand that i have too many men whore able to do those jobs but nothing better i understand it miss taggart do you what i need is your mind miss taggart my mind is not on the market any longer she stood looking at him her face growing harder youre one of them arent you she said at last of whom she did not answer shrugged and went on miss taggart he asked how long will you remain willing to be a common carrier i wont surrender the world to the creature youre quoting the answer you gave her was much more realistic the chain of their steps had stretched through many silent minutes before she asked why did you stand by me tonight why were you willing to help me he answered easily almost gaily because there isnt a passenger on that train who needs to get where hes going more urgently than i do if the train can be started none will profit more than i but when i need something i dont sit and expect transportation like that creature of yours you dont and what if all trains stopped running then i wouldnt count on making a crucial journey by train where are you going west on a special assignment no for a months vacation with some friends a vacation and its that important to you more important than anything on earth they had walked two miles when they came to the small gray box on a post by the trackside which was the emergency telephone the box hung sidewise beaten by storms she jerked it open the telephone was there a familiar reassuring object glinting in the beam of kelloggs flashlight but she knew the moment she pressed the receiver to her ear and he knew when he saw her finger tapping sharply against the hook that the telephone was dead she handed the receiver to him without a word she held the flashlight while he went swiftly over the instrument then tore it off the wall and studied the wires the wires okay he said the currents on its this particular instrument thats out of order theres a chance that the next one might be working he added the next one is five miles away lets go she said far behind them the engines headlight was still visible not a planet any longer but a small star winking through mists of distance ahead of them the rail went off into bluish space with nothing to mark its end she realized how often she had glanced back at that headlight so long as it remained in sight she had felt as if a lifeline were holding them anchored safely now they had to break it and dive into and dive off this planet she thought she noticed that kellogg too stood looking back at the headlight they glanced at each other but said nothing the crunch of a pebble under her shoe sole burst like a firecracker in the silence with a coldly intentional movement he kicked the telephone instrument and sent it rolling into a ditch the violence of the noise shattered the vacuum god damn him he said evenly not raising his voice with a loathing past any display of emotion he probably didnt feel like attending to his job and since he needed his pay check nobody had the right to ask that he keep the phones in order come on she said we can rest if you feel tired miss taggart im all right we have no time to feel tired thats our great error miss taggart we ought to take the time some day she gave a brief chuckle she stepped onto a tie of the track stressing the step as her answer and they went on it was hard walking on ties but when they tried to walk along the trackside they found that it was harder the soil halfsand halfdust sank under their heels like the soft unresisting spread of some substance that was neither liquid nor solid they went back to walking from tie to tie it was almost like stepping from log to log in the midst of a river she thought of what an enormous distance five miles had suddenly become and that a division point thirty miles away was now unattainableafter an era of railroads built by men who thought in thousands of transcontinental miles that net of rails and lights spreading from ocean to ocean hung on the snap of a wire on a broken connection inside a rusty phoneno she thought on something much more powerful and much more delicate it hung on the connections in the minds of the men who knew that the existence of a wire of a train of a job of themselves and their actions was an absolute not to be escaped when such minds were gone a two thousandton train was left at the mercy of the muscles of her legs tiredshe thought even the strain of walking was a value a small piece of reality in the stillness around them the sensation of effort was a specific experience it was pain and could be nothing elsein the midst of a space which was neither light nor dark a soil which neither gave nor resisted a fog which neither moved nor hung still their strain was the only evidence of their motion nothing changed in the emptiness around them nothing took form to mark their progress she had always wondered in incredulous contempt about the sects that preached the annihilation of the universe as the ideal to be attained there she thought was their world and the content of their minds made real when the green light of a signal appeared by the track it gave them a point to reach and pass butincongruous in the midst of the floating dissolutionit brought them no sense of relief it seemed to come from a long since extinguished world like those stars whose light remains after they are gone the green circle glowed in space announcing a clear track inviting motion where there was nothing to move who was that philosopher she thought who preached that motion exists without any moving entities this was his world too t she found herself pushing forward with increasing effort as if against some resistance that was not pressure but suction glancing at kellogg she saw that he too was walking like a man braced against a storm she felt as if the two of them were the sole survivors of of reality she thoughttwo lonely figures fighting not through a storm but worse through nonexistence it was kellogg who glanced back after a while and she followed his glance there was no headlight behind them they did not stop looking straight ahead he reached absently into his pocket she felt certain that the movement was involuntary he produced a package of cigarettes and extended it to her she was about to take a cigarettethen suddenly she seized his wrist and tore the package out of his hand it was a plain white package that bore as single imprint the sign of the dollar give me the flashlight she ordered stopping he stopped obediently and sent the beam of the flashlight at the package in her hands she caught a glimpse of his face he looked a little astonished and very amused there was no printing on the package no trade name no address only the dollar sign stamped in gold the cigarettes bore the same sign where did you get this she asked he was smiling if you know enough to ask that miss taggart you should know that i wont answer i know that this stands for something the dollar sign for a great deal it stands on the vest of every fat pig like figure in every cartoon for the purpose of denoting a crook a grafter a scoundrelas the one surefire brand of evil it standsas the money of a free countryfor achievement for success for ability for mans creative powerand precisely for these reasons it is used as a brand of infamy it stands stamped on the forehead of a man like hank rearden as a mark of damnation incidentally do you know where that sign comes from it stands for the initials of the united states he snapped the flashlight off but he did not move to go she could distinguish the hint of his bitter smile do you know that the united states is the only country in history that has ever used its own monogram as a symbol of depravity ask yourself why ask yourself how long a country that did that could hope to exist and whose moral standards have destroyed it it was the only country in history where wealth was not acquired by looting but by production not by force but by trade the only country whose money was the symbol of mans right to his own mind to his work to his life to his happiness to himself if this is evil by the present standards of the world if this is the reason for damning us then we we the dollar chasers and makersaccept it and choose to be damned by that world we choose to wear the sign of the dollar on our foreheads proudly as our badge of nobilitythe badge we are willing to live for and if need be to die he extended his hand for the package she held it as if her fingers would not let it go but gave up and placed it on his palm with deliberate slowness as if to underscore the meaning of his gesture he offered her a cigarette she took it and placed it between her lips he took one for himself struck a match lighted both and they walked on they walked over rotting logs that sank without resistance into the shifting ground through a vast uncongealed globe of moonlight and coiling mistwith two spots of living fire in their hands and the glow of two small circles to light their faces fire a dangerous force tamed at his fingertips she remembered the old man saying to her the old man who had said that these cigarettes were not made anywhere on earth when a man thinks there is a spot of fire alive in his mindand its proper that he should have the burning point of a cigarette as his one expression i wish youd tell me who makes them she said in the tone of a hopeless plea he chuckled goodnaturedly i can tell you this much theyre made by a friend of mine for sale butnot being a common carrier he sells them only to his friends sell me that package will you i dont think youll be able to afford it miss taggart butall right if you wish how much is it five cents five cents she repeated bewildered five cents he said and added in gold she stopped staring at him in gold yes miss taggart well whats your rate of exchange how much is it in our normal money there is no rate of exchange miss taggart no amount of physicalor spiritualcurrency whose sole standard of value is the decree of mr wesley mouch will buy these cigarettes i see he reached into his pocket took out the package and handed it to her ill give them to you miss taggart he said because youve earned them many times overand because you need them for the same purpose we do what purpose to remind usin moments of discouragement in the loneliness of exileof our true homeland which has always been yours too miss taggart thank you she said she put the cigarettes in her pocket he saw that her hand was trembling when they reached the fourth of the five mileposts they had been silent for a long time with no strength left for anything but the effort of moving their feet far ahead they saw a dot of light too low on the horizon and too harshly clear to be a star they kept watching it as they walked and said nothing until they became certain that it was a powerful electric beacon blazing in the midst of the empty prairie what is that she asked i dont know he said it looks like no she broke in hastily it couldnt be not around here she did not want to hear him name the hope which she had felt for many minutes past she could not permit herself to think of it or to know that the thought was hope they found the telephone box at the fifth milepost the beacon hung like a violent spot of cold fire less than half a mile farther south the telephone was working she heard the buzz of the wire like the breath of a living creature when she lifted the receiver then a drawling voice answered jessup at bradshaw the voice sounded sleepy this is dagny taggart speaking from who dagny taggart of taggart transcontinental speaking oh oh yes i see yes speaking from your track phone number the comet is stalled seven miles north of here its been abandoned the crew has deserted there was a pause well what do you want me to do about it she had to pause in turn in order to believe it are you the night dispatcher yeah then send another crew out to us at once a full passenger train crew of course now yes there was a pause the rules dont say anything about that get me the chief dispatcher she said choking hes away on his vacation get the division superintendent hes gone down to laurel for a couple of days get me somebody whos in charge im in charge listen she said slowly fighting for patience do you understand that theres a train a passenger limited abandoned in the middle of the prairie yeah but how am i to know what im supposed to do about it the rules dont provide for it now if you had an accident wed send out the wrecker but if there was no accident you dont need the wrecker do you no we dont need the wrecker we need men do you understand living men to run an engine the rules dont say anything about a train without men or about men without a train theres no rule for calling out a full crew in the middle of the night and sending them to hunt for a train somewhere ive never heard of it before youre hearing it now dont you know what you have to do who am i to know do you know that your job is to keep trains moving my job is to obey the rules if i send out a crew when im not supposed to god only knows whats going to happen what with the unification board and all the regulations theyve got nowadays who am i to take it upon myself and whats going to happen if you leave a train stalled on the line thats not my fault i had nothing to do with it they cant blame me i couldnt help it youre to help it now nobody told me to im telling you to how do i know whether youre supposed to tell me or not were not supposed to furnish any taggart crews you people were to run with your own crews thats what we were told but this is an emergency nobody told me anything about an emergency she had to take a few seconds to control herself she saw kellogg watching her with a bitter smile of amusement listen she said into the phone do you know that the comet was due at bradshaw over three hours ago oh sure but nobodys going to make any trouble about that no trains ever on schedule these days then do you intend to leave us blocking your track forever weve got nothing due till number the northbound passenger out of laurel at eight thirtyseven am you can wait till then the daytrick dispatcher will be on then you can speak to him you blasted idiot this is the comet whats that to me this isnt taggart transcontinental you people expect a lot for your money youve been nothing but a headache to us with all the extra work at no extra pay for the little fellows his voice was slipping into whining insolence you cant talk to me that way the times past when you could talk to people that way she had never believed that there were men with whom a certain method which she had never used would work such men were not hired by taggart transcontinental and she had never been forced to deal with them before do you know who i am she asked in the cold overbearing tone of a personal threat it worked i i guess so he answered then let me tell you that if you dont send a crew to me at once youll be out of a job within one hour after i reach bradshaw which ill reach sooner or later youd better make it sooner yes maam he said call out a full passenger train crew and give them orders to run us to laurel where we have our own men yes maam he added will you tell headquarters that it was you who told me to do it i will and that its you whore responsible for it i am there was a pause then he asked helplessly now how am i going to call the men most of them havent got any phones do you have a call boy yes but he wont get here till morning is there anybody in the yards right now theres the wiper in the roundhouse send him out to call the men yes maam hold the line she leaned against the side of the phone box to wait kellogg was smiling and you propose to run a railroada transcontinental railroadwith that he asked she shrugged she could not keep her eyes off the beacon it seemed so close so easily within her reach she felt as if the unconfessed thought were struggling furiously against her splattering bits of the struggle all over her mind a man able to harness an untapped source of energy a man working on a motor to make all other motors useless she could be talking to him to his kind of brain in a few hours in just a few hours what if there was no need to hurry to him it was what she wanted to do it was all she wanted her work what was her work to move on to the fullest most exacting use of her mindor to spend the rest of her life doing his thinking for a man unfit to be a night dispatcher why had she chosen to work was it in order to remain where she had startednight operator of rockdale stationno lower than thatshe had been better than that dispatcher even at rockdalewas this to be the final sum an end lower than her beginning there was no reason to hurry she was the reason they needed the trains but they did not need the motor she needed the motor her duty to whom the dispatcher was gone for a long time when he came back his voice sounded sulky well the wiper says he can get the men all right but its no use because how am i going to send them out to you we have no engine no engine no the superintendent took one to run down to laurel and the others in the shops been there for weeks and the switch engine jumped a rail this morning theyll be working on her till tomorrow afternoon what about the wreckers engine that you were offering to send us oh shes up north they had a wreck there yesterday she hasnt come back yet have you a diesel car never had any such thing not around here have you a track motor car yes we have that send them out on the track motor car oh yes maam tell your men to stop here at track phone number to pick up mr kellogg and myself she was looking at the beacon yes maam call the taggart trainmaster at laurel report the comets delay and explain to him what happened she put her hand into her pocket and suddenly clutched her fingers she felt the package of cigarettes say she asked whats that beacon about half a mile from here from where you are oh that must be the emergency landing field of the flagship airlines i see well thats all get your men started at once tell them to pick up mr kellogg by track phone number yes maam she hung up kellogg was grinning an airfield isnt it he asked yes she stood looking at the beacon her hand still clutching the cigarettes in her pocket so theyre going to pick up mr kellogg are they she whirled to him realizing what decision her mind had been reaching without her conscious knowledge no she said no i didnt mean to abandon you here its only that i too have a crucial purpose out west where i ought to hurry so i was thinking of trying to catch a plane but i cant do it and its not necessary come on he said starting in the direction of the airfield but i if theres anything you want to do more urgently than to nurse those moronsgo right ahead more urgently than anything in the world she whispered ill undertake to remain in charge for you and to deliver the comet to your man at laurel thank you but if youre hoping im not deserting you know i know then why are you so eager to help me i just want you to see what its like to do something you want for once theres not much chance that theyll have a plane at that field theres a good chance that they will there were two planes on the edge of the airfield one the half charred remnant of a wreck not worth salvaging for scrapthe other a dwight sanders monoplane brandnew the kind of ship that men were pleading for in vain all over the country there was one sleepy attendant at the airfield young pudgy and but for a faint smell of college about his vocabulary a brain brother of the night dispatcher of bradshaw he knew nothing about the two planes they had been there when he first took this job a year ago he had never inquired about them and neither had anybody else in whatever silent crumbling had gone on at the distant headquarters in the slow dissolution of a great airline company the sanders monoplane had been forgottenas assets of this nature were being forgotten everywhere as the model of the motor had been forgotten on a junk pile and left in plain sight had conveyed nothing to the inheritors and the takersover there were no rules to tell the young attendant whether he was expected to keep the sanders plane or not the decision was made for him by the brusque confident manner of the two strangersby the credentials of miss dagny taggart vicepresident of a railroadby brief hints about a secret emergency mission which sounded like washington to himby the mention of an agreement with the airlines top officials in new york whose names he had never heard beforeby a check for fifteen thousand dollars written by miss taggart as deposit against the return of the sanders planeand by another check for two hundred bucks for his own personal courtesy he fueled the plane he checked it as best he could he found a map of the countrys airportsand she saw that a landing field on the outskirts of afton utah was marked as still in existence she had been too tensely swiftly active to feel anything but at the last moment when the attendant switched on the floodlights when she was about to climb aboard she paused to glance at the emptiness of the sky then at owen kellogg he stood alone in the white glare his feet planted firmly apart on an island of cement in a ring of blinding lights with nothing beyond the ring but an irredeemable nightand she wondered which one of them was taking the greater chance and facing the more desolate emptiness in case anything happens to me she said will you tell eddie willers in my office to give jeff alien a job as i promised i will is this all you wish to be done in case anything happens she considered it and smiled sadly in astonishment at the realization yes i guess thats all except tell hank rearden what happened and that i asked you to tell him i will she lifted her head and said firmly i dont expect it to happen however when you reach laurel call winston colorado and tell them that i will be there tomorrow by noon yes miss taggart she wanted to extend her hand in parting but it seemed inadequate and then she remembered what he had said about times of loneliness she took out the package and silently offered him one of his own cigarettes his smile was a full statement of understanding and the small flame of his match lighting their two cigarettes was their most enduring handshake then she climbed aboardand the next span of her consciousness was not separate moments and movements but the sweep of a single motion and a single unit of time a progression forming one entity like the notes of a piece of music from the touch of her hand on the starterto the blast of the motors sound that broke off like a mountain rockslide all contact with the time behind herto the circling fall of a blade that vanished in a fragile sparkle of whirling air that cut the space aheadto the start for the runwayto the brief pausethen to the forward thrustto the long perilous run the run not to be obstructed the straight line ran that gathers power by spending it on a harder and harder and everaccelerating effort the straight line to a purposeto the moment unnoticed when the earth drops off and the line unbroken goes on into space in the simple natural act of rising she saw the telegraph wires of the trackside slipping past at the tip of her toes the earth was falling downward and she felt as if its weight were dropping off her ankles as if the globe would go shrinking to the size of a ball a convicts ball she had dragged and lost her body swayed drunk with the shock of a discovery and her craft rocked with her body and it was the earth below that reeled with the rocking of her craftthe discovery that her life was now in her own hands that there was no necessity to argue to explain to teach to plead to fightnothing but to see and think and act then the earth steadied into a wide black sheet that grew wider and wider as she circled rising when she glanced down for the last time the lights of the field were extinguished there was only the single beacon left and it looked like the tip of kelloggs cigarette glowing as a last salute in the darkness then she was left with the lights on her instrument panel and the spread of stars beyond her film of glass there was nothing to support her but the beat of the engine and the minds of the men who had made the plane but what else supports one anywhereshe thought the line of her course went northwest to cut a diagonal across the state of colorado she knew she had chosen the most dangerous route over too long a stretch of the worst mountain barrierbut it was the shortest line and safety lay in altitude and no mountains seemed dangerous compared to the dispatcher of bradshaw the stars were like foam and the sky seemed full of flowing motion the motion of bubbles settling and forming the floating of circular waves without progression a spark of light flared up on earth once in a while and it seemed brighter than all the static blue above but it hung alone between the black of ashes and the blue of a crypt it seemed to fight for its fragile foothold it greeted her and went the pale streak of a river came rising slowly from the void and for a long stretch of time it remained in sight gliding imperceptibly to meet her it looked like a phosphorescent vein showing through the skin of the earth a delicate vein without blood when she saw the lights of a town like a handful of gold coins flung upon the prairie the brightly violent lights fed by an electric current they seemed as distant as the stars and now as unattainable the energy that had lighted them was gone the power that created power stations in empty prairies had vanished and she knew of no journey to recapture it yet these had been her starsshe thought looking downthese had been her goal her beacon the aspiration drawing her upon her upward course that which others claimed to feel at the sight of the starsstars safely distant by millions of years and thus imposing no obligation to act but serving as the tinsel of futilityshe had felt at the sight of electric bulbs lighting the streets of a town it was this earth below that had been the height she had wanted to reach and she wondered how she had come to lose it who had made of it a convicts ball to drag through muck who had turned its promise of greatness into a vision never to be reached but the town was past and she had to look ahead to the mountains of colorado rising in her way the small glass dial on her panel showed that she was now climbing the sound of the engine beating through the metal shell around her trembling in the wheel against her palms like the pounding of a heart strained to a solemn effort told her of the power carrying her above the peaks the earth was now a crumpled sculpture that swayed from side to side the shape of an explosion still shooting sudden spurts to reach the plane she saw them as dented black cuts ripping through the milky spread of stars straight in her path and tearing wider her mind one with her body and her body one with the plane she fought the invisible suction drawing her downward she fought the sudden gusts that tipped the earth as if she were about to roll off into the sky with half of the mountains rolling after it was like fighting a frozen ocean where the touch of a single spray would be fatal there were stretches of rest when the mountains shrank down over valleys filled with fog then the fog rose higher to swallow the earth and she was left suspended in space left motionless but for the sound of the engine but she did not need to see the earth the instrument panel was now her power of sightit was the condensed sight of the best minds able to guide her on her way their condensed sight she thought offered to hers and requiring only that she be able to read it how had they been paid for it they the sightgivers from condensed milk to condensed music to the condensed sight of precision instrumentswhat wealth had they not given to the world and what had they received in return where were they now where was dwight sanders where was the inventor of her motor the fog was liftingand in a sudden clearing she saw a drop of fire on a spread of rock it was not an electric light it was a lonely flame in the darkness of the earth she knew where she was and she knew that flame it was wyatts torch she was coming close to her goal somewhere behind her in the northeast stood the summits pierced by the taggart tunnel the mountains were sliding in a long descent into the steadier soil of utah she let her plane slip closer to the earth the stars were vanishing the sky was growing darker but in the bank of clouds to the east thin cracks were beginning to appearfirst as threads then faint spots of reflection then straight bands that were not yet pink but no longer blue the color of a future light the first hints of the coming sunrise they kept appearing and vanishing slowly growing clearer leaving the sky darker then breaking it wider apart like a promise struggling to be fulfilled she heard a piece of music beating in her mind one she seldom liked to recall not halleys fifth concerto but his fourth the cry of a tortured struggle with the chords of its theme breaking through like a distant vision to be reached she saw the afton airport from across a span of miles first as a square of sparks then as a sunburst of white rays it was lighted for a plane about to take off and she had to wait for her landing circling in the outer darkness above the field she saw the silver body of a plane rising like a phoenix out of the white fire andin a straight line almost leaving an instants trail of light to hang in space behind itgoing off toward the east then she swept down in its stead to dive into the luminous funnel of beamsshe saw a strip of cement flying at her face she felt the jolt of the wheels stopping it in time then the streak of her motion ebbing out and the plane being tamed to the safety of a car as it taxied smoothly off the runway it was a small private airfield serving the meager traffic of a few industrial concerns still remaining in afton she saw a lone attendant hurrying to meet her she leaped down to the ground the moment the plane stood still the hours of the flight swept from her mind by the impatience over the stretch of a few more minutes can i get a car somewhere to drive me to the institute of technology at once she asked the attendant looked at her puzzled why yes i guess so maam but but what for theres nobody there mr quentin daniels is there the attendant shook his head slowlythen jerked his thumb pointing east to the shrinking taillights of the plane theres mr daniels going now what he just left left why he went with the man who flew in for him twothree hours ago what man dont know never saw him before but boyhes got a beauty of a ship she was back at the wheel she was speeding down the runway she was rising into the air her plane like a bullet aimed at two sparks of red and green light that were twinkling away into the eastern skywhile she was still repeating oh no they dont they dont they dont they dont once and for allshe thought clutching the wheel as if it were the enemy not to be relinquished her words like separate explosions with a trail of fire in her mind to link themonce and for all to meet the destroyer face to face to learn who he is and where he goes to vanish not the motor he is not to carry the motor away into the darkness of his monstrously closed unknown he is not to escape this time a band of light was rising in the east and it seemed to come from the earth as a breath longheld and released in the deep blue above it the strangers plane was a single spark changing color and flashing from side to side like the tip of a pendulum swinging in the darkness beating time the curve of distance made the spark drop closer to the earth and she pushed her throttle wide open not to let the spark out of her sight not to let it touch the horizon and vanish the light was flowing into the sky as if drawn from the earth by the strangers plane the plane was headed southeast and she was following it into the coming sunrise from the transparent green of ice the sky melted into pale gold and the gold spread into a lake under a fragile film of pink glass the color of that forgotten morning which was the first she had seen on earth the clouds were dropping away in long shreds of smoky blue she kept her eyes on the strangers plane as if her glance were a towline pulling her ship the strangers plane was now a small black cross like a shrinking check mark on the glowing sky then she noticed that the clouds were not dropping that they stood congealed on the edge of the earthand she realized that the plane was headed toward the mountains of colorado that the struggle against the invisible storm lay ahead for her once more she noted it without emotion she did not wonder whether her ship or her body had the power to attempt it again so long as she was able to move she would move to follow the speck that was fleeing away with the last of her world she felt nothing but the emptiness left by a fire that had been hatred and anger and the desperate impulse of a fight to the kill these had fused into a single icy streak the single resolve to follow the stranger whoever he was wherever he took her to follow and she added nothing in her mind but unstated what lay at the bottom of the emptiness was and give her life if she could take his first like an instrument set to automatic control her body was performing the motions of driving the planewith the mountains reeling in a bluish fog below and the dented peaks rising in her path as smoky formations of a deadlier blue she noticed that the distance to the strangers plane had shrunk he had checked his speed for the dangerous crossing while she had gone on unconscious of the danger with only the muscles of her arms and legs fighting to keep her plane aloft a brief tight movement of her lips was as close as she could come to a smile it was he who was flying her plane for her she thought he had given her the power to follow him with a somnambulists unerring skill as if responding of itself to his control the needle of her altimeter was slowly moving upward she was rising and she went on rising and she wondered when her breath and her propeller would fail he was going southeast toward the highest mountains that obstructed the path of the sun it was his plane that was struck by the first sunray it flashed for an instant like a burst of white fire sending rays to shoot from its wings the peaks of the mountains came next she saw the sunlight reaching the snow in the crevices then trickling down the granite sides it cut violent shadows on the ledges and brought the mountains into the jiving finality of a form they were flying over the wildest stretch of colorado uninhabited uninhabitable inaccessible to men on foot or plane no landing was possible within a radius of a hundred miles she glanced at her fuel gauge she had one halfhour left the stranger was heading straight toward another higher range she wondered why he chose a course no air route did or ever would travel she wished this range were behind her it was the last effort she could hope to make the strangers plane was suddenly slacking its speed he was losing altitude just when she had expected him to climb the granite barrier was rising in his path moving to meet him reaching for his wingsbut the long smooth line of his motion was sliding down she could detect no break no jolt no sign of mechanical failure it looked like the even movement of a controlled intention with a sudden flash of sunlight on its wings the plane banked into a long curve rays dripping like water from its bodythen went into the broad smooth circles of a spiral as if circling for a landing where no landing was conceivable she watched not trying to explain it not believing what she saw waiting for the upward thrust that would throw him back on his course but the easy gliding circles went on dropping toward a ground she could not see and dared not think of like remnants of broken jaws strings of granite dentures stood between her ship and his she could not tell what lay at the bottom of his spiral motion she knew only that it did not look like but was certain to be the motion of a suicide she saw the sunlight glitter on his wings for an instant then like the body of a man diving chestfirst and arms outstretched serenely abandoned to the sweep of the fall the plane went down and vanished behind the ridges of rock she flew on almost waiting for it to reappear unable to believe that she had witnessed a horrible catastrophe taking place so simply and quietly she flew on to where the plane had dropped it seemed to be a valley in a ring of granite walls she reached the valley and looked down there was no possible place for a landing there was no sign of a plane the bottom of the valley looked like a stretch of the earths crust mangled in the days when the earth was cooling left irretrievable ever since it was a stretch of rocks ground against one another with boulders hanging in precarious formations with long dark crevices and a few contorted pine trees growing halfhorizontally into the air there was no level piece of soil the size of a handkerchief there was no place for a plane to hide there was no remnant of a planes wreck she banked sharply circling above the valley dropping down a little by some trick of light which she could not explain the floor of the valley seemed more clearly visible than the rest of the earth she could distinguish it well enough to know that the plane was not there yet this was not possible she circled dropping down farther she glanced around herand for one frightening moment she thought that it was a quiet summer morning that she was alone lost in a region of the rocky mountains which no plane should ever venture to approach and with the last of her fuel burning away she was looking for a plane that had never existed in quest of a destroyer who had vanished as he always vanished perhaps it was only his vision that had led her here to be destroyed in the next moment she shook her head pressed her mouth tighter and dropped farther she thought that she could not abandon an incalculable wealth such as the brain of quentin daniels on one of those rocks below if he was still alive and within her reach to help she had dropped inside the circle of the valleys walls it was a dangerous job of flying the space was much too tight but she went on circling and dropping lower her life hanging on her eyesight and her eyesight flashing between two tasks searching the floor of the valley and watching the granite walls that seemed about to rip her wings she knew the danger only as part of the job it had no personal meaning any longer the savage thing she felt was almost enjoyment it was the last rage of a lost battle noshe was crying in her mind crying it to the destroyer to the world she had left to the years behind her to the long progression of defeatno no no her eyes swept past the instrument paneland then she sat still but for the sound of a gasp her altimeter had stood at feet the last time she remembered seeing it now it stood at but the floor of the valley had not changed it had come no closer it remained as distant as at her first glance down she knew that the figure meant the level of the ground in this part of colorado she had not noticed the length of her descent she had not noticed that the ground which had seemed too clear and too close from the height was now too dim and too far she was looking at the same rocks from the same perspective they had grown no larger their shadows had not moved and the oddly unnatural light still hung over the bottom of the valley she thought that her altimeter was off and she went on circling downward she saw the needle of her dial moving down she saw the walls of granite moving up she saw the ring of mountains growing higher its peaks coming closer together in the skybut the floor of the valley remained unchanged as if she were dropping down a well with a bottom never to be reached the needle moved to to to to the flash of light that hit her had no source it was as if the air within and beyond the plane became an explosion of blinding cold fire sudden and soundless the shock threw her back her hands off the wheel and over her eyes in the break of an instant when she seized the wheel again the light was gone but her ship was spinning her ears were bursting with silence and her propeller stood stiffly straight before her her motor was dead she tried to pull for a rise but the ship was going downand what she saw flying at her face was not the spread of mangled boulders but the green grass of a field where no field had been before there was no time to see the rest there was no time to think of explanations there was no time to come out of the spin the earth was a green ceiling coming down upon her a few hundred swiftly shrinking feet away flung from side to side like a battered pendulum clinging to the wheel half in her seat half on her knees she fought to pull the ship into a glide for an attempt to make a bellylanding while the green ground was whirling about her sweeping above her then below its spiral coils coming closer her arms pulling at the wheel with no chance to know whether she could succeed with her space and time running outshe felt in a flash of its full violent purity that special sense of existence which had always been hers in a moments consecration to her loveto her rebellious denial of disaster to her love of life and of the matchless value that was herselfshe felt the fiercely proud certainty that she would survive and in answer to the earth that flew to meet her she heard in her mind as her mockery at fate as her cry of defiance the words of the sentence she hatedthe words of defeat of despair and of a plea for help oh hell who is john galt part iii a is a chapter i atlantis when she opened her eyes she saw sunlight green leaves and a mans face she thought i know what this is this was the world as she had expected to see it at sixteenand now she had reached itand it seemed so simple so unastonishing that the thing she felt was like a blessing pronounced upon the universe by means of three words but of course she was looking up at the face of a man who knelt by her side and she knew that in all the years behind her this was what she would have given her life to see a face that bore no mark of pain or fear or guilt the shape of his mouth was pride and more it was as if he took pride in being proud the angular planes of his cheeks made her think of arrogance of tension of scornyet the face had none of these qualities it had their final sum a look of serene determination and of certainty and the look of a ruthless innocence which would not seek forgiveness or grant it it was a face that had nothing to hide or to escape a face with no fear of being seen or of seeing so that the first thing she grasped about him was the intense perceptiveness of his eyeshe looked as if his faculty of sight were his bestloved tool and its exercise were a limitless joyous adventure as if his eyes imparted a superlative value to himself and to the worldto himself for his ability to see to the world for being a place so eagerly worth seeing it seemed to her for a moment that she was in the presence of a being who was pure consciousnessyet she had never been so aware of a mans body the light cloth of his shirt seemed to stress rather than hide the structure of his figure his skin was suntanned his body had the hardness the gaunt tensile strength the clean precision of a foundry casting he looked as if he were poured out of metal but some dimmed softlustered metal like an aluminumcopper alloy the color of his skin blending with the chestnutbrown of his hair the loose strands of the hair shading from brown to gold in the sun and his eyes completing the colors as the one part of the casting left undimmed and harshly lustrous his eyes were the deep dark green of light glinting on metal he was looking down at her with the faint trace of a smile it was not a look of discovery but of familiar contemplationas if he too were seeing the longexpected and the neverdoubted this was her world she thought this was the way men were meant to be and to face their existenceand all the rest of it all the years of ugliness and struggle were only someones senseless joke she smiled at him as at a fellow conspirator in relief in deliverance in radiant mockery of all the things she would never have to consider important again he smiled in answer it was the same smile as her own as if he felt what she felt and knew what she meant we never had to take any of it seriously did we she whispered no we never had to and then her consciousness returning fully she realized that this man was a total stranger she tried to draw away from him but it was only a faint movement of her head on the grass she felt under her hair she tried to rise a shot of pain across her back threw her down again dont move miss taggart youre hurt you know me her voice was impersonal and hard ive known you for many years have i known you yes i think so what is your name john galt she looked at him not moving why are you frightened he asked because i believe it he smiled as if grasping a full confession of the meaning she attached to his name the smile held an adversarys acceptance of a challengeand an adults amusement at the selfdeception of a child she felt as if she were returning to consciousness after a crash that had shattered more than an airplane she could not reassemble the pieces now she could not recall the things she had known about his name she knew only that it stood for a dark vacuum which she would slowly have to fill she could not do it now this man was too blinding a presence like a spotlight that would not let her see the shapes strewn hi the outer darkness was it you that i was following she asked yes she glanced slowly around her she was lying in the grass of a field at the foot of a granite drop that came down from thousands of feet away in the blue sky on the other edge of the field some crags and pines and the glittering leaves of birch trees hid the space that stretched to a distant wall of encircling mountains her plane was not shatteredit was there a few feet away flat on its belly in the grass there was no other plane in sight no structures no sign of human habitation what is this valley she asked he smiled the taggart terminal what do you mean youll find out a dim impulse like the recoil of an antagonist made her want to check on what strength was left to her she could move her arms and legs she could lift her head she felt a stabbing pain when she breathed deeply she saw a thin thread of blood running down her stocking can one get out of this place she asked his voice seemed earnest but the glint of the metalgreen eyes was a smile actuallyno temporarilyyes she made a movement to rise he bent to lift her but she gathered her strength in a swift sudden jolt and slipped out of his grasp struggling to stand up i think i can she started saying and collapsed against him the instant her feet rested on the ground a stab of pain shooting up from an ankle that would not hold her he lifted her in his arms and smiled no you cant miss taggart he said and started off across the field she lay still her arms about him her head on his shoulder and she thought for just a few momentswhile this lastsit is all right to surrender completelyto forget everything and just permit yourself to feel when had she experienced it beforeshe wondered there had been a moment when these had been the words in her mind but she could not remember it now she had known it oncethis feeling of certainty of the final the reached the nottobequestioned but it was new to feel protected and to feel that it was right to accept the protection to surrenderright because this peculiar sense of safety was not protection against the future but against the past not the protection of being spared from battle but of having won it not a protection granted to her weakness but to her strength aware with abnormal intensity of the pressure of his hands against her body of the gold and copper threads of his hair the shadows of his lashes on the skin of his face a few inches away from hers she wondered dimly protected from what its he who was the enemy was he why she did not know she could not think of it now it took an effort to remember that she had had a goal and a motive a few hours ago she forced herself to recapture it did you know that i was following you she asked no where is your plane at the landing field where is the landing field on the other side of the valley there was no landing field in this valley when i looked down there was no meadow either how did it get here he glanced at the sky look carefully do you see anything up there she dropped her head back looking straight into the sky seeing nothing but the peaceful blue of morning after a while she distinguished a few faint strips of shimmering air heat waves she said refractor rays he answered the valley bottom that you saw is a mountain top eight thousand feet high five miles away from here a what a mountain top that no flyer would ever choose for a landing what you saw was its reflection projected over this valley how by the same method as a mirage on a desert an image refracted from a layer of heated air how by a screen of rays calculated against everythingexcept a courage such as yours what do you mean i never thought that any plane would attempt to drop within seven hundred feet of the ground you hit the ray screen some of the rays are the kind that kill magnetic motors well thats the second time you beat me ive never been followed either why do you keep that screen because this place is private property intended to remain as such what is this place ill show it to you now that youre here miss taggart ill answer questions after youve seen it she remained silent she noticed that she had asked questions about every subject but not about him it was as if he were a single whole grasped by her first glance at him like some irreducible absolute like an axiom not to be explained any further as if she knew everything about him by direct perception and what awaited her now was only the process of identifying her knowledge he was carrying her down a narrow trail that went winding to the bottom of the valley on the slopes around them the tall dark pyramids of firs stood immovably straight in masculine simplicity like sculpture reduced to an essential form and they clashed with the complex feminine over detailed lacework of the birch leaves trembling in the sun the leaves let the sunrays fall through to sweep across his hair across both their faces she could not see what lay below beyond the turns of the trail her eyes kept coming back to his face he glanced down at her once in a while at first she looked away as if she had been caught then as if learning it from him she held his glance whenever he chose to look downknowing that he knew what she felt and that he did not hide from her the meaning of his glance she knew that his silence was the same confession as her own he did not hold her in the impersonal manner of a man carrying a wounded woman it was an embrace even though she felt no suggestion of it in his bearing she felt it only by means of her certainty that his whole body was aware of holding hers she heard the sound of the waterfall before she saw the fragile thread that fell in broken strips of glitter down the ledges the sound came through some dim beat in her mind some faint rhythm that seemed no louder than a struggling memorybut they went past and the beat remained she listened to the sound of the water but another sound seemed to grow clearer rising not in her mind but from somewhere among the leaves the trail turned and in a sudden clearing she saw a small house on a ledge below with a flash of sun on the pane of an open window in the moment when she knew what experience had once made her want to surrender to the immediate presentit had been the night in a dusty coach of the comet when she had heard the theme of halleys fifth concerto for the first timeshe knew that she was hearing it now hearing it rise from the keyboard of a piano in the clear sharp chords of someones powerful confident touch she snapped the question at his face as if hoping to catch him unprepared thats the fifth concerto by richard halley isnt it yes when did he write it why dont you ask him that in person is he here its he whos playing it thats his house oh youll meet him later hell be glad to speak to you he knows that his works are the only records you like to play in the evening when you are alone how does he know that i told him the look on her face was like a question that would have begun with how in hell but she saw the look of his eyes and she laughed her laughter giving sound to the meaning of his glance she could not question anything she thought she could not doubt not nownot with the sound of that music rising triumphantly through the sundrenched leaves the music of release of deliverance played as it was intended to be played as her mind had struggled to hear it in a rocking coach through the beat of wounded wheelsit was this that her mind had seen in the sounds that nightthis valley and the morning sun andand then she gasped because the trail had turned and from the height of an open ledge she saw the town on the floor of the valley it was not a town only a cluster of houses scattered at random from the bottom to the rising steps of the mountains that went on rising above their roofs enclosing them within an abrupt impassable circle they were homes small and new with naked angular shapes and the glitter of broad windows far in the distance some structures seemed taller and the faint coils of smoke above them suggested an industrial district but close before her rising on a slender granite column from a ledge below to the level of her eyes blinding her by its glare dimming the rest stood a dollar sign three feet tall made of solid gold it hung in space above the town as its coatofarms its trademark its beaconand it caught the sunrays like some transmitter of energy that sent them in shining blessing to stretch horizontally through the air above the roofs whats that she gasped pointing at the sign oh thats franciscos private joke franciscowho she whispered knowing the answer francisco danconia is he here too he will be any day now what do you mean his joke he gave that sign as an anniversary present to the owner of this place and then we all adopted it as our particular emblem we liked the idea arent you the owner of this place i no he glanced down at the foot of the ledge and added pointing theres the owner of this place coming now a car had stopped at the end of a dirt road below and two men were hurrying up the trail she could not distinguish their faces one of them was slender and tall the other shorter more muscular she lost sight of them behind the twists of the trail as he went on carrying her down to meet them she met them when they emerged suddenly from behind a rocky corner a few feet away the sight of their faces hit her with the abruptness of a collision well ill be goddamned said the muscular man whom she did not know staring at her she was staring at the tall distinguished figure of his companion it was hugh akston it was hugh akston who spoke first bowing to her with a courteous smile of welcome miss taggart this is the first time anyone has ever proved me wrong i didnt knowwhen i told you youd never find him that the next time i saw you you would be in his arms in whose arms why the inventor of the motor she gasped closing her eyes this was one connection she knew she should have made when she opened her eyes she was looking at galt he was smiling family derisively as if he knew fully what this meant to her it would have served you right if youd broken your neck the muscular man snapped at her with the anger of concern almost of affection what a stunt to pullfor a person whod have been admitted here so eagerly if shed chosen to come through the front door miss taggart may i present midas mulligan said galt oh she said weakly and laughed she had no capacity for astonishment any longer do you suppose i was killed in that crashand this is some other kind of existence it is another kind of existence said galt but as for being killed doesnt it seem more like the other way around oh yes she whispered yes she smiled at mulligan where is the front door here he said pointing to his forehead ive lost the key she said simply without resentment ive lost all keys right now youll find them but what in blazes were you doing in that plane following him he pointed at galt yes youre lucky to be alive are you badly hurt i dont think so youll have a few questions to answer after they patch you up he turned brusquely leading the way down to the car then glanced at galt well what do we do now theres something we hadnt provided for the first scab the first what she asked skip it said mulligan and looked at galt what do we do it will be my charge said galt i will be responsible you take quentin daniels oh hes no problem at all he needs nothing but to get acquainted with the place he seems to know all the rest yes he had practically gone the whole way by himself he saw her watching him in bewilderment and said theres one thing i must thank you for miss taggart you did pay me a compliment when you chose quentin daniels as my understudy he was a plausible one where is he she asked will you tell me what happened why midas met us at the landing field drove me to my house and took daniels with him i was going to join them for breakfast but i saw your plane spinning and plunging for that pasture i was the closest one to the scene we got here as fast as we could said mulligan i thought he deserved to get himself killedwhoever was in that plane i never dreamed that it was one of the only two persons in the whole world whom id exempt who is the other one she asked hank rearden she winced it was like a sudden blow from another great distance she wondered why it seemed to her that galt was watching her face intently and that she saw an instants change in his too brief to define they had come to the car it was a hammond convertible its top down one of the costliest models some years old but kept in the shining trim of efficient handling galt placed her cautiously in the back seat and held her in the circle of his arm she felt a stabbing pain once in a while but she had no attention to spare for it she watched the distant houses of the town as mulligan pressed the starter and the car moved forward as they went past the sign of the dollar and a golden ray hit her eyes sweeping over her forehead who is the owner of this place she asked i am said mulligan what is he she pointed to galt mulligan chuckled he just works here and you dr akston she asked he glanced at galt im one of his two fathers miss taggart the one who didnt betray him oh she said as another connection fell into place your third pupil thats right the second assistant bookkeeper she moaned suddenly at one more memory whats that thats what dr stadler called him thats what dr stadler told me he thought his third pupil had become he overestimated said galt im much lower than that by the scale of his standards and of his world the car had swerved into a lane rising toward a lonely house that stood on a ridge above the valley she saw a man walking down a path ahead of them hastening in the direction of the town he wore blue denim overalls and carried a lunchbox there was something faintly familiar in the swift abruptness of his galt as the car went past him she caught a glimpse of his faceand she jerked backward her voice rising to a scream from the pain of the movement and from the shock of the sight oh stop stop dont let him go it was ellis wyatt the three men laughed but mulligan stopped the car oh she said weakly in apology realizing she had forgotten that this was the place from which wyatt would not vanish wyatt was running toward them he had recognized her too when he seized the edge of the car to brake his speed she saw the face and the young triumphant smile that she had seen but once before on the platform of wyatt junction dagny you too at last one of us no said galt miss taggart is a castaway what miss taggarts plane crashed didnt you see it crashedhere yes i heard a plane but i his look of bewilderment changed to a smile regretful amused and friendly i see oh hell dagny its preposterous she was staring at him helplessly unable to reconnect the past to the present and helplesslyas one would say to a dead friend in a dream the words one regrets having missed the chance to say in lifeshe said with the memory of a telephone ringing unanswered almost two years ago the words she had hoped to say if she ever caught sight of him again i i tried to reach you he smiled gently weve been trying to reach you ever since dagny ill see you tonight dont worry i wont vanishand i dont think you will either he waved to the others and went off swinging his lunchbox she glanced up as mulligan started the car and saw galts eyes watching her attentively her face hardened as if in open admission of pain and in defiance of the satisfaction it might give him all right she said i see what sort of show you want to put me through the shock of witnessing but there was neither cruelty nor pity in his face only the level look of justice our first rule here miss taggart he answered is that one must always see for oneself the car stopped in front of the lonely house it was built of rough granite blocks with a sheet of glass for most of its front wall ill send the doctor over said mulligan driving off while galt carried her up the path your house she asked mine he answered kicking the door open he carried her across the threshold into the glistening space of his living room where shafts of sunlight hit walls of polished pine she saw a few pieces of furniture made by hand a ceiling of bare rafters an archway open upon a small kitchen with rough shelves a bare wooden table and the astonishing sight of chromium glittering on an electric stove the place had the primitive simplicity of a frontiersmans cabin reduced to essential necessities but reduced with a supermodern skill he carried her across the sunrays into a small guest room and placed her down on a bed she noticed a window open upon a long slant of rocky steps and pines going off into the sky she noticed small streaks that looked like inscriptions cut into the wood of the walls a few scattered lines that seemed made by different handwritings she could not distinguish the words she noticed another door left halfopen it led to his bedroom am i a guest here or a prisoner she asked the choice will be yours miss taggart i can make no choice when im dealing with a stranger but youre not didnt you name a railroad line after me oh yes it was the small jolt of another connection falling into place yes i she was looking at the tall figure with the sunstreaked hair with the suppressed smile in the mercilessly perceptive eyesshe was seeing the struggle to build her line and the summer day of the first trains runshe was thinking that if a human figure could be fashioned as an emblem of that line this was the figure yes i did then remembering the rest she added but i named it after an enemy he smiled thats the contradiction you had to resolve sooner or later miss taggart it was you wasnt it who destroyed my line why no it was the contradiction she closed her eyes in a moment she asked all those stories i heard about youwhich of them were true all of them was it you who spread them no what for i never had any wish to be talked about but you do know that youve become a legend yes the young inventor of the twentieth century motor company is the one real version of the legend isnt it the one thats concretely realyes she could not say it indifferently there was still a breathless tone and the drop of her voice toward a whisper when she asked the motor the motor i found it was you who made it yes she could not prevent the jolt of eagerness that threw her head up the secret of transforming energy she began and stopped i could tell it to you in fifteen minutes he said in answer to the desperate plea she had not uttered but theres no power on earth that can force me to tell it if you understand this youll understand everything thats baffling you that night twelve years ago a spring night when you walked out of a meeting of six thousand murderersthat story is true isnt it yes you told them that you would stop the motor of the world i have what have you done ive done nothing miss taggart and thats the whole of my secret she looked at him silently for a long moment he stood waiting as if he could read her thoughts the destroyer she said in a tone of wonder and helplessness the most evil creature thats ever existed he said in the tone of a quotation and she recognized her own words the man whos draining the brains of the world how thoroughly have you been watching me she asked and for how long it was only an instants pause his eyes did not move but it seemed to her that his glance was stressed as if in special awareness of seeing her and she caught the sound of some particular intensity in his voice as he answered quietly for years she closed her eyes relaxing and giving up she felt an odd lighthearted indifference as if she suddenly wanted nothing but the comfort of surrendering to helplessness the doctor who arrived was a grayhaired man with a mild thoughtful face and a firmly unobtrusively confident manner miss taggart may i present dr hendricks said galt not dr thomas hendricks she gasped with the involuntary rudeness of a child the name belonged to a great surgeon who had retired and vanished six years ago yes of course said galt dr hendricks smiled at her in answer midas told me that miss taggart has to be treated for shock he said not for the one sustained but for the ones to come ill leave you to do it said galt while i go to the market to get supplies for breakfast she watched the rapid efficiency of dr hendricks work as he examined her injuries he had brought an object she had never seen before a portable xray machine she learned that she had torn the cartilage of two ribs that she had sprained an ankle ripped patches of skin off one knee and one elbow and acquired a few bruises spread in purple blotches over her body by the time dr hendricks swift competent hands had wound the bandages and the tight lacings of tape she felt as if her body were an engine checked by an expert mechanic and no further care was necessary i would advise you to remain in bed miss taggart oh no if im careful and move slowly ill be all right you ought to rest do you think i can he smiled i guess not she was dressed by the time galt came back dr hendricks gave him an account of her condition adding ill be back to check up tomorrow thanks said galt send the bill to me certainly not she said indignantly i will pay it myself the two men glanced at each other in amusement as at the boast of a beggar well discuss that later said galt dr hendricks left and she tried to stand up limping catching at the furniture for support galt lifted her in his arms carried her to the kitchen alcove and placed her on a chair by the table set for two she noticed that she was hungry at the sight of the coffee pot boiling on the stove the two glasses of orange juice the heavy white pottery dishes sparkling in the sun on the polished table top when did you sleep or eat last he asked i dont know i had dinner on the train with she shook her head in helplessly bitter amusement with the tramp she thought with a desperate voice pleading for escape from an avenger who would not pursue or be foundthe avenger who sat facing her across the table drinking a glass of orange juice i dont know it seems centuries and continents away how did you happen to be following me i landed at the alton airport just as you were taking off the man there told me that quentin daniels had gone with you i remember your plane circling to land but that was the one and only time when i didnt think of you i thought you were coming by train she asked looking straight at him how do you want me to understand that what the one and only time when you didnt think of me he held her glance she saw the faint movement she had noted as typical of him the movement of his proudly intractable mouth curving into the hint of a smile in any way you wish he answered she let a moment pass to underscore her choice by the severity of her face then asked coldly in the tone of an enemys accusation you knew that i was coming for quentin daniels yes you got him first and fast in order not to let me reach him in order to beat meknowing fully what sort of beating that would mean for me sure it was she who looked away and remained silent he rose to cook the rest of their breakfast she watched him as he stood at the stove toasting bread frying eggs and bacon there was an easy relaxed skill about the way he worked but it was a skill that belonged to another profession his hands moved with the rapid precision of an engineer pulling the levers of a control board she remembered suddenly where she had seen as expert and preposterous a performance is that what you learned from dr akston she asked pointing at the stove that among other things did he teach you to spend your timeyour time she could not keep the shudder of indignation out of her voiceon this sort of work ive spent time on work of much lesser importance when he put her plate before her she asked where did you get that food do they have a grocery store here the best one in the world its run by lawrence hammond what lawrence hammond of hammond cars the bacon is from the farm of dwight sandersof sanders aircraft the eggs and the butter from judge narragansettof the superior court of the state of illinois she looked at her plate bitterly almost as if she were afraid to touch it its the most expensive breakfast ill ever eat considering the value of the cooks time and of all those others yesfrom one aspect but from another its the cheapest breakfast youll ever eatbecause no part of it has gone to feed the looters wholl make you pay for it through year after year and leave you to starve in the end after a long silence she asked simply almost wistfully what is it that youre all doing here living she had never heard that word sound so real what is your job she asked midas mulligan said that you work here im the handy man i guess the what im on call whenever anything goes wrong with any of the installationswith the power system for instance she looked at himand suddenly she tore forward staring at the electric stove but fell back on her chair stopped by pain he chuckled yes thats truebut take it easy or dr hendricks will order you back to bed the power system she said choking the power system here its run by means of your motor yes its built its working its functioning it has cooked your breakfast i want to see it dont bother crippling yourself to look at that stove its just a plain electric stove like any other only about a hundred times cheaper to run and thats all youll have a chance to see miss taggart you promised to show me this valley ill show it to you but not the power generator will you take me to see the place now as soon as we finish if you wishand if youre able to move i am he got up went to the telephone and dialed a number hello midas yes he did yes shes all right will you rent me your car for the day thanks at the usual ratetwentyfive cents can you send it over do you happen to have some sort of cane shell need it tonight yes i think so we will thanks he hung up she was staring at him incredulously did i understand you to say that mr mulliganwhos worth about two hundred million dollars i believeis going to charge you twentyfive cents for the use of his car thats right good heavens couldnt he give it to you as a courtesy he sat looking at her for a moment studying her face as if deliberately letting her see the amusement in his miss taggart he said we have no laws in this valley no rules no formal organization of any kind we come here because we want to rest but we have certain customs which we all observe because they pertain to the things we need to rest from so ill warn you now that there is one word which is forbidden in this valley the word give im sorry she said youre right he refilled her cup of coffee and extended a package of cigarettes she smiled as she took a cigarette it bore the sign of the dollar if youre not too tired by evening he said mulligan has invited us for dinner hell have some guests there whom i think youll want to meet oh of course i wont be too tired i dont think ill ever feel tired again they were finishing breakfast when she saw mulligans car stopping in front of the house the driver leaped out raced up the path and rushed into the room not pausing to ring or knock it took her a moment to realize that the eager breathless disheveled young man was quentin daniels miss taggart he gasped im sorry the desperate guilt in his voice clashed with the joyous excitement in his face ive never broken my word before theres no excuse for it i cant ask you to forgive me and i know that you wont believe it but the truth is that ii forgot she glanced at galt i believe you i forgot that i promised to wait i forgot everythinguntil a few minutes ago when mr mulligan told me that youd crashed here in a plane and then i knew it was my fault and if anything had happened to youoh god are you all right yes dont worry sit down i dont know how one can forget ones word of honor i dont know what happened to me i do miss taggart i had been working on it for months on that one particular hypothesis and the more i worked the more hopeless it seemed to become id been in my laboratory for the last two days trying to solve a mathematical equation that looked impossible i felt id die at that blackboard but wouldnt give up it was late at night when he came in i dont think i even noticed him not really he said he wanted to speak to me and i asked him to wait and went right on i think i forgot his presence i dont know how long he stood there watching me but what i remember is that suddenly his hand reached over swept all my figures off the blackboard and wrote one brief equation and then i noticed him then i screamedbecause it wasnt the full answer to the motor but it was the way to it a way i hadnt seen hadnt suspected but i knew where it led i remember i cried how could you know itand he answered pointing at a photograph of your motor im the man who made it in the first place and thats the last i remember miss taggarti mean the last i remember of my own existence because after that we talked about static electricity and the conversion of energy and the motor we talked physics all the way down here said galt oh i remember when you asked me whether id go with you said daniels whether id be willing to go and never come back and give up everything everything give up a dead institute thats crumbling back into the jungle give up my future as a janitorslavebylaw give up wesley mouch and directive and subanimal creatures who crawl on their bellies grunting that there is no mind miss taggarthe laughed exultantlyhe was asking me whether id give that up to go with him he had to ask it twice i couldnt believe it at first i couldnt believe that any human being would need to be asked or would think of it as a choice to go i would have leaped off a skyscraper just to follow himand to hear his formula before we hit the pavement i dont blame you she said she looked at him with a tinge of wistfulness that was almost envy besides youve fulfilled your contract youve led me to the secret of the motor im going to be a janitor here too said daniels grinning happily mr mulligan said hed give me the job of janitorat the power plant and when i learn ill rise to electrician isnt he greatmidas mulligan thats what i want to be when i reach his age i want to make money i want to make millions i want to make as much as he did daniels she laughed remembering the quiet selfcontrol the strict precision the stern logic of the young scientist she had known whats the matter with you where are you do you know what youre saying im here miss taggartand theres no limit to whats possible here im going to be the greatest electrician in the world and the richest im going to youre going to go back to mulligans house said galt and sleep for twentyfour hoursor i wont let you near the power plant yes sir said daniels meekly the sun had trickled down the peaks and drawn a circle of shining granite and glittering snow to enclose the valleywhen they stepped out of the house she felt suddenly as if nothing existed beyond that circle and she wondered at the joyous proud comfort to be found in a sense of the finite in the knowledge that the field of ones concern lay within the realm of ones sight she wanted to stretch out her arms over the roofs of the town below feeling that her fingertips would touch the peaks across but she could not raise her arms leaning on a cane with one hand and on galts arm with the other moving her feet by a slow conscientious effort she walked down to the car like a child learning to walk for the first time she sat by galts side as he drove skirting the town to midas mulligans house it stood on a ridge the largest house of the valley the only one built two stories high an odd combination of fortress and pleasure resort with stout granite walls and broad open terraces he stopped to let daniels off then drove on up a winding road rising slowly into the mountains it was the thought of mulligans wealth the luxurious car and the sight of galts hands on the wheel that made her wonder for the first time whether galt too was wealthy she glanced at his clothes the gray slacks and white shirt seemed of a quality intended for long wear the leather of the narrow belt about his waistline was cracked the watch on his wrist was a precision instrument but made of plain stainless steel the sole suggestion of luxury was the color of his hairthe strands stirring in the wind like liquid gold and copper abruptly behind a turn of the road she saw the green acres of pastures stretching to a distant farmhouse there were herds of sheep some horses the fenced squares of pigpens under the sprawling shapes of wooden barns and farther away a metal hangar of a type that did not belong on a farm a man in a bright cowboy shirt was hurrying toward them galt stopped the car and waved to him but said nothing in answer to her questioning glance he let her discover for herself when the man came closer that it was dwight sanders hello miss taggart he said smiling she looked silently at his rolled shirt sleeves at his heavy boots at the herds of cattle so thats all thats left of sanders aircraft she said why no theres that excellent monoplane my best model which you flattened up in the foothills oh you know about that yes it was one of yours it was a wonderful ship but im afraid ive damaged it pretty badly you ought to have it fixed i think ive ripped the bottom nobody can fix it i can these were the words and the tone of confidence that she had not heard for years this was the manner she had given up expectingbut the start of her smile ended in a bitter chuckle how she asked on a hog farm why no at sanders aircraft where is it where did you think it was in that building in new jersey which tinky holloways cousin bought from my bankrupt successors by means of a government loan and a tax suspension in that building where he produced six planes that never left the ground and eight that did but crashed with forty passengers each where is it then wherever i am he pointed across the road glancing down through the tops of the pine trees she saw the concrete rectangle of an airfield on the bottom of the valley we have a few planes here and its my job to take care of them he said im the hog farmer and the airfield attendant im doing quite well at producing ham and bacon without the men from whom i used to buy it but those men cannot produce airplanes without meand without me they cannot even produce their ham and bacon but youyou have not been designing airplanes either no i havent and i havent been manufacturing the diesel engines i once promised you since the time i saw you last i have designed and manufactured just one new tractor i mean onei tooled it by handno mass production was necessary but that tractor has cut an eighthour workday down to four hours onthe straight line of his arm extended to point across the valley moved like a royal scepter her eyes followed it and she saw the terraced green of hanging gardens on a distant mountainsidethe chicken and dairy farm of judge narragansetthis arm moved slowly to a long flat stretch of greenish gold at the foot of a canyon then to a band of violent greenin the wheat fields and tobacco patch of midas mulliganhis arm rose to a granite flank striped by glistening tiers of leavesin the orchards of richard halley her eyes went slowly over the curve his arm had traveled over and over again long after the arm had dropped but she said only i see now do you believe that i can fix your plane he asked yes but have you seen it sure midas called two doctors immediatelyhendricks for you and me for your plane it can be fixed but it will be an expensive job how much two hundred dollars two hundred dollars she repeated incredulously the price seemed much too low in gold miss taggart oh well where can i buy the gold you cant said galt she jerked her head to face him defiantly no no not where you come from your laws forbid it yours dont no then sell it to me choose your own rate of exchange name any sum you wantin my money what money youre penniless miss taggart what it was a word that a taggart heiress could not ever expect to hear youre penniless in this valley you own millions of dollars in taggart transcontinental stockbut it will not buy one pound of bacon from the sanders hog farm see galt smiled and turned to sanders go ahead and fix that plane miss taggart will pay for it eventually he pressed the starter and drove on while she sat stiffly straight asking no questions a stretch of violent turquoise blue split the cliffs ahead ending the road it took her a second to realize that it was a lake the motionless water seemed to condense the blue of the sky and the green of the pinecovered mountains into so brilliantly pure a color that it made the sky look a dimmed pale gray a streak of boiling foam came from among the pines and went crashing down the rocky steps to vanish in the placid water a small granite structure stood by the stream galt stopped the car just as a husky man in overalls stepped out to the threshold of the open doorway it was dick mcnamara who had once been her best contractor good day miss taggart he said happily im glad to see that you werent hurt badly she inclined her head in silent greetingit was like a greeting to the loss and the pain of the past to a desolate evening and the desperate face of eddie willers telling her the news of this mans disappearancehurt badly she thoughti was but not in the plane crashon that evening in an empty office aloud she asked what are you doing here what was it that you betrayed me for at the worst time possible he smiled pointing at the stone structure and down at the rocky drop where the tube of a water main went vanishing into the underbrush im the utilities man he said i take care of the water lines the power lines and the telephone service alone used to but weve grown so much in the past year that ive had to hire three men to help me what men from where well one of them is a professor of economics who couldnt get a job outside because he taught that you cant consume more than you have producedone is a professor of history who couldnt get a job because he taught that the inhabitants of slums were not the men who made this countryand one is a professor of psychology who couldnt get a job because he taught that men are capable of thinking they work for you as plumbers and linesmen youd be surprised how good they are at it and to whom have they abandoned our colleges to those whore wanted there he chuckled how long ago was it that i betrayed you miss taggart not quite three years ago wasnt it its the john galt line that i refused to build for you where is your line now but my lines have grown in that time from the couple of miles that mulligan had built when i took over to hundreds of miles of pipe and wire all within the space of this valley he saw the swift involuntary look of eagerness on her face the look of a competent persons appreciation he smiled glanced at her companion and said softly you know miss taggart when it comes to the john galt linemaybe its i whove followed it and you whore betraying it she glanced at galt he was watching her face but she could read nothing in his as they drove on along the edge of the lake she asked youve mapped this route deliberately havent you youre showing me all the men whomshe stopped feeling inexplicably reluctant to say it and said insteadwhom i have lost im showing you all the men whom i have taken away from you he answered firmly this was the root she thought of the guiltlessness of his face he had guessed and named the words she had wanted to spare him he had rejected a good will that was not based on his valuesand in proud certainty of being right he had made a boast of that which she had intended as an accusation ahead of them she saw a wooden pier projecting into the water of the lake a young woman lay stretched on the sunflooded planks watching a battery of fishing rods she glanced up at the sound of the car then leaped to her feet in a single swift movement a shade too swift and ran to the road she wore slacks rolled above the knees of her bare legs she had dark disheveled hair and large eyes galt waved to her hello john when did you get in she called this morning he answered smiling and driving on dagny jerked her head to look back and saw the glance with which the young woman stood looking after galt and even though hopelessness serenely accepted was part of the worship in that glance she experienced a feeling she had never known before a stab of jealousy who is that she asked our best fishwife she provides the fish for hammonds grocery market what else is she youve noticed that theres a what else for every one of us here shes a writer the kind of writer who wouldnt be published outside she believes that when one deals with words one deals with the mind the car turned into a narrow path climbing steeply into a wilderness of brush and pine trees she knew what to expect when she saw a handmade sign nailed to a tree with an arrow pointing the way the buena esperanza pass it was not a pass it was a wall of laminated rock with a complex chain of pipes pumps and valves climbing like a vine up its narrow ledges but it bore on its crest a huge wooden signand the proud violence of the letters announcing their message to an impassable tangle of ferns and pine branches was more characteristic more familiar than the words wyatt oil it was oil that ran in a glittering curve from the mouth of a pipe into a tank at the foot of the wall as the only confession of the tremendous secret struggle inside the stone as the unobtrusive purpose of all the intricate machinerybut the machinery did not resemble the installations of an oil derrick and she knew that she was looking at the unborn secret of the buena esperanza pass she knew that this was oil drawn out of shale by some method men had considered impossible ellis wyatt stood on a ridge watching the glass dial of a gauge imbedded in the rock he saw the car stopping below and called hi dagny be with you in a minute there were two other men working with him a big muscular roughneck at a pump halfway up the wall and a young boy by the tank on the ground the young boy had blond hair and a face with an unusual purity of form she felt certain that she knew this face but she could not recall where she had seen it the boy caught her puzzled glance grinned and as if to help her whistled softly almost inaudibly the first notes of halleys fifth concerto it was the young brakeman of the comet she laughed it was the fifth concerto by richard halley wasnt it sure he answered but do you think id tell that to a scab a what what am i paying you for asked ellis wyatt approaching the boy chuckled darting back to seize the lever he had abandoned for a moment its miss taggart who couldnt fire you if you loafed on the job lean thats one of the reasons why i quit the railroad miss taggart said the boy did you know that i stole him from you said wyatt he used to be your best brakeman and now hes my best greasemonkey but neither one of us is going to hold him permanently who is richard halley music hes halleys best pupil she smiled i know this is a place where one employs nothing but aristocrats for the lousiest kinds of jobs theyre all aristocrats thats true said wyatt because they know that theres no such thing as a lousy jobonly lousy men who dont care to do it the roughneck was watching them from above listening with curiosity she glanced up at him he looked like a truck driver so she asked what were you outside a professor of comparative philology i suppose no maam he answered i was a truck driver he added but thats not what i wanted to remain ellis wyatt was looking at the place around them with a kind of youthful pride eager for acknowledgment it was the pride of a host at a formal reception in a drawing room and the eagerness of an artist at the opening of his show in a gallery she smiled and asked pointing at the machinery shale oil uhhuh thats the process which you were working to develop while you were on earth she said it involuntarily and she gasped a little at her own words he laughed while i was in hellyes im on earth now how much do you produce two hundred barrels a day a note of sadness came back into her voice its the process by which you once intended to fill five tanktrains a day dagny he said earnestly pointing at his tank one gallon of it is worth more than a trainful back there in hellbecause this is mine all of it every single drop of it to be spent on nothing but myself he raised his smudged hand displaying the greasy stains as a treasure and a black drop on the tip of his finger flashed like a gem in the sun mine he said have you let them beat you into forgetting what that word means what it feels like you should give yourself a chance to relearn it youre hidden in a hole in the wilderness she said bleakly and youre producing two hundred barrels of oil when you could have flooded the world with it what for to feed the looters no to earn the fortune you deserve but im richer now than i was in the world whats wealth but the means of expanding ones life theres two ways one can do it either by producing more or by producing it faster and thats what im doing im manufacturing time what do you mean im producing everything i need im working to improve my methods and every hour i save is an hour added to my life it used to take me five hours to fill that tank it now takes three the two i saved are mineas pricelessly mine as if i moved my grave two further hours away for every five ive got its two hours released from one task to be invested in anothertwo more hours in which to work to grow to move forward thats the savings account im hoarding is there any sort of safety vault that could protect this account in the outside world but what space do you have for moving forward wheres your market he chuckled market i now work for use not for profitmy use not the looters profit only those who add to my life not those who devour it are my market only those who produce not those who consume can ever be anybodys market i deal with the lifegivers not with the cannibals if my oil takes less effort to produce i ask less of the men to whom i trade it for the things i need i add an extra span of time to their lives with every gallon of my oil that they burn and since theyre men like me they keep inventing faster ways to make the things they makeso every one of them grants me an added minute hour or day with the bread i buy from them with the clothes the lumber the metalhe glanced at galtan added year with every month of electricity i purchase thats our market and thats how it works for usbut that was not the way it worked in the outer world down what drain were they poured out there our days our lives and our energy into what bottomless futureless sewer of the unpaidfor here we trade achievements not failuresvalues not needs were free of one another yet we all grow together wealth dagny what greater wealth is there than to own your me and to spend it on growing every living thing must grow it cant stand still it must grow or perish look he pointed at a plant fighting upward from under the weight of a rocka long gnarled stem contorted by an unnatural struggle with drooping yellow remnants of unformed leaves and a single green shoot thrust upward to the sun with the desperation of a last spent inadequate effort thats what theyre doing to us back there in hell do you see me submitting to it no she whispered do you see him submitting he pointed at galt god no then dont be astonished by anything you see in this valley she remained silent when they drove on galt said nothing on a distant mountainside in the dense green of a forest she saw a pine tree slanting down suddenly tracing a curve like the hand of a clock then crashing abruptly out of sight she knew that it was a manmade motion whos the lumberjack around here she asked ted nielsen the road was relaxing into wider curves and gentler grades among the softer shapes of hillsides she saw a rustbrown slope patched by two squares of unmatching green the dark dusty green of potato plants and the pale greenishsilver of cabbages a man in a red shirt was riding a small tractor cutting weeds whos the cabbage tycoon she asked roger marsh she closed her eyes she thought of the weeds that were climbing up the steps of a closed factory over its lustrous tile front a few hundred miles away beyond the mountains the road was descending to the bottom of the valley she saw the roofs of the town straight below and the small shining spot of the dollar sign in the distance at the other end galt stopped the car in front of the first structure on a ledge above the roofs a brick building with a faint tinge of red trembling over its smokestack it almost shocked her to see so logical a sign as stockton foundry above its door when she walked leaning on her cane out of the sunlight into the dank gloom of the building the shock she felt was part sense of anachronism part homesickness this was the industrial east which in the last few hours had seemed to be centuries behind her this was the old the familiar the loved sight of reddish billows rising to steel rafters of sparks shooting in sunbursts from invisible sources of sudden flames streaking through a black fog of sand molds glowing with white metal the fog hid the walls of the structure dissolving its sizeand for a moment this was the great dead foundry at stockton colorado it was nielsen motors it was rearden steel hi dagny the smiling face that approached her out of the fog was andrew stocktons and she saw a grimy hand extended to her with a gesture of confident pride as if it held all of her moments vision on its palm she clasped the hand hello she said softly not knowing whether she was greeting the past or the future then she shook her head and added how come youre not planting potatoes or making shoes around here youve actually remained in your own profession oh calvin atwood of the atwood light and power company of new york city is making the shoes besides my profession is one of the oldest and most immediately needed anywhere still i had to fight for it i had to ruin a competitor first what he grinned and pointed to the glass door of a sunflooded room theres my ruined competitor he said she saw a young man bent over a long table working on a complex model for the mold of a drill head he had the slender powerful hands of a concert pianist and the grim face of a surgeon concentrating on his task hes a sculptor said stockton when i came here he and his partner had a sort of combination handforge and repair shop i opened a real foundry and took all their customers away from them the boy couldnt do the kind of job i did it was only a parttime business for him anywaysculpture is his real businessso he came to work for me hes making more money now in shorter hours than he used to make in his own foundry his partner was a chemist so he went into agriculture and hes produced a chemical fertilizer thats doubled some of the crops around heredid you mention potatoespotatoes in particular then somebody could put you out of business too sure any time i know one man who could and probably will when he gets here but boyid work for him as a cinder sweeper hed blast through this valley like a rocket hed triple everybodys production whos that hank rearden yes she whispered oh yes she wondered what had made her say it with such immediate certainty she felt simultaneously that hank reardens presence in this valley was impossibleand that this was his place peculiarly his this was the place of his youth of his start and together the place he had been seeking all his life the land he had struggled to reach the goal of his tortured battle it seemed to her that the spirals of flame tinged fog were drawing time into an odd circleand while a dim thought went floating through her mind like the streamer of an unfollowed sentence to hold an unchanging youth is to reach at the end the vision with which one startedshe heard the voice of a tramp in a diner saying john galt found the fountain of youth which he wanted to bring down to men only he never came back because he found that it couldnt be brought down a sheaf of sparks went up in the depth of the fogand she saw the broad back of a foreman whose arm made the sweeping gesture of a signal directing some invisible task he jerked his head to snap an ordershe caught a glimpse of his profileand she caught her breath stockton saw it chuckled and called into the fog hey ken come here heres an old friend of yours she looked at ken danagger as he approached them the great industrialist whom she had tried so desperately to hold to his desk was now dressed in smudged overalls hello miss taggart i told you wed soon meet again her head dropped as if in assent and in greeting but her hand bore down heavily upon her cane for a moment while she stood reliving their last encounter the tortured hour of waiting then the gently distant face at the desk and the tinkling of a glasspaneled door closing upon a stranger it was so brief a moment that two of the men before her could take it only as a greetingbut it was at galt that she looked when she raised her head and she saw him looking at her as if he knew what she feltshe saw him seeing in her face the realization that it was he who had walked out of danaggers office that day his face gave her nothing in answer it had that look of respectful severity with which a man stands before the fact that the truth is the truth i didnt expect it she said softly to danagger i never expected to see you again danagger was watching her as if she were a promising child he had once discovered and was now affectionately amused to watch i know he said but why are you so shocked i oh its just that its preposterous she pointed at his clothes whats wrong with it is this then the end of your road hell no the beginning what are you aiming at mining not coal though iron where he pointed toward the mountains right here did you ever know midas mulligan to make a bad investment youd be surprised what one can find in that stretch of rock if one knows how to look thats what ive been doinglooking and if you dont find any iron ore he shrugged theres other things to do ive always been short on time in my life never on what to use it for she glanced at stockton with curiosity arent you training a man who could become your most dangerous competitor thats the only sort of men i like to hire dagny have you lived too long among the looters have you come to think that one mans ability is a threat to another oh no but i thought i was almost the only one left who didnt think that any man whos afraid of hiring the best ability he can find is a cheat whos in a business where he doesnt belong to methe foulest man on earth more contemptible than a criminal is the employer who rejects men for being too good thats what ive always thought andsay what are you laughing at she was listening to him with an eager incredulous smile its so startling to hear she said because its so right what else can one think she chuckled softly you know when i was a child i expected every businessman to think it and since then since then ive learned not to expect it but its right isnt it ive learned not to expect the right but it stands to reason doesnt it ive given up expecting reason thats what one must never give up said ken danagger they had returned to the car and had started down the last descending curves of the road when she glanced at galt and he turned to her at once as if he had expected it it was you in danaggers office that day wasnt it she asked yes did you know then that i was waiting outside yes did you know what it was like to wait behind that closed door she could not name the nature of the glance with which he looked at her it was not pity because she did not seem to be its object it was the kind of glance with which one looks at suffering but it was not her suffering that he seemed to be seeing oh yes he answered quietly almost lightly the first shop to rise by the side of the valleys single street was like the sudden sight of an open theater a frame box without front wall its stage set in the bright colors of a musical comedywith red cubes green circles gold triangles which were bins of tomatoes barrels of lettuce pyramids of oranges and a spangled backdrop where the sun hit shelves of metal containers the name on the marquee said hammond grocery market a distinguished man in shirt sleeves with a stern profile and gray temples was weighing a chunk of butter for an attractive young woman who stood at the counter her posture light as a show girls the skirt of her cotton dress swelling faintly in the wind like a dance costume dagny smiled involuntarily even though the man was lawrence hammond the shops were small onestory structures and as they moved past her she caught familiar names on their signs like headings on the pages of a book riffled by the cars motion mulligan general storeatwood leather goodsnielsen lumberthen the sign of the dollar above the door of a small brick factory with the inscription mulligan tobacco company whos the company besides midas mulligan she asked dr akston he answered there were few passersby some men fewer women and they walked with purposeful swiftness as if bound on specific errands one after another they stopped at the sight of the car they waved to galt and they looked at her with the unastonished curiosity of recognition have i been expected here for a long time she asked you still are he answered on the edge of the road she saw a structure made of glass sheets held together by a wooden framework but for one instant it seemed to her that it was only a frame for the painting of a womana tall fragile woman with pale blond hair and a face of such beauty that it seemed veiled by distance as if the artist had been merely able to suggest it not to make it quite real in the next instant the woman moved her headand dagny realized that there were people at the tables inside the structure that it was a cafeteria that the woman stood behind the counter and that she was kay ludlow the movie star who once seen could never be forgotten the star who had retired and vanished five years ago to be replaced by girls of indistinguishable names and interchangeable faces but at the shock of the realization dagny thought of the sort of movies that were now being madeand then she felt that the glass cafeteria was a cleaner use for kay ludlows beauty than a role in a picture glorifying the commonplace for possessing no glory the building that came next was a small squat block of rough granite sturdy solid neatly built the lines of its rectangular bulk as severely precise as the creases of a formal garmentbut she saw like an instants ghost the long streak of a skyscraper rising into the coils of chicagos fog the skyscraper that had once borne the sign she now saw written in gold letters above a modest pinewood door mulligan bank galt slowed the car while moving past the bank as if placing the motion in some special italics a small brick structure came next bearing the sign mulligan mint a mint she asked whats mulligan doing with a mint galt reached into his pocket and dropped two small coins into the palm of her hand they were miniature disks of shining gold smaller than pennies the kind that had not been in circulation since the days of nat taggart they bore the head of the statue of liberty on one side the words united states of americaone dollar on the other but the dates stamped upon them were of the past two years thats the money we use here he said its minted by midas mulligan but on whose authority thats stated on the coinon both sides of it what do you use for small change mulligan mints that too in silver we dont accept any other currency in this valley we accept nothing but objective values she was studying the coins this looks like like something from the first morning in the age of my ancestors he pointed at the valley yes doesnt it she sat looking at the two thin delicate almost weightless drops of gold in the palm of her hand knowing that the whole of the taggart transcontinental system had rested upon them that this had been the keystone supporting all the keystones all the arches all the girders of the taggart track the taggart bridge the taggart building she shook her head and slipped the coins back into his hand youre not making it easier for me she said her voice low im making it as hard as possible why dont you say it why dont you tell me all the things you want me to learn the gesture of his arm pointed at the town at the road behind them what have i been doing he asked they drove on in silence after a while she asked in the tone of a dryly statistical inquiry how much of a fortune has midas mulligan amassed in this valley he pointed ahead judge for yourself the road was winding through stretches of unleveled soil toward the homes of the valley the homes were not lined along a street they were spread at irregular intervals over the rises and hollows of the ground they were small and simple built of local materials mostly of granite and pine with a prodigal ingenuity of thought and a tight economy of physical effort every house looked as if it had been put up by the labor of one man no two houses were alike and the only quality they had in common was the stamp of a mind grasping a problem and solving it galt pointed out a house once in a while choosing the names she knewand it sounded to her like a list of quotations from the richest stock exchange in the world or like a roll call of honor ken danagger ted nielsen lawrence hammond roger marsh ellis wyatt owen kellogg dr akston the home of dr akston was the last a small cottage with a large terrace lifted on the crest of a wave against the rising walls of the mountains the road went past it and climbed on into the coils of an ascending grade the pavement shrank to a narrow path between two walls of ancient pines their tall straight trunks pressing against it like a grim colonnade their branches meeting above swallowing the path into sudden silence and twilight there were no marks of wheels on the thin strip of earth it looked unused and forgotten a few minutes and a few turns seemed to take the car miles away from human habitationand then there was nothing to break the pressure of the stillness but a rare wedge of sunlight cutting across the trunks in the depth of the forest once in a while the sudden sight of a house on the edge of the path struck her like the shock of an unexpected sound built in loneliness cut off from all ties to human existence it looked like the secret retreat of some great defiance or sorrow it was the humblest home of the valley a log cabin beaten in dark streaks by the tears of many rains only its great windows withstanding the storms with the smooth shining untouched serenity of glass whose house is ohshe caught her breath and jerked her head away above the door hit by a ray of sun its design blurred and worn battered smooth by the winds of centuries hung the silver coat ofarms of sebastian danconia as if in deliberate answer to her involuntary movement of escape galt stopped the car in front of the house for a moment they held each others eyes her glance was a question his a command her face had a defiant frankness his an unrevealing severity she understood his purpose but not his motive she obeyed leaning on her cane she stepped out of the car then stood erect facing the house she looked at the silver crest that had come from a marble palace in spain to a shack in the andes to a log cabin in coloradothe crest of the men who would not submit the door of the cabin was locked the sun did not reach into the glazed darkness beyond the windows and pine branches hung outstretched above the roof like arms spread in protection in compassion in solemn blessing with no sound but the snap of a twig or the ring of a drop falling somewhere in the forest through long stretches of moments the silence seemed to hold all the pain that had been hidden here but never given voice she stood listening with a gentle resigned unlamenting respect lets see wholl do greater honor youto nat taggart or ito sebastian danconia dagny help me to remain to refuse even though hes right she turned to look at galt knowing that he was the man against whom she had had no help to offer he sat at the wheel of the car he had not followed her or moved to assist her as if he had wanted her to acknowledge the past and had respected the privacy of her lonely salute she noticed that he still sat as she had left him his forearm leaning against the wheel at the same angle the fingers of his hand hanging down in the same sculptured position his eyes were watching her but that was all she could read in his face that he had watched her intently without moving when she was seated beside him once more he said that was the first man i took away from you she asked her face stern open and quietly defiant how much do you know about that nothing that he told me in words everything that the tone of his voice told me whenever he spoke of you she inclined her head she had caught the sound of suffering in the faintest exaggeration of evenness in his voice he pressed the starter the motors explosion blasted the story contained in the silence and they drove on the path widened a little streaming toward a pool of sunlight ahead she saw a brief glitter of wires among the branches as they drove out into a clearing an unobtrusive little structure stood against a hillside on a rising slant of rocky ground it was a simple cube of granite the size of a toolshed it had no windows no apertures of any kind only a door of polished steel and a complex set of wire antennae branching out from the roof galt was driving past leaving it unnoticed when she asked with a sudden start whats that she saw the faint break of his smile the powerhouse oh stop please he obeyed backing the car to the foot of the hillside it was her first few steps up the rocky incline that stopped her as if there were no need to move forward no further place to riseand she stood as in the moment when she had opened her eyes on the earth of the valley a moment uniting her beginning to her goal she stood looking up at the structure her consciousness surrendered to a single sight and a single wordless emotionbut she had always known that an emotion was a sum totaled by an adding machine of the mind and what she now felt was the instantaneous total of the thoughts she did not have to name the final sum of a long progression like a voice telling her by means of a feeling if she had held onto ouentin daniels with no hope of a chance to use the motor for the sole sake of knowing that achievement had not died on earthif like a weighted diver sinking in an ocean of mediocrity under the pressure of men with gelatin eyes rubber voices spiralshaped convictions noncommittal souls and noncommitting hands she had held as her life line and oxygen tube the thought of a superlative achievement of the human mindif at the sight of the motors remnant in a sudden gasp of suffocation as a last protest from his corruptioneaten lungs dr stadler had cried for something not to look down at but up to and this had been the cry the longing and the fuel of her lifeif she had moved drawn by the hunger of her youth for a sight of clean hard radiant competencethen here it was before her reached and done the power of an incomparable mind given shape in a net of wires sparkling peacefully under a summer sky drawing an incalculable power out of space into the secret interior of a small stone hovel she thought of this structure half the size of a boxcar replacing the power plants of the country the enormous conglomerations of steel fuel and effortshe thought of the current flowing from this structure lifting ounces pounds tons of strain from the shoulders of those who would make it or use it adding hours days and years of liberated time to their lives be it an extra moment to lift ones head from ones task and glance at the sunlight or an extra pack of cigarettes bought with the money saved from ones electric bill or an hour cut from the workday of every factory using power or a months journey through the whole open width of the world on a ticket paid for by one day of ones labor on a train pulled by the power of this motorwith all the energy of that weight that strain that time replaced and paid for by the energy of a single mind who had known how to make connections of wire follow the connections of his thought but she knew that there was no meaning in motors or factories or trains that their only meaning was in mans enjoyment of his life which they servedand that her swelling admiration at the sight of an achievement was for the man from whom it came for the power and the radiant vision within him which had seen the earth as a place of enjoyment and had known that the work of achieving ones happiness was the purpose the sanction and the meaning of life the door of the structure was a straight smooth sheet of stainless steel softly lustrous and bluish in the sun above it cut in the granite as the only feature of the buildings rectangular austerity there stood an inscription i swear by my life and my love of it that i will never live for the sake of another man nor ask another man to live for mine she turned to galt he stood beside her he had followed her he had known that this salute was his she was looking at the inventor of the motor but what she saw was the easy casual figure of a workman in his natural setting and functionshe noted the uncommon lightness of his posture a weightless way of standing that showed an expert control of the use of his bodya tall body in simple garments a thin shirt light slacks a belt about a slender waistlineand loose hair made to glitter like metal by the current of a sluggish wind she looked at him as she had looked at his structure then she knew that the first two sentences they had said to each other still hung between them filling the silencethat everything said since had been said over the sound of those words that he had known it had held it had not let her forget it she was suddenly aware that they were alone it was an awareness that stressed the fact permitting no further implication yet holding the full meaning of the unnamed in that special stress they were alone in a silent forest at the foot of a structure that looked like an ancient templeand she knew what rite was the proper form of worship to be offered on an altar of that kind she felt a sudden pressure at the base of her throat her head leaned back a little no more than to feel the faint shift of a current against her hair but it was as if she were lying back in space against the wind conscious of nothing but his legs and the shape of his mouth he stood watching her his face still but for the faint movement of his eyelids drawing narrow as if against too strong a light it was like the beat of three instantsthis was the firstand in the next she felt a stab of ferocious triumph at the knowledge that his effort and his struggle were harder to endure than hersand then he moved his eyes and raised his head to look at the inscription on the temple she let him look at it for a moment almost as an act of condescending mercy to an adversary struggling to refuel his strength then she asked with a note of imperious pride in her voice pointing at the inscription whats that its the oath that was taken by every person in this valley but you she said looking at the words this has always been my own rule of living i know it but i dont think that yours is the way to practice it then youll have to learn which one of us is wrong she walked up to the steel door of the structure with a sudden confidence faintly stressed in the movements of her body a mere hint of stress no more than her awareness of the power she held by means of his painand she tried asking no permission to turn the knob of the door but the door was locked and she felt no tremor under the pressure of her hand as if the lock were poured and sealed to the stone with the solid steel of the sheet dont try to open that door miss taggart he approached her his steps a shade too slow as if stressing his knowledge of her awareness of every step no amount of physical force will do it he said only a thought can open that door if you tried to break it down by means of the best explosives in the world the machinery inside would collapse into rubble long before the door would give way but reach the thought which it requiresand the secret of the motor will be yours as well asit was the first break she had heard in his voiceas well as any other secret you might wish to know he faced her for a moment as if leaving himself open to her full understanding then smiled oddly quietly at some thought of his own and added ill show you how its done he stepped back then standing still his face raised to the words carved in the stone he repeated them slowly evenly as if taking that oath once more there was no emotion in his voice nothing but the spaced clarity of the sounds he pronounced with full knowledge of their meaningbut she knew that she was witnessing the most solemn moment it would ever be given her to witness she was seeing a mans naked soul and the cost it had paid to utter these words she was hearing an echo of the day when he had pronounced that oath for the first time and with full knowledge of the years aheadshe knew what manner of man had stood up to face six thousand others on a dark spring night and why they had been afraid of him she knew that this was the birth and the core of all the things that had happened to the world in the twelve years since she knew that this was of far greater import than the motor hidden inside the structureshe knew it to the sound of a mans voice pronouncing in selfreminder and rededication i swear by my life and my love of it that i will never live for the sake of another man nor ask another man to live for mine it did not startle her it seemed unastonishing and almost unimportant that at the end of the last sound she saw the door opening slowly without human touch moving inward upon a growing strip of darkness in the moment when an electric light went on inside the structure he seized the knob and pulled the door shut its lock clicking sealed once more its a sound lock he said his face was serene that sentence is the combination of sounds needed to open it i dont mind telling you this secretbecause i know that you wont pronounce those words until you mean them the way i intended them to be meant she inclined her head i wont she followed him down to the car slowly feeling suddenly too exhausted to move she fell back against the seat closing her eyes barely hearing the sound of the starter the accumulated strain and shock of her sleepless hours hit her at once breaking through the barrier of the tension her nerves had held to delay it she lay still unable to think to react or to struggle drained of all emotions but one she did not speak she did not open her eyes until the car stopped in front of his house youd better rest he said and go to sleep right now if you want to attend mulligans dinner tonight she nodded obediently she staggered to the house avoiding his help she made an effort to tell him ill be all right then to escape to the safety of her room and last long enough to close the door she collapsed face down on the bed it was not the mere fact of physical exhaustion it was the sudden monomania of a sensation too complete to endure while the strength of her body was gone while her mind had lost the faculty of consciousness a single emotion drew on her remnants of energy of understanding of judgment of control leaving her nothing to resist it with or to direct it making her unable to desire only to feel reducing her to a mere sensationa static sensation without start or goal she kept seeing his figure in her mindhis figure as he had stood at the door of the structureshe felt nothing else no wish no hope no estimate of her feeling no name for it no relation to herselfthere was no entity such as herself she was not a person only a function the function of seeing him and the sight was its own meaning and purpose with no further end to reach her face buried in the pillow she recalled dimly as a faint sensation the moment of her takeoff from the floodlighted strip of the kansas airfield she felt the beat of the engine the streak of accelerating motion gathering power in a straightline run to a single goaland in the moment when the wheels left the ground she was asleep the floor of the valley was like a pool still reflecting the glow of the sky but the light was thickening from gold to copper the shores were fading and the peaks were smokebluewhen they drove to mulligans house there was no trace of exhaustion left in her bearing and no remnant of violence she had awakened at sundown stepping out of her room she had found galt waiting sitting idly motionless in the light of a lamp he had glanced up at her she had stood in the doorway her face composed her hair smooth her posture relaxed and confident she had looked as she would have looked on the threshold of her office in the taggart building but for the slight angle of her body leaning on a cane he had sat looking at her for a moment and she had wondered why she had felt certain that this was the image he was seeinghe was seeing the doorway of her office as if it were a sight longimagined and longforbidden she sat beside him in the car feeling no desire to speak knowing that neither of them could conceal the meaning of their silence she watched a few lights come up in the distant homes of the valley then the lighted windows of mulligans house on the ledge ahead she asked who will be there some of your last friends he answered and some of my first midas mulligan met them at the door she noticed that his grim square face was not as harshly expressionless as she had thought he had a look of satisfaction but satisfaction could not soften his features it merely struck them like flint and sent sparks of humor to glitter faintly in the corners of his eyes a humor that was shrewder more demanding yet warmer than a smile he opened the door of his house moving his arm a shade more slowly than normal giving an imperceptibly solemn emphasis to his gesture walking into the living room she faced seven men who rose to their feet at her entrance gentlementaggart transcontinental said midas mulligan he said it smiling but only halfjesting some quality in his voice made the name of the railroad sound as it would have sounded in the days of nat taggart as a sonorous title of honor she inclined her head slowly in acknowledgment to the men before her knowing that these were the men whose standards of value and honor were the same as her own the men who recognized the glory of that title as she recognized it knowing with a sudden stab of wistfulness how much she had longed for that recognition through all her years her eyes moved slowly in greeting from face to face ellis wyattken danaggerhugh akstondr hendricksquentin danielsmulligans voice pronounced the names of the two others richard halleyjudge narragansett the faint smile on richard halleys face seemed to tell her that they had known each other for yearsas in her lonely evenings by the side of her phonograph they had the austerity of judge narragansetts whitehaired figure reminded her that she had once heard him described as a marble statuea blindfolded marble statue it was the kind of figure that had vanished from the courtrooms of the country when the gold coins had vanished from the countrys hands you have belonged here for a long time miss taggart said midas mulligan this was not the way we expected you to come butwelcome home noshe wanted to answer but heard herself answering softly thank you dagny how many years is it going to take you to learn to be yourself it was ellis wyatt grasping her elbow leading her to a chair grinning at her look of helplessness at the struggle between a smile and a tightening resistance in her face dont pretend that you dont understand us you do we never make assertions miss taggart said hugh akston that is the moral crime peculiar to our enemies we do not tellwe show we do not claimwe prove it is not your obedience that we seek to win but your rational conviction you have seen all the elements of our secret the conclusion is now yours to drawwe can help you to name it but not to accept itthe sight the knowledge and the acceptance must be yours i feel as if i know it she answered simply and more i feel as if ive always known it but never found it and now im afraid not afraid to hear it just afraid that its coming so close akston smiled what does this look like to you miss taggart he pointed around the room this she laughed suddenly looking at the faces of the men against the golden sunburst of rays filling the great windows this looks like you know i never hoped to see any of you again i wondered at times how much id give for just one more glimpse or one more wordand nownow this is like that dream you imagine in childhood when you think that some day in heaven you will see those great departed whom you had not seen on earth and you choose from all the past centuries the great men you would like to meet well thats one clue to the nature of our secret said akston ask yourself whether the dream of heaven and greatness should be left waiting for us in our gravesor whether it should be ours here and now and on this earth i know she whispered and if you met those great men in heaven asked ken danagger what would you want to say to them just just hello i guess thats not all said danagger theres something youd want to hear from them i didnt know it either until i saw him for the first timehe pointed to galtand he said it to me and then i knew what it was that i had missed all my life miss taggart youd want them to look at you and to say well done she dropped her head and nodded silently head down not to let him see the sudden spurt of tears to her eyes all right then well done dagnywell donetoo welland now its time for you to rest from that burden which none of us should ever have had to carry shut up said midas mulligan looking at her bowed head with anxious concern but she raised her head smiling thank you she said to danagger if you talk about resting then let her rest said mulligan shes had too much for one day no she smiled go ahead say itwhatever it is later said mulligan it was mulligan and akston who served dinner with quentin daniels to help them they served it on small silver trays to be placed on the arms of the chairsand they all sat about the room with the fire of the sky fading in the windows and sparks of electric light glittering in the wine glasses there was an air of luxury about the room but it was the luxury of expert simplicity she noted the costly furniture carefully chosen for comfort bought somewhere at a time when luxury had still been an art there were no superfluous objects but she noticed a small canvas by a great master of the renaissance worth a fortune she noticed an oriental rug of a texture and color that belonged under glass in a museum this was mulligans concept of wealth she thoughtthe wealth of selection not of accumulation quentin daniels sat on the floor with his tray on his lap he seemed completely at home and he glanced up at her once in a while grinning like an impudent kid brother who had beaten her to a secret she had not discovered he had preceded her into the valley by some ten minutes she thought but he was one of them while she was still a stranger galt sat aside beyond the circle of lamplight on the arm of dr akstons chair he had not said a word he had stepped back and turned her over to the others and he sat watching it as a spectacle in which he had no further part to play but her eyes kept coming back to him drawn by the certainty that the spectacle was of his choice and staging that he had set it in motion long ago and that all the others knew it as she knew it she noticed another person who was intensely aware of galts presence hugh akston glanced up at him once in a while involuntarily almost surreptitiously as if struggling not to confess the loneliness of a long separation akston did not speak to him as if taking his presence for granted but once when galt bent forward and a strand of hair fell down across his face akston reached over and brushed it back his hand lingering for an imperceptible instant on his pupils forehead it was the only break of emotion he permitted himself the only greeting it was the gesture of a father she found herself talking to the men around her relaxing in lighthearted comfort no she thought what she felt was not strain it was a dim astonishment at the strain which she should but did not feel the abnormality of it was that it seemed so normal and simple she was barely aware of her questions as she spoke to one man after another but their answers were printing a record in her mind moving sentence by sentence to a goal the fifth concerto said richard halley in answer to her question i wrote it ten years ago we call it the concerto of deliverance thank you for recognizing it from a few notes whistled in the night yes i know about that yes since you knew my work you would know when you heard it that this concerto said everything i had been struggling to say and reach its dedicated to him he pointed to galt why no miss taggart i havent given up music what makes you think so ive written more in the last ten years than in any other period of my life i will play it for you any of it when you come to my house no miss taggart it will not be published outside not a note of it will be heard beyond these mountains no miss taggart i have not given up medicine said dr hendricks in answer to her question i have spent the last six years on research i have discovered a method to protect the blood vessels of the brain from that fatal rupture which is known as a brain stroke it will remove from human existence the terrible threat of sudden paralysis no not a word of my method will be heard outside the law miss taggart said judge narragansett what law i did not give it upit has ceased to exist but i am still working in the profession i had chosen which was that of serving the cause of justice no justice has not ceased to exist how could it it is possible for men to abandon their sight of it and then it is justice that destroys them but it is not possible for justice to go out of existence because one is an attribute of the other because justice is the act of acknowledging that which exists yes i am continuing in my profession i am writing a treatise on the philosophy of law i shall demonstrate that humanitys darkest evil the most destructive horror machine among all the devices of men is nonobjective law no miss taggart my treatise will not be published outside my business miss taggart said midas mulligan my business is blood transfusionand im still doing it my job is to feed a lifefuel into the plants that are capable of growing but ask dr hendricks whether any amount of blood will save a body that refuses to function a rotten hulk that expects to exist without effort my blood bank is gold gold is a fuel that will perform wonders but no fuel can work where there is no motor no i havent given up i merely got fed up with the job of running a slaughter house where one drains blood out of healthy living beings and pumps it into gutless halfcorpses given up said hugh akston check your premises miss taggart none of us has given up it is the world that has what is wrong with a philosopher running a roadside diner or a cigarette factory as i am doing now all work is an act of philosophy and when men will learn to consider productive workand that which is its sourceas the standard of their moral values they will reach that state of perfection which is the birthright they lost the source of work mans mind miss taggart mans reasoning mind i am writing a book on this subject defining a moral philosophy that i learned from my own pupil yes it could save the world no it will not be published outside why she cried why what are you doing all of you we are on strike said john galt they all turned to him as if they had been waiting for his voice and for that word she heard the empty beat of time within her which was the sudden silence of the room as she looked at him across a span of lamplight he sat slouched casually on the arm of a chair leaning forward his forearm across his knees his hand hanging down idlyand it was the faint smile on his face that gave to his words the deadly sound of the irrevocable why should this seem so startling there is only one kind of men who have never been on strike in human history every other kind and class have stopped when they so wished and have presented demands to the world claiming to be indispensableexcept the men who have carried the world on their shoulders have kept it alive have endured torture as sole payment but have never walked out on the human race well their turn has come let the world discover who they are what they do and what happens when they refuse to function this is the strike of the men of the mind miss taggart this is the mind on strike she did not move except for the fingers of one hand that moved slowly up her cheek to her temple through all the ages he said the mind has been regarded as evil and every form of insult from heretic to materialist to exploiterevery form of iniquity from exile to disfranchisement to expropriationevery form of torture from sneers to rack to firing squadhave been brought down upon those who assumed the responsibility of looking at the world through the eyes of a living consciousness and performing the crucial act of a rational connection yet only to the extent to whichin chains in dungeons in hidden corners in the cells of philosophers in the shops of traderssome men continued to think only to that extent was humanity able to survive through all the centuries of the worship of the mindless whatever stagnation humanity chose to endure whatever brutality to practiceit was only by the grace of the men who perceived that wheat must have water in order to grow that stones laid in a curve will form an arch that two and two make four that love is not served by torture and life is not fed by destructiononly by the grace of those men did the rest of them learn to experience moments when they caught the spark of being human and only the sum of such moments permitted them to continue to exist it was the man of the mind who taught them to bake their bread to heal their wounds to forge their weapons and to build the jails into which they threw him he was the man of extravagant energyand reckless generositywho knew that stagnation is not mans fate that impotence is not his nature that the ingenuity of his mind is his noblest and most joyous powerand in service to that love of existence he was alone to feel he went on working working at any price working for his despoilers for his jailers for his torturers paying with his life for the privilege of saving theirs this was his glory and his guiltthat he let them teach him to feel guilty of his glory to accept the part of a sacrificial animal and in punishment for the sin of intelligence to perish on the altars of the brutes the tragic joke of human history is that on any of the altars men erected it was always man whom they immolated and the animal whom they enshrined it was always the animals attributes not mans that humanity worshipped the idol of instinct and the idol of forcethe mystics and the kingsthe mystics who longed for an irresponsible consciousness and ruled by means of the claim that their dark emotions were superior to reason that knowledge came in blind causeless fits blindly to be followed not doubtedand the kings who ruled by means of claws and muscles with conquest as their method and looting as their aim with a club or a gun as sole sanction of their power the defenders of mans soul were concerned with his feelings and the defenders of mans body were concerned with his stomachbut both were united against his mind yet no one not the lowest of humans is ever able fully to renounce his brain no one has ever believed in the irrational what they do believe in is the unjust whenever a man denounces the mind it is because his goal is of a nature the mind would not permit him to confess when he preaches contradictions he does so in the knowledge that someone will accept the burden of the impossible someone will make it work for him at the price of his own suffering or life destruction is the price of any contradiction it is the victims who made injustice possible it is the men of reason who made it possible for the rule of the brute to work the despoiling of reason has been the motive of every antireason creed on earth the despoiling of ability has been the purpose of every creed that preached selfsacrifice the despoilers have always known it we havent the time has come for us to see what we are now asked to worship what had once been dressed as god or king is the naked twisted mindless figure of the human incompetent this is the new ideal the goal to aim at the purpose to live for and all men are to be rewarded according to how close they approach it this is the age of the common man they tell usa title which any man may claim to the extent of such distinction as he has managed not to achieve he will rise to a rank of nobility by means of the effort he has failed to make he will be honored for such virtue as he has not displayed and he will be paid for the goods which he did not produce but wewe who must atone for the guilt of abilitywe will work to support him as he orders with his pleasure as our only reward since we have the most to contribute we will have the least to say since we have the better capacity to think we will not be permitted a thought of our own since we have the judgment to act we will not be permitted an action of our choice we will work under directives and controls issued by those who are incapable of working they will dispose of our energy because they have none to offer and of our product because they cant produce do you say that this is impossible that it cannot be made to work they know it but it is you who dontand they are counting on you not to know it they are counting on you to go on to work to the limit of the inhuman and to feed them while you lastand when you collapse there will be another victim starting out and feeding them while struggling to surviveand the span of each succeeding victim will be shorter and while youll die to leave them a railroad your last descendantinspirit will die to leave them a loaf of bread this does not worry the looters of the moment their planlike all the plans of all the royal looters of the pastis only that the loot shall last their lifetime it has always lasted before because in one generation they could not run out of victims but this timeit will not last the victims are on strike we are on strike against martyrdomand against the moral code that demands it we are on strike against those who believe that one man must exist for the sake of another we are on strike against the morality of cannibals be it practiced in body or in spirit we will not deal with men on any terms but oursand our terms are a moral code which holds that man is an end in himself and not the means to any end of others we do not seek to force our code upon them they are free to believe what they please but for once they will have to believe it and to existwithout our help and once and for all they will learn the meaning of their creed that creed has lasted for centuries solely by the sanction of the victimsby means of the victims acceptance of punishment for breaking a code impossible to practice but that code was intended to be broken it is a code that thrives not on those who observe it but on those who dont a morality kept in existence not by virtue of its saints but by the grace of its shiners we have decided not to be sinners any longer we have ceased breaking that moral code we shall blast it out of existence forever by the one method that it cant withstand by obeying it we are obeying it we are complying in dealing with our fellow men we are observing their code of values to the letter and sparing them all the evils they denounce the mind is evil we have withdrawn the works of our minds from society and not a single idea of ours is to be known or used by men ability is a selfish evil that leaves no chance to those who are less able we have withdrawn from the competition and left all chances open to incompetents the pursuit of wealth is greed the root of all evil we do not seek to make fortunes any longer it is evil to earn more than ones bare sustenance we take nothing but the lowliest jobs and we produce by the effort of our muscles no more than we consume for our immediate needswith not a penny nor an inventive thought left over to harm the world it is evil to succeed since success is made by the strong at the expense of the weak we have ceased burdening the weak with our ambition and have left them free to prosper without us it is evil to be an employer we have no employment to offer it is evil to own property we own nothing it is evil to enjoy ones existence in this world there is no form of enjoyment that we seek from their world andthis was hardest for us to attainwhat we now feel for their world is that emotion which they preach as an ideal indifferencethe blankthe zerothe mark of death we are giving men everything theyve professed to want and to seek as virtue for centuries now let them see whether they want it it was you who started this strike she asked i did he got up he stood hands in pockets his face in the lightand she saw him smile with the easy effortless implacable amusement of certainty weve heard so much about strikes he said and about the dependence of the uncommon man upon the common weve heard it shouted that the industrialist is a parasite that his workers support him create his wealth make his luxury possibleand what would happen to him if they walked out very well i propose to show to the world who depends on whom who supports whom who is the source of wealth who makes whose livelihood possible and what happens to whom when who walks out the windows were now sheets of darkness reflecting the dots of lighted cigarettes he picked a cigarette from a table beside him and in the flare of a match she saw the brief sparkle of gold the dollar sign between his fingers i quit and joined him and went on strike said hugh akston because i could not share my profession with men who claim that the qualification of an intellectual consists of denying the existence of the intellect people would not employ a plumber whod attempt to prove his professional excellence by asserting that theres no such thing as plumbingbut apparently the same standards of caution are not considered necessary in regard to philosophers i learned from my own pupil however that it was i who made this possible when thinkers accept those who deny the existence of thinking as fellow thinkers of a different school of thoughtit is they who achieve the destruction of the mind they grant the enemys basic premise thus granting the sanction of reason to formal dementia a basic premise is an absolute that permits no cooperation with its antithesis and tolerates no tolerance in the same manner and for the same reason as a banker may not accept and pass counterfeit money granting it the sanction honor and prestige of his bank just as he may not grant the counterfeiters demand for tolerance of a mere difference of opinionso i may not grant the title of philosopher to dr simon pritchett or compete with him for the minds of men dr pritchett has nothing to deposit to the account of philosophy except his declared intention to destroy it he seeks to cash inby means of denying iton the power of reason among men he seeks to stamp the mintmark of reason upon the plans of his looting masters he seeks to use the prestige of philosophy to purchase the enslavement of thought but that prestige is an account which can exist only so long as i am there to sign the checks let him do it without me let himand those who entrust to him their childrens mindshave exactly that which they demand a world of intellectuals without intellect and of thinkers who proclaim that they cannot think i am conceding it i am complying and when they see the absolute reality of their nonabsolute world i will not be there and it will not be i who will pay the price of their contradictions dr akston quit on the principle of sound banking said midas mulligan i quit on the principle of love love is the ultimate form of recognition one grants to superlative values it was the hunsacker case that made me quitthat case when a court of law ordered that i honor as first right to my depositors funds the demand of those who would offer proof that they had no right to demand it i was ordered to hand out money earned by men to a worthless rotter whose only claim consisted of his inability to earn it i was born on a farm i knew the meaning of money i had dealt with many men in my life i had watched them grow i had made my fortune by being able to spot a certain kind of man the kind who never asked you for faith hope and charity but offered you facts proof and profit did you know that i invested in hank reardens business at the time when he was rising when he had just beaten his way out of minnesota to buy the steel mills in pennsylvania well when i looked at that court order on my desk i had a vision i saw a picture and i saw it so clearly that it changed the looks of everything for me i saw the bright face and the eyes of young rearden as hed been when id met him first i saw him lying at the foot of an altar with his blood running down into the earthand what stood on that altar was lee hunsacker with the mucusfilled eyes whining that hed never had a chance its strange how simple things become once you see them clearly it wasnt hard for me to close the bank and go i kept seeing for the first time in my life what it was that i had lived for and loved she looked at judge narragansett you quit over the same case didnt you yes said judge narragansett i quit when the court of appeals reversed my ruling the purpose for which i had chosen my work was my resolve to be a guardian of justice but the laws they asked me to enforce made me the executor of the vilest injustice conceivable i was asked to use force to violate the rights of disarmed men who came before me to seek my protection for their rights litigants obey the verdict of a tribunal solely on the premise that there is an objective rule of conduct which they both accept now i saw that one man was to be bound by it but the other was not one was to obey a rule the other was to assert an arbitrary wishhis needand the law was to stand on the side of the wish justice was to consist of upholding the unjustifiable i quitbecause i could not have borne to hear the words your honor addressed to me by an honest man her eyes moved slowly to richard halley as if she were both pleading and afraid to hear his story he smiled i would have forgiven men for my struggle said richard halley it was their view of my success that i could not forgive i had felt no hatred in all the years when they rejected me if my work was new i had to give them time to learn if i took pride in being first to break a trail to a height of my own i had no right to complain if others were slow to follow that was what i had told myself through all those years except on some nights when i could neither wait nor believe any longer when i cried why but found no answer then on the night when they chose to cheer me i stood before them on the stage of a theater thinking that this was the moment i had struggled to reach wishing to feel it but feeling nothing i was seeing all the other nights behind me hearing the why which still had no answerand their cheers seemed as empty as their snubs if they had said sorry to be so late thank you for waitingi would have asked for nothing else and they could have had anything i had to give them but what i saw in their faces and in the way they spoke when they crowded to praise me was the thing i had heard being preached to artistsonly i had never believed that anyone human could mean it they seemed to say that they owed me nothing that their deafness had provided me with a moral goal that it had been my duty to struggle to suffer to bearfor their sakewhatever sneers contempt injustice torture they chose to inflict upon me to bear it in order to teach them to enjoy my work that this was their rightful due and my proper purpose and then i understood the nature of the looterinspirit a thing i had never been able to conceive i saw them reaching into my soul just as they reach into mulligans pocket reaching to expropriate the value of my person just as they reach to expropriate his wealthi saw the impertinent malice of mediocrity boastfully holding up its own emptiness as an abyss to be filled by the bodies of its bettersi saw them seeking just as they seek to feed on mulligans money to feed on those hours when i wrote my music and on that which made me write it seeking to gnaw their way to selfesteem by extorting from me the admission that they were the goal of my music so that precisely by reason of my achievement it would not be they whod acknowledge my value but i who would bow to theirs it was that night that i took the oath never to let them hear another note of mine the streets were empty when i left that theater i was the last one to leaveand i saw a man whom i had never seen before waiting for me in the light of a lamppost he did not have to tell me much but the concerto i dedicated to him is called the concerto of deliverance she looked at the others please tell me your reasons she said with a faint stress of firmness in her voice as if she were taking a beating but wished to take it to the end i quit when medicine was placed under state control some years ago said dr hendricks do you know what it takes to perform a brain operation do you know the kind of skill it demands and the years of passionate merciless excruciating devotion that go to acquire that skill that was what i would not place at the disposal of men whose sole qualification to rule me was their capacity to spout the fraudulent generalities that got them elected to the privilege of enforcing their wishes at the point of a gun i would not let them dictate the purpose for which my years of study had been spent or the conditions of my work or my choice of patients or the amount of my reward i observed that in all the discussions that preceded the enslavement of medicine men discussed everythingexcept the desires of the doctors men considered only the welfare of the patients with no thought for those who were to provide it that a doctor should have any right desire or choice in the matter was regarded as irrelevant selfishness his is not to choose they said only to serve that a man whos willing to work under compulsion is too dangerous a brute to entrust with a job in the stockyardsnever occurred to those who proposed to help the sick by making life impossible for the healthy i have often wondered at the smugness with which people assert their right to enslave me to control my work to force my will to violate my conscience to stifle my mindyet what is it that they expect to depend on when they lie on an operating table under my hands their moral code has taught them to believe that it is safe to rely on the virtue of their victims well that is the virtue i have withdrawn let them discover the kind of doctors that their system will now produce let them discover in their operating rooms and hospital wards that it is not safe to place their lives in the hands of a man whose life they have throttled it is not safe if he is the sort of man who resents itand still less safe if he is the sort who doesnt i quit said ellis wyatt because i didnt wish to serve as the cannibals meal and to do the cooking besides i discovered said ken danagger that the men i was fighting were impotent the shiftless the purposeless the irresponsible the irrationalit was not i who needed them it was not theirs to dictate terms to me it was not mine to obey demands i quit to let them discover it too i quit said quentin daniels because if there are degrees of damnation the scientist who places his mind in the service of brute force is the longestrange murderer on earth they were silent she turned to galt and you she asked you were first what made you come to it he chuckled my refusal to be born with any original sin what do you mean i have never felt guilty of my ability i have never felt guilty of my mind i have never felt guilty of being a man i accepted no unearned guilt and thus was free to earn and to know my own value ever since i can remember i had felt that i would kill the man whod claim that i exist for the sake of his needand i had known that this was the highest moral feeling that night at the twentieth century meeting when i heard an unspeakable evil being spoken in a tone of moral righteousness i saw the root of the worlds tragedy the key to it and the solution i saw what had to be done i went out to do it and the motor she asked why did you abandon it why did you leave it to the starnes heirs it was then fathers property he paid me for it it was made on his time but i knew that it would be of no benefit to them and that no one would ever hear of it again it was my first experimental model nobody but me or my equivalent could have been able to complete it or even to grasp what it was and i knew that no equivalent of mine would come near that factory from then on you knew the kind of achievement your motor represented yes and you knew you were leaving it to perish yes he looked off into the darkness beyond the windows and chuckled softly but it was not a sound of amusement i looked at my motor for the last tune before i left i thought of the men who claim that wealth is a matter of natural resourcesand of the men who claim that wealth is a matter of seizing the factoriesand of the men who claim that machines condition their brains well there was the motor to condition them and there it remained as just exactly what it is without mans mindas a pile of metal scraps and wires going to rust you have been thinking of the great service which that motor could have rendered to mankind if it had been put into production i think that on the day when men understand the meaning of its fate in that factorys junk heapit will have rendered a greater one did you expect to see that day when you left it no did you expect a chance to rebuild it elsewhere no and you were willing to let it remain in a junk heap for the sake of what that motor meant to me he said slowly i had to be willing to let it crumble and vanish foreverhe looked straight at her and she heard the steady unhesitant uninflected ruthlessness of his voicejust as you will have to be willing to let the rail of taggart transcontinental crumble and vanish she held his eyes her head was lifted and she said softly in the tone of a proudly open plea dont make me answer you now i wont well tell you whatever you wish to know we wont urge you to make a decision he added and she was shocked by the sudden gentleness of his voice i said that that kind of indifference toward a world which should have been ours was the hardest thing to attain i know weve all gone through it she looked at the quiet impregnable room and at the lightthe light that came from his motoron the faces of men who were the most serene and confident gathering she had ever attended what did you do when you walked out of the twentieth century she asked i went out to become a flamespotter i made it my job to watch for those bright flares in the growing night of savagery which were the men of ability the men of the mindto watch their course their struggle and their agonyand to pull them out when i knew that they had seen enough what did you tell them to make them abandon everything i told them that they were right in answer to the silent question of her glance he added i gave them the pride they did not know they had i gave them the words to identify it i gave them that priceless possession which they had missed had longed for yet had not known they needed a moral sanction did you call me the destroyer and the hunter of men i was the walking delegate of this strike the leader of the victims rebellion the defender of the oppressed the disinherited the exploitedand when i use these words they have for once a literal meaning who were the first to follow you he let a moment pass in deliberate emphasis then answered my two best friends you know one of them you know perhaps better than anyone else what price he paid for it our own teacher dr akston was next he joined us within one evenings conversation william hastings who had been my boss in the research laboratory of twentieth century motors had a hard time fighting it out with himself it took him a year but he joined then richard halley then midas mulligan who took fifteen minutes said mulligan she turned to him it was you who established this valley yes said mulligan it was just my own private retreat at first i bought it years ago i bought miles of these mountains section by section from ranchers and cattlemen who didnt know what they owned the valley is not listed on any map i built this house when i decided to quit i cut off all possible avenues of approach except one roadand its camouflaged beyond anyones power to discoverand i stocked this place to be selfsupporting so that i could live here for the rest of my life and never have to see the face of a looter when i heard that john had got judge narragansett too i invited the judge to come here then we asked richard halley to join us the others remained outside at first we had no rules of any kind said galt except one when a man took our oath it meant a single commitment not to work in his own profession not to give to the world the benefit of his mind each of us carried it out in any manner he chose those who had money retired to live on their savings those who had to work took the lowest jobs they could find some of us had been famous otherslike that young brakeman of yours whom halley discoveredwere stopped by us before they had set out to get tortured but we did not give up our minds or the work we loved each of us continued in his real profession in whatever manner and spare time he could managebut he did it secretly for his own sole benefit giving nothing to men sharing nothing we were scattered all over the country as the outcasts we had always been only now we accepted our parts with conscious intention our sole relief were the rare occasions when we could see one another we found that we liked to meetin order to be reminded that human beings still existed so we came to set aside one month a year to spend in this valleyto rest to live in a rational world to bring our real work out of hiding to trade our achievementshere where achievements meant payment not expropriation each of us built his own house here at his own expensefor one month of life out of twelve it made the eleven easier to bear you see miss taggart said hugh akston man is a social being but not in the way the looters preach its the destruction of colorado that started the growth of this valley said midas mulligan ellis wyatt and the others came to live here permanently because they had to hide whatever part of their wealth they could salvage they converted into gold or machines as i had and they brought it here there were enough of us to develop the place and to create jobs for those who had had to earn their living outside we have now reached the stage where most of us can live here full time the valley is almost selfsupportingand as to the goods that we cant yet produce i purchase them from the outside through a pipe line of my own its a special agent a man who does not let my money reach the looters we are not a state here not a society of any kindwere just a voluntary association of men held together by nothing but every mans selfinterest i own the valley and i sell the land to the others when they want it judge narragansett is to act as our arbiter hi case of disagreements he hasnt had to be called upon as yet they say that its hard for men to agree youd be surprised how easy it iswhen both parties hold as their moral absolute that neither exists for the sake of the other and that reason is their only means of trade the time is approaching when all of us will have to be called to live herebecause the world is falling apart so fast that it will soon be starving but we will be able to support ourselves in this valley the world is crashing faster than we expected said hugh akston men are stopping and giving up your frozen trains the gangs of raiders the deserters theyre men whove never heard of us and theyre not part of our strike they are acting on their ownits the natural response of whatever rationality is still left in themits the same kind of protest as ours we started with no time limit in view said galt we did not know whether wed live to see the liberation of the world or whether wed have to leave our battle and our secret to the next generations we knew only that this was the only way we cared to live but now we think that we will see and soon the day of our victory and of our return when she whispered when the code of the looters has collapsed he saw her looking at him her glance halfquestion halfhope and he added when the creed of selfimmolation has run for once its undisguised coursewhen men find no victims ready to obstruct the path of justice and to deflect the fall of retribution on themselveswhen the preachers of selfsacrifice discover that those who are willing to practice it have nothing to sacrifice and those who have are not willing any longerwhen men see that neither their hearts nor their muscles can save them but the mind they damned is not there to answer then screams for helpwhen they collapse as they must as men without mindwhen they have no pretense of authority left no remnant of law no trace of morality no hope no food and no way to obtain itwhen they collapse and the road is clearthen well come back to rebuild the world the taggart terminal she thought she heard the words beating through the numbness of her mind as the sum of a burden she had not had time to weigh this was the taggart terminal she thought this room not the giant concourse in new yorkthis was her goal the end of track the point beyond the curve of the earth where the two straight lines of rail met and vanished drawing her forwardas they had drawn nathaniel taggartthis was the goal nathaniel taggart had seen in the distance and this was the point still holding the straightline glance of his lifted head above the spiral motion of men in the granite concourse it was for the sake of this that she had dedicated herself to the rail of taggart transcontinental as to the body of a spirit yet to be found she had found it everything she had ever wanted it was here in this room reached and hersbut the price was that net of rail behind her the rail that would vanish the bridges that would crumble the signal lights that would go out and yet everything i had ever wanted she thoughtlooking away from the figure of a man with suncolored hair and implacable eyes you dont have to answer us now she raised her head he was watching her as if he had followed the steps in her mind we never demand agreement he said we never tell anyone more than he is ready to hear you are the first person who has learned our secret ahead of time but youre here and you had to know now you know the exact nature of the choice youll have to make if it seems hard its because you still think that it does not have to be one or the other you will learn that it does will you give me time your time is not ours to give take your time you alone can decide what youll choose to do and when we know the cost of that decision weve paid it that youve come here might now make it easier for youor harder harder she whispered i know he said it his voice as low as hers with the same sound of being forced past ones breath and she missed an instant of time as in the stillness after a blow because she felt that thisnot the moments when he had carried her in his arms down the mountainside but this meeting of their voiceshad been the closest physical contact between them a full moon stood in the sky above the valley when they drove back to his house it stood like a flat round lantern without rays with a haze of light hanging in space not reaching the ground and the illumination seemed to come from the abnormal white brightness of the soil in the unnatural stillness of sight without color the earth seemed veiled by a film of distance its shapes did not merge into a landscape but went slowly flowing past like the print of a photograph on a cloud she noticed suddenly that she was smiling she was looking down at the houses of the valley their lighted windows were dimmed by a bluish cast the outlines of their walls were dissolving long bands of mist were coiling among them in torpid unhurried waves it looked like a city sinking under water what do they call this place she asked i call it mulligans valley he said the others call it galts gulch id call it but she did not finish he glanced at her she knew what he saw in her face he turned away she saw a faint movement of his lips like the release of a breath that he was forcing to function she dropped her glance her arm falling against the side of the car as if her hand were suddenly too heavy for the weakness in the crook of her elbow the road grew darker as it went higher and pine branches met over their heads above a slant of rock moving to meet them she saw the moonlight on the windows of his house her head fell back against the seat and she lay still losing awareness of the car feeling only the motion that carried her forward watching the glittering drops of water in the pine branches which were the stars when the car stopped she did not permit herself to know why she did not look at him as she stepped out she did not know that she stood still for an instant looking up at the dark windows she did not hear him approach but she felt the impact of his hands with shocking intensity as if it were the only awareness she could now experience he lifted her in his arms and started slowly up the path to the house he walked not looking at her holding her tight as if trying to hold a progression of time as if his arms were still locked over the moment when he had lifted her against his chest she felt his steps as if they were a single span of motion to a goal and as if each step were a separate moment in which she dared not think of the next her head was close to his his hair brushing her cheek and she knew that neither of them would move his face that one breath closer it was a sudden stunned state of quiet drunkenness complete in itself their hair mingled like the rays of two bodies in space that had achieved their meeting she saw that he walked with his eyes closed as if even sight would now be an intrusion he entered the house and as he moved across the living room he did not look to his left and neither did she but she knew that both of them were seeing the door on his left that led to his bedroom he walked the length of the darkness to the wedge of moonlight that fell across the guestroom bed he placed her down upon it she felt an instants pause of his hands still holding her shoulder and waistline and when his hands left her body she knew that the moment was over he stepped back and pressed a switch surrendering the room to the harshly public glare of light he stood still as if demanding that she look at him his face expectant and stern have you forgotten that you wanted to shoot me on sight he asked it was the unprotected stillness of his figure that made it real the shudder that threw her upright was like a cry of terror and denial but she held his glance and answered evenly thats true i did then stand by it her voice was low its intensity was both a surrender and a scornful reproach you know better than that dont you he shook his head no i want you to remember that that had been your wish you were right in the past so long as you were part of the outer world you had to seek to destroy me and of the two courses now open to you one will lead you to the day when you will find yourself forced to do it she did not answer she sat looking down he saw the strands of her hair swing jerkily as she shook her head in desperate protest you are my only danger you are the only person who could deliver me to my enemies if you remain with them you will choose that if you wish but choose it with full knowledge dont answer me now but until you dothe stress of severity in his voice was the sound of effort directed against himselfremember that i know the meaning of either answer as fully as i do she whispered as fully he turned to go when her eyes fell suddenly upon the inscriptions she had noticed and forgotten on the walls of the room they were cut into the polish of the wood still showing the force of the pencils pressure in the hands that had made them each in his own violent writing youll get over itellis wyatt it will be all right by morningken danagger its worth itroger marsh there were others what is that she asked he smiled this is the room where they spent their first night in the valley the first night is the hardest its the last pull of the break with ones memories and the worst i let them stay here so they can call for me if they want me i speak to them if they cant sleep most of them cant but theyre free of it by morning theyve all gone through this room now they call it the torture chamber or the anteroombecause everyone has to enter the valley through my house he turned to go he stopped on the threshold and added this is the room i never intended you to occupy good night miss taggart chapter ii the utopia of greed good morning she looked at him across the living room from the threshold of her door in the windows behind him the mountains had that tinge of silverpink which seems brighter than daylight with the promise of a light to come the sun had risen somewhere over the earth but it had not reached the top of the barrier and the sky was glowing in its stead announcing its motion she had heard the joyous greeting to the sunrise which was not the song of birds but the ringing of the telephone a moment ago she saw the start of day not in the shining green of the branches outside but in the glitter of chromium on the stove the sparkle of a glass ashtray on a table and the crisp whiteness of his shirt sleeves irresistibly she heard the sound of a smile in her own voice matching his as she answered good morning he was gathering notes of penciled calculations from his desk and stuffing them into his pocket i have to go down to the powerhouse he said theyve just phoned me that theyre having trouble with the ray screen your plane seems to have knocked it off key ill be back in half an hour and then ill cook our breakfast it was the casual simplicity of his voice the manner of taking her presence and their domestic routine for granted as if it were of no significance to them that gave her the sense of an underscored significance and the feeling that he knew it she answered as casually if youll bring me the cane i left in the car ill have breakfast ready for you by the time you come back he glanced at her with a slight astonishment his eyes moved from her bandaged ankle to the short sleeves of the blouse that left her arms bare to display the heavy bandage on her elbow but the transparent blouse the open collar the hair falling down to the shoulders that seemed innocently naked under a thin film of cloth made her look like a schoolgirl not an invalid and her posture made the bandages look irrelevant he smiled not quite at her but as if in amusement at some sudden memory of his own if you wish he said it was strange to be left alone in his house part of it was an emotion she had never experienced before an awed respect that made her hesitantly conscious of her hands as if to touch any object around her would be too great an intimacy the other part was a reckless sense of ease a sense of being at home in this place as if she owned its owner it was strange to feel so pure a joy in the simple task of preparing a breakfast the work seemed an end in itself as if the motions of filling a coffee pot squeezing oranges slicing bread were performed for their own sake for the sort of pleasure one expects but seldom finds in the motions of dancing it startled her to realize that she had not experienced this kind of pleasure in her work since her days at the operators desk in rockdale station she was setting the table when she saw the figure of a man hurrying up the path to the house a swift agile figure that leaped over boulders with the casual ease of a flight he threw the door open calling hey johnand stopped short as he saw her he wore a dark blue sweater and slacks he had gold hair and a face of such shocking perfection of beauty that she stood still staring at him not in admiration at first but in simple disbelief he looked at her as if he had not expected to find a woman in this house then she saw a look of recognition melting into a different kind of astonishment part amusement part triumph melting into a chuckle oh have you joined us he asked no she answered dryly i havent im a scab he laughed like an adult at a child who uses technological words beyond its understanding if you know what youre saying you know that its not possible he said not here i crashed the gate literally he looked at her bandages weighing the question his glance almost insolent in its open curiosity when yesterday how in a plane what were you doing in a plane in this part of the country he had the direct imperious manner of an aristocrat or a roughneck he looked like one and was dressed like the other she considered him for a moment deliberately letting him wait i was trying to land on a prehistorical mirage she answered and i have you are a scab he said and chuckled as if grasping all the implications of the problem wheres john mr galt is at the powerhouse he should be back any moment he sat down in an armchair asking no permission as if he were at home she turned silently to her work he sat watching her movements with an open grin as if the sight of her laying out cutlery on a kitchen table were the spectacle of some special paradox what did francisco say when he saw you here he asked she turned to him with a slight jolt but answered evenly he is not here yet not yet he seemed startled are you sure so i was told he lighted a cigarette she wondered watching him what profession he had chosen loved and abandoned in order to join this valley she could make no guess none seemed to fit she caught herself in the preposterous feeling of wishing that he had no profession at all because any work seemed too dangerous for his incredible kind of beauty it was an impersonal feeling she did not look at him as at a man but as at an animated work of artand it seemed to be a stressed indignity of the outer world that a perfection such as his should be subjected to the shocks the strains the scars reserved for any man who loved his work but the feeling seemed the more preposterous because the lines of his face had the sort of hardness for which no danger on earth was a match no miss taggart he said suddenly catching her glance youve never seen me before she was shocked to realize that she had been studying him openly how do you happen to know who i am she asked first ive seen your pictures in the papers many times second youre the only woman left in the outer world to the best of our knowledge whod be allowed to enter galts gulch third youre the only woman whod have the courageand prodigalitystill to remain a scab what made you certain that i was a scab if you werent youd know that its not this valley but the view of life held by men in the outer world that is a prehistorical mirage they heard the sound of the motor and saw the car stopping below in front of the house she noticed the swiftness with which he rose to his feet at the sight of galt in the car if it were not for the obvious personal eagerness it would have looked like an instinctive gesture of military respect she noticed the way galt stopped when he entered and saw his visitor she noticed that galt smiled but that his voice was oddly low almost solemn as if weighted with unconfessed relief when he said very quietly hello hi john said the visitor gaily she noticed that their handshake came an instant too late and lasted an instant too long like the handshake of men who had not been certain that their previous meeting would not be their last galt turned to her have you met he asked addressing them both not exactly said the visitor miss taggart may i present ragnar danneskjold she knew what her face had looked like when she heard danneskjolds voice as from a great distance you dont have to be frightened miss taggart im not dangerous to anyone in galts gulch she could only shake her head before she recaptured her voice to say its not what youre doing to anyone its what theyre doing to you his laughter swept her out of her moments stupor be careful miss taggart if thats how youre beginning to feel you wont remain a scab for long he added but you ought to start by adopting the right things from the people in galts gulch not their mistakes theyve spent twelve years worrying about meneedlessly he glanced at galt when did you get in asked galt late last night sit down youre going to have breakfast with us but wheres francisco why isnt he here yet i dont know said galt frowning slightly i asked at the airport just now nobodys heard from him as she turned to the kitchen galt moved to follow no she said its my job today let me help you this is the place where one doesnt ask for help isnt it he smiled thats right she had never experienced the pleasure of motion of walking as if her feet had no weight to carry as if the support of the cane in her hand were merely a superfluous touch of elegance the pleasure of feeling her steps trace swift straight lines of sensing the faultless spontaneous precision of her gesturesas she experienced it while placing their food on the table in front of the two men her bearing told them that she knew they were watching hershe held her head like an actress on a stage like a woman in a ballroom like the winner of a silent contest francisco will be glad to know that its you who were his standin today said danneskjold when she joined them at the table his what you see today is june first and the three of usjohn francisco and ihave had breakfast together on every june first for twelve years here not when we started but here ever since this house was built eight years ago he shrugged smiling for a man who has more centuries of tradition behind him than i have its odd that francisco should be the first to break our own tradition and mr galt she asked how many centuries does he have behind him john none at all none behind himbut all of those ahead never mind the centuries said galt tell me what sort of year youve had behind you lost any men no lost any of your time you mean was i wounded no i havent had a scratch since that one time ten years ago when i was still an amateur which you ought to forget by now i wasnt in any danger whatever this yearin fact i was much more safe than if i were running a smalltown drugstore under directive lost any battles no the losses were all on the other side this year the looters lost most of their ships to meand most of their men to you youve had a good year too havent you i know ive kept track of it since our last breakfast together you got everyone you wanted from the state of colorado and a few others besides such as ken danagger who was a great prize to get but let me tell you about a still greater one who is almost yours youre going to get him soon because hes hanging by a thin thread and is just about ready to fall at your feet hes a man who saved my lifeso you can see how far hes gone galt leaned back his eyes narrowing so you werent in any danger whatever were you danneskjold laughed oh i took a slight risk it was worth it it was the most enjoyable encounter ive ever had ive been waiting to tell you about it in person its a story youll want to hear do you know who the man was hank rearden i no it was galts voice it was a command the brief snap of sound had a tinge of violence neither of them had ever heard from him before what asked danneskjold softly incredulously dont tell me about it now but youve always said that hank rearden was the one man you wanted to see here most i still do but youll tell me later she studied galts face intently but she could find no clue only a closed impersonal look either of determination or of control that tightened the skin of his cheekbones and the line of his mouth no matter what he knew about her she thought the only knowledge that could explain this was a knowledge he had had no way of acquiring youve met hank rearden she asked turning to danneskjold and he saved your life yes i want to hear about it i dont said galt why not youre not one of us miss taggart i see she smiled with a faint touch of defiance were you thinking that i might prevent you from getting hank rearden no that was not what i was thinking she noticed that danneskjold was studying galts face as if he too found the incident inexplicable galt held his glance deliberately and openly as if challenging him to find the explanation and promising that he would fail she knew that danneskjold had failed when she saw a faint crease of humor softening galts eyelids what else asked galt have you accomplished this year ive defied the law of gravitation youve always done that in what particular form now in the form of a flight from midatlantic to colorado in a plane loaded with gold beyond the safety point of its capacity wait till midas sees the amount i have to deposit my customers this year will become richer by say have you told miss taggart that shes one of my customers no not yet you may tell her if you wish imwhat did you say i am she asked dont be shocked miss taggart said danneskjold and dont object im used to objections im a sort of freak here anyway none of them approve of my particular method of fighting our battle john doesnt dr akston doesnt they think that my life is too valuable for it but you see my father was a bishopand of all his teachings there was only one sentence that i accepted all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword what do you mean that violence is not practical if my fellow men believe that the force of the combined tonnage of their muscles is a practical means to rule melet them learn the outcome of a contest in which theres nothing but brute force on one side and force ruled by a mind on the other even john grants me that in our age i had the moral right to choose the course ive chosen i am doing just what he is doingonly in my own way he is withdrawing mans spirit from the looters im withdrawing the products of mans spirit he is depriving them of reason im depriving them of wealth he is draining the soul of the world im draining its body his is the lesson they have to learn only im impatient and im hastening their scholastic progress but like john im simply complying with their moral code and refusing to grant them a double standard at my expense or at reardens expense or at yours what are you talking about about a method of taxing the income taxers all methods of taxation are complex but this one is very simple because its the naked essence of all the others let me explain it to you she listened she heard a sparkling voice reciting in the tone of a dryly meticulous bookkeeper a report about financial transfers bank accounts incometax returns as if he were reading the dusty pages of a ledgera ledger where every entry was made by means of offering his own blood as the collateral to be drained at any moment at any slip of his bookkeeping pen as she listened she kept seeing the perfection of his faceand she kept thinking that this was the head on which the world had placed a price of millions for the purpose of delivering it to the rot of death the face she had thought too beautiful for the scars of a productive careershe kept thinking numbly missing half his wordsthe face too beautiful to risk then it struck her that his physical perfection was only a simple illustration a childish lesson given to her in crudely obvious terms on the nature of the outer world and on the fate of any human value in a subhuman age whatever the justice or the evil of his course she thought how could they no she thought his course was just and this was the horror of it that there was no other course for justice to select that she could not condemn him that she could neither approve nor utter a word of reproach and the names of my customers miss taggart were chosen slowly one by one i had to be certain of the nature of their character and career on my list of restitution your name was one of the first she forced herself to keep her face expressionlessly tight and she answered only i see your account is one of the last left unpaid it is here at the mulligan bank to be claimed by you on the day when you join us i see your account however is not as large as some of the others even though huge sums were extorted from you by force in the past twelve years you will findas it is marked on the copies oј your incometax returns which mulligan will hand over to youthat i have refunded only those taxes which you paid on the salary you earned as operating vicepresident but not the taxes you paid on your income from your taggart transcontinental stock you deserved every penny of that stock and in the days of your father i would have refunded every penny of your profitbut under your brothers management taggart transcontinental has taken its share of the looting it has made profits by force by means of government favors subsidies moratoriums directives you were not responsible for it you were in fact the greatest victim of that policybut i refund only the money which was made by pure productive ability not the money any part of which was loot taken by force i see they had finished their breakfast danneskjold lighted a cigarette and watched her for an instant through the first jet of smoke as if he knew the violence of the conflict in her mindthen he grinned at galt and rose to his feet ill run along he said my wife is waiting for me what she gasped my wife he repeated gaily as if he had not understood the reason of her shock who is your wife kay ludlow the implications that struck her were more than she could bear to consider when when were you married four years ago how could you show yourself anywhere long enough to go through a wedding ceremony we were married here by judge narragansett how canshe tried to stop but the words burst involuntarily in helplessly indignant protest whether against him fate or the outer world she could not tellhow can she live through eleven months of thinking that you at any moment might be she did not finish he was smiling but she saw the enormous solemnity of that which he and his wife had needed to earn their right to this kind of smile she can live through it miss taggart because we do not hold the belief that this earth is a realm of misery where man is doomed to destruction we do not think that tragedy is our natural fate and we do not live in chronic dread of disaster we do not expect disaster until we have specific reason to expect itand when we encounter it we are free to fight it it is not happiness but suffering that we consider unnatural it is not success but calamity that we regard as the abnormal exception in human life galt accompanied him to the door then came back sat down at the table and in a leisurely manner reached for another cup of coffee she shot to her feet as if flung by a jet of pressure breaking a safety valve do you think that ill ever accept his money he waited until the curving streak of coffee had filled his cup then glanced up at her and answered yes i think so well i wont i wont let him risk his life for it you have no choice about that i have the choice never to claim it yes you have then it will lie in that bank till doomsday no it wont if you dont claim it some part of ita very small partwill be turned over to me in your name in my name why to pay for your room and board she stared at him her look of anger switching to bewilderment then dropped slowly back on her chair he smiled how long did you think you were going to stay here miss taggart he saw her startled look of helplessness you havent thought of it i have youre going to stay here for a month for the one month of our vacation like the rest of us i am not asking for your consentyou did not ask for ours when you came here you broke our rules so youll have to take the consequences nobody leaves the valley during this month i could let you go of course but i wont theres no rule demanding that i hold you but by forcing your way here youve given me the right to any choice i makeand im going to hold you simply because i want you here if at the end of a month you decide that you wish to go back you will be free to do so not until then she sat straight the planes of her face relaxed the shape of her mouth softened by the faint purposeful suggestion of a smile it was the dangerous smile of an adversary but her eyes were coldly brilliant and veiled at once like the eyes of an adversary who fully intends to fight but hopes to lose very well she said i shall charge you for your room and boardit is against our rules to provide the unearned sustenance of another human being some of us have wives and children but there is a mutual trade involved in that and a mutual paymenthe glanced at herof a kind i am not entitled to collect so i shall charge you fifty cents a day and you will pay me when you accept the account that lies in your name at the mulligan bank if you dont accept the account mulligan will charge your debt against it and he will give me the money when i ask for it i shall comply with your terms she answered her voice had the shrewd confident deliberating slowness of a trader but i shall not permit the use of that money for my debts how else do you propose to comply i propose to earn my room and board by what means by working in what capacity in the capacity of your cook and housemaid for the first time she saw him take the shock of the unexpected in a manner and with a violence she had not foreseen it was only an explosion of laughter on his partbut he laughed as if he were hit beyond his defenses much beyond the immediate meaning of her words she felt that she had struck his past tearing loose some memory and meaning of his own which she could not know he laughed as if he were seeing some distant image as if he were laughing in its face as if this were his victoryand hers if you will hire me she said her face severely polite her tone harshly clear impersonal and businesslike i shall cook your meals clean your house do your laundry and perform such other duties as are required of a servantin exchange for my room board and such money as i will need for some items of clothing i may be slightly handicapped by my injuries for the next few days but that will not last and i will be able to do the job fully is that what you want to do he asked that is what i want to do she answered and stopped before she uttered the rest of the answer in her mind more than anything else in the world he was still smiling it was a smile of amusement but it was as if amusement could be transmuted into some shining glory all right miss taggart he said ill hire you she inclined her head in a dryly formal acknowledgment thank you i will pay you ten dollars a month in addition to your room and board very well i shall be the first man in this valley to hire a servant he got up reached into his pocket and threw a fivedollar gold piece down on the table as advance on your wages he said she was startled to discover as her hand reached for the gold piece that she felt the eager desperate tremulous hope of a young girl on her first job the hope that she would be able to deserve it yes sir she said her eyes lowered owen kellogg arrived on the afternoon of her third day in the valley she did not know which shocked him most the sight of her standing on the edge of the airfield as he descended from the planethe sight of her clothes her delicate transparent blouse tailored by the most expensive shop in new york and the wide cottonprint skirt she had bought in the valley for sixty centsher cane her bandages or the basket of groceries on her arm he descended among a group of men he saw her he stopped then ran to her as if flung forward by some emotion so strong that whatever its nature it looked like terror miss taggart he whisperedand said nothing else while she laughed trying to explain how she had come to beat him to his destination he listened as if it were irrelevant and then he uttered the thing from which he had to recover but we thought you were dead who thought it all of us i mean everybody in the outside world then she suddenly stopped smiling while his voice began to recapture his story and his first sound of joy miss taggart dont you remember you told me to phone winston colorado and to tell them that youd be there by noon of the next day that was to be the day before yesterday may thirtyfirst but you did not reach winstonand by late afternoon the news was on all the radios that you were lost in a plane crash somewhere in the rocky mountains she nodded slowly grasping the events she had not thought of considering i heard it aboard the comet he said at a small station in the middle of new mexico the conductor held us there for an hour while i helped him to check the story on longdistance phones he was hit by the news just as i was they all werethe train crew the station agent the switchmen they huddled around me while i called the city rooms of newspapers in denver and new york we didnt learn much only that you had left the afton airfield just before dawn on may thirtyfirst that you seemed to be following some strangers plane that the attendant had seen you go off southeastand that nobody had seen you since and that searching parties were combing the rockies for the wreckage of your plane she asked involuntarily did the comet reach san francisco i dont know she was crawling north through arizona when i gave up there were too many delays too many things going wrong and a total confusion of orders i got off and spent the night hitchhiking my way to colorado bumming rides on trucks on buggies on horse carts to get there on timeto get to our meeting place i mean where we gather for midas ferry plane to pick us up and bring us here she started walking slowly up the path toward the car she had left in front of hammonds grocery market kellogg followed and when he spoke again his voice dropped a little slowing down with their steps as if there were something they both wished to delay i got a job for jeff alien he said his voice had the peculiarly solemn tone proper for saying i have carried out your last will your agent at laurel grabbed him and put him to work the moment we got there the agent needed every ablebodiedno ablemindedman he could find they had reached the car but she did not get in miss taggart you werent hurt badly were you did you say you crashed but it wasnt serious no not serious at all ill be able to get along without mr mulligans car by tomorrowand in a day or two i wont need this thing either she swung her cane and tossed it contemptuously into the car they stood in silence she was waiting the last longdistance call i made from that station in new mexico he said slowly was to pennsylvania i spoke to hank rearden i told him everything i knew he listened and then there was a pause and then he said thank you for calling me kelloggs eyes were lowered he added i never want to hear that kind of pause again as long as i live he raised his eyes to hers there was no reproach in his glance only the knowledge of that which he had not suspected when he heard her request but had guessed since thank you she said and threw the door of the car open can i give you a lift i have to get back and get dinner ready before my employer comes home it was in the first moment of returning to galts house of standing alone in the silent sunfilled room that she faced the full meaning of what she felt she looked at the window at the mountains barring the sky in the east she thought of hank rearden as he sat at his desk now two thousand miles away his face tightened into a retaining wall against agony as it had been tightened under all the blows of all his yearsand she felt a desperate wish to fight his battle to fight for him for his past for that tension of his face and the courage that fed itas she wanted to fight for the comet that crawled by a last effort across a desert on a crumbling track she shuddered closing her eyes feeling as if she were guilty of double treason feeling as if she were suspended in space between this valley and the rest of the earth with no right to either the feeling vanished when she sat facing galt across the dinner table he was watching her openly and with an untroubled look as if her presence were normaland as if the sight of her were all he wished to allow into his consciousness she leaned back a little as if complying with the meaning of his glance and said dryly efficiently in deliberate denial i have checked your shirts and found one with two buttons missing and another with the left elbow worn through do you wish me to mend them why yesif you can do it i can do it it did not seem to alter the nature of his glance it merely seemed to stress its satisfaction as if this were what he had wished her to say except that she was not certain whether satisfaction was the name for the thing she saw in his eyes and fully certain that he had not wished her to say anything beyond the window at the edge of the table storm clouds had wiped out the last remnants of light in the eastern sky she wondered why she felt a sudden reluctance to look out why she felt as if she wanted to cling to the golden patches of light on the wood of the table on the buttered crust of the rolls on the copper coffee pot on galts hair to cling as to a small island on the edge of a void then she heard her own voice asking suddenly involuntarily and she knew that this was the treason she had wanted to escape do you permit any communication with the outside world no not any not even a note without return address no not even a message if no secret of yours were given away not from here not during this month not to outsiders at any time she noticed that she was avoiding his eyes and she forced herself to lift her head and face him his glance had changed it was watchful unmoving implacably perceptive he asked looking at her as if he knew the reason of her query do you wish to ask for a special exception no she answered holding his glance next morning after breakfast when she sat in her room carefully placing a patch on the sleeve of galts shirt with her door closed not to let him see her fumbling effort at an unfamiliar task she heard the sound of a car stopping in front of the house she heard galts steps hurrying across the living room she heard him jerk the entrance door open and call out with the joyous anger of relief its about time she rose to her feet but stopped she heard his voice its tone abruptly changed and grave as if in answer to the shock of some sight confronting him whats the matter hello john said a clear quiet voice that sounded steady but weighted with exhaustion she sat down on her bed feeling suddenly drained of strength the voice was franciscos she heard galt asking his tone severe with concern what is it ill tell you afterwards why are you so late i have to leave again in an hour to leave john i just came to tell you that i wont be able to stay here this year there was a pause then galt asked gravely his voice low is it as bad as thatwhatever it is yes i i might be back before the month is over i dont know he added with the sound of a desperate effort i dont know whether to hope to be done with it quickly or or not francisco could you stand a shock right now i nothing could shock me now theres a person here in my guest room whom you have to see it will be a shock to you so i think id better warn you in advance that this person is still a scab what a scab in your house let me tell you how thats something i want to see for myself she heard franciscos contemptuous chuckle and the rush of his steps she saw her door flung open and she noticed dimly that it was galt who closed it leaving them alone she did not know how long francisco stood looking at her because the first moment that she grasped fully was when she saw him on his knees holding onto her his face pressed to her legs the moment when she felt as if the shudder that ran through his body and left him still had run into hers and made her able to move she saw in astonishment that her hand was moving gently over his hair while she was thinking that she had no right to do it and feeling as if a current of serenity were flowing from her hand enveloping them both smoothing the past he did not move he made no sound as if the act of holding her said everything he had to say when he raised his head he looked as she had felt when she had opened her eyes in the valley he looked as if no pain had ever existed in the world he was laughing dagny dagny dagnyhis voice sounded not as if a confession resisted for years were breaking out but as if he were repeating the long since known laughing at the pretense that it had ever been unsaid of course i love you were you afraid when he made me say it ill say it as often as you wishi love you darling i love you i always willdont be afraid for me i dont care if ill never have you again what does that matteryoure alive and youre here and you know everything now and its so simple isnt it do you see what it was and why i had to desert you his arm swept out to point at the valley there it isits your earth your kingdom your kind of worlddagny ive always loved you and that i deserted you that was my love he took her hands and pressed them to his lips and held them not moving not as a kiss but as a long moment of restas if the effort of speech were a distraction from the fact of her presence and as if he were torn by too many things to say by the pressure of all the words stored in the silence of years the women i chasedyou didnt believe that did you ive never touched one of thembut i think you knew it i think youve known it all along the playboyit was a part that i had to play in order not to let the looters suspect me while i was destroying danconia copper in plain sight of the whole world thats the joker in their system theyre out to fight any man of honor and ambition but let them see a worthless rotter and they think hes a friend they think hes safesafethats their view of life but are they learningare they learning whether evil is safe and incompetence practical dagny it was the night when i knew for the first time that i loved youit was then that i knew i had to go it was when you entered my hotel room that night when i saw what you looked like what you were what you meant to meand what awaited you in the future had you been less you might have stopped me for a while but it was you you who were the final argument that made me leave you i asked for your help that nightagainst john galt but i knew that you were his best weapon against me though neither you nor he could know it you were everything that he was seeking everything he told us to live for or die if necessary i was ready for him when he called me suddenly to come to new york that spring i had not heard from him for some time he was fighting the same problem i was he solved it do you remember it was the time when you did not hear from me for three years dagny when i took over my fathers business when i began to deal with the whole industrial system of the world it was then that i began to see the nature of the evil i had suspected but thought too monstrous to believe i saw the taxcollecting vermin that had grown for centuries like mildew on danconia copper draining us by no right that anyone could namei saw the government regulations passed to cripple me because i was successful and to help my competitors because they were loafing failuresi saw the labor unions who won every claim against me by reason of my ability to make their livelihood possiblei saw that any mans desire for money he could not earn was regarded as a righteous wish but if he earned it it was damned as greedi saw the politicians who winked at me telling me not to worry because i could just work a little harder and outsmart them all i looked past the profits of the moment and i saw that the harder i worked the more i tightened the noose around my throat i saw that my energy was being poured down a sewer that the parasites who fed on me were being fed upon in their turn that they were caught in their own trapand that there was no reason for it no answer known to anyone that the sewer pipes of the world draining its productive blood led into some dank fog nobody had dared to pierce while people merely shrugged and said that life on earth could be nothing but evil and then i saw that the whole industrial establishment of the world with all of its magnificent machinery its thousandton furnaces its transatlantic cables its mahogany offices its stock exchanges its blazing electric signs its power its wealthall of it was run not by bankers and boards of directors but by any unshaved humanitarian in any basement beer joint by any face pudgy with malice who preached that virtue must be penalized for being virtue that the purpose of ability is to serve incompetence that man has no right to exist except for the sake of others i knew it i saw no way to fight it john found the way there were just the two of us with him the night when we came to new york in answer to his call ragnar and i he told us what we had to do and what sort of men we had to reach he had quit the twentieth century he was living in a garret in a slum neighborhood he stepped to the window and pointed at the skyscrapers of the city he said that we had to extinguish the lights of the world and when we would see the lights of new york go out we would know that our job was done he did not ask us to join him at once he told us to think it over and to weigh everything it would do to our lives i gave him my answer on the morning of the second day and ragnar a few hours later in the afternoon dagny that was the morning after our last night together i had seen in a manner of vision that i couldnt escape what it was that i had to fight for it was for the way you looked that night for the way you talked about your railroadfor the way you had looked when we tried to see the skyline of new york from the top of a rock over the hudsoni had to save you to clear the way for you to let you find your citynot to let you stumble the years of your life away struggling on through a poisoned fog with your eyes still held straight ahead still looking as they had looked in the sunlight struggling on to find at the end of your road not the towers of a city but a fat soggy mindless cripple performing his enjoyment of life by means of swallowing the gin your life had gone to pay for youto know no joy in order that he may know it youto serve as fodder for the pleasure of others youas the means for the subhuman as the end dagny that was what i saw and that was what i couldnt let them do to you not to you not to any child who had your kind of look whenhe faced the future not to any man who had your spirit and was able to experience a moment of being proudly guiltlessly confidently joyously alive that was my love that state of the human spirit and i left you to fight for it and i knew that if i were to lose you it was still you that i would be winning with every year of the battle but you see it now dont you youve seen this valley its the place we set out to reach when we were children you and i weve reached it what else can i ask for now just to see you heredid john say youre still a scaboh well its only a matter of tune but youll be one of us because youve always been if you dont see it fully well wait i dont careso long as youre alive so long as i dont have to go on flying over the rockies looking for the wreckage of your plane she gasped a little realizing why he had not come to the valley on time he laughed dont look like that dont look at me as if i were a wound that youre afraid to touch francisco ive hurt you in so many different ways no no you havent hurt meand he hasnt either dont say anything about it its he whos hurt but well save him and hell come here too where he belongs and hell know and then he too will be able to laugh about it dagny i didnt expect you to wait i didnt hope i knew the chance id taken and if it had to be anyone im glad its he she closed her eyes pressing her lips together not to moan darling dont dont you see that ive accepted it but it isntshe thoughtit isnt he and i cant tell you the truth because its a man who might never hear it from me and whom i might never have francisco i did love you she said and caught her breath shocked realizing that she had not intended to say it and simultaneously that this was not the tense she had wanted to use but you do he said calmly smiling you still love meeven if theres one expression of it that youll always feel and want but will not give me any longer im still what i was and youll always see it and youll always grant me the same response even if theres a greater one that you grant to another man no matter what you feel for him it will not change what you feel for me and it wont be treason to either because it comes from the same root its the same payment in answer to the same values no matter what happens in the future well always be what we were to each other you and i because youll always love me francisco she whispered do you know that of course dont you understand it now dagny every form of happiness is one every desire is driven by the same motorby our love for a single value for the highest potentiality of our own existenceand every achievement is an expression of it look around you do you see how much is open to us here on an unobstructed earth do you see how much i am free to do to experience to achieve do you see that all of it is part of what you are to meas i am part of it for you and if ill see you smile with admiration at a new copper smelter that i built it will be another form of what i felt when i lay in bed beside you will i want to sleep with you desperately will i envy the man who does sure but what does that matter its so muchjust to have you here to love you and to be alive her eyes lowered her face stern holding her head bowed as in an act of reverence she said slowly as if fulfilling a solemn promise will you forgive me he looked astonished then chuckled gaily remembering and answered not yet theres nothing to forgive but ill forgive it when you join us he rose he drew her to her feetand when his arms closed about her their kiss was the summation of their past its end and their seal of acceptance galt turned to them from across the living room when they came out he had been standing at a window looking at the valleyand she felt certain that he had stood there all that time she saw his eyes studying their faces his glance moving slowly from one to the other his face relaxed a little at the sight of the change in franciscos francisco smiled asking him why do you stare at me do you know what you looked like when you came in oh did i thats because i hadnt slept for three nights john will you invite me to dinner i want to know how this scab of yours got here but i think that i might collapse sound asleep in the middle of a sentenceeven though right now i feel as if ill never need any sleep at allso i think id better go home and stay there till evening galt was watching him with a faint smile but arent you going to leave the valley in an hour what no he said mildly in momentary astonishment no he laughed exultantly i dont have to thats right i havent told you what it was have i i was searching for dagny for for the wreck of her plane shed been reported lost in a crash in the rockies i see said galt quietly i could have thought of anything except that she would choose to crash in galts gulch francisco said happily he had the tone of that joyous relief which almost relishes the horror of the past defying it by means of the present i kept flying over the district between afton utah and winston colorado over every peak and crevice of it over every remnant of a car in any gully below and whenever i saw one i he stopped it looked like a shudder then at night we went out on footthe searching parties of railroad men from winstonwe went climbing at random with no clues no plan on and on until it was daylight again and he shrugged trying to dismiss it and to smile i wouldnt wish it on my worst he stopped short his smile vanished and a dim reflection of the look he had worn for three days came back to his face as if at the sudden presence of an image he had forgotten after a long moment he turned to galt john his voice sounded peculiarly solemn could we notify those outside that dagny is alive in case theres somebody who whod feel as i did galt was looking straight at him do you wish to give any outsider any relief from the consequences of remaining outside francisco dropped his eyes but answered firmly no pity francisco yes forget it youre right galt turned away with a movement that seemed oddly out of character it had the unrhythmical abruptness of the involuntary he did not turn back francisco watched him in astonishment then asked softly whats the matter galt turned and looked at him for a moment not answering she could not identify the emotion that softened the lines of galts face it had the quality of a smile of gentleness of pain and of something greater that seemed to make these concepts superfluous whatever any of us has paid for this battle said galt youre the one whos taken the hardest beating arent you who i francisco grinned with shocked incredulous amusement certainly not whats the matter with you he chuckled and added pity john no said galt firmly she saw francisco watching him with a faint puzzled frownbecause galt had said it looking not at him but at her the emotional sum that struck her as an immediate impression of franciscos house when she entered it for the first time was not the sum she had once drawn from the sight of its silent locked exterior she felt not a sense of tragic loneliness but of invigorating brightness the rooms were bare and crudely simple the house seemed built with the skill the decisiveness and the impatience typical of francisco it looked like a frontiersmans shanty thrown together to serve as a mere springboard for a long flight into the futurea future where so great a field of activity lay waiting that no time could be wasted on the comfort of its start the place had the brightness not of a home but of a fresh wooden scaffolding erected to shelter the birth of a skyscraper francisco in shirt sleeves stood in the middle of his twelvefoot square living room with the look of a host in a palace of all the places where she had ever seen him this was the background that seemed most properly his just as the simplicity of his clothes added to his bearing gave him the air of a superlative aristocrat so the crudeness of the room gave it the appearance of the most patrician retreat a single royal touch was added to the crudeness two ancient silver goblets stood in a small niche cut in a wall of bare logs their ornate design had required the luxury of some craftsmans long and costly labor more labor than had gone to build the shanty a design dimmed by the polish of more centuries than had gone to grow the log walls pines in the midst of that room franciscos easy natural manner had a touch of quiet pride as if his smile were silently saying to her this is what i am and what i have been all these years she looked up at the silver goblets yes he said in answer to her silent guess they belonged to sebastian danconia and his wife thats the only thing i brought here from my palace in buenos aires that and the crest over the door its all i wanted to save everything else will go in a very few months now he chuckled theyll seize it all of it the last dregs of danconia copper but theyll be surprised they wont find much for their trouble and as to that palace they wont be able to afford even its heating bill and then she asked where will you go from there i i will go to work for danconia copper what do you mean do you remember that old slogan the king is dead long live the king when the carcass of my ancestors property is out of the way then my mine will become the young new body of danconia copper the kind of property my ancestors had wanted had worked for had deserved but had never owned your mine what mine where here he said pointing toward the mountain peaks didnt you know it no i own a copper mine that the looters wont reach its here in these mountains i did the prospecting i discovered it i broke the first excavation it was over eight years ago i was the first man to whom midas sold land in this valley i bought that mine i started it with my own hands as sebastian danconia had started i have a superintendent in charge of it now who used to be my best metallurgist in chile the mine produces all the copper we require my profits are deposited at the mulligan bank that will be all ill have a few months from now that will be all ill need to conquer the world was the way his voice sounded on his last sentenceand she marveled at the difference between that sound and the shameful mawkish tone halfwhine halfthreat the tone of beggar and thug combined which the men of their century had given to the word need dagny he was saying standing at the window as if looking out at the peaks not of mountains but of time the rebirth of danconia copperand of the worldhas to start here in the united states this country was the only country in history born not of chance and blind tribal warfare but as a rational product of mans mind this country was built on the supremacy of reasonand for one magnificent century it redeemed the world it will have to do so again the first step of danconia copper as of any other human value has to come from herebecause the rest of the earth has reached the consummation of the beliefs it has held through the ages mystic faith the supremacy of the irrational which has but two monuments at the end of its course the lunatic asylum and the graveyard sebastian danconia committed one error he accepted a system which declared that the property he had earned by right was to be his not by right but by permission his descendants paid for that error i have made the last payment i think that i will see the day when growing out from their root in this soil the mines the smelters the ore docks of danconia copper will spread again through the world and down to my native country and i will be the first to start my countrys rebuilding i may see it but i cannot be certain no man can predict the time when others will choose to return to reason it may be that at the end of my life i shall have established nothing but this single minedanconia copper no galts gulch colorado usa but dagny do you remember that my ambition was to double my fathers production of copper dagny if at the end of my life i produce but one pound of copper a year i will be richer than my father richer than all my ancestors with all their thousands of tonsbecause that one pound will be mine by right and will be used to maintain a world that knows it this was the francisco of their childhood in bearing in manner in the unclouded brilliance of his eyesand she found herself questioning him about his copper mine as she had questioned him about his industrial projects on their walks on the shore of the hudson recapturing the sense of an unobstructed future ill take you to see the mine he said as soon as your ankle recovers completely we have to climb a steep trail to get there just a mule trail theres no truck road as yet let me show you the new smelter im designing ive been working on it for some time its too complex for our present volume of production but when the mines output grows to justify itjust take a look at the time labor and money that it will save they were sitting together on the floor bending over the sheets of paper he spread before her studying the intricate sections of the smelterwith the same joyous earnestness they had once brought to the study of scraps in a junk yard she leaned forward just as he moved to reach for another sheet and she found herself leaning against his shoulderinvoluntarily she held still for one instant no longer than for a small break in the flow of a single motion while her eyes rose to his he was looking down at her neither hiding what he felt nor implying any further demand she drew back knowing that she had felt the same desire as his then still holding the recaptured sensation of what she had felt for him in the past she grasped a quality that had always been part of it now suddenly clear to her for the first time if that desire was a celebration of ones life then what she had felt for francisco had always been a celebration of her future like a moment of splendor gained in part payment of an unknown total affirming some promise to come in the instant when she grasped it she knew also the only desire she had ever experienced not in token of the future but of the full and final present she knew it by means of an imagethe image of a mans figure standing at the door of a small granite structure the final form of the promise that had kept her moving she thought was the man who would perhaps remain a promise never to be reached but thisshe thought in consternationwas that view of human destiny which she had most passionately hated and rejected the view that man was ever to be drawn by some vision of the unattainable shining ahead doomed ever to aspire but not to achieve her life and her values could not bring her to that she thought she had never found beauty in longing for the impossible and had never found the possible to be beyond her reach but she had come to it and she could find no answer she could not give him up or give up the worldshe thought looking at galt that evening the answer seemed harder to find in his presence she felt that no problem existed that nothing could stand beside the fact of seeing him and nothing would ever have the power to make her leaveand simultaneously that she would have no right to look at him if she were to renounce her railroad she felt that she owned him that the unnamed had been understood between them from the startand simultaneously that he was able to vanish from her me and on some future street of the outside world to pass her by in unweighted indifference she noted that he did not question her about francisco when she spoke of her visit she could find no reaction in his face neither of approval nor of resentment it seemed to her that she caught an imperceptible shading in his gravely attentive expression he looked as if this were a matter about which he did not choose to feel her faint apprehension grew into a question mark and the question mark turned into a drill cutting deeper and deeper into her mind through the evenings that followedwhen galt left the house and she remained alone he went out every other night after dinner not telling her where he went returning at midnight or later she tried not to allow herself fully to discover with what tension and restlessness she waited for his return she did not ask him where he spent his evenings the reluctance that stopped her was her too urgent desire to know she kept silent in some dimly intentional form of defiance half in defiance of him half of her own anxiety she would not acknowledge the things she feared or give them the solid shape of words she knew them only by the ugly nagging pull of an unadmitted emotion part of it was a savage resentment of a kind she had never experienced before which was her answer to the dread that there might be a woman in his life yet the resentment was softened by some quality of health in the thing she feared as if the threat could be fought and even if need be accepted but there was another uglier dread the sordid shape of selfsacrifice the suspicion not to be uttered about him that he wished to remove himself from her path and let its emptiness force her back to the man who was his bestloved friend days passed before she spoke of it then at dinner on an evening when he was to leave she became suddenly aware of the peculiar pleasure she experienced while watching him eat the food she had preparedand suddenly involuntarily as if that pleasure gave her a right she dared not identify as if enjoyment not pain broke her resistance she heard herself asking him what is it youre doing every other evening he answered simply as if he had taken for granted that she knew it lecturing what giving a course of lectures on physics as i do every year during this month its my what are you laughing at he asked seeing the look of relief of silent laughter that did not seem to be directed at his wordsand then before she answered he smiled suddenly as if he had guessed the answer she saw some particular intensely personal quality in his smile which was almost a quality of insolent intimacyin contrast to the calmly impersonal casual manner with which he went on you know that this is the month when we all trade the achievements of our real professions richard halley is to give concerts kay ludlow is to appear in two plays written by authors who do not write for the outside worldand i give lectures reporting on the work ive done during the year free lectures certainly not its ten dollars per person for the course i want to hear you he shook his head no youll be allowed to attend the concerts the plays or any form of presentation for your own enjoyment but not my lectures or any other sale of ideas which you might carry out of this valley besides my customers or students are only those who have a practical purpose in taking my course dwight sanders lawrence hammond dick mcnamara owen kellogg a few others ive added one beginner this year quentin daniels really she said almost with a touch of jealousy how can he afford anything that expensive on credit ive given him a timepayment plan hes worth it where do you lecture in the hangar on dwight sanders farm and where do you work during the year in my laboratory she asked cautiously where is your laboratory here in the valley he held her eyes for a moment letting her see that his glance was amused and that he knew her purpose then answered no youve lived in the outside world for all of these twelve years yes do youthe thought seemed unbearabledo you hold some such job as the others oh yes the amusement in his eyes seemed stressed by some special meaning dont tell me that youre a second assistant bookkeeper no im not then what do you do i hold the kind of job that the world wishes me to hold where he shook his head no miss taggart if you decide to leave the valley this is one of the things that you are not to know he smiled again with that insolently personal quality which now seemed to say that he knew the threat contained in his answer and what it meant to her then he rose from the table when he had gone she felt as if the motion of time were an oppressive weight in the stillness of the house like a stationary halfsolid mass slithering slowly into some faint elongation by a tempo that left her no measure to know whether minutes had passed or hours she lay halfstretched in an armchair of the living room crumpled by that heavy indifferent lassitude which is not the will to laziness but the frustration of the will to a secret violence that no lesser action can satisfy that special pleasure she had felt in watching him eat the food she had preparedshe thought lying still her eyes closed her mind moving like time through some realm of veiled slownessit had been the pleasure of knowing that she had provided him with a sensual enjoyment that one form of his bodys satisfaction had come from her there is reason she thought why a woman would wish to cook for a man oh not as a duty not as a chronic career only as a rare and special rite in symbol of but what have they made of it the preachers of womans duty the castrated performance of a sickening drudgery was held to be a womans proper virtuewhile that which gave it meaning and sanction was held as a shameful sin the work of dealing with grease steam and slimy peelings in a reeking kitchen was held to be a spiritual matter an act of compliance with her moral dutywhile the meeting of two bodies in a bedroom was held to be a physical indulgence an act of surrender to an animal instinct with no glory meaning or pride of spirit to be claimed by the animals involved she leaped abruptly to her feet she did not want to think of the outer world or of its moral code but she knew that that was not the subject of her thoughts and she did not want to think of the subject her mind was intent on pursuing the subject to which it kept returning against her will by some will of its own she paced the room hating the ugly jerky uncontrolled looseness of her movementstorn between the need to let her motion break the stillness and the knowledge that this was not the form of break she wanted she lighted cigarettes for an instants illusion of purposeful actionand discarded them within another instant feeling the weary distaste of a substitute purpose she looked at the room like a restless beggar pleading with physical objects to give her a motive wishing she could find something to clean to mend to polishwhile knowing that no task was worth the effort when nothing seems worth the effortsaid some stern voice in her mindits a screen to hide a wish thats worth too much what do you want she snapped a match viciously jerking the flame to the tip of a cigarette she noticed hanging unlighted in the corner of her mouth what do you wantrepeated the voice that sounded severe as a judge i want him to come backshe answered throwing the words as a soundless cry at some accuser within her almost as one would throw a bone to a pursuing beast in the hope of distracting it from pouncing upon the rest i want him backshe said softly in answer to the accusation that there was no reason for so great an impatience i want him back she said pleadingly in answer to the cold reminder that her answer did not balance the judges scale i want him backshe cried defiantly fighting not to drop the one superfluous protective word in that sentence she felt her head drooping with exhaustion as after a prolonged beating the cigarette she saw between her fingers had burned the mere length of half an inch she ground it out and fell into the armchair again im not evading itshe thoughtim not evading it its just that i can see no way to any answer that which you wantsaid the voice while she stumbled through a thickening fogis yours for the taking but anything less than your full acceptance anything less than your full conviction is a betrayal of everything he is then let him damn meshe thought as if the voice were now lost in the fog and would not hear herlet him damn me tomorrow i want him back she heard no answer because her head had fallen softly against the chair she was asleep when she opened her eyes she saw him standing three feet away looking down at her as if he had been watching her for some time she saw his face and with the clarity of undivided perception she saw the meaning of the expression on his face it was the meaning she had fought for hours she saw it without astonishment because she had not yet regained her awareness of any reason why it should astonish her this is the way you look he said softly when you fall asleep in your office and she knew that he too was not fully aware of letting her hear it the way he said it told her how often he had thought of it and for what reason you look as if you would awaken in a world where you had nothing to hide or to fear and she knew that the first movement of her face had been a smile she knew it in the moment when it vanished when she grasped that they were both awake he added quietly with full awareness but here its true her first emotion of the realm of reality was a sense of power she sat up with a flowing leisurely movement of confidence feeling the flow of the motion from muscle to muscle through her body she asked and it was the slowness the sound of casual curiosity the tone of taking the implications for granted that gave to her voice the faintest sound of disdain how did you know what i look like in my office i told you that ive watched you for years how were you able to watch me that thoroughly from where i will not answer you now he said simply without defiance the slight movement of her shoulder leaning back the pause then the lower huskier tone of her voice left a hint of smiling triumph to trail behind her words when did you see me for the first time ten years ago he answered looking straight at her letting her see that he was answering the full unnamed meaning of her question where the word was almost a command he hesitated then she saw a faint smile that touched only his lips not his eyes the kind of smile with which one contemplateswith longing bitterness and pridea possession purchased at an excruciating cost his eyes seemed directed not at her but at the girl of that time underground in the taggart terminal he answered she became suddenly conscious of her posture she had let her shoulder blades slide down against the chair carelessly halflying one leg stretched forwardand with her sternly tailored transparent blouse her wide peasant skirt handprinted in violent colors her thin stocking and highheeled pump she did not look like a railroad executivethe consciousness of it struck her in answer to his eyes that seemed to be seeing the unattainableshe looked like that which she was his servant girl she knew the moment when some faintest stress of the brilliance in his dark green eyes removed the veil of distance replacing the vision of the past by the act of seeing her immediate person she met his eyes with that insolent glance which is a smile without movement of facial muscles he turned away but as he moved across the room his steps were as eloquent as the sound of a voice she knew that he wanted to leave the room as he always left it he had never stayed for longer than a brief good night when he came home she watched the course of his struggle whether by means of his steps begun in one direction and swerving in another or by means of her certainty that her body had become an instrument for the direct perception of his like a screen reflecting both movements and motivesshe could not tell she knew only that he who had never started or lost a battle against himself now had no power to leave this room his manner seemed to show no sign of strain he took off his coat throwing it aside remaining in shirt sleeves and sat down facing her at the window across the room but he sat down on the arm of a chair as if he were neither leaving nor staying she felt the lightheaded the easy the almost frivolous sensation of triumph in the knowledge that she was holding him as surely as by a physical touch for the length of a moment brief and dangerous to endure it was a more satisfying form of contact then she felt a sudden blinding shock which was halfblow half scream within her and she groped stunned for its causeonly to realize that he had leaned a little to one side and it had been no more than the sight of an accidental posture of the long line running from his shoulder to the angle of his waist to his hips down his legs she looked away not to let him see that she was tremblingand she dropped all thoughts of triumph and of whose was the power ive seen you many times since he said quietly steadily but a little more slowly than usual as if he could control everything except his need to speak where have you seen me many places but you made certain to remain unseen she knew that his was a face she could not have failed to notice yes why were you afraid yes he said it simply and it took her a moment to realize that he was admitting he knew what the sight of his person would have meant to her did you know who i was when you saw me for the first time oh yes my worst enemy but one what she had not expected it she added more quietly whos the worst one dr robert stadler did you have me classified with him no hes my conscious enemy hes the man who sold his soul we dont intend to reclaim him youyou were one of us i knew it long before i saw you i knew also that you would be the last to join us and the hardest one to defeat who told you that francisco she let a moment pass then asked what did he say he said that of all the names on our list youd be the one most difficult to win that was when i heard of you for the first time it was francisco who put your name on our list he told me that you were the sole hope and future of taggart transcontinental that youd stand against us for a long time that youd fight a desperate battle for your railroadbecause you had too much endurance courage and consecration to your work he glanced at her he told me nothing else he spoke of you as if he were merely discussing one of our future strikers i knew that you and he had been childhood friends that was all when did you see me two years later how by chance it was late at night on a passenger platform of the taggart terminal she knew that this was a form of surrender he did not want to say it yet he had to speak she heard both the muted intensity and the pull of resistance in his voicehe had to speak because he had to give himself and her this one form of contact you wore an evening gown you had a cape halfslipping off your bodyi saw at first only your bare shoulders your back and your profileit looked for a moment as if the cape would slip further and you would stand there naked then i saw that you wore a long gown the color of ice like the tunic of a grecian goddess but had the short hair and the imperious profile of an american woman you looked preposterously out of place on a railroad platformand it was not on a railroad platform that i was seeing you i was seeing a setting that had never haunted me beforebut then suddenly i knew that you did belong among the rails the soot and the girders that that was the proper setting for a flowing gown and naked shoulders and a face as alive as yoursa railroad platform not a curtained apartmentyou looked like a symbol of luxury and you belonged in the place that was its sourceyou seemed to bring wealth grace extravagance and the enjoyment of life back to their rightful owners to the men who created railroads and factoriesyou had a look of energy and of its reward together a look of competence and luxury combinedand i was the first man who had ever stated in what manner these two were inseparableand i thought that if our age gave form to its proper gods and erected a statue to the meaning of an american railroad yours would be that statue then i saw what you were doingand i knew who you were you were giving orders to three terminal officials i could not hear your words but your voice sounded swift clearcut and confident i knew that you were dagny taggart i came closer close enough to hear two sentences who said so asked one of the men i did you answered that was all i heard that was enough and then he raised his eyes slowly to hold hers across the room and the submerged intensity that pulled his voice down blurring its tone to softness gave it a sound of selfmockery that was desperate and almost gentle then i knew that abandoning my motor was not the hardest price i would have to pay for this strike she wondered which anonymous shadowamong the passengers who had hurried past her as insubstantial as the steam of the engines and as ignoredwhich shadow and face had been his she wondered how close she had come to him for the length of that unknown moment oh why didnt you speak to me then or later do you happen to remember what you were doing in the terminal that night i remember vaguely a night when they called me from some party i was attending my father was out of town and the new terminal manager had made some sort of error that tied up all traffic in the tunnels the old manager had quit unexpectedly the week before it was i who made him quit i see her voice trailed off as if abandoning sound as her eyelids dropped abandoning sight if he had not withstood it thenshe thoughtif he had come to claim her then or later what sort of tragedy would they have had to reach she remembered what she had felt when she had cried that she would shoot the destroyer on sight i would havethe thought was not in words she knew it only as a trembling pressure in her stomachi would have shot him afterward if i discovered his role and i would have had to discover it and yetshe shuddered because she knew she still wished he had come to her because the thought not to be admitted into her mind but flowing as a dark warmth through her body was i would have shot him but not beforeshe raised her eyelidsand she knew that that thought was as naked to him in her eyes as it was to her in his she saw his veiled glance and the tautness of his mouth she saw him reduced to agony she felt herself drowned by the exultant wish to cause him pain to see it to watch it to watch it beyond her own endurance and his then to reduce him to the helplessness of pleasure he got up he looked away and she could not tell whether it was the slight lift of his head or the tension of his features that made his face look oddly calm and clear as if it were stripped of emotion down to the naked purity of its structure every man that your railroad needed and lost in the past ten years he said it was i who made you lose him his voice had the single toned flatness and the luminous simplicity of an accountant who reminds a reckless purchaser that cost is an absolute which cannot be escaped i have pulled every girder from under taggart transcontinental and if you choose to go back i will see it collapse upon your head he turned to leave the room she stopped him it was her voice more than her words that made him stop her voice was low it had no quality of emotion only of a sinking weight and its sole color was some dragging undertone like an inner echo resembling a threat it was the voice of the plea of a person who still retains a concept of honor but is long past caring for it you want to hold me here dont you more than anything else in the world you could hold me i know it his voice had said it with the same sound as hers he waited to regain his breath when he spoke his voice was low and clear with some stressed quality of awareness which was almost the quality of a smile of understanding its your acceptance of this place that i want what good would it do me to have your physical presence without any meaning thats the kind of faked reality by which most people cheat themselves of their lives im not capable of it he turned to go and neither are you good night miss taggart he walked out into his bedroom closing the door she was past the realm of thoughtas she lay in bed in the darkness of her room unable to think or to sleepand the moaning violence that filled her mind seemed only a sensation of her muscles but its tone and its twisting shades were like a pleading cry which she knew not as words but as pain let him come here let him break let it be damned all of it my railroad and his strike and everything weve lived bylet it be damned everything weve been and arehe would if tomorrow i were to diethen let me die but tomorrow let him come here be it any price he names i have nothing left thats not for sale to him any longeris this what it means to be an animalit does and i am she lay on her back her palms pressed to the sheet at her sides to stop herself from rising and walking into his room knowing that she was capable even of that its not i its a body i can neither endure nor control but somewhere within her not as words but as a radiant point of stillness there was the presence of the judge who seemed to observe her not in stern condemnation any longer but in approval and amusement as if saying your bodyif he were not what you know him to be would your body bring you to thiswhy is it his body that you want and no otherdo you think that you are damning them the things you both have lived byare you damning that which you are honoring in this very moment by your very desire she did not have to hear the words she knew them she had always known them after a while she lost the glow of that knowledge and there was nothing left but pain and the palms that were pressed to the sheetand the almost indifferent wonder whether he too was awake and fighting the same torture she heard no sound in the house and saw no light from his window on the tree trunks outside after a long while she heard from the darkness of his room two sounds that gave her a full answer she knew that he was awake and that he would not come it was the sound of a step and the click of a cigarette lighter richard halley stopped playing turned away from the piano and glanced at dagny he saw her drop her face with the involuntary movement of hiding too strong an emotion he rose smiled and said softly thank you oh no she whispered knowing that the gratitude was hers and that it was futile to express it she was thinking of the years when the works he had just played for her were being written here in his small cottage on a ledge of the valley when all this prodigal magnificence of sound was being shaped by him as a flowing monument to a concept which equates the sense of life with the sense of beautywhile she had walked through the streets of new york in a hopeless quest for some form of enjoyment with the screeches of a modern symphony running after her as if spit by the infected throat of a loudspeaker coughing its malicious hatred of existence but i mean it said richard halley smiling im a businessman and i never do anything without payment youve paid me do you see why i wanted to play for you tonight she raised her head he stood in the middle of his living room they were alone with the window open to the summer night to the dark trees on a long sweep of ledges descending toward the glitter of the valleys distant lights miss taggart how many people are there to whom my work means as much as it does to you not many she answered simply neither as boast nor flattery but as an impersonal tribute to the exacting values involved that is the payment i demand not many can afford it i dont mean your enjoyment i dont mean your emotionemotions be damnedi mean your understanding and the fact that your enjoyment was of the same nature as mine that it came from the same source from your intelligence from the conscious judgment of a mind able to judge my work by the standard of the same values that went to write iti mean not the fact that you felt but that you felt what i wished you to feel not the fact that you admire my work but that you admire it for the things i wished to be admired he chuckled theres only one passion in most artists more violent than their desire for admiration their fear of identifying the nature of such admiration as they do receive but its a fear ive never shared i do not fool myself about my work or the response i seeki value both too highly i do not care to be admired causelessly emotionally intuitively instinctivelyor blindly i do not care for blindness in any form i have too much to showor for deafness i have too much to say i do not care to be admired by anyones heartonly by someones head and when i find a customer with that invaluable capacity then my performance is a mutual trade to mutual profit an artist is a trader miss taggart the hardest and most exacting of all traders now do you understand me yes she said incredulously i do incredulously because she was hearing her own symbol of moral pride chosen by a man she had least expected to choose it if you do why did you look quite so tragic just a moment ago what is it that you regret the years when your work has remained unheard but it hasnt ive given two or three concerts every year here in galts gulch i am giving one next week i hope youll come the price of admission is twentyfive cents she could not help laughing he smiled then his face slipped slowly into earnestness as under the tide of some unspoken contemplation of his own he looked at the darkness beyond the window at a spot where in a clearing of the branches with the moonlight draining its color leaving only its metallic luster the sign of the dollar hung like a curve of shining steel engraved on the sky miss taggart do you see why id give three dozen modern artists for one real businessman why i have much more in common with ellis wyatt or ken danaggerwho happens to be tone deafthan with men like mort liddy and balph eubank whether its a symphony or a coal mine all work is an act of creating and comes from the same source from an inviolate capacity to see through ones own eyeswhich means the capacity to perform a rational identification which means the capacity to sew to connect and to make what had not been seen connected and made before that shining vision which they talk about as belonging to the authors of symphonies and novelswhat do they think is the driving faculty of men who discover how to use oil how to run a mine how to build an electric motor that sacred fire which is said to burn within musicians and poetswhat do they suppose moves an industrialist to defy the whole world for the sake of his new metal as the inventors of the airplane the builders of the railroads the discoverers of new germs or new continents have done through all the ages an intransigent devotion to the pursuit of truth miss taggart have you heard the moralists and the art lovers of the centuries talk about the artists intransigent devotion to the pursuit of truth name me a greater example of such devotion than the act of a man who says that the earth does turn or the act of a man who says that an alloy of steel and copper has certain properties which enable it to do certain things that it is and doesand let the world rack him or ruin him he will not bear false witness to the evidence of his mind this miss taggart this sort of spirit courage and love for truthas against a sloppy bum who goes around proudly assuring you that he has almost reached the perfection of a lunatic because hes an artist who hasnt the faintest idea what his art work is or means hes not restrained by such crude concepts as being or meaning hes the vehicle of higher mysteries he doesnt know how he created his work or why it just came out of him spontaneously like vomit out of a drunkard he did not think he wouldnt stoop to thinking he just felt it all he has to do is feelhe feels the flabby loosemouthed shiftyeyed drooling shivering uncongealed bastard i who know what discipline what effort what tension of mind what unrelenting strain upon ones power of clarity are needed to produce a work of arti who know that it requires a labor which makes a chain gang look like rest and a severity no army drilling sadist could imposeill take the operator of a coal mine over any walking vehicle of higher mysteries the operator knows that its not his feelings that keep the coal carts moving under the earthand he knows what does keep them moving feelings oh yes we do feel he you and iwe are in fact the only people capable of feelingand we know where our feelings come from but what we did not know and have delayed learning for too long is the nature of those who claim that they cannot account for their feelings we did not know what it is that they feel we are learning it now it was a costly error and those most guilty of it will pay the hardest priceas in justice they must those most guilty of it were the real artists who will now see that they are first to be exterminated and that they had prepared the triumph of their own exterminators by helping to destroy their only protectors for if there is more tragic a fool than the businessman who doesnt know that hes an exponent of mans highest creative spiritits the artist who thinks that the businessman is his enemy it was trueshe thought when she walked through the streets of the valley looking with a childs excitement at the shop windows sparkling in the sunthat the businesses here had the purposeful selectiveness of artand that the artshe thought when she sat in the darkness of a clapboard concert hall listening to the controlled violence and the mathematical precision of halleys musichad the stern discipline of business both had the radiance of engineeringshe thought when she sat among rows of benches under the open sky watching kay ludlow on the stage it was an experience she had not known since childhood the experience of being held for three hours by a play that told a story she had not seen before in lines she had not heard uttering a theme that had not been picked from the handmedowns of the centuries it was the forgotten delight of being held in rapt attention by the reins of the ingenious the unexpected the logical the purposeful the newand of seeing it embodied in a performance of superlative artistry by a woman playing a character whose beauty of spirit matched her own physical perfection thats why im here miss taggart said kay ludlow smiling in answer to her comment after the performance whatever quality of human greatness i have the talent to portraythat was the quality the outer world sought to degrade they let me play nothing but symbols of depravity nothing but harlots dissipationchasers and homewreckers always to be beaten at the end by the little girl next door personifying the virtue of mediocrity they used my talentfor the defamation of itself that was why i quit not since childhood thought dagny had she felt that sense of exhilaration after witnessing the performance of a playthe sense that life held things worth reaching not the sense of having studied some aspect of a sewer there had been no reason to see as the audience filed away into the darkness from the lighted rows of benches she noticed ellis wyatt judge narragansett ken danagger men who had once been said to despise all forms of art the last image she caught that evening was the sight of two tall straight slender figures walking away together down a trail among the rocks with the beam of a spotlight flashing once on the gold of their hair they were kay ludlow and ragnar danneskjoldand she wondered whether she could bear to return to a world where these were the two doomed to destruction the recaptured sense of her own childhood kept coming back to her whenever she met the two sons of the young woman who owned the bakery shop she often saw them wandering down the trails of the valleytwo fearless beings aged seven and four they seemed to face life as she had faced it they did not have the look she had seen in the children of the outer worlda look of fear halfsecretive half sneering the look of a childs defense against an adult the look of a being in the process of discovering that he is hearing lies and of learning to feel hatred the two boys had the open joyous friendly confidence of kittens who do not expect to get hurt they had an innocently natural nonboastful sense of their own value and as innocent a trust in any strangers ability to recognize it they had the eager curiosity that would venture anywhere with the certainty that life held nothing unworthy of or closed to discovery and they looked as if should they encounter malevolence they would reject it contemptuously not as dangerous but as stupid they would not accept it in bruised resignation as the law of existence they represent my particular career miss taggart said the young mother in answer to her comment wrapping a loaf of fresh bread and smiling at her across the counter theyre the profession ive chosen to practice which in spite of all the guff about motherhood one cant practice successfully in the outer world i believe youve met my husband hes the teacher of economics who works as linesman for dick mcnamara you know of course that there can be no collective commitments in this valley and that families or relatives are not allowed to come here unless each person takes the strikers oath by his own independent conviction i came here not merely for the sake of my husbands profession but for the sake of my own i came here in order to bring up my sons as human beings i would not surrender them to the educational systems devised to stunt a childs brain to convince him that reason is impotent that existence is an irrational chaos with which hes unable to deal and thus reduce him to a state of chronic terror you marvel at the difference between my children and those outside miss taggart yet the cause is so simple the cause is that here in galts gulch theres no person who would not consider it monstrous ever to confront a child with the slightest suggestion of the irrational she thought of the teachers whom the schools of the world had lost when she looked at the three pupils of dr akston on the evening of their yearly reunion the only other guest he had invited was kay ludlow the six of them sat in the back yard of his house with the light of the sunset on their faces and the floor of the valley condensing into a soft blue vapor far below she looked at his pupils at the three pliant agile figures half stretched on canvas chairs in poses of relaxed contentment dressed in slacks windbreakers and opencollared shirts john galt francisco danconia ragnar danneskjold dont be astonished miss taggart said dr akston smiling and dont make the mistake of thinking that these three pupils of mine are some sort of superhuman creatures theyre something much greater and more astounding than that theyre normal mena thing the world has never seenand their feat is that they managed to survive as such it does take an exceptional mind and a still more exceptional integrity to remain untouched by the braindestroying influences of the worlds doctrines the accumulated evil of centuriesto remain human since the human is the rational she felt some new quality in dr akstons attitude some change in the sternness of his usual reserve he seemed to include her in their circle as if she were more than a guest francisco acted as if her presence at their reunion were natural and to be taken gaily for granted galts face gave no hint of any reaction his manner was that of a courteous escort who had brought her here at dr akstons request she noticed that dr akstons eyes kept coming back to her as if with the quiet pride of displaying his students to an appreciative observer his conversation kept returning to a single theme in the manner of a father who has found a listener interested in his most cherished subject you should have seen them when they were in college miss taggart you couldnt have found three boys conditioned to such different backgrounds butconditioners be damnedthey must have picked one another at first sight among the thousands on that campus francisco the richest hen in the worldragnar the european aristocratand john the selfmade man selfmade in every sense out of nowhere penniless parentless tieless actually he was the son of a gasstation mechanic at some forsaken crossroads in ohio and he had left home at the age of twelve to make his own waybut ive always thought of him as if he had come into the world like minerva the goddess of wisdom who sprang forth from jupiters head fully grown and fully armed i remember the day when i saw the three of them for the first time they were sitting at the back of the classroomi was giving a special course for postgraduate students so difficult a course that few outsiders ever ventured to attend these particular lectures those three looked too young even for freshmenthey were sixteen at the time as i learned later at the end of that lecture john got up to ask me a question it was a question which as a teacher i would have been proud to hear from a student whod taken six years of philosophy it was a question pertaining to platos metaphysics which plato hadnt had the sense to ask of himself i answeredand i asked john to come to my office after the lecture he cameall three of them camei saw the two others in my anteroom and let them in i talked to them for an hourthen i cancelled all my appointments and talked to them for the rest of the day after which i arranged to let them take that course and receive their credits for it they took the course they got the highest grades in the class they were majoring in two subjects physics and philosophy their choice amazed everybody but me modern thinkers considered it unnecessary to perceive reality and modern physicists considered it unnecessary to think i knew better what amazed me was that these children knew it too robert stadler was head of the department of physics as i was head of the department of philosophy he and i suspended all rules and restrictions for these three students we spared them all the routine unessential courses we loaded them with nothing but the hardest tasks and we cleared their way to major in our two subjects within their four years they worked for it and during those four years they worked for their living besides francisco and ragnar were receiving allowances from their parents john had nothing but all three of them held parttime jobs to earn their own experience and money francisco worked in a copper foundry john worked in a railroad roundhouse and ragnarno miss taggart ragnar was not the least but the most studiously sedate of the threehe worked as clerk in the university library they had time for everything they wanted but no time for people or for any communal campus activities they ragnar he interrupted himself suddenly sharply dont sit on the ground danneskjold had slipped down and was now sitting on the grass with his head leaning against kay ludlows knees he rose obediently chuckling dr akston smiled with a touch of apology its an old habit of mine he explained to dagny a conditioned reflex i guess i used to tell him that in those college years when id catch him sitting on the ground in my back yard on cold foggy eveningshe was reckless that way he made me worry he should have known it was dangerous and he stopped abruptly he read in dagnys startled eyes the same thought as his own the thought of the kind of dangers the adult ragnar had chosen to face dr akston shrugged spreading his hands in a gesture of helpless selfmockery kay ludlow smiled at him in understanding my house stood just outside the campus he continued sighing on a tall bluff over lake erie we spent many evenings together the four of us we would sit just like this in my back yard on the nights of early fall or in the spring only instead of this granite mountainside we had the spread of the lake before us stretching off into a peacefully unlimited distance i had to work harder on those nights than in any classroom answering all the questions theyd ask me discussing the kind of issues theyd raise about midnight i would fix some hot chocolate and force them to drink itthe one thing i suspected was that they never took time to eat properlyand then wed go on talking while the lake vanished into solid darkness and the sky seemed lighter than the earth there were a few tunes when we stayed there till i noticed suddenly that the sky was turning darker and the lake was growing pale and we were within a few sentences of daylight i should have known better i knew that they werent getting enough sleep as it was but i forgot it occasionally i lost my sense of timeyou see when they were there i always felt as ft it were early morning and a long inexhaustible day were stretching ahead before us they never spoke of what they wished they might do in the future they never wondered whether some mysterious omnipotence had favored them with some unknowable talent to achieve the things they wantedthey spoke of what they would do does affection tend to make one a coward i know that the only times i felt fear were occasional moments when i listened to them and thought of what the world was becoming and what they would have to encounter in the future fear yesbut it was more than fear it was the kind of emotion that makes men capable of killingwhen i thought that the purpose of the worlds trend was to destroy these children that these three sons of mine were marked for immolation oh yes i would have killedbut whom was there to kill it was everyone and no one there was no single enemy no center and no villain it was not the simpering social worker incapable of earning a penny or the thieving bureaucrat scared of his own shadow it was the whole of the earth rolling into an obscenity of horror pushed by the hand of every wouldbe decent man who believed that need is holier than ability and pity is holier than justice but these were only occasional moments it was not my constant feeling i listened to my children and i knew that nothing would defeat them i looked at them as they sat in my back yard and beyond my house there were the tall dark buildings of what was still a monument to unenslaved thoughtthe patrick henry universityand farther in the distance there were the lights of cleveland the orange glow of steel mills behind batteries of smokestacks the twinkling red dots of radio towers the long white rays of airports on the black edge of the skyand i thought that in the name of any greatness that had ever existed and moved this world the greatness of which they were the last descendants they would win i remember one night when i noticed that john had been silent for a long time and i saw that he had fallen asleep stretched there on the ground the two others confessed that he had not slept for three days i sent the two of them home at once but i didnt have the heart to disturb him it was a warm spring night i brought a blanket to cover him and i let him sleep where he was i sat there beside him till morningand as i watched his face in the starlight then the first ray of the sun on his untroubled forehead and closed eyelids what i experienced was not a prayer i do not pray but that state of spirit at which a prayer is a misguided attempt a full confident affirming selfdedication to my love of the right to the certainty that the right would win and that this boy would have the kind of future he deserved he moved his arm pointing to the valley i did not expect it to be as great as thisor as hard it had grown dark and the mountains had blended with the sky hanging detached in space there were the lights of the valley below them the red breath of stocktons foundry above and the lighted string of windows of mulligans house like a railroad car imbedded in the sky i did have a rival said dr akston slowly it was robert stadler dont frown johnits past john did love him once well so did ino not quite but what one felt for a mind like stadlers was painfully close to love it was that rarest of pleasures admiration no i did not love him but he and i had always felt as if we were fellow survivors from some vanishing age or land in the gibbering swamp of mediocrity around us the mortal sin of robert stadler was that he never identified his proper homeland he hated stupidity it was the only emotion i had ever seen him display toward peoplea biting bitter weary hatred for any ineptitude that dared to oppose him he wanted his own way he wanted to be left alone to pursue it he wanted to brush people out of his pathand he never identified the means to it or the nature of his path and of his enemies he took a short cut are you smiling miss taggart you hate him dont you yes you know the kind of short cut he took he told you that we were rivals for these three students that was trueor rather that was not the way i thought of it but i knew that he did well if we were rivals i had one advantage i knew why they needed both our professions he never understood their interest in mine he never understood its importance to himselfwhich incidentally is what destroyed him but in those years he was still alive enough to grasp at these three students grasp was the word for it intelligence being the only value he worshipped he clutched them as if they were a private treasure of his own he had always been a very lonely man i think that in the whole of his life francisco and ragnar were his only love and john was his only passion it was john whom he regarded as his particular heir as his future as his own immortality john intended to be an inventor which meant that he was to be a physicist he was to take his postgraduate course under robert stadler francisco intended to leave after graduation and go to work he was to be the perfect blend of both of us his two intellectual fathers an industrialist and ragnaryou didnt know what profession ragnar had chosen miss taggart no it wasnt stunt pilot or jungle explorer or deepsea diver it was something much more courageous than these ragnar intended to be a philosopher an abstract theoretical academic cloistered ivorytower philosopher yes robert stadler loved them and yeti have said that i would have killed to protect them only there was no one to kill if that were the solutionwhich of course it isntthe man to kill was robert stadler of any one person of any single guilt for the evil which is now destroying the worldhis was the heaviest guilt he had the mind to know better his was the only name of honor and achievement used to sanction the rule of the looters he was the man who delivered science into the power of the looters guns john did not expect it neither did i john came back for his postgraduate course in physics but he did not finish it he left on the day when robert stadler endorsed the establishment of a state science institute i met stadler by chance in a corridor of the university as he came out of his office after his last conversation with john he looked changed i hope that i shall never have to see again a change of that kind in a mans face he saw me approachingand he did not know but i knew what made him whirl upon me and cry tin so sick of all of you impractical idealists i turned away i knew that i had heard a man pronounce a death sentence upon himself miss taggart do you remember the question you asked me about my three pupils yes she whispered i could gather from your question the nature of what robert stadler had said to you about them tell me why did he speak of them at all he saw the faint movement of her bitter smile he told me their story as a justification for his belief in the futility of human intelligence he told it to me as an example of his disillusioned hope theirs was the kind of ability he said one expects to see in the future changing the course of the world well havent they done so she nodded slowly holding her head inclined for a long moment hi acquiescence and in homage what i want you to understand miss taggart is the full evil of those who claim to have become convinced that this earth by its nature is a realm of malevolence where the good has no chance to win let them check their premises let them check their standards of value let them checkbefore they grant themselves the unspeakable license of evilasnecessitywhether they know what is the good and what are the conditions it requires robert stadler now believes that intelligence is futile and that human life can be nothing but irrational did he expect john galt to become a great scientist willing to work under the orders of dr floyd ferris did he expect francisco danconia to become a great industrialist willing to produce under the orders and for the benefit of wesley mouch did he expect ragnar danneskjold to become a great philosopher willing to preach under the orders of dr simon pritchett that there is no mind and that might is right would that have been a future which robert stadler would have considered rational i want you to observe miss taggart that those who cry the loudest about their disillusionment about the failure of virtue the futility of reason the impotence of logicare those who have achieved the full exact logical result of the ideas they preached so mercilessly logical that they dare not identify it in a world that proclaims the nonexistence of the mind the moral righteousness of rule by brute force the penalizing of the competent in favor of the incompetent the sacrifice of the best to the worst in such a world the best have to turn against society and have to become its deadliest enemies in such a world john galt the man of incalculable intellectual power will remain an unskilled laborerfrancisco danconia the miraculous producer of wealth will become a wastreland ragnar danneskjold the man of enlightenment will become the man of violence societyand dr robert stadlerhave achieved everything they advocated what complaint do they now have to make that the universe is irrational is it he smiled his smile had the pitiless gentleness of certainty every man builds his world in his own image he said he has the power to choose but no power to escape the necessity of choice if he abdicates his power he abdicates the status of man and the grinding chaos of the irrational is what he achieves as his sphere of existenceby his own choice whoever preserves a single thought uncorrupted by any concession to the will of others whoever brings into reality a matchstick or a patch of garden made in the image of his thoughthe and to that extent is a man and that extent is the sole measure of his virtue theyhe pointed at his pupilsmade no concessions thishe pointed at the valleyis the measure of what they preserved and of what they are now i can repeat my answer to the question you asked me knowing that you will understand it fully you asked me whether i was proud of the way my three sons had turned out i am more proud than i had ever hoped to be i am proud of their every action of their every goaland of every value theyve chosen and this dagny is my full answer the sudden sound of her first name was pronounced in the tone of a father he spoke his last two sentences looking not at her but at galt she saw galt answering him by an open glance held steady for an instant like a signal of affirmation then galts eyes moved to hers she saw him looking at her as if she bore the unspoken title that hung in the silence between them the title dr akston had granted her but had not pronounced and none of the others had caughtshe saw in galts eyes a glance of amusement at her shock of support and incredibly of tenderness danconia copper no i was a small cut on the face of the mountain that looked as if a knife had made a few angular slashes leaving shelves of rock red as a wound on the reddishbrown flank the sun beat down upon it dagny stood at the edge of a path holding on to galts arm on one side and to franciscos on the other the wind blowing against their faces and out over the valley two thousand feet below thisshe thought looking at the minewas the story of human wealth written across the mountains a few pine trees hung over the cut contorted by the storms that had raged through the wilderness for centuries six men worked on the shelves and an inordinate amount of complex machinery traced delicate lines against the sky the machinery did most of the work she noticed that francisco was displaying his domain to galt as much as to her as much or more you havent seen it since last year john john wait till you see it a year from now ill be through outside in just a few monthsand then this will be my fulltime job hell no john he said laughing in answer to a questionbut she caught suddenly the particular quality of his glance whenever it rested on galt it was the quality she had seen in his eyes when he had stood in her room clutching the edge of a table to outlive an unlivable moment he had looked as if he were seeing someone before him it was galt she thought it was galts image that had carried him through some part of her felt a dim dread the effort which francisco had made in that moment to accept her loss and his rival as the payment demanded of him for his battle had cost him so much that he was now unable to suspect the truth dr akston had guessed what will it do to him when he learnsshe wondered and felt a bitter voice reminding her that there would perhaps never be any truth of this kind to learn some part of her felt a dim tension as she watched the way galt looked at francisco it was an open simple unreserved glance of surrender to an unreserved feeling she felt the anxious wonder she had never fully named or dismissed wonder whether this feeling would bring him down to the ugliness of renunciation but most of her mind seemed swept by some enormous sense of release as if she were laughing at all doubts her glance kept going back over the path they had traveled to get here over the two exhausting miles of a twisted trail that ran like a precarious corkscrew from the tip of her feet down to the floor of the valley her eyes kept studying it her mind racing with some purpose of its own brush pines and a clinging carpet of moss went climbing from the green slopes far below up the granite ledges the moss and the brush vanished gradually but the pines went on struggling upward in thinning strands till only a few dots of single trees were left rising up the naked rock toward the white sunbursts of snow in the crevices at the peaks she looked at the spectacle of the most ingenious mining machinery she had ever seen then at the trail where the plodding hoofs and swaying shapes of mules provided the most ancient form of transportation francisco she asked pointing who designed the machines theyre just adaptations of standard equipment who designed them i did we dont have many men to spare we had to make up for it youre wasting an unconscionable amount of manpower and time carting your ore on muleback you ought to build a railroad down to the valley she was looking down and did not notice the sudden eager shot of his glance to her face or the sound of caution in his voice i know it but its such a difficult job that the mines output wont justify it at present nonsense its much simpler than it looks theres a pass to the east where theres an easier grade and softer stone i watched it on the way up it wouldnt take so many curves three miles of rail or less would do it she was pointing east she did not notice the intensity with which the two men were watching her face just a narrowgauge track is all youll need like the first railroads thats where the first railroads startedat mines only they were coal mines look do you see that ridge theres plenty of clearance for a threefoot gauge you wouldnt need to do any blasting or widening do you see where theres a slow rise for a stretch of almost half a mile that would be no worse than a four per cent grade any engine could manage it she was speaking with a swift bright certainty conscious of nothing but the joy of performing her natural function in her natural world where nothing could take precedence over the act of offering a solution to a problem the road will pay for itself within three years i think at a rough glance that the costliest part of the job will be a couple of steel trestlesand theres one spot where i might have to blast a tunnel but its only for a hundred feet or less ill need a steel trestle to throw the track across that gorge and bring it here but its not as hard as it lookslet me show you have you got a piece of paper she did not notice with what speed galt produced a notebook and a pencil and thrust them into her handsshe seized them as if she expected them to be there as if she were giving orders on a construction site where details of this kind were not to delay her let me give you a rough idea of what i mean if we drive diagonal piles into the rockshe was sketching rapidlythe actual steel span would be only six hundred feet longit would cut off this last half mile of your corkscrew turnsi could have the rail laid in three months and she stopped when she looked up at their faces the fire had gone out of hers she crumpled her sketch and flung it aside into the red dust of the gravel oh what for she cried the despair breaking out for the first time to build three miles of railroad and abandon a transcontinental system the two men were looking at her she saw no reproach in their faces only a look of understanding which was almost compassion im sorry she said quietly dropping her eyes if you change your mind said francisco ill hire you on the spotor midas will give you a loan in five minutes to finance that railroad if you want to own it yourself she shook her head i cant she whispered not yet she raised her eyes knowing that they knew the nature of her despair and that it was useless to hide her struggle ive tried it once she said ive tried to give it up i know what it will mean ill think of it with every crosstie ill see laid here with every spike driven ill think of that other tunnel and and of nat taggarts bridge oh if only i didnt have to hear about it if only i could stay here and never know what theyre doing to the railroad and never learn when it goes youll have to hear about it said galt it was that ruthless tone peculiarly his which sounded implacable by being simple devoid of any emotional value save the quality of respect for facts youll hear the whole course of the last agony of taggart transcontinental youll hear about every wreck youll hear about every discontinued train youll hear about every abandoned line youll hear about the collapse of the taggart bridge nobody stays in this valley except by a full conscious choice based on a full conscious knowledge of every fact involved in his decision nobody stays here by faking reality in any manner whatever she looked at him her head lifted knowing what chance he was rejecting she thought that no man of the outer world would have said this to her at this momentshe thought of the worlds code that worshipped white lies as an act of mercyshe felt a stab of revulsion against that code suddenly seeing its full ugliness for the first timeshe felt an enormous pride for the tight clean face of the man before herhe saw the shape of her mouth drawn firm in selfcontrol yet softened by some tremulous emotion while she answered quietly thank you youre right you dont have to answer me now he said youll tell me when youve decided theres still a week left yes she said calmly just one more week he turned picked up her crumpled sketch folded it neatly and slipped it into his pocket dagny said francisco when you weigh your decision consider the first time you quit if you wish but consider everything about it in this valley you wont have to torture yourself by shingling roofs and building paths that lead nowhere tell me she asked suddenly how did you find out where i was that time he smiled it was john who told me the destroyer remember you wondered why the destroyer had not sent anyone after you but he had it was he who sent me there he sent you yes what did he say to you nothing much why what did he say do you remember the exact words yes i do remember he said if you want your chance take it youve earned it i remember because he turned to galt with the untroubled frown of a slight casual puzzle john i never quite understood why you said it why that whymy chance do you mind if i dont answer you now no but someone hailed him from the ledges of the mine and he went off swiftly as if the subject required no further attention she was conscious of the long span of moments she took while turning her head to galt she knew that she would find him looking at her she could read nothing in his eyes except a hint of derision as if he knew what answer she was seeking and that she would not find it in his face you gave him a chance that you wanted i could have no chance till hed had every chance possible to him how did you know what he had earned i had been questioning him about you for ten years every time i could in every way from every angle no he did not tell meit was the way he spoke of you that did he didnt want to speak but he spoke too eagerly eagerly and reluctantly togetherand then i knew that it had not been just a childhood friendship i knew how much he had given up for the strike and how desperately he hadnt given it up forever i i was merely questioning him about one of our most important future strikersas i questioned him about many others the hint of derision remained in his eyes he knew that she had wanted to hear this but that this was not the answer to the one question she feared she looked from his face to franciscos approaching figure not hiding from herself any longer that her sudden heavy desolate anxiety was the fear that galt might throw the three of them into the hopeless waste of selfsacrifice francisco approached looking at her thoughtfully as if weighing some question of his own but some question that gave a sparkle of reckless gaiety to his eyes dagny theres only one week left he said if you decide to go back it will be the last for a long time there was no reproach and no sadness in his voice only some softened quality as sole evidence of emotion if you leave nowoh yes youll still come back but it wont be soon and iin a few months ill come to live here permanently so if you go i wont see you again perhaps for years id like you to spend this last week with me id like you to move to my house as my guest nothing else for no reason except that id like you to he said it simply as if nothing were or could be hidden among the three of them she saw no sign of astonishment in galts face she felt some swift tightening in her chest something hard reckless and almost vicious that had the quality of a dark excitement driving her blindly into action but im an employee she said with an odd smile looking at galt i have a job to finish i wont hold you to it said galt and she felt anger at the tone of his voice a tone that granted her no hidden significance and answered nothing but the literal meaning of her words you can quit the job any time you wish its up to you no it isnt im a prisoner here dont you remember im to take orders i have no preferences to follow no wishes to express no decisions to make i want the decision to be yours you want it to be mine yes youve expressed a wish the mockery of his voice was in its seriousnessand she threw at him defiantly not smiling as if daring him to continue pretending that he did not understand all right thats what i wish he smiled as at a childs complex scheming which he had long since seen through very well but he did not smile as he said turning to francisco thenno the defiance toward an adversary who was the sternest of teachers was all that francisco had read in her face he shrugged regretfully but gaily youre probably right if you cant prevent her from going backnobody can she was not hearing franciscos words she was stunned by the magnitude of the relief that hit her at the sound of galts answer a relief that told her the magnitude of the fear it swept away she knew only after it was over what had hung for her on his decision she knew that had his answer been different it would have destroyed the valley in her eyes she wanted to laugh she wanted to embrace them both and laugh with them in celebration it did not seem to matter whether she would stay here or return to the world a week was like an endless span of time either course seemed flooded by an unchanging sunlightand no struggle was hard she thought if this was the nature of existence the relief did not come from the knowledge that he would not renounce her nor from arty assurance that she would winthe relief came from the certainty that he would always remain what he was i dont know whether ill go back to the world or not she said soberly but her voice was trembling with a subdued violence which was pure gaiety im sorry that im still unable to make a decision im certain of only one thing that i wont be afraid to decide francisco took the sudden brightness of her face as proof that the incident had been of no significance but galt understood he glanced at her and the glance was part amusement part contemptuous reproach he said nothing until they were alone walking down the trail to the valley then he glanced at her again the amusement sharper in his eyes and said you had to put me to a test in order to learn whether id fall to the lowest possible stage of altruism she did not answer but looked at him in open undefensive admission he chuckled and looked away and a few steps later said slowly in the tone of a quotation nobody stays here by faking reality in any manner whatever part of the intensity of her reliefshe thought as she walked silently by his sidewas the shock of a contrast she had seen with the sudden immediate vividness of sensory perception an exact picture of what the code of selfsacrifice would have meant if enacted by the three of them galt giving up the woman he wanted for the sake of his friend faking his greatest feeling out of existence and himself out of her life no matter what the cost to him and to her then dragging the rest of his years through the waste of the unreached and unfulfilled she turning for consolation to a second choice faking a love she did not feel being willing to fake since her will to selfdeceit was the essential required for galts selfsacrifice then living out her years in hopeless longing accepting as relief for an unhealing wound some moments of weary affection plus the tenet that love is futile and happiness is not to be found on earthfrancisco struggling in the elusive fog of a counterfeit reality his life a fraud staged by the two who were dearest to him and most trusted struggling to grasp what was missing from his happiness struggling down the brittle scaffold of a lie over the abyss of the discovery that he was not the man she loved but only a resented substitute halfcharitypatient halfcrutch his perceptiveness becoming his danger and only his surrender to lethargic stupidity protecting the shoddy structure of his joy struggling and giving up and settling into the dreary routine of the conviction that fulfillment is impossible to manthe three of them who had had all the gifts of existence spread out before them ending up as embittered hulks who cry in despair that life is frustrationthe frustration of not being able to make unreality real but thisshe thoughtwas mens moral code in the outer world a code that told them to act on the premise of one anothers weakness deceit and stupidity and this was the pattern of their lives this struggle through a fog of the pretended and unacknowledged this belief that facts are not solid or final this state where denying any form to reality men stumble through life unreal and unformed and die having never been born hereshe thought looking down through green branches at the glittering roofs of the valleyone dealt with men as clear and firm as sun and rocks and the immense lightheartedness of her relief came from the knowledge that no battle was hard no decision was dangerous where there was no soggy uncertainty no shapeless evasion to encounter did it ever occur to you miss taggart said galt in the casual tone of an abstract discussion but as if he had known her thoughts that there is no conflict of interests among men neither in business nor in trade nor in their most personal desiresif they omit the irrational from their view of the possible and destruction from their view of the practical there is no conflict and no call for sacrifice and no man is a threat to the aims of anotherif men understand that reality is an absolute not to be faked that lies do not work that the unearned cannot be had that the undeserved cannot be given that the destruction of a value which is will not bring value to that which isnt the businessman who wishes to gain a market by throttling a superior competitor the worker who wants a share of his employers wealth the artist who envies a rivals higher talenttheyre all wishing facts out of existence and destruction is the only means of their wish if they pursue it they will not achieve a market a fortune or an immortal famethey will merely destroy production employment and art a wish for the irrational is not to be achieved whether the sacrificial victims are willing or not but men will not cease to desire the impossible and will not lose their longing to destroyso long as selfdestruction and selfsacrifice are preached to them as the practical means of achieving the happiness of the recipients he glanced at her and added slowly a slight emphasis as sole change in the impersonal tone of his voice no ones happiness but my own is in my power to achieve or to destroy you should have had more respect for him and for me than to fear what you had feared she did not answer she felt as if a word would overfill the fullness of this moment she merely turned to him with a look of acquiescence that was disarmed childishly humble and would have been an apology but for its shining joy he smiledin amusement in understanding almost in comradeship of the things they shared and in sanction of the things she felt they went on in silence and it seemed to her that this was a summer day out of a carefree youth she had never lived it was just a walk through the country by two people who were free for the pleasure of motion and sunlight with no unsolved burdens left to carry her sense of lightness blended with the weightless sense of walking downhill as if she needed no effort to walk only to restrain herself from flying and she walked fighting the speed of the downward pull her body leaning back the wind blowing her skirt like a sail to brake her motion they parted at the bottom of the trail he went to keep an appointment with midas mulligan while she went to hammonds market with a list of items for the evenings dinner as the sole concern of her world his wifeshe thought letting herself hear consciously the word dr akston had not pronounced the word she had long since felt but never namedfor three weeks she had been his wife in every sense but one and that final one was still to be earned but this much was real and today she could permit herself to know it to feel it to live with that one thought for this one day the groceries which lawrence hammond was lining up at her order on the polished counter of his store had never appeared to her as such shining objectsand intent upon them she was only halfconscious of some disturbing element of something that was wrong but that her mind was too full to notice she noticed it only when she saw hammond pause frown and stare upward at the sky beyond his open store front in time with his words i think somebodys trying to repeat your stunt miss taggart she realized that it was the sound of an airplane overhead and that it had been there for some time a sound which was not to be heard in the valley after the first of this month they rushed out to the street the small silver cross of a plane was circling above the ring of mountains like a sparkling dragonfly about to brush the peaks with its wings what does he think hes doing said lawrence hammond there were people at the doors of the shops and standing still all down the street looking up is is anyone expected she asked and was astonished by the anxiety of her own voice no said hammond everyone whos got any business here is here he did not sound disturbed but grimly curious the plane was now a small dash like a silver cigarette streaking against the flanks of the mountains it had dropped lower looks like a private monoplane said hammond squinting against the sun not an army model will the ray screen hold out she asked tensely in a tone of defensive resentment against the approach of an enemy he chuckled hold out will he see us that screen is safer than an underground vault miss taggart as you ought to know the plane rose and for a moment it was only a bright speck like a bit of paper blown by the windit hovered uncertainly then dropped down again into another circling spiral what in hell is he after said hammond her eyes shot suddenly to his face hes looking for something said hammond what is there a telescope somewhere whyyes at the airfield but he was about to ask what was the matter with her voicebut she was running across the road down the path to the airfield not knowing that she was running driven by a reason she had no time and no courage to name she found dwight sanders at the small telescope of the control tower he was watching the plane attentively with a puzzled frown let me see it she snapped she clutched the metal tube she pressed her eye to the lens her hand guiding the tube slowly to follow the planethen he saw that her hand had stopped but her fingers did not open and her face remained bent over the telescope pressed to the lens until he looked closer and saw that the lens was pressed to her forehead whats the matter miss taggart she raised her head slowly is it anyone you know miss taggart she did not answer she hurried away her steps rushing with the zigzagging aimlessness of uncertaintyshe dared not run but she had to escape she had to hide she did not know whether she was afraid to be seen by the men around her or by the plane abovethe plane whose silver wings bore the number that belonged to hank rearden she stopped when she stumbled over a rock and fell and noticed that she had been running she was on a small ledge in the cliffs above the airfield hidden from the sight of the town open to the view of the sky she rose her hands groping for support along a granite wall feeling the warmth of the sun on the rock under her palmsshe stood her back pressed to the wall unable to move or to take her eyes off the plane the plane was circling slowly dipping down then rising again strugglingshe thoughtas she had struggled to distinguish the sight of a wreck in a hopeless spread of crevices and boulders an elusive spread neither clear enough to abandon nor to survey he was searching for the wreck of her plane he had not given up and whatever the three weeks of it had cost him whatever he felt the only evidence he would give to the world and his only answer was this steady insistent monotonous drone of a motor carrying a fragile craft over every deadly foot of an inaccessible chain of mountains through the brilliant purity of the summer air the plane seemed intimately close she could see it rock on precarious currents and bank under the thrusts of wind she could see and it seemed impossible that so clear a sight was closed to his eyes the whole of the valley lay below him flooded by sunlight flaming with glass panes and green lawns screaming to be seenthe end of his tortured quest the fulfillment of more than his wishes not the wreck of her plane and her body but her living presence and his freedomall that he was seeking or had ever sought was now spread open before him open and waiting his to be reached by a straightline dive through the pure clear airhis and asking nothing of him but the capacity to see hank she screamed waving her arms in desperate signal hank she fell back against the rock knowing that she had no way to reach him that she had no power to give him sight that no power on earth could pierce that screen except his own mind and vision suddenly and for the first time she felt the screen not as the most intangible but as the most grimly absolute barrier in the world slumped against the rock she watched in silent resignation the hopeless circles of the planes struggle and its motors uncomplaining cry for help a cry she had no way to answer the plane swooped down abruptly but it was only the start of its final rise it cut a swift diagonal across the mountains and shot into the open sky then as if caught in the spread of a lake with no shores and no exit it went sinking slowly and drowning out of sight she thought in bitter compassion of how much he had failed to see and ishe thought if she left the valley the screen would close for her as tightly atlantis would descend under a vault of rays more impregnable than the bottom of the ocean and she too would be left to struggle for the things she had not known how to see she too would be left to fight a mirage of primordial savagery while the reality of all that she desired would never come again within her reach but the pull of the outer world the pull that drew her to follow the plane was not the image of hank reardenshe knew that she could not return to him even if she returned to the worldthe pull was the vision of hank reardens courage and the courage of all those still fighting to stay alive he would not give up the search for her plane when all others had long since despaired as he would not give up his mills as he would not give up any goal he had chosen if a single chance was left was she certain that no chance remained for the world of taggart transcontinental was she certain that the terms of the battle were such that she could not care to win they were right the men of atlantis they were right to vanish if they knew that they left no value behind thembut until and unless she saw that no chance was untaken and no battle unfought she had no right to remain among them this was the question that had lashed her for weeks but had not driven her to a glimpse of the answer she lay awake through the hours of that night quietly motionless followinglike an engineer and like hank reardena process of dispassionate precise almost mathematical consideration with no regard for cost or feeling the agony which he lived in his plane she lived it in a soundless cube of darkness searching but finding no answer she looked at the inscriptions on the walls of her room faintly visible in patches of starlight but the help those men had called in their darkest hour was not hers to call yes or no miss taggart she looked at the faces of the four men in the soft twilight of mulligans living room galt whose face had the serene impersonal attentiveness of a scientistfrancisco whose face was made expressionless by the hint of a smile the kind of smile that would fit either answerhugh akston who looked compassionately gentlemidas mulligan who had asked the question with no touch of rancor in his voice somewhere two thousand miles away at this sunset hour the page of a calendar was springing into light over the roofs of new york saying june and it seemed to her suddenly that she was seeing it as if it were hanging over the heads of these men i have one more day she said steadily will you let me have it i think ive reached my decision but i am not fully certain of it and ill need all the certainty possible to me of course said mulligan you have in fact until morning of the day after tomorrow well wait well wait after that as well said hugh akston though in your absence if that be necessary she stood by the window facing them and she felt a moments satisfaction in the knowledge that she stood straight that her hands did not tremble that her voice sounded as controlled uncomplaining and unpitying as theirs it gave her a moments feeling of a bond to them if any part of your uncertainty said galt is a conflict between your heart and your mindfollow your mind consider the reasons which make us certain that we are right said hugh akston but not the fact that we are certain if you are not convinced ignore our certainty dont be tempted to substitute our judgment for your own dont rely on our knowledge of whats best for your future said mulligan we do know but it cant be best until you know it dont consider our interests or desires said francisco you have no duty to anyone but yourself she smiled neither sadly nor gaily thinking that none of it was the sort of advice she would have been given in the outer world and knowing how desperately they wished to help her where no help was possible she felt it was her part to give them reassurance i forced my way here she said quietly and i was to bear responsibility for the consequences im bearing it her reward was to see galt smile the smile was like a military decoration bestowed upon her looking away she remembered suddenly jeff alien the tramp aboard the comet in the moment when she had admired him for attempting to tell her that he knew where he was going to spare her the burden of his aimlessness she smiled faintly thinking that she had now experienced it in both roles and knew that no action could be lower or more futile than for one person to throw upon another the burden of his abdication of choice she felt an odd calm almost a confident repose she knew that it was tension but the tension of a great clarity she caught herself thinking shes functioning well in an emergency ill be all right with herand realized that she was thinking of herself let it go till day after tomorrow miss taggart said midas mulligan tonight youre still here thank you she said she remained by the window while they went on discussing the valleys business it was their closing conference of the month they had just finished dinnerand she thought of her first dinner in this house a month ago she was wearing as she had then worn the gray suit that belonged in her office not the peasant skirt that had been so easy to wear hi the sun im still here tonight she thought her hand pressed possessively to the window sill the sun had not yet vanished beyond the mountains but the sky was an even deep deceptively clear blue that blended with the blue of invisible clouds into a single spread hiding the sun only the edges of the clouds were outlined by a thin thread of flame and it looked like a glowing twisted net of neon tubing she thought like a chart of winding rivers like like the map of a railroad traced in white fire on the sky she heard mulligan giving galt the names of those who were not returning to the outer world we have jobs for all of them said mulligan in fact theres only ten or twelve men whore going back this yearmostly to finish off convert whatever they own and come here permanently i think this was our last vacation month because before another year is over well all be living in this valley good said galt well have to from the way things are going outside yes francisco said mulligan youll come back in a few months in november at the latest said francisco ill send you word by short wave when im ready to come backwill you turn the furnace on in my house i will said hugh akston and ill have your supper ready for you when you arrive john i take it for granted said mulligan that youre not returning to new york this time galt took a moment to glance at him then answered evenly i have not decided it yet she noticed the shocked swiftness with which francisco and mulligan bent forward to stare at himand the slowness with which hugh akstons glance moved to his face akston did not seem to be astonished youre not thinking of going back to that hell for another year are you said mulligan i am butgood god johnwhat for ill tell you when ive decided but theres nothing left there for you to do we got everybody we knew of or can hope to know of our list is completed except for hank reardenand well get him before the year is overand miss taggart if she so chooses thats all your job is done theres nothing to look for out thereexcept the final crash when the roof comes down on their heads i know it john yours is the one head i dont want to be there when it happens youve never had to worry about me but dont you realize what stage theyre coming to theyre only one step away from open violencehell theyve taken the step and sealed and declared it long agobut in one more moment theyll see the full reality of what theyve taken exploding in their damned facesplain open blind arbitrary blood shedding violence running amuck hitting anything and anyone at random thats what i dont want to see you in the midst of i can take care of myself john theres no reason for you to take the risk said francisco what risk the looters are worried about the men whove disappeared theyre suspecting something you of all people shouldnt stay there any longer theres always a chance that they might discover just who and what you are theres some chance not much but theres no reason whatever to take it theres nothing left that ragnar and i cant finish hugh akston was watching them silently leaning back in his chair his face had that look of intensity neither quite bitterness nor quite a sos smile with which a man watches a progression that interests him but that lags a few steps behind his vision if i go back said galt it wont be for our work it will be to win the only thing i want from the world for myself now that the work is done ive taken nothing from the world and ive wanted nothing but theres one thing which its still holding and which is mine and which i wont let it have no i dont intend to break my oath i wont deal with the looters i wont be of any value or help to anyone out there neither to looters nor neutralsnor scabs if i go it wont be for anyones sake but mineand i dont think im risking my life but if i amwell im now free to risk it he was not looking at her but she had to turn away and stand pressed against the window frame because her hands were trembling but john cried mulligan waving his arm at the valley if anything happens to you what would we he stopped abruptly and guiltily galt chuckled what were you about to say mulligan waved his hand sheepishly in a gesture of dismissal were you about to say that if anything happens to me ill die as the worst failure in the world all right said mulligan guiltily i wont say it i wont say that we couldnt get along without youwe can i wont beg you to stay here for our sakei didnt think id ever revert to that rotten old plea but boy what a temptation it was i can almost see why people do it i know that whatever it is you want if you wish to risk your life thats all there is to itbut im thinking only that its oh god john its such a valuable life galt smiled i know it thats why i dont think im risking iti think ill win francisco was now silent he was watching galt intently with a frown of wonder not as if he had found an answer but as if he had suddenly glimpsed a question look john said mulligan since you havent decided whether youll goyou havent decided it yet have you no not yet since you havent would you let me remind you of a few things just for you to consider go ahead its the chance dangers that im afraid ofthe senseless unpredictable dangers of a world falling apart consider the physical risks of complex machinery in the hands of blind fools and fearcrazed cowards just think of their railroadsyoud be taking a chance on some such horror as that winston tunnel incident every time you stepped aboard a trainand there will be more incidents of that kind coming faster and faster theyll reach the stage where no day will pass without a major wreck i know it and the same will be happening in every other industry wherever machines are usedthe machines which they thought could replace our minds plane crashes oil tank explosions blastfurnace breakouts hightension wire electrocutions subway caveins and trestle collapses theyll see them all the very machines that had made their life so safe will now make it a continuous peril i know it i know that you know it but have you considered it in every specific detail have you allowed yourself to visualize it i want you to see the exact picture of what it is that you propose to enterbefore you decide whether anything can justify your entering it you know that the cities will be hit worst of all the cities were made by the railroads and will go with them thats right when the rails are cut the city of new york will starve in two days thats all the supply of food its got its fed by a continent three thousand miles long how will they carry food to new york by directive and oxcart but first before it happens theyll go through the whole of the agonythrough the shrinking the shortages the hunger riots the stampeding violence in the midst of the growing stillness they will theyll lose their airplanes first then their automobiles then their trucks then their horse carts they will their factories will stop then their furnaces and their radios then their electric light system will go it will theres only a worn thread holding that continent together there will be one train a day then one train a weekthen the taggart bridge will collapse and no it wont it was her voice and they whirled to her her face was white but calmer than it had been when she had answered them last slowly galt rose to his feet and inclined his head as in acceptance of a verdict youve made your decision he said i have dagny said hugh akston im sorry he spoke softly with effort as if his words were struggling and failing to fill the silence of the room i wish it were possible not to see this happen i would have preferred anythingexcept to see you stay here by default of the courage of your convictions she spread her hands palms out her arms at her sides in a gesture of simple frankness and said addressing them all her manner so calm that she could afford to show emotion i want you to know this i have wished it were possible for me to die in one more month so that i could spend it in this valley this is how much ive wanted to remain but so long as i choose to go on living i cant desert a battle which i think is mine to fight of course said mulligan respectfully if you still think it if you want to know the one reason thats taking me back tell you i cannot bring myself to abandon to destruction all the greatness of the world all that which was mine and yours which was made by us and is still ours by rightbecause i cannot believe that men can refuse to see that they can remain blind and deaf to us forever when the truth is ours and their lives depend on accepting it they still love their livesand that is the uncorrupted remnant of their minds so long as men desire to live i cannot lose my battle do they said hugh akston softly do they desire it no dont answer me now i know that the answer was the hardest thing for any of us to grasp and to accept just take that question back with you as the last premise left for you to check youre leaving as our friend said midas mulligan and well be fighting everything youll do because we know youre wrong but its not you that well be damning youll come back said hugh akston because yours is an error of knowledge not a moral failure not an act of surrender to evil but only the last act of being victim to your own virtue well wait for youand dagny when you come back you will have discovered that there need never be any conflict among your desires nor so tragic a clash of values as the one youve borne so well thank you she said closing her eyes we must discuss the conditions of your departure said galt he spoke in the dispassionate manner of an executive first you must give us your word that you will not disclose our secret or any part of itneither our cause nor our existence nor this valley nor your whereabouts for the past monthto anyone in the outer world not at any time or for any purpose whatsoever i give you my word second you must never attempt to find this valley again you are not to come here uninvited should you break the first condition it will not place us in serious danger should you break the secondit will it is not our policy ever to be at the arbitrary mercy of the good faith of another person or at the mercy of a promise that cannot be enforced nor can we expect you to place our interests above your own since you believe that your course is right the day may come when you may find it necessary to lead our enemies to this valley we shall therefore leave you no means to do it you will be taken out of the valley by plane blindfolded and you will be flown a distance sufficient to make it impossible for you ever to retrace the course she inclined her head you are right your plane has been repaired do you wish to reclaim it by signing a draft on your account at the mulligan bank no then we shall hold it until such time as you choose to pay for it day after tomorrow i will take you in my plane to a point outside the valley and leave you within reach of further transportation she inclined her head very well it had grown dark when they left midas mulligans the trail back to galts house led across the valley past franciscos cabin and the three of them walked home together a few squares of lighted windows hung scattered through the darkness and the first streams of mist were weaving slowly across the panes like shadows cast by a distant sea they walked in silence but the sound of their steps blending into a single steady beat was like a speech to be grasped and not to be uttered in any other form after a while francisco said it changes nothing it only makes the span a little longer and the last stretch is always the hardestbut its the last i will hope so she said in a moment she repeated quietly the last is the hardest she turned to galt may i make one request yes will you let me go tomorrow if you wish when francisco spoke again moments later it was as if he were addressing the unnamed wonder in her mind his voice had the tone of answering a question dagny all three of us are in loveshe jerked her head to himwith the same thing no matter what its forms dont wonder why you feel no breach among us youll be one of us so long as youll remain in love with your rails and your enginesand theyll lead you back to us no matter how many times you lose your way the only man never to be redeemed is the man without passion thank you she said softly for what for for the way you sound how do i sound name it dagny you sound as if youre happy i amin exactly the same way you are dont tell me what you feel i know it but you see the measure of the hell youre able to endure is the measure of your love the hell i couldnt bear to witness would be to see you being indifferent she nodded silently unable to name as joy any part of the things she felt yet feeling that he was right clots of mist were drifting like smoke across the moon and in the diffused glow she could not distinguish the expressions of their faces as she walked between them the only expressions to perceive were the straight silhouettes of their bodies the unbroken sound of then steps and her own feeling that she wished to walk on and on a feeling she could not define except that it was neither doubt nor pain when they approached his cabin francisco stopped the gesture of his hand embracing them both as he pointed to his door will you come in since its to be our last night together for some time lets have a drink to that future of which all three of us are certain are we she asked yes said galt we are she looked at their faces when francisco switched on the light in his house she could not define their expressions it was not happiness or any emotion pertaining to joy their faces were taut and solemn but it was a glowing solemnityshe thoughtif this were possible and the odd glow she felt within her told her that her own face had the same look francisco reached for three glasses from a cupboard but stopped as at a sudden thought he placed one glass on the table then reached for the two silver goblets of sebastian danconia and placed them beside it are you going straight to new york dagny he asked in the calm unstrained tone of a host bringing out a bottle of old wine yes she answered as calmly im flying to buenos aires day after tomorrow he said uncorking the bottle im not sure whether ill be back in new york later but if i am it will be dangerous for you to see me i wont care about that she said unless you feel that im not entitled to see you any longer true dagny youre not not in new york he was pouring the wine and he glanced up at galt john when will you decide whether youre going back or staying here galt looked straight at him then said slowly in the tone of a man who knows all the consequences of his words i have decided francisco im going back franciscos hand stopped for a long moment he was seeing nothing but galts face then his eyes moved to hers he put the bottle down and he did not step back but it was as if his glance drew back to a wide range to include them both but of course he said he looked as if he had moved still farther and were now seeing the whole spread of their years his voice had an even uninflected sound quality that matched the size of the vision i knew it twelve years ago he said i knew it before you could have known and its i who should have seen that you would see that night when you called us to new york i thought of it then ashe was speaking to galt but his eyes moved to dagnyas everything that you were seeking everything you told us to live for or die if necessary i should have seen that you would think it too it could not have been otherwise it is as it hadand oughtto be it was set then twelve years ago he looked at galt and chuckled softly and you say that its i whove taken the hardest beating he turned with too swift a movementthen too slowly as if in deliberate emphasis he completed the task of pouring the wine filling the three vessels on the table he picked up the two silver goblets looked down at them for the pause of an instant then extended one to dagny the other to galt take it he said youve earned itand it wasnt chance galt took the goblet from his hand but it was as if the acceptance was done by their eyes as they looked at each other i would have given anything to let it be otherwise said galt except that which is beyond giving she held her goblet she looked at francisco and she let him see her eyes glance at galt yes she said in the tone of an answer but i have not earned itand what youve paid im paying it now and i dont know whether ill ever earn enough to hold clear title but if hell is the priceand the measurethen let me be the greediest of the three of us as they drank as she stood her eyes closed feeling the liquid motion of the wine inside her throat she knew that for all three of them this was the most torturedand the most exultantmoment they had ever reached she did not speak to galt as they walked down the last stretch of the trail to his house she did not turn her head to him feeling that even a glance would be too dangerous she felt in their silence both the calm of a total understanding and the tension of the knowledge that they were not to name the things they understood but she faced him when they were in his living room with full confidence and as if in sudden certainty of a rightthe certainty that she would not break and that it was now safe to speak she said evenly neither as plea nor as triumph merely as the statement of a fact you are going back to the outer world because i will be there yes i do not want you to go you have no choice about it you are going for my sake no for mine will you allow me to see you there no i am not to see you no i am not to know where you are or what you do youre not will you be watching me as you did before more so is your purpose to protect me no what is it then to be there on the day when you decide to join us she looked at him attentively permitting herself no other reaction but as if groping for an answer to the first point she had not fully understood all the rest of us will be gone he explained it will become too dangerous to remain i will remain as your last key before the door of this valley closes altogether oh she choked it off before it became a moan then regaining the manner of impersonal detachment she asked suppose i were to tell you that my decision is final and that i am never to join you it would be a lie suppose i were now to decide that i wish to make it final and to stand by it no matter what the future no matter what future evidence you observe and what convictions you form yes that would be worse than a lie you are certain that i have made the wrong decision i am do you believe that one must be responsible for ones own errors i do then why arent you letting me bear the consequences of mine i am and you will if i find when it is too late that i want to return to this valley why should you have to bear the risk of keeping that door open to me i dont have to i wouldnt do it if i had no selfish end to gain what selfish end i want you here she closed her eyes and inclined her head in open admission of defeatdefeat in the argument and in her attempt to face calmly the full meaning of that which she was leaving then she raised her head and as if she had absorbed his kind of frankness she looked at him hiding neither her suffering nor her longing nor her calm knowing that all three were in her glance his face was as it had been in the sunlight of the moment when she had seen it for the first time a face of merciless serenity and unflinching perceptiveness without pain or fear or guilt she thought that were it possible for her to stand looking at him at the straight lines of his eyebrows over the dark green eyes at the curve of the shadow underscoring the shape of his mouth at the pouredmetal planes of his skin in the open collar of his shirt and the casually immovable posture of his legsshe would wish to spend the rest of her life on this spot and in this manner and in the next instant she knew that if her wish were granted the contemplation would lose all meaning because she would have betrayed all the things that gave it value then not as memory but as an experience of the present she felt herself reliving the moment when she had stood at the window of her room in new york looking at a fogbound city at the unattainable shape of atlantis sinking out of reachand she knew that she was now seeing the answer to that moment she felt not the words she had then addressed to the city but that untranslated sensation from which the words had come you whom i have always loved and never found you whom i expected to see at the end of the rails beyond the horizon aloud she said i want you to know this i started my life with a single absolute that the world was mine to shape in the image of my highest values and never to be given up to a lesser standard no matter how long or hard the struggleyou whose presence i had always felt in the streets of the city the wordless voice within her was saying and whose world i had wanted to buildnow i know that i was fighting for this valleyit is my love for you that had kept me movingit was this valley that i saw as possible and would exchange for nothing less and would not give up to a mindless evilmy love and my hope to reach you and my wish to be worthy of you on the day when i would stand before you face to facei am going back to fight for this valleyto release it from its underground to regain for it its full and rightful realm to let the earth belong to you in fact as it does in spiritand to meet you again on the day when im able to deliver to you the whole of the worldor if i fail to remain in exile from this valley to the end of my lifebut what is left of my life will still be yours and i will go on in your name even though it is a name im never to pronounce i will go on serving you even though im never to win i will go on to be worthy of you on the day when i would have met you even though i wonti will fight for it even if i have to fight against you even if you damn me as a traitor even if i am never to see you again he had stood without moving he had listened with no change in his face only his eyes had looked at her as if he were hearing every word even the words she had not pronounced he answered with the same look as if the look were holding some circuit not yet to be broken his voice catching some tone of hers as if in signal of the same code a voice with no sign of emotion except in the spacing of the words if you fail as men have failed in their quest for a vision that should have been possible yet has remained forever beyond their reachif like them you come to think that ones highest values are not to be attained and ones greatest vision is not to be made realdont damn this earth as they did dont damn existence you have seen the atlantis they were seeking it is here it existsbut one must enter it naked and alone with no rags from the falsehoods of centuries with the purest clarity of mindnot an innocent heart but that which is much rarer an intransigent mindas ones only possession and key you will not enter it until you learn that you do not need to convince or to conquer the world when you learn it you will see that through all the years of your struggle nothing had barred you from atlantis and there were no chains to hold you except the chains you were willing to wear through all those years that which you most wished to win was waiting for youhe looked at her as if he were speaking to the unspoken words in her mindwaiting as unremittingly as you were fighting as passionately as desperatelybut with a greater certainty than yours go out to continue your struggle go on carrying unchosen burdens taking undeserved punishment and believing that justice can be served by the offer of your own spirit to the most unjust of tortures but in your worst and darkest moments remember that you have seen another kind of world remember that you can reach it whenever you choose to see remember that it will be waiting and that its real its possibleits yours then turning his head a little his voice as clear but his eyes breaking the circuit he asked what time do you wish to leave tomorrow oh as early as it will be convenient for you then have breakfast ready at seven and well take off at eight i will he reached into his pocket and extended to her a small shining disk which she could not distinguish at first he dropped it on the palm of her hand it was a fivedollar gold piece the last of your wages for the month he said her fingers snapped closed over the coin too tightly but she answered calmly and tonelessly thank you good night miss taggart good night she did not sleep in the hours that were still left to her she sat on the floor of her room her face pressed to the bed feeling nothing but the sense of his presence beyond the wall at times she felt as if he were before her as if she were sitting at his feet she spent her last night with him in this manner she left the valley as she had come carrying away nothing that belonged to it she left the few possessions she had acquiredher peasant skirt a blouse an apron a few pieces of underwearfolded neatly in a drawer of the chest in her room she looked at them for a moment before she closed the drawer thinking that if she came back she would perhaps still find them there she took nothing with her but the fivedollar gold piece and the band of tape still wound about her ribs the sun touched the peaks of the mountains drawing a shining circle as a frontier of the valleywhen she climbed aboard the plane she leaned back in the seat beside him and looked at galts face bent over her as it had been bent when she had opened her eyes on the first morning then she closed her eyes and felt his hands tying the blindfold across her face she heard the blast of the motor not as sound but as the shudder of an explosion inside her body only it felt like a distant shudder as if the person feeling it would have been hurt if she were not so far away she did not know when the wheels left the ground or when the plane crossed the circle of the peaks she lay still with the pounding beat of the motor as her only perception of space as if she were carried inside a current of sound that rocked once in a while the sound came from his engine from the control of his hands on the wheel she held onto that the rest was to be endured not resisted she lay still her legs stretched forward her hands on the arms of the seat with no sense of motion not even her own to give her a sense of time with no space no sight no future with the night of closed eyelids under the pressure of the clothand with the knowledge of his presence beside her as her single unchanging reality they did not speak once she said suddenly mr galt yes no nothing i just wanted to know whether you were still there i will always be there she did not know for how many miles the memory of the sound of words seemed like a small landmark rolling away into the distance then vanishing then there was nothing but the stillness of an indivisible present she did not know whether a day had passed or an hour when she felt the downward plunging motion which meant that they were about to land or to crash the two possibilities seemed equal to her mind she felt the jolt of the wheels against the ground as an oddly delayed sensation as if some fraction of time had gone to make her believe it she felt the running streak of jerky motion then the jar of the stop and of silence then the touch of his hands on her hair removing the blindfold she saw a glaring sunlight a stretch of scorched weeds going off into the sky with no mountains to stop it a deserted highway and the hazy outline of a town about a mile away she glanced at her watch forty seven minutes ago she had still been in the valley youll find a taggart station there he said pointing at the town and youll be able to take a train she nodded as if she understood he did not follow her as she descended to the ground he leaned across the wheel toward the open door of the plane and they looked at each other she stood her face raised to him a faint wind stirring her hair the straight line of her shoulders sculptured by the trim suit of a business executive amidst the flat immensity of an empty prairie the movement of his hand pointed east toward some invisible cities dont look for me out there he said you will not find meuntil you want me for what i am and when youll want me ill be the easiest man to find she heard the sound of the door falling closed upon him it seemed louder than the blast of the propeller that followed she watched the run of the planes wheels and the trail of weeds left flattened behind them then she saw a strip of sky between wheels and weeds she looked around her a reddish haze of heat hung over the shapes of the town in the distance and the shapes seemed to sag under a rusty tinge above their roofs she saw the remnant of a crumbled smokestack she saw a dry yellow scrap rustling faintly in the weeds beside her it was a piece of newspaper she looked at these objects blankly unable to make them real she raised her eyes to the plane she watched the spread of its wings grow smaller in the sky draining away in its wake the sound of its motor it kept rising wings first like a long silver cross then the curve of its motion went following the sky dropping slowly closer to the earth then it seemed not to move any longer but only to shrink she watched it like a star in the process of extinction while it shrank from cross to dot to a burning spark which she was no longer certain of seeing when she saw that the spread of the sky was strewn with such sparks all over she knew that the plane was gone chapter iii antigreed what am i doing here asked dr robert stadler why was i asked to come here i demand an explanation im not accustomed to being dragged halfway across a continent without rhyme reason or notice dr floyd ferris smiled which makes me appreciate it all the more that you did come dr stadler it was impossible to tell whether his voice had a tone of gratitudeor of gloating the sun was beating down upon them and dr stadler felt a streak of perspiration oozing along his temple he could not hold an angrily embarrassingly private discussion in the middle of a crowd streaming to fill the benches of the grandstand around themthe discussion which he had tried and failed to obtain for the last three days it occurred to him that that was precisely the reason why his meeting with dr ferris had been delayed to this moment but he brushed the thought aside just as he brushed some insect buzzing to reach his wet temple why was i unable to get in touch with you he asked the fraudulent weapon of sarcasm now seemed to sound less effective than ever but it was dr stadlers only weapon why did you find it necessary to send me messages on official stationery worded in a style proper im sure for armyorders he was about to say but didntcommunications but certainly not for scientific correspondence it is a government matter said dr ferris gently do you realize that i was much too busy and that this meant an interruption of my work oh yes said dr ferris noncommittally do you realize that i could have refused to come but you didnt said dr ferris softly why was i given no explanation why didnt you come for me in person instead of sending those incredible young hooligans with their mysterious gibberish that sounded halfscience halfpulpmagazine i was too busy said dr ferris blandly then would you mind telling me what youre doing in the middle of a plain in iowaand what im doing here for that matter he waved contemptuously at the dusty horizon of an empty prairie and at the three wooden grandstands the stands were newly erected and the wood too seemed to perspire he could see drops of resin sparkling in the sun we are about to witness an historical event dr stadler an occasion which will become a milestone on the road of science civilization social welfare and political adaptability dr ferris voice had the tone of a public relations mans memorized handout the turning point of a new era what event what new era as you will observe only the most distinguished citizens the cream of our intellectual elite have been chosen for the special privilege of witnessing this occasion we could not omit your name could weand we feel certain of course that we can count on your loyalty and cooperation he could not catch dr ferris eyes the grandstands were rapidly filling with people and dr ferris kept interrupting himself constantly to wave to nondescript newcomers whom dr stadler had never seen before but who were personages as he could tell by the particular shade of gaily informal deference in ferns waving they all seemed to know dr ferris and to seek him out as if he were the master of ceremonies or the starof the occasion if you would kindly be specific for a moment said dr stadler and tell me what hi spud called dr ferris waving to a portly whitehaired man who filled the fulldress uniform of a general dr stadler raised his voice i said if you would kindly concentrate long enough to explain to me what in hell is going on but its very simple its the final triumph of youll have to excuse me a minute dr stadler said dr ferris hastily tearing forward like an over trained lackey at the sound of a bell in the direction of what looked like a group of aging rowdies he turned back long enough to add two words which he seemed reverently to consider as a full explanation the press dr stadler sat down on the wooden bench feeling unaccountably reluctant to brush against anything around him the three grandstands were spaced at intervals in a semicurve like the tiers of a small private circus with room for some three hundred people they seemed built for the viewing of some spectaclebut they faced the emptiness of a flat prairie stretching off to the horizon with nothing in sight but the dark blotch of a farmhouse miles away there were radio microphones in front of one stand which seemed reserved for the press there was a contraption resembling a portable switchboard in front of the stand reserved for officials a few levers of polished metal sparkled in the sun on the face of the switchboard in an improvised parking lot behind the stands the glitter of luxurious new cars seemed a brightly reassuring sight but it was the building that stood on a knoll some thousand feet away that gave dr stadler a vague sense of uneasiness it was a small squat structure of unknown purpose with massive stone walls no windows except a few slits protected by stout iron bars and a large dome grotesquely too heavy for the rest that seemed to press the structure down into the soil a few outlets protruded from the base of the dome in loose irregular shapes resembling badly poured clay funnels they did not seem to belong to an industrial age or to any known usage the building had an air of silent malevolence like a puffed venomous mushroom it was obviously modern but its sloppy rounded ineptly unspecific lines made it look like a primitive structure unearthed in the heart of the jungle devoted to some secret rites of savagery dr stadler sighed with irritation he was tired of secrets confidential and top confidential had been the words stamped on the invitation which had demanded that he travel to iowa on a twoday notice and for an unspecified purpose two young men who called themselves physicists had appeared at the institute to escort him his calls to ferris office in washington had remained unanswered the young men had talkedthrough an exhausting trip by government plane then a clammy ride in a government carabout science emergencies social equilibriums and the need of secrecy till he knew less than he had known at the start he noticed only that two words kept recurring in their jabber which had also appeared in the text of the invitation two words that had an ominous sound when involving an unknown issue the demands for his loyalty and cooperation the young men had deposited him on a bench in the front row of the grandstand and had vanished like the folding gear of a mechanism leaving him to the sudden presence of dr ferris in person now watching the scene around him watching dr ferris vague excited loosely casual gestures in the midst of a group of newsmen he had an impression of bewildering confusion of senseless chaotic inefficiencyand of a smooth machine working to produce the exact degree of that impression needed at the exact moment he felt a single sudden flash of panic in which as in a flash of lightning he permitted himself to know that he felt a desperate desire to escape but he slammed his mind shut against it he knew that the darkest secret of the occasionmore crucial more untouchable more deadly than whatever was hidden in the mushroom buildingwas that which had made him agree to come he would never have to learn his own motive he thought he thought it not by means of words but by means of the brief vicious spasm of an emotion that resembled irritation and felt like acid the words that stood in his mind as they had stood when he had agreed to come were like a voodoo formula which one recites when it is needed and beyond which one must not look what can you do when you have to deal with people he noticed that the stand reserved for those whom ferris had called the intellectual elite was larger than the stand prepared for government officials he caught himself feeling a swift little sneak of pleasure at the thought that he had been placed in the front row he turned to glance at the tiers behind him the sensation he experienced was like a small gray shock that random faded shopworn assembly was not his conception of an intellectual elite he saw defensively belligerent men and tastelessly dressed womenhe saw mean rancorous suspicious faces that bore the one mark incompatible with a standard bearer of the intellect the mark of uncertainty he could find no face he knew no face to recognize as famous and none likely ever to achieve such recognition he wondered by what standard these people had been selected then he noticed a gangling figure in the second row the figure of an elderly man with a long slack face that seemed faintly familiar to him though he could recall nothing about it except a vague memory as of a photograph seen in some unsavory publication he leaned toward a woman and asked pointing could you tell me the name of that gentleman the woman answered in a whisper of awed respect that is dr simon pritchett dr stadler turned away wishing no one would see him wishing no one would ever learn that he had been a member of that group he raised his eyes and saw that ferris was leading the whole press gang toward him he saw ferris sweeping his arm at him in the manner of a tourist guide and declaring when they were close enough to be heard but why should you waste your time on me when there is the source of todays achievement the man who made it all possibledr robert stadler it seemed to him for an instant that he saw an incongruous look on the worn cynical faces of the newsmen a look that was not quite respect expectation or hope but more like an echo of these like a faint reflection of the look they might have worn in their youth on hearing the name of robert stadler in that instant he felt an impulse which he would not acknowledge the impulse to tell them that he knew nothing about todays event that his power counted for less than theirs that he had been brought here as a pawn in some confidence game almost as as a prisoner instead he heard himself answering their questions in the smug condescending tone of a man who shares all the secrets of the highest authorities yes the state science institute is proud of its record of public service the state science institute is not the tool of any private interests or personal greed it is devoted to the welfare of mankind to the good of humanity as a whole spouting like a dictaphone the sickening generalities he had heard from dr ferns he would not permit himself to know that what he felt was self loathing he identified the emotion but not its object it was loathing for the men around him he thought it was they who were forcing him to go through this shameful performance what can you dohe thoughtwhen you have to deal with people the newsmen were making brief notes of his answers their faces now had the look of automatons acting out the routine of pretending that they were hearing news in the empty utterances of another automaton dr stadler asked one of them pointing at the building on the knoll is it true that you consider project x the greatest achievement of the state science institute there was a dead drop of silence project x said dr stadler he knew that something was ominously wrong in the tone of his voice because he saw the heads of the newsmen go up as at the sound of an alarm he saw them waiting their pencils poised for one instant while he felt the muscles of his face cracking into the fraud of a smile he felt a formless an almost supernatural terror as if he sensed again the silent working of some smooth machine as if he were caught in it part of it and doing its irrevocable will project x he said softly in the mysterious tone of a conspirator well gentlemen the valueand the motiveof any achievement of the state science institute are not to be doubted since it is a nonprofit ventureneed i say more he raised his head and noticed that dr ferris had stood on the edge of the group through the whole of the interview he wondered whether he imagined that the look on dr ferris face now seemed less tenseand more impertinent two resplendent cars came shooting at full speed into the parking lot and stopped with a flourish of screeching brakes the newsmen deserted him in the middle of a sentence and went running to meet the group alighting from the cars dr stadler turned to ferris what is project x he asked sternly dr ferris smiled in a manner of innocence and insolence together a nonprofit venture he answeredand went running off to meet the newcomers from the respectful whispers of the crowd dr stadler learned that the little man in a wilted linen suit who looked like a shyster striding briskly in the center of the new group was mr thompson the head of the state mr thompson was smiling frowning and barking answers to the newsmen dr ferris was weaving through the group with the grace of a cat rubbing against sundry legs the group came closer and he saw ferris steering them in his direction mr thompson said dr ferris sonorously as they approached may i present dr robert stadler dr stadler saw the little shysters eyes studying him for the fraction of a second the eyes had a touch of superstitious awe as at the sight of a phenomenon from a mystical realm forever incomprehensible to mr thompsonand they had the piercing calculating shrewdness of a ward heeler who feels certain that nothing is immune from his standards a glance like the visual equivalent of the words whats your angle its an honor doctor an honor im sure said mr thompson briskly shaking his hand he learned that the tall stoopshouldered man with a crew haircut was mr wesley mouch he did not catch the names of the others whose hands he shook as the group proceeded toward the officials grandstand he was left with the burning sensation of a discovery he dared not face the discovery that he had felt anxiously pleased by the little shysters nod of approval a party of young attendants who looked like movie theater ushers appeared from somewhere with handcarts of glittering objects which they proceeded to distribute to the assembly the objects were field glasses dr ferns took his place at the microphone of a publicaddress system by the officials stand at a signal from wesley mouch his voice boomed suddenly over the prairie an unctuous fraudulently solemn voice magnified by the microphone inventors ingenuity into the sound and power of a giant ladies and gentlemen the crowd was struck into silence all heads jerking unanimously toward the graceful figure of dr floyd ferris ladies and gentlemen you have been chosenin recognition of your distinguished public service and social loyaltyto witness the unveiling of a scientific achievement of such tremendous importance such staggering scope such epochmaking possibilities that up to this moment it has been known only to a very few and only as project x dr stadler focused his field glasses on the only thing in sighton the blotch of the distant farm he saw that it was the deserted ruin of a farmhouse which had obviously been abandoned years ago the light of the sky showed through the naked ribs of the roof and jagged bits of glass framed the darkness of empty windows he saw a sagging barn the rusted tower of a water wheel and the remnant of a tractor lying upturned with its treads in the air dr ferris was talking about the crusaders of science and about the years of selfless devotion unremitting toil and persevering research that had gone into project x it was oddthought dr stadler studying the ruins of the farmthat there should be a herd of goats in the midst of such desolation there were six or seven of them some drowsing some munching lethargically at whatever grass they could find among the sunscorched weeds project x dr ferris was saying was devoted to some special research in the field of sound the science of sound has astonishing aspects which laymen would scarcely suspect some fifty feet away from the farmhouse dr stadler saw a structure obviously new and of no possible purpose whatever it looked like a few spans of a steel trestle rising into empty space supporting nothing leading nowhere dr ferris was now talking about the nature of sound vibrations dr stadler aimed his field glasses at the horizon beyond the farm but there was nothing else to be seen for dozens of miles the sudden straining motion of one of the goats brought his eyes back to the herd he noticed that the goats were chained to stakes driven at intervals into the ground and it was discovered said dr ferris that there are certain frequencies of sound vibration which no structure organic or inorganic can withstand dr stadler noticed a silvery spot bouncing over the weeds among the herd it was a kid that had not been chained it kept leaping and weaving about its mother the sound ray is controlled by a panel inside the giant underground laboratory said dr ferris pointing at the building on the knoll that panel is known to us affectionately as the xylophonebecause one must be darn careful to strike the right keys or rather to pull the right levers for this special occasion an extension xylophone connected to the one inside has been erected herehe pointed to the switchboard in front of the officials standso that you may witness the entire operation and see the simplicity of the whole procedure dr stadler found pleasure in watching the kid a soothing reassuring kind of pleasure the little creature seemed barely a week old it looked like a ball of white fur with graceful long legs it kept bounding in a manner of deliberate gaily ferocious awkwardness all four of its legs held stiff and straight it seemed to be leaping at the sunrays at the summer air at the joy of discovering its own existence the sound ray is invisible inaudible and fully controllable in respect to target direction and range its first public test which you are about to witness has been set to cover a small sector a mere two miles in perfect safety with all space cleared for twenty miles beyond the present generating equipment in our laboratory is capable of producing rays to coverthrough the outlets which you may observe under the domethe entire countryside within a radius of a hundred miles a circle with a periphery extending from the shore of the mississippi roughly from the bridge of the taggart transcontinental railroad to des moines and fort dodge iowa to austin minnesota to woodman wisconsin to rock island illinois this is only a modest beginning we possess the technical knowledge to build generators with a range of two and three hundred milesbut due to the fact that we were unable to obtain in time a sufficient quantity of a highly heat resistant metal such as rearden metal we had to be satisfied with our present equipment and radius of control in honor of our great executive mr thompson under whose farsighted administration the state science institute was granted the funds without which project x would not have been possible this great invention will henceforth be known as the thompson harmonizer the crowd applauded mr thompson sat motionless with his face held selfconsciously stiff dr stadler felt certain that this smalltime shyster had had as little to do with the project as any of the movie usher attendants that he possessed neither the mind nor the initiative nor even the sufficient degree of malice to cause a new gopher trap to be brought into the world that he too was only the pawn of a silent machinea machine that had no center no leader no direction a machine that had not been set in motion by dr ferris or wesley mouch or any of the cowed creatures in the grandstands or any of the creatures behind the scenesan impersonal unthinking unembodied machine of which none was the driver and all were the pawns each to the degree of his evil dr stadler gripped the edge of the bench he felt a desire to leap to his feet and run as to the function and the purpose of the sound ray i shall say nothing i shall let it speak for itself you will now see it work when dr blodgett pulls the levers of the xylophone i suggest that you keep your eyes on the targetwhich is that farmhouse two miles away there will be nothing else to see the ray itself is invisible it has long been conceded by all progressive thinkers that there are no entities only actionsand no values only consequences now ladies and gentlemen you will see the action and the consequences of the thompson harmonizer dr ferris bowed walked slowly away from the microphone and came to take his seat on the bench beside dr stadler a youngish fattish kind of man took his stand by the switchboardand raised his eyes expectantly toward mr thompson mr thompson looked blankly bewildered for an instant as if something had slipped his mind until wesley mouch leaned over and whispered some word into his ear contact said mr thompson loudly dr stadler could not bear to watch the graceful undulating effeminate motion of dr blodgetts hand as it pulled the first lever of the switchboard then the next he raised his field glasses and looked at the farmhouse in the instant when he focused his lens a goat was pulling at its chain reaching placidly for a tall dry thistle in the next instant the goat rose into the air upturned its legs stretched upward and jerking then fell into a gray pile made of seven goats in convulsions by the time dr stadler believed it the pile was motionless except for one beasts leg sticking out of the mass stiff as a rod and shaking as in a strong wind the farmhouse tore into strips of clapboard and went down followed by a geyser of the bricks of its chimney the tractor vanished into a pancake the water tower cracked and its shreds hit the ground white its wheel was still describing a long curve through the air as if of its own leisurely volition the steel beams and girders of the solid new trestle collapsed like a structure of matchsticks under the breath of a sigh it was so swift so uncontested so simple that dr stadler felt no horror he felt nothing it was not the reality he had known it was the realm of a childs nightmare where material objects could be dissolved by means of a single malevolent wish he moved the field glasses from his eyes he was looking at an empty prairie there was no farm there was nothing in the distance except a darkish strip that looked like the shadow of a cloud a single high thin scream rose from the tiers behind him as some woman fainted he wondered why she should scream so long after the factand then he realized that the time elapsed since the touch of the first lever was not a full minute he raised his field glasses again almost as if he were suddenly hoping that the cloud shadow would be all he would see but the material objects were still there they were a mount of refuse he moved his glasses over the wreckage in a moment he realized that he was looking for the kid he could not find it there was nothing but a pile of gray fur when he lowered the glasses and turned he found dr ferns looking at him he felt certain that through the whole of the test it was not the target it was his face that ferris had watched as if to see whether he robert stadler could withstand the ray thats all there is to it the fattish dr blodgett announced through the microphone in the ingratiating sales tone of a departmentstore floorwalker there is no nail or rivet remaining in the frame of the structures and there is no blood vessel left unbroken in the bodies of the animals the crowd was rustling with jerky movements and highpitched whispers people were looking at one another rising uncertainly and dropping down again restlessly demanding anything but this pause there was a sound of submerged hysteria in the whispers they seemed to be waiting to be told what to think dr stadler saw a woman being escorted down the steps from the back row her head bent a handkerchief pressed to her mouth she was sick at her stomach he turned away and saw that dr ferris was still watching him dr stadler leaned back a little his face austere and scornful the face of the nations greatest scientist and asked who invented that ghastly thing you did dr stadler looked at him not moving it is merely a practical appliance said dr ferris pleasantly based upon your theoretical discoveries it was derived from your invaluable research into the nature of cosmic rays and of the spatial transmission of energy who worked on the project a few thirdraters as you would call them really there was very little difficulty none of them could have begun to conceive of the first step toward the concept of your energytransmission formula but given thatthe rest was easy what is the practical purpose of this invention what are the epochmaking possibilities oh but dont you see it is an invaluable instrument of public security no enemy would attack the possessor of such a weapon it will set the country free from the fear of aggression and permit it to plan its future in undisturbed safety his voice had an odd carelessness a tone of offhand improvisation as if he were neither expecting nor attempting to be believed it will relieve social frictions it will promote peace stability andas we have indicatedharmony it will eliminate all danger of war what war what aggression with the whole world starving and all those peoples states barely subsisting on handouts from this countrywhere do you see any danger of war do you expect those ragged savages to attack you dr ferris looked straight into his eyes internal enemies can be as great a danger to the people as external ones he answered perhaps greater this time his voice sounded as if he expected and was certain to be understood social systems are so precarious but think of what stability could be achieved by a few scientific installations at strategic key points it would guarantee a state of permanent peacedont you think so dr stadler did not move or answer as the seconds clicked past and his face still held an unchanged expression it began to look paralyzed his eyes had the stare of a man who suddenly sees that which he had known had known from the first had spent years trying not to see and who is now engaged in a contest between the sight and his power to deny its existence i dont know what youre talking about he snapped at last dr ferris smiled no private businessman or greedy industrialist would have financed project x he said softly in the tone of an idle informal discussion he couldnt have afforded it its an enormous investment with no prospect of material gain what profit could he expect from it there are no profits henceforth to be derived from that farm he pointed at the dark strip in the distance but as you have so well observed project x had to be a nonprofit venture contrary to a business firm the state science institute had no trouble in obtaining funds for the project you have not heard of the institute having any financial difficulties in the past two years have you and it used to be such a problemgetting them to vote the funds necessary for the advancement of science they always demanded gadgets for their cash as you used to say well here was a gadget which some people in power could fully appreciate they got the others to vote for it it wasnt difficult in fact a great many of those others felt safe in voting money for a project that was secretthey felt certain it was important since they were not considered important enough to be let in on it there were of course a few skeptics and doubters but they gave in when they were reminded that the head of the state science institute was dr robert stadlerwhose judgment and integrity they could not doubt dr stadler was looking down at his fingernails the sudden screech of the microphone jerked the crowd into an instantaneous attentiveness people seemed to be a seconds worth of selfcontrol away from panic an announcer with a voice like a machine gun spitting smiles barked cheerily that they were now to witness the radio broadcast that would break the news of the great discovery to the whole nation then with a glance at his watch his script and the signaling arm of wesley mouch he yelled into the sparkling snakehead of the microphoneinto the living rooms the offices the studies the nurseries of the country ladies and gentlemen project x dr ferris leaned toward dr stadlerthrough the staccato hoof beats of the announcers voice galloping across the continent with a description of the new inventionand said in the tone of a casual remark it is vitally important that there be no criticism of the project in the country at this precarious time then added semiaccidentally as a semijoke that there be no criticism of anything at any time and the nations political cultural intellectual and moral leaders the announcer was yelling into the microphone who have witnessed this great event as your representatives and in your name will now tell you their views of it in person mr thompson was the first to mount the wooden steps to the platform of the microphone he snapped his way through a brief speech hailing a new era and declaringin the belligerent tone of a challenge to unidentified enemiesthat science belonged to the people and that every man on the face of the globe had a right to a share of the advantages created by technological progress wesley mouch came next he spoke about social planning and the necessity of unanimous rallying in support of the planners he spoke about discipline unity austerity and the patriotic duty of bearing temporary hardships we have mobilized the best brains of the country to work for your welfare this great invention was the product of the genius of a man whose devotion to the cause of humanity is not to be questioned a man acknowledged by all as the greatest mind of the centurydr robert stadler what gasped dr stadler whirling toward ferris dr ferris looked at him with a glance of patient mildness he didnt ask my permission to say that dr stadler halfsnapped halfwhispered dr ferris spread out his hands in a gesture of reproachful helplessness now you see dr stadler how unfortunate it is if you allow yourself to be disturbed by political matters which you have always considered unworthy of your attention and knowledge you see it is not mr mouchs function to ask permissions the figure now slouching against the sky on the speakers platform coiling itself about the microphone talking in the bored contemptuous tone of an offcolor story was dr simon pritchett he was declaring that the new invention was an instrument of social welfare which guaranteed general prosperity and that anyone who doubted this self evident fact was an enemy of society to be treated accordingly this invention the product of dr robert stadler the preeminent lover of freedom dr ferris opened a briefcase produced some pages of neatly typed copy and turned to dr stadler you are to be the climax of the broadcast he said you will speak last at the end of the hour he extended the pages heres the speech youll make his eyes said the rest they said that his choice of words had not been accidental dr stadler took the pages but held them between the tips of two straight fingers as one might hold a scrap of waste paper about to be tossed aside i havent asked you to appoint yourself as my ghost writer he said the sarcasm of the voice gave ferris his clue this was not a moment for sarcasm i couldnt have allowed your invaluable time to be taken up by the writing of radio speeches said dr ferris i felt certain that you would appreciate it he said it in a tone of spurious politeness intended to be recognized as spurious the tone of tossing to a beggar the alms of facesaving dr stadlers answer disturbed him dr stadler did not choose to answer or to glance down at the manuscript lack of faith a beefy speaker was snarling on the platform in the tone of a street brawl lack of faith is the only thing we got to fear if we iave faith in the plans of our leaders why the plans will work and well all have prosperity and ease and plenty its the fellows who go around doubting and destroying our morale its they whore keeping us in shortages and misery but were not going to let them do it much longer were here to protect the peopleand if any of those doubting smarties come around believe you me well take care of them it would be unfortunate said dr ferris in a soft voice to arouse popular resentment against the state science institute at an explosive time like the present theres a great deal of dissatisfaction and unrest in the countryand if people should misunderstand the nature of the new invention theyre liable to vent their rage on all scientists scientists have never been popular with the masses peace a tall willowy woman was signing into the microphone this invention is a great new instrument of peace it will protect us from the aggressive designs of selfish enemies it will allow us to breathe freely and to learn to love our fellow men she had a bony face with a mouth embittered at cocktail parties and wore a flowing pale blue gown suggesting the concert garment of a harpist it may well be considered as that miracle which was thought impossible in historythe dream of the agesthe final synthesis of science and love dr stadler looked at the faces in the grandstands they were sitting quietly now they were listening but their eyes had an ebbing look of twilight a look of fear in the process of being accepted as permanent the look of raw wounds being dimmed by the veil of infection they knew as he knew it that they were the targets of the shapeless funnels protruding from the mushroom buildings domeand he wondered in what manner they were now extinguishing their minds and escaping that knowledge he knew that the words they were eager to absorb and believe were the chains slipping in to hold them like the goats securely within the range of those funnels they were eager to believe he saw the tightening lines of their lips he saw the occasional glances of suspicion they threw at their neighborsas if the horror that threatened them was not the sound ray but the men who would make them acknowledge it as horror their eyes were veiling over but the remnant look of a wound was a cry for help why do you think they think said dr ferris softly reason is the scientists only weaponand reason has no power over men has it at a time like ours with the country falling apart with the mob driven by blind desperation to the edge of open riots and violenceorder must be maintained by any means available what can we do when we have to deal with people dr stadler did not answer a fat jellied woman with an inadequate brassiere under a dark perspirationstained dress was saying into the microphonedr stadler could not believe it at firstthat the new invention was to be greeted with particular gratitude by the mothers of the country dr stadler turned away watching him ferris could see nothing but the noble line of the high forehead and the deep cut of bitterness at the corner of the mouth suddenly without context or warning robert stadler whirled to face him it was like a spurt of blood from a sudden crack in a wound that had almost closed stadlers face was open open in pain in horror in sincerity as if for that moment both he and ferris were human beings while he moaned with incredulous despair in a civilized century ferris in a civilized century dr ferris took his time to produce and prolong a soft chuckle i dont know what youre talking about he answered in the tone of a quotation dr stadler lowered his eyes when ferris spoke again his voice had the faintest edge of a tone which stadler could not define except that it did not belong in any civilized discussion it would be unfortunate if anything were to happen to jeopardize the state science institute it would be most unfortunate if the institute were to be closedor if any one of us were to be forced to leave it where would we go scientists are an inordinate luxury these daysand there arent many people or establishments left whore able to afford necessities let alone luxuries there are no doors left open to us we wouldnt be welcome in the research department of an industrial concern such aslet us sayrearden steel besides if we should happen to make enemies the same enemies would be feared by any person tempted to employ our talents a man like rearden would have fought for us would a man like orren boyle but this is purely theoretical speculation because as a matter of practical fact all private establishments of scientific research have been closed by lawby directive issued as you might not realize by mr wesley mouch are you thinking perhaps of universities they are in the same position they cant afford to make enemies who would speak up for us i believe that some such man as hugh akston would have come to our defensebut to think of that is to be guilty of an anachronism he belonged to a different age the conditions set up in our social and economic reality have long since made his continued existence impossible and i dont think that dr simon pritchett or the generation reared under his guidance would be able or willing to defend us i have never believed in the efficacy of idealistshave youand this is no age for impractical idealism if anyone wished to oppose a government policy how would he make himself heard through these gentlemen of the press dr stadler through this microphone is there an independent newspaper left in the country an uncontrolled radio station a private piece of property for that matteror a personal opinion the tone of the voice was obvious now it was the tone of a thug a personal opinion is the one luxury that nobody can afford today dr stadlers lips moved stiffly as stiffly as the muscles of the goats you are speaking to robert stadler i have not forgotten that it is precisely because i have not forgotten it that i am speaking robert stadler is an illustrious name which i would hate to see destroyed but what is an illustrious name nowadays in whose eyes his arm swept over the grandstands in the eyes of people such as you see around you if they will believe when so told that an instrument of death is a tool of prosperitywould they not believe it if they were told that robert stadler is a traitor and an enemy of the state would you then rely on the fact that this is not true are you thinking of truth dr stadler questions of truth do not enter into social issues principles have no influence on public affairs reason has no power over human beings logic is impotent morality is superfluous do not answer me now dr stadler you will answer me over the microphone youre the next speaker looking off at the dark strip of the farm in the distance dr stadler knew that what he felt was terror but he would not permit himself to know its nature he who had been able to study the particles and sub particles of cosmic space would not permit himself to examine his feeling and to know that it was made of three parts one part was terror of a vision that seemed to stand before his eyes the vision of the inscription cut in his honor over the door of the institute to the fearless mind to the inviolate truthanother part was a plain brute animal fear of physical destruction a humiliating fear which in the civilized world of his youth he had not expected ever to experienceand the third was the terror of the knowledge that by betraying the first one delivers oneself into the realm of the second he walked toward the speakers scaffold his steps firm and slow his head lifted the manuscript of the speech held crumpled in his fingers it looked like a walk to mount either a pedestal or a guillotine as the whole of a mans life flashes before him in his dying moment so he walked to the sound of the announcers voice reading to the country the list of robert stadlers achievements and career a faint convulsion ran over robert stadlers face at the words former head of the department of physics of the patrick henry university he knew distantly not as if the knowledge were within him but as if it were within some person he was leaving behind that the crowd was about to witness an act of destruction more terrible than the destruction of the farm he had mounted the first three steps of the scaffold when a young newsman tore forward ran to him and from below seized the railing to stop him dr stadler he cried in a desperate whisper tell them the truth tell them that you had nothing to do with it tell them what sort of infernal machine it is and for what purpose its intended to be used tell the country what sort of people are trying to rule it nobody can doubt your word tell them the truth save us youre the only one who can dr stadler looked down at him he was young his movements and voice had that swift sharp clarity which belongs to competence among his aged corrupt favorridden and pullcreated colleagues he had managed to achieve the rank of elite of the political press by means and in the role of a last irresistible spark of ability his eyes had the look of an eager unfrightened intelligence they were the kind of eyes dr stadler had seen looking up at him from the benches of classrooms he noticed that this boys eyes were hazel they had a tinge of green dr stadler turned his head and saw that ferris had come rushing to his side like a servant or a jailer i do not expect to be insulted by disloyal young punks with treasonable motives said dr stadler loudly dr ferris whirled upon the young man and snapped his face out of control distorted by rage at the unexpected and unplanned give me your press card and your work permit i am proud dr robert stadler readinto the microphone and into the attentive silence of a nation that my years of work in the service of science have brought me the honor of placing into the hands of our great leader mr thompson a new instrument with an incalculable potential for a civilizing and liberating influence upon the mind of man the sky had the stagnant breath of a furnace and the streets of new york were like pipes running not with air and light but with melted dust dagny stood on a street corner where the airport bus had left her looking at the city in passive astonishment the buildings seemed worn by weeks of summer heat but the people seemed worn by centuries of anguish she stood watching them disarmed by an enormous sense of unreality that sense of unreality had been her only feeling since the early hours of the morningsince the moment when at the end of an empty highway she had walked into an unknown town and stopped the first passerby to ask where she was watsonville he answered what state please she asked the man glanced at her said nebraska and walked hastily away she smiled mirthlessly knowing that he wondered where she had come from and that no explanation he could imagine would be as fantastic as the truth yet it was watsonville that seemed fantastic to her as she walked through its streets to the railroad station she had lost the habit of observing despair as the normal and dominant aspect of human existence so normal as to become unnoticedand the sight of it struck her in all of its senseless futility she was seeing the brand of pain and fear on the faces of people and the look of evasion that refuses to know itthey seemed to be going through the motions of some enormous pretense acting out a ritual to ward off reality letting the earth remain unseen and their lives unlived in dread of something namelessly forbiddenyet the forbidden was the simple act of looking at the nature of their pain and questioning their duty to bear it she was seeing it so clearly that she kept wanting to approach strangers to shake them to laugh in their faces and to cry snap out of it there was no reason for people to be as unhappy as that she thought no reason whatever and then she remembered that reason was the one power they had banished from their existence she boarded a taggart train for the nearest airfield she did not identify herself to anyone it seemed irrelevant she sat at the window of a coach like a stranger who has to learn the incomprehensible language of those around her she picked up a discarded newspaper she managed with effort to understand what was written but not why it should ever have been written it all seemed so childishly senseless she stared in astonishment at a paragraph in a syndicated column from new york which stated over emphatically that mr james taggart wished it to be known that his sister had died in an airplane crash any unpatriotic rumors to the contrary notwithstanding slowly she remembered directive and realized that jim was embarrassed by the public suspicion that she had vanished as a deserter the wording of the paragraph suggested that her disappearance had been a prominent public issue not yet dropped there were other suggestions of it a mention of miss taggarts tragic death in a story about the growing number of plane crashesand on the back page an ad offering a reward to the person who would find the wreckage of her plane signed by henry rearden the last gave her a stab of urgency the rest seemed meaningless then slowly she realized that her return was a public event which would be taken as big news she felt a lethargic weariness at the prospect of a dramatic homecoming of facing jim and the press of witnessing the excitement she wished they would get it over with in her absence at the airfield she saw a smalltown reporter interviewing some departing officials she waited till he had finished then she approached him extended her credentials and said quietly to the gaping stare of his eyes im dagny taggart would you make it known please that im alive and that ill be in new york this afternoon the plane was about to take off and she escaped the necessity of answering questions she watched the prairies the rivers the towns slipping past at an untouchable distance belowand she noted that the sense of detachment one feels when looking at the earth from a plane was the same sense she felt when looking at people only her distance from people seemed longer the passengers were listening to some radio broadcast which appeared to be important judging by their earnest attentiveness she caught brief snatches of fraudulent voices talking about some sort of new invention that was to bring some undefined benefits to some undefined publics welfare the words were obviously chosen to convey no specific meaning whatever she wondered how one could pretend that one was hearing a speech yet that was what the passengers were doing they were going through the performance of a child who not yet able to read holds a book open and spells out anything he wishes to spell pretending that it is contained in the incomprehensible black lines but the child she thought knows that he is playing a game these people pretend to themselves that they are not pretending they know no other state of existence the sense of unreality remained as her only feeling when she landed when she escaped a crowd of reporters without being seenby avoiding the taxi stands and leaping into the airport buswhen she rode on the bus then stood on a street corner looking et new york she felt as if she were seeing an abandoned city she felt no sense of homecoming when she entered her apartment the place seemed to be a convenient machine that she could use for some purpose of no significance whatever but she felt a quickened touch of energy like the first break in a fog a touch of meaningwhen she picked up the telephone receiver and called reardens office in pennsylvania oh miss taggart miss taggart said in a joyous moan the voice of the severe unemotional miss ives hello miss ives i havent startled you have i you knew that i was alive oh yes i heard it on the radio this morning is mr rearden in his office no miss taggart he hes in the rocky mountains searching for that is yes i know do you know where we can reach him i expect to hear from him at any moment hes stopping in los gatos colorado right now i phoned him the moment i heard the news but he was out and i left a message for him to call me you see hes out flying most of the day but hell call me when he comes back to the hotel what hotel is it the eldorado hotel in los gatos thank you miss ives she was about to hang up oh miss taggart yes what was it that happened to you where were you i ill tell you when i see you im in new york now when mr rearden calls tell him please that ill be in my office yes miss taggart she hung up but her hand remained on the receiver clinging to her first contact with a matter that had importance she looked at her apartment and at the city in the window feeling reluctant to sink again into the dead fog of the meaningless she raised the receiver and called los gatos eldorado hotel said a womans drowsily resentful voice would you take a message for mr henry rearden ash him when he comes in to just a minute please drawled the voice in the impatient tone that resents any effort as an imposition she heard the clicking of switches some buzzing some breaks of silence and then a mans clear firm voice answering hello it was hank rearden she stared at the receiver as at the muzzle of a gun feeling trapped unable to breathe hello he repeated hank is that you she heard a low sound more a sigh than a gasp and then the long empty crackling of the wire hank there was no answer hank she screamed in terror she thought she heard the effort of a breaththen she heard a whisper which was not a question but a statement saying everything dagny hank im sorryoh darling im sorrydidnt you know where are you dagny are you all right of course didnt you know that i was back and and alive no i didnt know it oh god im sorry i called i what are you talking about dagny where are you in new york didnt you hear about it on the radio no ive just come in didnt they give you a message to call miss ives no are you all right now she heard his soft low chuckle she was hearing the sound of unreleased laughter the sound of youth growing in his voice with every word when did you come back this morning dagny where were you she did not answer at once my plane crashed she said in the rockies i was picked up by some people who helped me but i could not send word to anyone the laughter went out of his voice as bad as that oh oh the crash no it wasnt bad i wasnt hurt not seriously then why couldnt you send word there were no no means of communication why did it take you so long to get back i cant answer that now dagny were you in danger the halfsmiling halfbitter tone of her voice was almost regret as she answered no were you held prisoner nonot really then you could have returned sooner but didnt thats truebut thats all i can tell you where were you dagny do you mind if we dont talk about it now lets wait until i see you of course i wont ask any questions just tell me are you safe now safe yes i mean have you suffered any permanent injuries or consequences she answered with the same sound of a cheerless smile injuriesno hank i dont know as to the permanent consequences will you still be in new york tonight why yes im im back for good are you why do you ask that i dont know i guess im too used to what its like when when i cant find you im back yes ill see you in a few hours his voice broke off as if the sentence were too enormous to believe in a few hours he repeated firmly ill be here dagny yes he chuckled softly no nothing just wanted to hear your voice awhile longer forgive me i mean not now i mean i dont want to say anything now hank i when i see you my darling so long she stood looking at the silent receiver for the first time since her return she felt pain a violent pain but it made her alive because it was worth feeling she telephoned her secretary at taggart transcontinental to say briefly that she would be in the office in half an hour the statue of nathaniel taggart was realwhen she stood facing it in the concourse of the terminal it seemed to her that they were alone in a vast echoing temple with fog coils of formless ghosts weaving and vanishing around them she stood still looking up at the statue as for a brief moment of dedication im backwere the only words she had to offer dagny taggart was still the inscription on the frosted glass panel of the door to her office the look on the faces of her staff as she entered the anteroom was the look of drowning persons at the sight of a lifeline she saw eddie willers standing at his desk in his glass enclosure with some man before him eddie made a move in her direction but stopped he looked imprisoned she let her glance greet every face in turn smiling at them gently as at doomed children then walked toward eddies desk eddie was watching her approach as if he were seeing nothing else in the world but his rigid posture seemed designed to pretend that he was listening to the man before him motive power the man was saying in a voice that had a brusque staccato snap and a slurred nasal drawl together theres no problem about motive power you just take hello said eddie softly with a muted smile as to a distant vision the man turned to glance at her he had a yellow complexion curly hair a hard face made of soft muscles and the revolting handsomeness belonging to the esthetic standards of barroom corners his blurred brown eyes had the empty flatness of glass miss taggart said eddie in a resonant tone of severity the tone of slapping the man into the manners of a drawing room he had never entered may i present mr meigs how d do said the man without interest then turned to eddie and proceeded as if she were not present you just take the comet off the schedule for tomorrow and tuesday and shoot the engines to arizona for the grapefruit special with the rolling stock from the scranton coal run i mentioned send the orders out at once youll do nothing of the kind she gasped too incredulous to be angry eddie did not answer meigs glanced at her with what would have been astonishment if his eyes were capable of registering a reaction send the orders he said to eddie with no emphasis and walked out eddie was jotting notations on a piece of paper are you crazy she asked he raised his eyes to her as though exhausted by hours of beating well have to dagny he said his voice dead what is that she asked pointing at the outer door that had closed on mr meigs the director of unification what the washington representative in charge of the railroad unification plan whats that its oh wait dagny are you all right were you hurt was it a plane crash she had never imagined what the face of eddie willers would look like in the process of aging but she was seeing it nowaging at thirtyfive and within the span of one month it was not a matter of texture or wrinkles it was the same face with the same muscles but saturated by the withering look of resignation to a pain accepted as hopeless she smiled gently and confidently in understanding in dismissal of all problems and said extending her hand all right eddie hello he took her hand and pressed it to his lips a thing he had never done before his manner neither daring nor apologetic but simply and openly personal it was a plane crash she said and eddie so that you wont worry tell you the truth i wasnt hurt not seriously but thats not the story im going to give to the press and to all the others so youre never to mention it of course i had no way to communicate with anyone but not because i was hurt its all i can tell you eddie dont ask me where i was or why it took me so long to return i wont now tell me what is the railroad unification plan its oh do you mindlet jim tell you he will soon enough i just dont have the stomachunless you want me to he added with a conscientious effort at discipline no you dont have to just tell me whether i understood that unificator correctly he wants you to cancel the comet for two days in order to give her engines to a grapefruit special in arizona thats right and hes cancelled a coal train in order to get cars to lug grapefruit yes grapefruit thats right why dagny why is a word nobody uses any longer after a moment she asked have you any guess about the reason guess i dont have to guess i know all right what is it the grapefruit special is for the smather brothers the smather brothers bought a fruit ranch in arizona a year ago from a man who went bankrupt under the equalization of opportunity bill he had owned the ranch for thirty years the smather brothers were in the punchboard business the year before they bought the ranch by means of a loan from washington under a project for the reclamation of distressed areas such as arizona the smather brothers have friends in washington well dagny everybody knows it everybody knows how train schedules have been run in the past three weeks and why some districts and some shippers get transportation while others dont what were not supposed to do is say that we know it were supposed to pretend to believe that public welfare is the only reason for any decisionand that the public welfare of the city of new york requires the immediate delivery of a large quantity of grapefruit he paused then added the director of unification is sole judge of the public welfare and has sole authority over the allocation of any motive power and rolling stock on any railroad anywhere in the united states there was a moment of silence i see she said in another moment she asked what has been done about the winston tunnel oh that was abandoned three weeks ago they never unearthed the trains the equipment gave out what has been done about rebuilding the old line around the tunnel that was shelved then are we running any transcontinental traffic he gave her an odd glance oh yes he said bitterly through the detour of the kansas western no eddie what has been happening here in the past month he smiled as if his words were an ugly confession weve been making money in the past month he answered she saw the outer door open and james taggart come in accompanied by mr meigs eddie do you want to be present at the conference she asked or would you rather miss this one no i want to be present jims face looked like a crumpled piece of paper though its soft puffed flesh had acquired no additional lines dagny theres a lot of things to discuss a lot of important changes which he said shrilly his voice rushing in ahead of his person oh im glad to see you back im happy that youre alive he added impatiently remembering now there are some urgent lets go to my office she said her office was like a historical reconstruction restored and maintained by eddie willers her map her calendar the picture of nat taggart were on the walls and no trace was left of the clifton locey era i understand that i am still the operating vicepresident of this railroad she asked sitting down at her desk you are said taggart hastily accusingly almost defiantly you certainly areand dont you forget ityou havent quit youre still have you no i havent quit now the most urgent thing to do is to tell that to the press tell them that youre back on the job and where you were andand by the way where were you eddie she said will you make a note on this and send it to the press my plane developed engine trouble while i was flying over the rocky mountains to the taggart tunnel i lost my way looking for an emergency landing and crashed in an uninhabited mountain sectionof wyoming i was found by an old sheepherder and his wife who took me to their cabin deep in the wilderness fifty miles away from the nearest settlement i was badly injured and remained unconscious for most of two weeks the old couple had no telephone no radio no means of communication or transportation except an old truck that broke down when they attempted to use it i had to remain with them until i recovered sufficient strength to walk i walked the fifty miles to the foothills then hitchhiked my way to a taggart station in nebraska i see said taggart well thats fine now when you give the press interview im not going to give any press interviews what but theyve been calling me all day theyre waiting its essential he had an air of panic its most crucially essential whos been calling you all day people in washington and and others theyre waiting for your statement she pointed at eddies notes theres my statement but thats not enough you must say that you havent quit thats obvious isnt it im back you must say something about it such as what something personal to whom to the country people were worried about you you must reassure them the story will reassure them if anyone was worried about me thats not what i mean well what do you mean i mean he stopped his eyes avoiding hers i mean he sat searching for words cracking his knuckles jim was going to pieces she thought the jerky impatience the shrillness the aura of panic were new crude outbreaks of a tone of ineffectual menace had replaced his pose of cautious smoothness i mean he was searching for words to name his meaning without naming it she thought to make her understand that which he did not want to be understood i mean the public i know what you mean she said no jim im not going to reassure the public about the state of our industry now youre the public had better be as unreassured as it has the wits to be now proceed to business i proceed to business jim he glanced at mr meigs mr meigs sat silently his legs crossed smoking a cigarette he wore a jacket which was not but looked like a military uniform the flesh of his neck bulged over the collar and the flesh of his body strained against the narrow waistline intended to disguise it he wore a ring with a large yellow diamond that flashed when he moved his stubby fingers youve met mr meigs said taggart im so glad that the two of you will get along well together he made an expectant halfpause but received no answer from either mr meigs is the representative of the railroad unification plan youll have many opportunities to cooperate with him what is the railroad unification plan it is a a new national setup that went into effect three weeks ago which you will appreciate and approve of and find extremely practical she marveled at the futility of his method he was acting as if by naming her opinion in advance he would make her unable to alter it it is an emergency setup which has saved the countrys transportation system what is the plan you realize of course the insurmountable difficulties of any sort of construction job during this period of emergency it istemporarilyimpossible to lay new track therefore the countrys top problem is to preserve the transportation industry as a whole to preserve its existing plant and all of its existing facilities the national survival requires what is the plan as a policy of national survival the railroads of the country have been unified into a single team pooling their resources all of their gross revenue is turned over to the railroad pool board in washington which acts as trustee for the industry as a whole and divides the total income among the various railroads according to a a more modern principle of distribution what principle now dont worry property rights have been fully preserved and protected theyve merely been given a new form every railroad retains independent responsibility for its own operations its train schedules and the maintenance of its track and equipment as its contribution to the national pool every railroad permits any other when conditions so require to use its track and facilities without charge at the end of the year the pool board distributes the total gross income and every individual railroad is paid not on the haphazard oldfashioned basis of the number of trains run or the tonnage of freight carried but on the basis of its needthat is the preservation of its track being its main need every individual railroad is paid according to the mileage of the track which it owns and maintains she heard the words she understood the meaning she was unable to make it realto grant the respect of anger concern opposition to a nightmare piece of insanity that rested on nothing but peoples willingness to pretend to believe that it was sane she felt a numbed emptiness and the sense of being thrown far below the realm where moral indignation is pertinent whose track are we using for our transcontinental traffic she asked her voice flat and dry why our own of course said taggart hastily that is from new york to bedford illinois we run our trains out of bedford on the track of the atlantic southern to san francisco well its much faster than that long detour you tried to establish we run our trains without charge for the use of the track besides your detour couldnt have lasted the kansas western rail was shot and besides without charge for the use of the atlantic southern track well were not charging them for the use of our mississippi bridge either after a moment she asked have you looked at a map sure said meigs unexpectedly you own the largest track mileage of any railroad in the country so youve got nothing to worry about eddie willers burst out laughing meigs glanced at him blankly whats the matter with you he asked nothing said eddie wearily nothing mr meigs she said if you look at a map you will see that two thirds of the cost of maintaining a track for our transcontinental traffic is given to us free and is paid by our competitor why sure he said but his eyes narrowed watching her suspiciously as if he were wondering what motive prompted her to so explicit a statement while were paid for owning miles of useless track which carries no traffic she said meigs understoodand leaned back as if he had lost all further interest in the discussion thats not true snapped taggart were running a great number of local trains to serve the region of our former transcontinental linethrough iowa nebraska and coloradoand on the other side of the tunnel through california nevada and utah were running two locals a day said eddie willers in the dry blankly innocent tone of a business report fewer some places what determines the number of trains which any given railroad is obligated to run she asked the public welfare said taggart the pool board said eddie how many trains have been discontinued in the country in the past three weeks as a matter of fact said taggart eagerly the plan has helped to harmonize the industry and to eliminate cutthroat competition it has eliminated thirty per cent of the trains run inthe country said eddie the only competition left is in the applications to the board for permission to cancel trains the railroad to survive will be the one that manages to run no trains at all has anybody calculated how long the atlantic southern is expected to be able to remain in business thats no skin off your started meigs please cuffy cried taggart the president of the atlantic southern said eddie impassively has committed suicide that had nothing to do with this yelled taggart it was over a personal matter she remained silent she sat looking at their faces there was still an element of wonder in the numbed indifference of her mind jim had always managed to switch the weight of his failures upon the strongest plants around him and to survive by destroying them to pay for his errors as he had done with dan conway as he had done with the industries of colorado but this did not have even the rationality of a looterthis pouncing upon the drained carcass of a weaker a half bankrupt competitor for a moments delay with nothing but a cracking bone between the pouncer and the abyss the impulse of the habit of reason almost pushed her to speak to argue to demonstrate the selfevidentbut she looked at their faces and she saw that they knew it in some terms different from hers in some inconceivable manner of consciousness they knew all that she could tell them it was useless to prove to them the irrational horror of their course and of its consequences both meigs and taggart knew itand the secret of their consciousness was the means by which they escaped the finality of their knowledge i see she said quietly well what would you rather have had me do screamed taggart give up our transcontinental traffic go bankrupt turn the railroad into a miserable east coast local her two words seemed to have hit him worse than any indignant objection he seemed to be shaking with terror at that which the quiet i see had acknowledged seeing i couldnt help it we had to have a transcontinental track there was no way to get around the tunnel we had no money to pay for any extra costs something had to be done we had to have a track meigs was looking at him with a glance of partastonishment part disgust i am not arguing jim she said dryly we couldnt permit a railroad like taggart transcontinental to crash it would have been a national catastrophe we had to think of all the cities and industries and shippers and passengers and employees and stockholders whose lives depend on us it wasnt just for ourselves it was for the public welfare everybody agrees that the railroad unification plan is practical the bestinformed jim she said if you have any further business to discuss with me discuss it youve never considered the social angle of anything he said in a sullen retreating voice she noticed that this form of pretense was as unreal to mr meigs as it was to her though for an antipodal reason he was looking at jim with bored contempt jim appeared to her suddenly as a man who had tried to find a middle course between two polesmeigs and herself and who was now seeing that his course was narrowing and that he was to be ground between two straight walls mr meigs she asked prompted by a touch of bitterly amused curiosity what is your economic plan for day after tomorrow she saw his bleary brown eyes focus upon her without expression youre impractical he said its perfectly useless to theorize about the future snapped taggart when we have to take care of the emergency of the moment in the long run in the long run well all be dead said meigs then abruptly he shot to his feet ill run along jim he said ive got no time to waste on conversations he added you talk to her about that matter of doing something to stop all those train wrecksif shes the little girl whos such a wizard at railroading it was said inoffensively he was a man who would not know when he was giving offense or taking it ill see you later cuffy said taggart as meigs walked out with no parting glance at any of them taggart looked at her expectantly and fearfully as if dreading her comment yet desperately hoping to hear some word any word well she asked what do you mean have you anything else to discuss well i he sounded disappointed yes he cried in the tone of a desperate plunge i have another matter to discuss the most important one of all the your growing number of train wrecks no not that what then its that youre going to appear on bertram scudders radio program tonight she leaned back am i dagny its imperative its crucial theres nothing to be done about it to refuse is out of the question in times like these one has no choice and she glanced at her watch ill give you three minutes to explainif you want to be heard at all and youd better speak straight all right he said desperately its considered most importanton the highest levels i mean chick morrison and wesley mouch and mr thompson as high as thatthat you should make a speech to the nation a moralebuilding speech you know saying that you havent quit why because everybody thought you had you dont know whats been going on lately but but its sort of uncanny the country is full of rumors all sorts of rumors about everything all of them dangerous disruptive i mean people seem to do nothing but whisper they dont believe the newspapers they dont believe the best speakers they believe every vicious scaremongering piece of gossip that comes floating around theres no confidence left no faith no order no no respect for authority people people seem to be on the verge of panic well well for one thing its that damnable business of all those big industrialists whove vanished into thin air nobodys been able to explain it and its giving them the jitters theres all sorts of hysterical stuff being whispered about it but what they whisper mostly is that no decent man will work for those people they mean the people in washington now do you see you wouldnt suspect that you were so famous but you are or youve become ever since your plane crash nobody believed the plane crash they all thought you had broken the law that is directive and deserted theres a lot of popular misunderstanding of directive a lot of well unrest now you see how important it is that you go on the air and tell people that it isnt true that directive is destroying industry that its a sound piece of legislation devised for everybodys good and that if theyll just be patient a little longer things will improve and prosperity will return they dont believe any public official any more you youre an industrialist one of the few left of the old school and the only one whos ever come back after they thought youd gone youre known as as a reactionary whos opposed to washington policies so the people will believe you it would have a great influence on them it would buttress their confidence it would help their morale now do you see he had rushed on encouraged by the odd look of her face a look of contemplation that was almost a faint halfsmile she had listened hearing through his words the sound of reardens voice saying to her on a spring evening over a year ago they need some sort of sanction from us i dont know the nature of that sanction but dagny i know that if we value our lives we must not give it to them if they put you on a torture rack dont give it to them let them destroy your railroad and my mills but dont give it to them now do you see oh yes jim i see he could not interpret the sound of her voice it was low it was partmoan partchuckle parttriumphbut it was the first sound of emotion to come from her and he plunged on with no choice but to hope i promised them in washington that youd speak we cant fail themnot in an issue of this kind we cant afford to be suspected of disloyalty its alt arranged youll be the guest speaker on bertram scudders program tonight at tenthirty hes got a radio program where he interviews prominent public figures its a national hookup he has a large following he reaches over twenty million people the office of the morale conditioner has the what the morale conditionerthats chick morrisonhas called me three times to make sure that nothing would go wrong theyve issued orders to all the news broadcasters whove been announcing it all day all over the country telling people to listen to you tonight on bertram scudders hour he looked at her as if he were demanding both an answer and the recognition that her answer was the element of least importance in these circumstances she said you know what i think of the washington policies and of directive at a time like this we cant afford the luxury of thinking she laughed aloud but dont you see that you cant refuse them now he yelled if you dont appear after all those announcements it will support the rumors it will amount to an open declaration of disloyalty the trap wont work jim what trap the one youre always setting up i dont know what you mean yes you do you knewall of you knew itthat i would refuse so you pushed me into a public trap where my refusal would become an embarrassing scandal for you more embarrassing than you thought id dare to cause you were counting on me to save your faces and the necks you stuck out i wont save them but i promised it i didnt but we cant refuse them dont you see that theyve got us hogtied that theyre holding us by the throat dont you know what they can do to us through this railroad pool or through the unification board or through the moratorium on our bonds i knew that two years ago he was shaking there was some formless desperate almost superstitious quality in his terror out of proportion to the dangers he named she felt suddenly certain that it came from something deeper than his fear of bureaucratic reprisal that the reprisal was the only identification of it which he would permit himself to know a reassuring identification which had a semblance of rationality and hid his true motive she felt certain that it was not the countrys panic he wanted to stave off but his ownthat he and chick morrison and wesley mouch and all the rest of the looting crew needed her sanction not to reassure their victims but to reassure themselves though the allegedly crafty the allegedly practical idea of deluding their victims was the only identification they gave to their own motive and their hysterical insistence with an awed contemptawed by the enormity of the sightshe wondered what inner degradation those men had to reach in order to arrive at a level of selfdeception where they would seek the extorted approval of an unwilling victim as the moral sanction they needed they who thought that they were merely deceiving the world we have no choice he cried nobody has any choice get out of here she said her voice very quiet and low some tonal quality in the sound of her voice struck the note of the unconfessed within him as ft never allowing it into words he knew from what knowledge that sound had come he got out she glanced at eddie he looked like a man worn by fighting one more of the attacks of disgust which he was learning to endure as a chronic condition after a moment he asked dagny what became of quentin daniels you were flying after him werent you yes she said hes gone to the destroyer the word hit her like a physical blow it was the first touch of the outer world upon that radiant presence which she had kept within her all day as a silent changeless vision a private vision not to be affected by any of the things around her not to be thought about only to be felt as the source of her strength the destroyer she realized was the name of that vision here in their world yes she said dully with effort to the destroyer then she closed her hands over the edge of the desk to steady her purpose and her posture and said with the bitter hint of a smile well eddie lets see what two impractical persons like you and me can do about preventing the tram wrecks it was two hours laterwhen she was alone at her desk bent over sheets of paper that bore nothing but figures yet were like a motion picture film unrolling to tell her the whole story of the railroad in the past four weeksthat the buzzer rang and her secretarys voice said mrs rearden to see you miss taggart mr rearden she asked incredulously unable to believe either no mrs rearden she let a moment pass then said please ask her to come in there was some peculiar touch of emphasis in lillian reardens bearing when she entered and walked toward the desk she wore a tailored suit with a loose bright bow hanging casually sidewise for a note of elegant incongruity and a small hat tilted at an angle considered smart by virtue of being considered amusing her face was a shade too smooth her steps a shade too slow and she walked almost as if she were swinging her hips how do you do miss taggart she said in a lazily gracious voice a drawingroom voice which seemed to strike in that office the same style of incongruity as her suit and her bow dagny inclined her head gravely lillian glanced about the office her glance had the same style of amusement as her hat an amusement purporting to express maturity by the conviction that life could be nothing but ridiculous please sit down said dagny lillian sat down relaxing into a confident gracefully casual posture when she turned her face to dagny the amusement was still there but its shading was now different it seemed to suggest that they shared a secret which would make her presence here seem preposterous to the world but selfevidently logical to the two of them she stressed it by remaining silent what can i do for you i came to tell you said lillian pleasantly that you will appear on bertram scudders broadcast tonight she detected no astonishment in dagnys face no shock only the glance of an engineer studying a motor that makes an irregular sound i assume said dagny that you are fully aware of the form of your sentence oh yes said lillian then proceed to support it i beg your pardon proceed to tell me lillian gave a brief little laugh its forced brevity betraying that this was not quite the attitude she had expected i am sure that no lengthy explanations will be necessary she said you know why your appearance on that broadcast is important to those in power i know why you have refused to appear i know your convictions on the subject you may have attached no importance to it but you do know that my sympathy has always been on the side of the system now in power therefore you will understand my interest in the issue and my place in it when your brother told me that you had refused i decided to take a hand in the matterbecause you see i am one of the very few who know that you are not in a position to refuse i am not one of those few as yet said dagny lillian smiled well yes i must explain a little further you realize that your radio appearance will have the same value for those in power asas the action of my husband when he signed the gift certificate that turned rearden metal over to them you know how frequently and how usefully they have been mentioning it in all of their propaganda i didnt know that said dagny sharply oh of course you have been away for most of the last two months so you might have missed the constant remindersin the press on the radio in public speechesthat even hank rearden approves of and supports directive since he has voluntarily signed his metal over to the nation even hank rearden that discourages a great many recalcitrants and helps to keep them in line she leaned back and asked in the tone of a casual aside have you ever asked him why he signed dagny did not answer she did not seem to hear that it was a question she sat still and her face was expressionless but her eyes seemed too large and they were fixed on lillians as if she were now intent upon nothing but hearing lillian to the end no i didnt think you knew it i didnt think that he would ever tell you said lillian her voice smoother as if recognizing the signposts and sliding comfortably down the anticipated course yet you must learn the reason that made him signbecause it is the same reason that will make you appear on bertram scudders broadcast tonight she paused wishing to be urged dagny waited it is a reason said lillian which should please youas far as my husbands action is concerned consider what that signature meant to him rearden metal was his greatest achievement the summation of the best in his life the final symbol of his prideand my husband as you have reason to know is an extremely passionate man his pride in himself being perhaps his greatest passion rearden metal was more than an achievement to him it was the symbol of his ability to achieve of his independence of his struggle of his rise it was his property his by rightand you know what rights mean to a man as strict as he and what property means to a man as possessive he would have gladly died to defend it rather than surrender it to the men he despised this is what it meant to himand this is what he gave up you will be glad to know that he gave it up for your sake miss taggart for the sake of your reputation and your honor he signed the gift certificate surrendering rearden metalunder the threat that the adultery he was carrying on with you would be exposed to the eyes of the world oh yes we had full proof of it in every intimate detail i believe that you hold a philosophy which disapproves of sacrificebut in this case you are most certainly a woman so im sure that you will feel gratification at the magnitude of the sacrifice a man has made for the privilege of using your body you have undoubtedly taken great pleasure in the nights which he spent in your bed you may now take pleasure in the knowledge of what those nights have cost him and sinceyou like bluntness dont you miss taggartsince your chosen status is that of a whore i take my hat off to you in regard to the price you exacted which none of your sisters could ever have hoped to match lillians voice had kept growing reluctantly sharper like a drill head that kept breaking by being unable to find the line of the fault in the stone dagny was still looking at her but the intensity had vanished from dagnys eyes and posture lillian wondered why she felt as if dagnys face were hit by a spotlight she could detect no particular expression it was simply a face in natural reposeand the clarity seemed to come from its structure from the precision of its sharp planes the firmness of the mouth the steadiness of the eyes she could not decipher the expression of the eyes it seemed incongruous it resembled the calm not of a woman but of a scholar it had that peculiar luminous quality which is the fearlessness of satisfied knowledge it was i said lillian softly who informed the bureaucrats about my husbands adultery dagny noticed the first flicker of feeling in lillians lifeless eyes it resembled pleasure but so distantly that it looked like sunlight reflected from the dead surface of the moon to the stagnant water of a swamp it flickered for an instant and went it was i said lillian who took rearden metal away from him it sounded almost like a plea it was not within the power of dagnys consciousness ever to understand that plea or to know what response lillian had hoped to find she knew only that she had not found it when she heard the sudden shrillness of lillians voice have you understood me yes then you know what i demand and why youll obey me you thought you were invincible you and he didnt you the voice was attempting smoothness but it was jerking unevenly you have always acted on no will but your owna luxury i have not been able to afford for once and in compensation i will see you acting on mine you cant fight me you cant buy your way out of it with those dollars which youre able to make and im not theres no profit you can offer meim devoid of greed im not paid by the bureaucrats for doing thisi am doing it without gain without gain do you understand me yes then no further explanations are necessary only the reminder that all the factual evidencehotel registers jewelry bills and stuff like thatis still in the possession of the right persons and will be broadcast on every radio program tomorrow unless you appear on one radio program tonight is this clear yes now what is your answer she saw the luminous scholareyes looking at her and suddenly she felt as if too much of her were seen and as if she were not seen at all i am glad that you have told me said dagny i will appear on bertram scudders broadcast tonight there was a beam of white light beating down upon the glittering metal of a microphonein the center of a glass cage imprisoning her with bertram scudder the spark of glitter were greenishblue the microphone was made of rearden metal above them beyond a sheet of glass she could distinguish a booth with two rows of faces looking down at her the lax anxious face of james taggart with lillian rearden beside him her hand resting reassuringly on his arma man who had arrived by plane from washington and had been introduced to her as chick morrisonand a group of young men from his staff who talked about percentage curves of intellectual influence and acted like motorcycle cops bertram scudder seemed to be afraid of her he clung to the microphone spitting words into its delicate mesh into the ears of the country introducing the subject of his program he was laboring to sound cynical skeptical superior and hysterical together to sound like a man who sneers at the vanity of all human beliefs and thereby demands an instantaneous belief from his listeners a small patch of moisture glistened on the back of his neck he was describing in over colored detail her month of convalescence in the lonely cabin of a sheepherder then her heroic trudging down fifty miles of mountain trails for the sake of resuming her duties to the people in this grave hour of national emergency and if any of you have been deceived by vicious rumors aimed to undermine your faith in the great social program of our leadersyou may trust the word of miss taggart who she stood looking up at the white beam specks of dust were whirling in the beam and she noticed that one of them was alive it was a gnat with a tiny sparkle in place of its beating wings it was struggling for some frantic purpose of its own and she watched it feeling as distant from its purpose as from that of the world miss taggart is an impartial observer a brilliant businesswoman who has often been critical of the government in the past and who may be said to represent the extreme conservative viewpoint held by such giants of industry as hank rearden yet even she she wondered at how easy it felt when one did not have to feel she seemed to be standing naked on public display and a beam of light was enough to support her because there was no weight of pain in her no hope no regret no concern no future and now ladies and gentlemen i will present to you the heroine of this night our most uncommon guest the pain came back to her in a sudden piercing stab like a long splinter from the glass of a protective wall shattered by the knowledge that the next words would be hers it came back for the brief length of a name in her mind the name of the man she had called the destroyer she did not want him to hear what she would now have to say if you hear itthe pain was like a voice crying it to himyou wont believe the things i have said to youno worse the things which i have not said but which you knew and believed and accepted you will think that i was not free to offer them and that my days with you were a liethis will destroy my one month and ten of your yearsthis was not the way i wanted you to learn it not like this not tonight but you will you whove watched and known my every movement you whore watching me now wherever you areyou will hear itbut it has to be said the last descendant of an illustrious name in our industrial history the woman executive possible only in america the operating vicepresident of a great railroadmiss dagny taggart then she felt the touch of rearden metal as her hand closed over the stem of the microphone and it was suddenly easy not with the drugged ease of indifference but with the bright clear living ease of action i came here to tell you about the social program the political system and the moral philosophy under which you are now living there was so calm so natural so total a certainty in the sound of her voice that the mere sound seemed to carry an immense persuasiveness you have heard it said that i believe that this system has depravity as its motive plunder as its goal lies fraud and force as its method and destruction as its only result you have also heard it said that like hank rearden i am a loyal supporter of this system and that i give my voluntary cooperation to present policies such as directive have come here to tell you the truth about it it is true that i share the stand of hank rearden his political convictions are mine you have heard him denounced in the past as a reactionary who opposed every step measure slogan and premise of the present system now you hear him praised as our greatest industrialist whose judgment on the value of economic policies may safely be trusted it is true you may trust his judgment if you are now beginning to fear that you are in the power of an irresponsible evil that the country is collapsing and that you will soon be left to starveconsider the views of our ablest industrialist who knows what conditions are necessary to make production possible and to permit a country to survive consider all that you know about his views at such times as he was able to speak you have heard him tell you that this governments policies were leading you to enslavement and destruction yet he did not denounce the final climax of these policiesdirective you have heard him fighting for his rightshis and yoursfor his independence for his property yet he did not fight directive he signed voluntarily so you have been told the gift certificate that surrendered rearden metal to his enemies he signed the one paper which by all of his previous record you had expected him to fight to the death what could this meanyou have constantly been toldunless it meant that even he recognized the necessity of directive and sacrificed his personal interests for the sake of the country judge his views by the motive of that action you have constantly been told and with this i agree unreservedly judge his views by the motive of that action andfor whatever value you attach to my opinion and to any warning i may give youjudge my views also by the motive of that action because his convictions are mine for two years i had been hank reardens mistress let there be no misunderstanding about it i am saying this not as a shameful confession but with the highest sense of pride i had been his mistress i had slept with him in his bed in his arms there is nothing anyone might now say to you about me which i will not tell you first it will be useless to defame mei know the nature of the accusations and i will state them to you myself did i feel a physical desire for him i did was i moved by a passion of my body i was have i experienced the most violent form of sensual pleasure i have if this now makes me a disgraced woman in your eyeslet your estimate be your own concern i will stand on mine bertram scudder was staring at her this was not the speech he had expected and he felt in dim panic that it was not proper to let it continue but she was the special guest whom the washington rulers had ordered him to treat cautiously he could not be certain whether he was now supposed to interrupt her or not besides he enjoyed hearing this sort of story in the audience booth james taggart and lillian rearden sat frozen like animals paralyzed by the headlight of a train rushing down upon them they were the only ones present who knew the connection between the words they were hearing and the theme of the broadcast it was too late for them to move they dared not assume the responsibility of a movement or of whatever was to follow in the control room a young intellectual of chick morrisons staff stood ready to cut the broadcast off the air in case of trouble but he saw no political significance in the speech he was hearing no element he could construe as dangerous to his masters he was accustomed to hearing speeches extorted by unknown pressure from unwilling victims and he concluded that this was the case of a reactionary forced to confess a scandal and that therefore the speech had perhaps some political value besides he was curious to hear it i am proud that he had chosen me to give him pleasure and that it was he who had been my choice it was notas it is for most of youan act of casual indulgence and mutual contempt it was the ultimate form of our admiration for each other with full knowledge of the values by which we made our choice we are those who do not disconnect the values of their minds from the actions of their bodies those who do not leave their values to empty dreams but bring them into existence those who give material form to thoughts and reality to valuesthose who make steel railroads and happiness and to such among you who hate the thought of human joy who wish to see mens life as chronic suffering and failure who wish men to apologize for happinessor for success or ability or achievement or wealthto such among you i am now saying i wanted him i had him i was happy i had known joy a pure full guiltless joy the joy you dread to hear confessed by any human being the joy of which your only knowledge is in your hatred for those who are worthy of reaching it well hate me thenbecause i reached it miss taggart said bertram scudder nervously arent we departing from the subject of after all your personal relationship with mr rearden has no political significance which didnt think it had either and of course i came here to tell you about the political and moral system under which you are now living well i thought that i knew everything about hank rearden but there was one thing which i did not learn until today it was the blackmail threat that our relationship would be made public that forced hank rearden to sign the gift certificate surrendering rearden metal it was blackmailblackmail by your government officials by your rulers by your in the instant when scudders hand swept out to knock the microphone over a faint click came from its throat as it crashed to the floor signifying that the intellectual cop had cut the broadcast off the air she laughedbut there was no one to see her and to hear the nature of her laughter the figures rushing into the glass enclosure were screaming at one another chick morrison was yelling unprintable curses at bertram scudderbertram scudder was shouting that he had been opposed to the whole idea but had been ordered to do itjames taggart looked like an animal baring its teeth while he snarled at two of morrisons youngest assistants and avoided the snarls of an older third the muscles of lillian reardens face had an odd slackness like the limbs of an animal lying in the road intact but dead the morale conditioners were shrieking what they guessed they thought mr mouch would think what am i to say to them the program announcer was crying pointing at the microphone mr morrison theres an audience waiting what am i to say nobody answered him they were not fighting over what to do but over whom to blame nobody said a word to dagny or glanced in her direction nobody stopped her when she walked out she stepped into the first taxicab in sight giving the address of her apartment as the cab started she noticed that the dial of the radio on the drivers panel was lighted and silent crackling with the brief tense coughs of static it was tuned to bertram scudders program she lay back against the seat feeling nothing but the desolation of the knowledge that the sweep of her action had perhaps swept away the man who might never wish to see her again she felt for the first time the immensity of the hopelessness of finding himif he did not choose to be foundin the streets of the city in the towns of a continent in the canyons of the rocky mountains where the goal was closed by a screen of rays but one thing remained to her like a log floating on a void the log to which she had clung through the broadcastand she knew that this was the thing she could not abandon even were she to lose all the rest it was the sound of his voice saying to her nobody stays here by faking reality in any manner whatever ladies and gentlemen the voice of bertram scudders announcer crackled suddenly out of the static due to technical difficulties over which we have no control this station will remain off the air pending the necessary readjustments the taxi driver gave a brief contemptuous chuckleand snapped the radio off when she stepped out and handed him a bill he extended the change to her and suddenly leaned forward for a closer look at her face she felt certain that he recognized her and she held his glance austerely for an instant his bitter face and his over patched shirt were worn out by a hopeless losing struggle as she handed him a tip he said quietly with too earnest too solemn an emphasis for a mere acknowledgment of the corns thank you maam she turned swiftly and hurried into the building not to let him see the emotion which was suddenly more than she could bear her head was drooping as she unlocked the door of her apartment and the light struck her from below from the carpet before she jerked her head up in astonishment at finding the apartment lighted she took a step forwardand saw hank rearden standing across the room she was held still by two shocks one was the sight of his presence she had not expected him to be back so soon the other was the sight of his face his face had so firm so confident so mature a look of calm in the faint halfsmile in the clarity of the eyes that she felt as if he had aged decades within one month but aged in the proper sense of human growth aged in vision in stature in power she felt that he who had lived through a month of agony he whom she had hurt so deeply and was about to hurt more deeply still he would now be the one to give her support and consolation his would be the strength to protect them both she stood motionless for only an instant but she saw his smile deepening as if he were reading her thoughts and telling her that she had nothing to fear she heard a slight crackling sound and saw on a table beside him the lighted dial of a silent radio her eyes moved to his as a question and he answered by the faintest nod barely more than a lowering of his eyelids he had heard her broadcast they moved toward each other in the same moment he seized her shoulders to support her her face was raised to his but he did not touch her lips he took her hand and kissed her wrist her fingers her palm as the sole form of the greeting which so much of his suffering had gone to await and suddenly broken by the whole of this day and of that month she was sobbing in his arms slumped against him sobbing as she had never done in her life as a woman in surrender to pain and in a last futile protest against it holding her so that she stood and moved only by means of his body not hers he led her to the couch and tried to make her sit down beside him but she slipped to the floor to sit at his feet and bury her face in his knees and sob without defense or disguise he did not lift her he let her cry with his arm tight about her she felt his hand on her head on her shoulder she felt the protection of his firmness a firmness which seemed to tell her that as her tears were for both of them so was his knowledge that he knew her pain and felt it and understood yet was able to witness it calmlyand his calm seemed to lift her burden by granting her the right to break here at his feet by telling her that he was able to carry what she could not carry any longer she knew dimly that this was the real hank rearden and no matter what form of insulting cruelty he had once given to their first nights together no matter how often she had seemed as the stronger of the two this had always been within him and at the root of their bondthis strength of his which would protect her if ever hers were gone when she raised her head he was smiling down at her hank she whispered guiltily in desperate astonishment at her own break quiet darling she let her face drop back on his knees she lay still fighting for rest fighting against the pressure of a wordless thought he had been able to bear and to accept her broadcast only as a confession of her love it made the truth she now had to tell him more inhuman a blow than anyone had the right to deliver she felt terror at the thought that she would not have the strength to do it and terror at the thought that she would when she looked up at him again he ran his hand over her forehead brushing the hair o her face its over darling he said the worst of it is over for both of us no hank it isnt he smiled he drew her to sit beside him with her head on his shoulder dont say anything now he said you know that we both understand all that has to be said and well speak of it but not until it has ceased to hurt you quite so much his hand moved down the line of her sleeve down a fold of her skirt with so light a pressure that it seemed as if the hand did not feel the body inside the clothes as if he were regaining possession not of her body but only of its vision youve taken too much he said so have i let them batter us theres no reason why we should add to it no matter what we have to face there can be no suffering between the two of us no added pain let that come from their world it wont come from us dont be afraid we wont hurt each other not now she raised her head shaking it with a bitter smilethere was a desperate violence in her movement but the smile was a sign of recovery of the determination to face the despair hank the kind of hell i let you go through in the last month her voice was trembling its nothing compared to the kind of hell i let you go through in the last hour his voice was steady she got up to pace the room to prove her strengthher steps like words telling him that she was not to be spared any longer when she stopped and turned to face him he rose as if he understood her motive i know that ive made it worse for you she said pointing at the radio he shook his head no hank theres something i have to tell you so have i will you let me speak first you see its something i should have said to you long ago will you let me speak and not answer me until i finish she nodded he took a moment to look at her as she stood before him as if to hold the full sight of her figure of this moment and of everything that had led them to it i love you dagny he said quietly with the simplicity of an unclouded yet unsmiling happiness she was about to speak but knew that she couldnt even if he had permitted it she caught her unuttered words the movement of her lips was her only answer then she inclined her head in acceptance i love you as the same value as the same expression with the same pride and the same meaning as i love my work my mills my metal my hours at a desk at a furnace in a laboratory in an ore mine as i love my ability to work as i love the act of sight and knowledge as i love the action of my mind when it solves a chemical equation or grasps a sunrise as i love the things ive made and the things ive felt as my product as my choice as a shape of my world as my best mirror as the wife ive never had as that which makes all the rest of it possible as my power to live she did not drop her face but kept it level and open to hear and accept as he wanted her to and as he deserved i loved you from the first day i saw you on a flatcar on a siding of milford station i loved you when we rode in the cab of the first engine on the john galt line i loved you on the gallery of ellis wyatts house i loved you on that next morning you knew it but its i who must say it to you as im saying it nowif i am to redeem all those days and to let them be fully what they were for both of us i loved you you knew it i didnt and because i didnt i had to learn it when i sat at my desk and looked at the gift certificate for rearden metal she closed her eyes but there was no suffering in his face nothing but the immense and quiet happiness of clarity we are those who do not disconnect the values of their minds from the actions of their bodies you said it in your broadcast tonight but you knew it then on that morning in ellis wyatts house you knew that all those insults i was throwing at you were the fullest confession of love a man could make you knew that the physical desire i was damning as our mutual shame is neither physical nor an expression of ones body but the expression of ones minds deepest values whether one has the courage to know it or not that was why you laughed at me as you did wasnt it yes she whispered you said i do not want your mind your will your being or your soulso long as its to me that you will come for that lowest one of your desires you knew when you said it that it was my mind my will my being and my soul that i was giving you by means of that desire and i want to say it now to let that morning mean what it meant my mind my will my being and my soul dagnyyours for as long as i shall live he was looking straight at her and she saw a brief sparkle in his eyes which was not a smile but almost as if he had heard the cry she had not uttered let me finish dearest i want you to know how fully i know what i am saying i who thought that i was fighting them i had accepted the worst of our enemies creedand that is what ive paid for ever since as i am paying now and as i must i had accepted the one tenet by which they destroy a man before hes started the killertenet the breach between his mind and body i had accepted it like most of their victims not knowing it not knowing even that the issue existed i rebelled against their creed of human impotence and i took pride in my ability to think to act to work for the satisfaction of my desires but i did not know that this was virtue i never identified it as a moral value as the highest of moral values to be defended above ones life because its that which makes life possible and i accepted punishment for it punishment for virtue at the hands of an arrogant evil made arrogant solely by my ignorance and my submission accepted their insults their frauds their extortions i thought i could afford to ignore themall those impotent mystics who prattle about their souls and are unable to build a roof over their heads i thought that the world was mine and that those jabbering incompetents were no threat to my strength i could not understand why i kept losing every battle i did not know that the force unleashed against me was my own while i was busy conquering matter i had surrendered to them the realm of the mind of thought of principle of law of values of morality i had accepted unwittingly and by default the tenet that ideas were of no consequence to ones existence to ones work to reality to this earthas if ideas were not the province of reason but of that mystic faith which i despised this was all they wanted me to concede it was enough i had surrendered that which all of their claptrap is designed to subvert and to destroy mans reason no they were not able to deal with matter to produce abundance to control this earth they did not have to they controlled me i who knew that wealth is only a means to an end created the means and let them prescribe my ends i who took pride in my ability to achieve the satisfaction of my desires let them prescribe the code of values by which i judged my desires i who shaped matter to serve my purpose was left with a pile of steel and gold but with my every purpose defeated my every desire betrayed my every attempt at happiness frustrated had cut myself in two as the mystics preached and i ran my business by one code of rules but my own life by another i rebelled against the looters attempt to set the price and value of my steelbut i let them set the moral values of my life i rebelled against demands for an unearned wealthbut i thought it was my duty to grant an unearned love to a wife i despised an unearned respect to a mother who hated me an unearned support to a brother who plotted for my destruction i rebelled against undeserved financial injurybut i accepted a life of undeserved pain i rebelled against the doctrine that my productive ability was guiltbut i accepted as guilt my capacity for happiness i rebelled against the creed that virtue is some disembodied unknowable of the spiritbut i damned you you my dearest one for the desire of your body and mine but if the body is evil then so are those who provide the means of its survival so is material wealth and those who produce itand if moral values are set in contradiction to our physical existence then its right that rewards should be unearned that virtue should consist of the undone that there should be no tie between achievement and profit that the inferior animals whore able to produce should serve those superior beings whose superiority in spirit consists of incompetence in the flesh if some man like hugh akston had told me when i started that by accepting the mystics theory of sex i was accepting the looters theory of economics i would have laughed in his face i would not laugh at him now now i see rearden steel being ruled by human scumi see the achievement of my life serving to enrich the worst of my enemiesand as to the only two persons i ever loved ive brought a deadly insult to one and public disgrace to the other i slapped the face of the man who was my friend my defender my teacher the man who set me free by helping me to learn what ive learned i loved him dagny he was the brother the son the comrade i never hadbut i knocked him out of my life because he would not help me to produce for the looters id give anything now to have him back but i own nothing to offer in such repayment and ill never see him again because its i wholl know that there is no way to deserve even the right to ask forgiveness but what ive done to you my dearest is still worse your speech and that you had to make itthats what ive brought upon the only woman i loved in payment for the only happiness ive known dont tell me that it was your choice from the first and that you accepted all consequences including tonightit does not redeem the fact that it was i who had no better choice to offer you and that the looters forced you to speak that you spoke to avenge me and set me freedoes not redeem the fact that it was i who made their tactics possible it was not then own convictions of sin and dishonor that they could use to disgrace youit was mine they merely carried out the things i believed and said in ellis wyatts house it was i who kept our love bidden as a guilty secretthey merely treated it for what it was by my own appraisal it was i who was willing to counterfeit reality for the sake of appearance in their eyesthey merely cashed in on the right i had given them people think that a liar gains a victory over his victim what ive learned is that a lie is an act of selfabdication because one surrenders ones reality to the person to whom one lies making that person ones master condemning oneself from then on to faking the sort of reality that persons view requires to be faked and if one gains the immediate purpose of the liethe price one pays is the destruction of that which the gain was intended to serve the man who lies to the world is the worlds slave from then on when i chose to hide my love for you to disavow it in public and live it as a lie i made it public propertyand the public has claimed it in a fitting sort of manner i had no way to avert it and no power to save you when i gave in to the looters when i signed their gift certificate to protect youi was still faking reality there was nothing else left open to meand dagny id rather have seen us both dead than permit them to do what they threatened but there are no white lies there is only the blackness of destruction and a white lie is the blackest of all i was still faking reality and it had the inexorable result instead of protection it brought you a more terrible kind of ordeal instead of saving your name it forced you to offer yourself for a public stoning and to throw the stones by your own hand i know that you were proud of the things you said and i was proud to hear youbut that was the pride we should have claimed two years ago no you did not make it worse for me you set me free you saved us both you redeemed our past i cant ask you to forgive me were far beyond such termsand the only atonement i can offer you is the fact that i am happy that i am happy my darling not that i suffer i am happy that i have seen the trutheven if my power of sight is all thats left to me now were i to surrender to pain and give up in futile regret that my own error has wrecked my pastthat would be the act of final treason the ultimate failure toward that truth i regret having failed but if my love of truth is left as my only possession then the greater the loss behind me the greater the pride i may take in the price i have paid for that love then the wreckage will not become a funereal mount above me but will serve as a height i have climbed to attain a wider field of vision my pride and my power of vision were all that i owned when i startedand whatever i achieved was achieved by means of them both are greater now now i have the knowledge of the superlative value i had missed of my right to be proud of my vision the rest is mine to reach and dagny the one thing i wanted as the first step of my future was to say that i love youas im saying it now i love you my dearest with that blindest passion of my body which comes from the clearest perception of my mindand my love for you is the only attainment of my past that will be left to me unchanged through all the years ahead i wanted to say it to you while i still had the right to say it and because i had not said it at our beginning this is the way i have to say itat the end now ill tell you what it was that you wanted to tell mebecause you see i know it and i accept somewhere within the past month you have met the man you love and if love means ones final irreplaceable choice then he is the only man youve ever loved yes her voice was halfgasp halfscream as under a physical blow with shock as her only awareness hankhow did you know it he smiled and pointed at the radio my darling you used nothing but the past tense oh her voice was now halfgasp halfmoan and she closed her eyes you never pronounced the one word you would have rightfully thrown at them were it otherwise you said i wanted him not i love him you told me on the phone today that you could have returned sooner no other reason would have made you leave me as you did only that one reason was valid and right she was leaning back a little as if fighting for balance to stand yet she was looking straight at him with a smile that did not part her lips but softened her eyes to a glance of admiration and her mouth to a shape of pain its true ive met the man i love and will always love ive seen him ive spoken to himbut hes a man whom i cant have whom i may never have and perhaps may never see again i think ive always known that you would find him i knew what you felt for me i knew how much it was but i knew that i was not your final choice what youll give him is not taken away from me its what ive never had i cant rebel against it what ive had means too much to meand that ive had it can never be changed do you want me to say it hank will you understand it if i say that ill always love you i think ive understood it before you did ive always seen you as you are now that greatness of yours which you are just beginning to allow yourself to knowive always known it and ive watched your struggle to discover it dont speak of atonement you have not hurt me your mistakes came from your magnificent integrity under the torture of an impossible codeand your fight against it did not bring me suffering it brought me the feeling ive found too seldom admiration if you will accept it it will always be yours what you meant to me can never be changed but the man i methe is the love i had wanted to reach long before i knew that he existed and i think he will remain beyond my reach but that i love him will be enough to keep me living he took her hand and pressed it to his lips then you know what i feel he said and why i am still happy looking up at his face she realized that for the first time he was what she had always thought him intended to be a man with an immense capacity for the enjoyment of existence the taut look of endurance of fiercely unadmitted pain was gone now in the midst of the wreckage and of his hardest hour his face had the serenity of pure strength it had the look she had seen in the faces of the men in the valley hank she whispered i dont think i can explain it but i feel that i have committed no treason either to you or to him you havent her eyes seemed abnormally alive in a face drained of color as if her consciousness remained untouched in a body broken by exhaustion he made her sit down and slipped his arm along the back of the couch not touching her yet holding her in a protective embrace now tell me he asked where were you i cant tell you that ive given my word never to reveal anything about it i can say only that its a place i found by accident when i crashed and i left it blindfoldedand i wouldnt be able to find it again couldnt you trace your way back to it i wont try and the man i wont look for him he remained there i dont know why did you leave him i cant tell you who is he her chuckle of desperate amusement was involuntary who is john galt he glanced at her astonishedbut realized that she was not joking so there is a john galt he asked slowly yes that slang phrase refers to him yes and it has some special meaning oh yes theres one thing i can tell you about him because i discovered it earlier without promise of secrecy he is the man who invented the motor we found oh he smiled as if he should have known it then he said softly with a glance that was almost compassion hes the destroyer isnt he he saw her look of shock and added no dont answer me if you cant i think i know where you were it was quentin daniels that you wanted to save from the destroyer and you were following daniels when you crashed werent you yes good god dagnydoes such a place really exist are they all alive is there im sorry dont answer she smiled it does exist he remained silent for a long time hank could you give up rearden steel no the answer was fiercely immediate but he added with the first sound of hopelessness in his voice not yet then he looked at her as if in the transition of his three words he had lived the course of her agony of the past month i see he said he ran his hand over her forehead with a gesture of understanding of compassion of an almost incredulous wonder what hell youve now undertaken to endure he said his voice low she nodded she slipped down to lie stretched her face on his knees he stroked her hair he said well fight the looters as long as we can i dont know what future is possible to us but well win or well learn that its hopeless until we do well fight for our world were all thats left of it she fell asleep lying there her hand clasping his her last awareness before she surrendered the responsibility of consciousness was the sense of an enormous void the void of a city and of a continent where she would never be able to find the man whom she had no right to seek chapter iv antilife james taggart reached into the pocket of his dinner jacket pulled out the first wad of paper he found which was a hundreddollar bill and dropped it into the beggars hand he noticed that the beggar pocketed the money in a manner as indifferent as his own thanks bud said the beggar contemptuously and walked away james taggart remained still in the middle of the sidewalk wondering what gave him a sense of shock and dread it was not the mans insolencehe had not sought any gratitude he had not been moved by pity his gesture had been automatic and meaningless it was that the beggar acted as if he would have been indifferent had he received a hundred dollars or a dime or failing to find any help whatever had seen himself dying of starvation within this night taggart shuddered and walked brusquely on the shudder serving to cut off the realization that the beggars mood matched his own the walls of the street around him had the stressed unnatural clarity of a summer twilight while an orange haze filled the channels of intersections and veiled the tiers of roofs leaving him on a shrinking remnant of ground the calendar in the sky seemed to stand insistently out of the haze yellow like a page of old parchment saying august nohe thought in answer to things he had not namedit was not true he felt fine thats why he wanted to do something tonight he could not admit to himself that his peculiar restlessness came from a desire to experience pleasure he could not admit that the particular pleasure he wanted was that of celebration because he could not admit what it was that he wanted to celebrate this had been a day of intense activity spent on words floating as vaguely as cotton yet achieving a purpose as precisely as an adding machine summing up to his full satisfaction but his purpose and the nature of his satisfaction had to be kept as carefully hidden from himself as they had been from others and his sudden craving for pleasure was a dangerous breach the day had started with a small luncheon in the hotel suite of a visiting argentinian legislator where a few people of various nationalities had talked at leisurely length about the climate of argentina its soil its resources the needs of its people the value of a dynamic progressive attitude toward the futureand had mentioned as the briefest topic of conversation that argentina would be declared a peoples state within two weeks it had been followed by a few cocktails at the home of orren boyle with only one unobtrusive gentleman from argentina sitting silently in a corner while two executives from washington and a few friends of unspecified positions had talked about national resources metallurgy mineralogy neighborly duties and the welfare of the globeand had mentioned that a loan of four billion dollars would be granted within three weeks to the peoples state of argentina and the peoples state of chile it had been followed by a small cocktail party in a private room of the bar built like a cellar on the roof of a skyscraper an informal party given by him james taggart for the directors of a recently formed company the interneighborly amity and development corporation of which orren boyle was president and a slender graceful overactive man from chile was treasurer a man whose name was senor mario martinez but whom taggart was tempted by some resemblance of spirit to call senor cuffy meigs here they had talked about golf horse races boat races automobiles and women it had not been necessary to mention since they all knew it that the interneighborly amity and development corporation had an exclusive contract to operate on a twentyyear managerial lease all the industrial properties of the peoples states of the southern hemisphere the last event of the day had been a large dinner reception at the home of senor rodrigo gonzales a diplomatic representative of chile no one had heard of senor gonzales a year ago but he had become famous for the parties he had given in the past six months ever since his arrival in new york his guests described him as a progressive businessman he had lost his propertyit was saidwhen chile becoming a peoples state had nationalized all properties except those belonging to citizens of backward nonpeoples countries such as argentina but he had adopted an enlightened attitude and had joined the new regime placing himself in the service of his country his home in new york occupied an entire floor of an exclusive residential hotel he had a fat blank face and the eyes of a killer watching him at tonights reception taggart had concluded that the man was impervious to any sort of feeling he looked as if a knife could slash unnoticed through his pendulous layers of fleshexcept that there was a lewd almost sexual relish in the way he rubbed his feet against the rich pile of his persian rugs or patted the polished arm of his chair or folded his lips about a cigar his wife the senora gonzales was a small attractive woman not as beautiful as she assumed but enjoying the reputation of a beauty by means of a violent nervous energy and an odd manner of loose warm cynical selfassertiveness that seemed to promise anything and to absolve anyone it was known that her particular brand of trading was her husbands chief asset in an age when one traded not goods but favorsand watching her among the guests taggart had found amusement in wondering what deals had been made what directives issued what industries destroyed in exchange for a few chance nights which most of those men had had no reason to seek and perhaps could no longer remember the party had bored him there had been only half a dozen persons for whose sake he had put in an appearance and it had not been necessary to speak to that halfdozen merely to be seen and to exchange a few glances dinner had been about to be served when he had heard what he had come to hear senor gonzales had mentionedthe smoke of his cigar weaving over the halfdozen men who had drifted toward his armchairthat by agreement with the future peoples state of argentina the properties of danconia copper would be nationalized by the peoples state of chile in less than a month on september it had all gone as taggart had expected the unexpected had come when on hearing those words he had felt an irresistible urge to escape he had felt incapable of enduring the boredom of the dinner as if some other form of activity were needed to greet the achievement of this night he had walked out into the summer twilight of the streets feeling as if he were both pursuing and pursued pursuing a pleasure which nothing could give him in celebration of a feeling which he dared not namepursued by the dread of discovering what motive had moved him through the planning of tonights achievement and what aspect of it now gave him this feverish sense of gratification he reminded himself that he would sell his danconia copper stock which had never rallied fully after its crash of last year and he would purchase shares of the interneighborly amity and development corporation as agreed with his friends which would bring him a fortune but the thought brought him nothing but boredom this was not the thing he wanted to celebrate he tried to force himself to enjoy it money he thought had been his motive money nothing worse wasnt that a normal motive a valid one wasnt that what they all were after the wyatts the reardens the danconias he jerked his head to stop it he felt as if his thoughts were slipping down a dangerous blind alley the end of which he must never permit himself to see nohe thought bleakly in reluctant admissionmoney meant nothing to him any longer he had thrown dollars about by the hundredsat that party he had given todayfor unfinished drinks for uneaten delicacies for unprovoked tips and unexpected whims for a long distance phone call to argentina because one of the guests had wanted to check the exact version of a smutty story he had started telling for the spur of any moment for the clammy stupor of knowing that it was easier to pay than to think youve got nothing to worry about under that railroad unification plan orren boyle had giggled to him drunkenly under the railroad unification plan a local railroad had gone bankrupt in north dakota abandoning the region to the fate of a blighted area the local banker had committed suicide first killing his wife and childrena freight train had been taken oil the schedule in tennessee leaving a local factory without transportation at a days notice the factory owners son had quit college and was now in jail awaiting execution for a murder committed with a gang of raidersa way station had been closed in kansas and the station agent who had wanted to be a scientist had given up his studies and become a dishwasherthat he james taggart might sit in a private barroom and pay for the alcohol pouring down orren boyles throat for the waiter who sponged boyles garments when he spilled his drink over his chest for the carpet burned by the cigarettes of an expimp from chile who did not want to take the trouble of reaching for an ashtray across a distance of three feet it was not the knowledge of his indifference to money that now gave him a shudder of dread it was the knowledge that he would be equally indifferent were he reduced to the state of the beggar there had been a time when he had felt some measure of guiltin no clearer a form than a touch of irritationat the thought that he shared the sin of greed which he spent his time denouncing now he was hit by the chill realization that in fact he had never been a hypocrite in full truth he had never cared for money this left another hole gaping open before him leading into another blind alley which he could not risk seeing i just want to do something tonighthe cried soundlessly to someone at large in protest and in demanding angerin protest against whatever it was that kept forcing these thoughts into his mindin anger at a universe where some malevolent power would not permit him to find enjoyment without the need to know what he wanted or why what do you wantsome enemy voice kept asking and he walked faster trying to escape it it seemed to him that his brain was a maze where a blind alley opened at every turn leading into a fog that hid an abyss it seemed to him that he was running while the small island of safety was shrinking and nothing but those alleys would soon be left it was like the remnant of clarity in the street around him with the haze rolling in to fill all exits why did it have to shrinkhe thought in panic this was the way he had lived all his lifekeeping his eyes stubbornly safely on the immediate pavement before him craftily avoiding the sight of his road of corners of distances of pinnacles he had never intended going anywhere he had wanted to be free of progression free of the yoke of a straight line he had never wanted his years to add up to any sumwhat had summed them upwhy had he reached some unchosen destination where one could no longer stand still or retreat look where youre going brother snarled some voice while an elbow pushed him backand he realized that he had collided with some large illsmelling figure and that he had been running he slowed his steps and admitted into his mind a recognition of the streets he had chosen in his random escape he had not wanted to know that he was going home to his wife that too was a fogbound alley but there was no other left to him he knewthe moment he saw cherryls silent poised figure as she rose at his entrance into her roomthat this was more dangerous than he had allowed himself to know and that he would not find what he wanted but danger to him was a signal to shut off his sight suspend his judgment and pursue an unaltered course on the unstated premise that the danger would remain unreal by the sovereign power of his wish not to see itlike a foghorn within him blowing not to sound a warning but to summon the fog why yes i did have an important business banquet to attend but i changed my mind i felt like having dinner with you tonight he said in the tone of a complimentbut a quiet i see was the only answer he obtained he felt irritation at her unastonished manner and her pale unrevealing face he felt irritation at the smooth efficiency with which she gave instructions to the servants then at finding himself in the candlelight of the dining room facing her across a perfectly appointed table with two crystal cups of fruit in silver bowls of ice between them it was her poise that irritated him most she was no longer an incongruous little freak dwarfed by the luxury of the residence which a famous artist had designed she matched it she sat at the table as if she were the kind of hostess that room had the right to demand she wore a tailored housecoat of russetcolored brocade that blended with the bronze of her hair the severe simplicity of its lines serving as her only ornament he would have preferred the jingling bracelets and rhinestone buckles of her past her eyes disturbed him as they had for months they were neither friendly nor hostile but watchful and questioning i closed a big deal today he said his tone part boastful part pleading a deal involving this whole continent and half a dozen governments he realized that the awe the admiration the eager curiosity he had expected belonged to the face of the little shop girl who had ceased to exist he saw none of it in the face of his wife even anger or hatred would have been preferable to her level attentive glance the glance was worse than accusing it was inquiring what deal jim what do you mean what deal why are you suspicious why do you have to start prying at once im sorry i didnt know it was confidential you dont have to answer me its not confidential he waited but she remained silent well arent you going to say anything why no she said it simply as if to please him so youre not interested at all but i thought you didnt want to discuss it oh dont be so tricky he snapped its a big business deal thats what you admire isnt it big business well its bigger than anything those boys ever dreamed of they spend their lives grubbing for their fortunes penny by penny while i can do it like thathe snapped his fingersjust like that its the biggest single stunt ever pulled stunt jim deal and you did it yourself you bet i did it that fat fool orren boyle couldnt have swung it in a million years this took knowledge and skill and timinghe saw a spark of interest in her eyesand psychology the spark vanished but he went rushing heedlessly on one had to know how to approach wesley and how to keep the wrong influences away from him and how to get mr thompson interested without letting him know too much and how to cut chick morrison in on it but keep tinky holloway out and how to get the right people to give a few parties for wesley at the right time and say cherryl is there any champagne in this house champagne cant we do something special tonight cant we have a sort of celebration together we can have champagne yes jim of course she rang the bell and gave the orders in her odd lifeless uncritical manner a manner of meticulous compliance with his wishes while volunteering none of her own you dont seem to be very impressed he said but what would you know about business anyway you wouldnt be able to understand anything on so large a scale wait till september second wait till they hear about it they who he glanced at her as if he had let a dangerous word slip out involuntarily weve organized a setup where weme orren and a few friendsare going to control every industrial property south of the border whose property why the peoples this is not an oldfashioned grab for private profit its a deal with a missiona worthy publicspirited missionto manage the nationalized properties of the various peoples states of south america to teach their workers our modern techniques of production to help the underprivileged whove never had a chance to he broke off abruptly though she had merely sat looking at him without shifting her glance you know he said suddenly with a cold little chuckle if youre so damn anxious to hide that you came from the slums you ought to be less indifferent to the philosophy of social welfare its always the poor who lack humanitarian instincts one has to be born to wealth in order to know the finer feelings of altruism ive never tried to hide that i came from the slums she said in the simple impersonal tone of a factual correction and i havent any sympathy for that welfare philosophy ive seen enough of them to know what makes the kind of poor who want something for nothing he did not answer and she added suddenly her voice astonished but firm as if in final confirmation of a longstanding doubt jim you dont care about it either you dont care about any of that welfare hogwash well if money is all that youre interested in he snapped let me tell you that that deal will bring me a fortune thats what youve always admired isnt it wealth it depends i think ill end up as one of the richest men in the world he said he did not ask what her admiration depended upon theres nothing i wont be able to afford nothing just name it i can give you anything you want go on name it i dont want anything jim but id like to give you a present to celebrate the occasion see anything you take it into your head to ask anything i can do it i want to show you that i can do it any fancy you care to name i havent any fancies oh come on want a yacht no want me to buy you the whole neighborhood where you lived in buffalo no want the crown jewels of the peoples state of england they can be had you know that peoples state has been hinting about it on the black market for a long time but there arent any oldfashioned tycoons left whore able to afford it im able to afford itor will be after september second want it no then what do you want i dont want anything jim but youve got to youve got to want something damn you she looked at him faintly startled but otherwise indifferent oh all right im sorry he said he seemed astonished by his own outbreak i just wanted to please you he added sullenly but i guess you cant understand it at all you dont know how important it is you dont know how big a man youre married to im trying to find out she said slowly do you still think as you used to that hank rearden is a great man yes jim i do well ive got him beaten im greater than any of them greater than rearden and greater than that other lover of my sisters who he stopped as if he had slid too far jim she asked evenly what is going to happen on september second he glanced up at her from under his foreheada cold glance while his muscles creased into a semismile as if in cynical breach of some hallowed restraint theyre going to nationalize danconia copper he said he heard the long harsh roll of a motor as a plane went by somewhere in the darkness above the roof then a thin tinkle as a piece of ice settled melting in the silver bowl of his fruit cupbefore she answered she said he was your friend wasnt he oh shut up he remained silent not looking at her when his eyes came back to her face she was still watching him and she spoke first her voice oddly stern what your sister did in her radio broadcast was great yes i know i know youve been saying that for a month youve never answered me what is there to ans just as your friends in washington have never answered her he remained silent jim im not dropping the subject he did not answer your friends in washington never uttered a word about it they did not deny the things she said they did not explain they did not try to justify themselves they acted as if she had never spoken i think theyre hoping that people will forget it some people will but the rest of us know what she said and that your friends were afraid to fight her thats not true the proper action was taken and the incident is closed and i dont see why you keep bringing it up what action bertram scudder was taken off the air as a program not in the public interest at the present time does that answer her it closes the issue and theres nothing more to be said about it about a government that works by blackmail and extortion you cant say that nothing was done its been publicly announced that scudders programs were disruptive destructive and untrustworthy jim i want to understand this scudder wasnt on her sidehe was on yours he didnt even arrange that broadcast he was acting on orders from washington wasnt he i thought you didnt like bertram scudder i didnt and i dont but then what do you care but he was innocent as far as your friends were concerned wasnt he i wish you wouldnt bother with politics you talk like a fool he was innocent wasnt he so what she looked at him her eyes incredulously wide then they just made him the scapegoat didnt they oh dont sit there looking like eddie willers do i i like eddie willers hes honest hes a damn halfwit who doesnt have the faintest idea of how to deal with practical reality but you do dont you jim you bet i do then couldnt you have helped scudder i he burst into helpless angry laughter oh why dont you grow up i did my best to get scudder thrown to the lions somebody had to be dont you know that it was my neck if some other hadnt been found your neck why not dagnys if she was wrong because she wasnt dagny is in an entirely different category it had to be scudder or me why and its much better for national policy to let it be scudder this way its not necessary to argue about what she saidand if anybody brings it up we start howling that it was said on scudders program and that scudders programs have been discredited and that scudder is a proven fraud and liar etc etcand do you think the public will be able to unscramble it nobodys ever trusted bertram scudder anyway oh dont stare at me like that would you rather theyd picked me to discredit why not dagny because her speech could not be discredited if youre so damn sorry for bertram scudder you should have seen him try his damndest to make them break my neck hes been doing that for yearshow do you think he got to where he was except by climbing on carcasses he thought he was pretty powerful tooyou should have seen how the big business tycoons used to be afraid of him but he got himself outmaneuvered this time this time he belonged to the wrong faction dimly through the pleasant stupor of relaxing of sprawling back in his chair and smiling he knew that this was the enjoyment he wanted to be himself to be himselfhe thought in the drugged precarious state of floating past the deadliest of his blind alleys the one that led to the question of what was himself you see he belonged to the tinky holloway faction it was pretty much of a seesaw for a while between the tinky holloway faction and the chick morrison faction but we won tinky made a deal and agreed to scuttle his pal bertram in exchange for a few things he needed from us you should have heard bertram howl but he was a dead duck and he knew it he started on a rolling chuckle but choked it off as the haze cleared and he saw his wifes face jim she whispered is that the sort of victories youre winning oh for christs sake he screamed smashing his fist down on the table where have you been all these years what sort of world do you think youre living in his blow had upset his water glass and the water went spreading in dark stains over the lace of the tablecloth im trying to find out she whispered her shoulders were sagging and her face looked suddenly worn an odd aged look that seemed haggard and lost i couldnt help it he burst out in the silence im not to blame i have to take things as i find them its not i whove made this world he was shocked to see that she smileda smile of so fiercely bitter a contempt that it seemed incredible on her gently patient face she was not looking at him but at some image of her own thats what my father used to say when he got drunk at the corner saloon instead of looking for work how dare you try comparing me to he started but did not finish because she was not listening her words when she looked at him again astonished him as completely irrelevant the date of that nationalization september second she asked her voice wistful was it you who picked it no i had nothing to do with it its the date of some special session of their legislature why its the date of our first wedding anniversary oh oh thats right he smiled relieved at the change to a safe subject well have been married a year my it doesnt seem that long it seems much longer she said tonelessly she was looking off again and he felt in sudden uneasiness that the subject was not safe at all he wished she would not look as if she were seeing the whole course of that year and of their marriage not to get scared but to learnshe thoughtthe thing to do is not to get scared but to learn the words came from a sentence she had repeated to herself so often that it felt like a pillar polished smooth by the helpless weight of her body the pillar that had supported her through the past year she tried to repeat it but she felt as if her hands were slipping on the polish as if the sentence would not stave off terror any longerbecause she was beginning to understand if you dont know the thing to do is not to get scared but to learn it was in the bewildered loneliness of the first weeks of her marriage that she said it to herself for the first time she could not understand jims behavior or his sullen anger which looked like weakness or his evasive incomprehensible answers to her questions which sounded like cowardice such traits were not possible in the james taggart whom she had married she told herself that she could not condemn without understanding that she knew nothing about his world that the extent of her ignorance was the extent to which she misinterpreted his actions she took the blame she took the beating of self reproachagainst some bleakly stubborn certainty which told her that something was wrong and that the thing she felt was fear i must learn everything that mrs james taggart is expected to know and to be was the way she explained her purpose to a teacher of etiquette she set out to learn with the devotion the discipline the drive of a military cadet or a religious novice it was the only way she thought of earning the height which her husband had granted her on trust of living up to his vision of her which it was now her duty to achieve and not wishing to confess it to herself she felt also that at the end of the long task she would recapture her vision of him that knowledge would bring back to her the man she had seen on the night of his railroads triumph she could not understand jims attitude when she told him about her lessons he burst out laughing she was unable to believe that the laughter had a sound of malicious contempt why jim why what are you laughing at he would not explainalmost as if the fact of his contempt were sufficient and required no reasons she could not suspect him of malice he was too patiently generous about her mistakes he seemed eager to display her in the best drawing rooms of the city and he never uttered a word of reproach for her ignorance for her awkwardness for those terrible moments when a silent exchange of glances among the guests and a burst of blood to her cheekbones told her that she had said the wrong thing again he showed no embarrassment he merely watched her with a faint smile when they came home after one of those evenings his mood seemed affectionately cheerful he was trying to make it easier for her she thoughtand gratitude drove her to study the harder she expected her reward on the evening when by some imperceptible transition she found herself enjoying a party for the first time she felt free to act not by rules but at her own pleasure with sudden confidence that the rules had fused into a natural habitshe knew that she was attracting attention but now for the first time it was not the attention of ridicule but of admirationshe was sought after on her own merit she was mrs taggart she had ceased being an object of charity weighing jim down painfully tolerated for his sakeshe was laughing gaily and seeing the smiles of response of appreciation on the faces around herand she kept glancing at him across the room radiantly like a child handing him a report card with a perfect score begging him to be proud of her jim sat alone in a corner watching her with an undecipherable glance he would not speak to her on their way home i dont know why i keep dragging myself to those parties he snapped suddenly tearing off his dress tie in the middle of their living room ive never sat through such a vulgar boring waste of time why jim she said stunned i thought it was wonderful you would you seemed to be quite at homequite as if it were coney island i wish youd learn to keep your place and not to embarrass me in public embarrassed you tonight you did how if you dont understand it i cant explain he said in the tone of a mystic who implies that a lack of understanding is the confession of a shameful inferiority i dont understand it she said firmly he walked out of the room slamming the door she felt that the inexplicable was not a mere blank this time it had a tinge of evil from that night on a small hard point of fear remained within her like the spot of a distant headlight advancing upon her down an invisible track knowledge did not seem to bring her a clearer vision of jims world but to make the mystery greater she could not believe that she was supposed to feel respect for the dreary senselessness of the art shows which his friends attended of the novels they read of the political magazines they discussedthe art shows where she saw the kind of drawings she had seen chalked on any pavement of her childhoods slumsthe novels that purported to prove the futility of science industry civilization and love using language that her father would not have used in his drunkenest momentsthe magazines that propounded cowardly generalities less clear and more stale than the sermons for which she had condemned the preacher of the slum mission as a mealymouthed old fraud she could not believe that these things were the culture she had so reverently looked up to and so eagerly waited to discover she felt as if she had climbed a mountain toward a jagged shape that had looked like a castle and had found it to be the crumbling ruin of a gutted warehouse jim she said once after an evening spent among the men who were called the intellectual leaders of the country dr simon pritchett is a phonya mean scared old phony now really he answered do you think youre qualified to pass judgment on philosophers im qualified to pass judgment on con men ive seen enough of them to know one when i see him now this is why i say that youll never outgrow your background if you had you would have learned to appreciate dr pritchetts philosophy what philosophy if you dont understand it i cant explain she would not let him end the conversation on that favorite formula of his jim she said hes a phony he and balph eubank and that whole gang of theirsand i think youve been taken in by them instead of the anger she expected she saw a brief flash of amusement in the lift of his eyelids thats what you think he answered she felt an instant of terror at the first touch of a concept she had not known to be possible what if jim was not taken in by them she could understand the phoniness of dr pritchett she thoughtit was a racket that gave him an undeserved income she could even admit the possibility by now that jim might be a phony in his own business what she could not hold inside her mind was the concept of jim as a phony in a racket from which he gained nothing an unpaid phony an unvenal phony the phoniness of a cardsharp or a con man seemed innocently wholesome by comparison she could not conceive of his motive she felt only that the headlight moving upon her had grown larger she could not remember by what steps what accumulation of pain first as small scratches of uneasiness then as stabs of bewilderment then as the chronic nagging pull of fear she had begun to doubt jims position on the railroad it was his sudden angry so you dont trust me snapped in answer to her first innocent questions that made her realize that she did notwhen the doubt had not yet formed in her mind and she had fully expected that his answers would reassure her she had learned in the slums of her childhood that honest people were never touchy about the matter of being trusted i dont care to talk shop was his answer whenever she mentioned the railroad she tried to plead with him once jim you know what i think of your work and how much i admire you for it oh really what is it you married a man or a railroad president i i never thought of separating the two well it is not very flattering to me she looked at him baffled she had thought it was id like to believe he said that you love me for myself and not for my railroad oh god jim she gasped you didnt think that i no he said with a sadly generous smile i didnt think that you married me for my money or my position i have never doubted you realizing in stunned confusion and in tortured fairness that she might have given him ground to misinterpret her feeling that she had forgotten how many bitter disappointments he must have suffered at the hands of fortunehunting women she could do nothing but shake her head and moan oh jim thats not what i meant he chuckled softly as at a child and slipped his arm around her do you love me he asked yes she whispered then you must have faith in me love is faith you know dont you see that i need it i dont trust anyone around me i have nothing but enemies i am very lonely dont you know that i need you the thing that made her pace her roomhours later in tortured restlessnesswas that she wished desperately to believe him and did not believe a word of it yet knew that it was true it was true but not in the manner he implied not in any manner or meaning she could ever hope to grasp it was true that he needed her but the nature of his need kept slipping past her every effort to define it she did not know what he wanted of her it was not flattery that he wanted she had seen him listening to the obsequious compliments of liars listening with a look of resentful inertnessalmost the look of a drug addict at a dose inadequate to rouse him but she had seen him look at her as if he were waiting for some reviving shot and at times as if he were begging she had seen a flicker of life in his eyes whenever she granted him some sign of admirationyet a burst of anger was his answer whenever she named a reason for admiring him he seemed to want her to consider him great but never dare ascribe any specific content to his greatness she did not understand the night in midapril when he returned from a trip to washington hi kid he said loudly dropping a sheaf of lilac into her arms happy days are here again just saw those flowers and thought of you spring is coming baby he poured himself a drink and paced the room talking with too light too brash a manner of gaiety there was a feverish sparkle in his eyes and his voice seemed shredded by some unnatural excitement she began to wonder whether he was elated or crushed i know what it is that theyre planning he said suddenly without transition and she glanced up at him swiftly she knew the sound of one of his inner explosions theres not a dozen people in the whole country who know it but i do the top boys are keeping it secret till theyre ready to spring it on the nation will it surprise a lot of people will it knock them flat a lot of people hell every single person in this country it will affect every single person thats how important it is affecthow jim it will affect them and they dont know whats coming but i do there they sit tonighthe waved at the lighted windows of the citymaking plans counting their money hugging their children or their dreams and they dont know but i do that all of it will be struck stopped changed changedfor the worse or the better for the better of course he answered impatiently as if it were irrelevant his voice seemed to lose its fire and to slip into the fraudulent sound of duty its a plan to save the country to stop our economic decline to hold things still to achieve stability and security what plan i cant tell you its secret top secret you have no idea how many people would like to know it theres no industrialist who wouldnt give a dozen of his best furnaces for just one hint of warning which hes not going to get like hank rearden for instance whom you admire so much he chuckled looking off into the future jim she asked the sound of fear in her voice telling him what the sound of his chuckle had been like why do you hate hank rearden i dont hate him he whirled to her and his face incredibly looked anxious almost frightened i never said i hated him dont worry hell approve of the plan everybody will its for everybodys good he sounded as if he were pleading she felt the dizzying certainty that he was lying yet that the plea was sincereas if he had a desperate need to reassure her but not about the things he said she forced herself to smile yes jim of course she answered wondering what instinct in what impossible kind of chaos had made her say it as if it were her part to reassure him the look she saw on his face was almost a smile and almost of gratitude had to tell you about it tonight i had to tell you i wanted you to know what tremendous issues i deal with you always talk about my work but you dont understand it at all its so much wider than you imagine you think that running a railroad is a matter of track laying and fancy metals and getting trains there on time but its not any underling can do that the real heart of a railroad is in washington my job is politics politics decisions made on a national scale affecting everything controlling everybody a few words on paper a directivechanging the life of every person in every nook cranny and penthouse of this country yes jim she said wishing to believe that he was perhaps a man of stature in the mysterious realm of washington youll see he said pacing the room you think theyre powerful those giants of industry whore so clever with motors and furnaces theyll be stopped theyll be stripped theyll be brought down theyll be he noticed the way she was staring at him its not for ourselves he snapped hastily its for the people thats the difference between business and politicswe have no selfish ends in view no private motives were not after profit we dont spend our lives scrambling for money we dont have to thats why were slandered and misunderstood by all the greedy profitchasers who cant conceive of a spiritual motive or a moral ideal or we couldnt help it he cried suddenly whirling to her we had to have that plan with everything falling to pieces and stopping something had to be done we had to stop them from stopping we couldnt help it his eyes were desperate she did not know whether he was boasting or begging for forgiveness she did not know whether this was triumph or terror jim dont you feel well maybe youve worked too hard and youre worn out and ive never felt better in my life he snapped resuming his pacing you bet ive worked hard my work is bigger than any job you can hope to imagine its above anything that grubbing mechanics like rearden and my sister are doing whatever they do i can undo it let them build a tracki can come and break it just like that he snapped his fingers just like breaking a spine you want to break spines she whispered trembling i havent said that he screamed whats the matter with you i havent said it im sorry jim she gasped shocked by her own words and by the terror in his eyes its just that i dont understand but but i know i shouldnt bother you with questions when youre so tiredshe was struggling desperately to convince herselfwhen you have so many things on your mind such such great things things i cant even begin to think of his shoulders sagged relaxing he approached her and dropped wearily down on his knees slipping his arms around her you poor little fool he said affectionately she held onto him moved by something that felt like tenderness and almost like pity but he raised his head to glance up at her face and it seemed to her that the look she saw in his eyes was partgratification partcontemptalmost as if by some unknown kind of sanction she had absolved him and damned herself it was uselessshe found in the days that followedto tell herself that these things were beyond her understanding that it was her duty to believe in him that love was faith her doubt kept growingdoubt of his incomprehensible work and of his relation to the railroad she wondered why it kept growing in direct proportion to her selfadmonitions that faith was the duty she owed him then one sleepless night she realized that her effort to fulfill that duty consisted of turning away whenever people discussed his job of refusing to look at newspaper mentions of taggart transcontinental of slamming her mind shut against any evidence and every contradiction she stopped aghast struck by the question what is it thenfaith versus truth and realizing that part of her zeal to believe was her fear to know she set out to learn the truth with a cleaner calmer sense of tightness than the effort at dutiful selffraud had ever given her it did not take her long to learn the evasiveness of the taggart executives when she asked a few casual questions the stale generalities of their answers the strain of their manner at the mention of their boss and their obvious reluctance to discuss himtold her nothing concrete but gave her a feeling equivalent to knowing the worst the railroad workers were more specificthe switchmen the gatemen the ticket sellers whom she drew into chance conversations in the taggart terminal and who did not know her jim taggart that whining sniveling speechmaking deadhead jimmy the president well ill tell you hes the hobo on the gravy train the boss mr taggart you mean miss taggart dont you it was eddie willers who told her the whole truth she heard that he had known jim since childhood and she asked him to lunch with her when she faced him at the table when she saw the earnest questioning directness of his eyes and the severely literal simplicity of his words she dropped all attempts at casual prodding she told him what she wanted to know and why briefly impersonally not appealing for help or for pity only for truth he answered her in the same manner he told her the whole story quietly impersonally pronouncing no verdict expressing no opinion never encroaching on her emotions by any sign of concern for them speaking with the shining austerity and the awesome power of facts he told her who ran taggart transcontinental he told her the story of the john galt line she listened and what she felt was not shock but worse the lack of shock as if she had always known it thank you mr willers was all that she said when he finished she waited for jim to come home that evening and the thing that eroded any pain or indignation was a feeling of her own detachment as if it did not matter to her any longer as if some action were required of her but it made no difference what the action would be or the consequences it was not anger that she felt when she saw jim enter the room but a murky astonishment almost as if she wondered who he was and why it should now be necessary to speak to him she told him what she knew briefly in a tired extinguished voice it seemed to her that he understood it from her first few sentences as if he had expected this to come sooner or later why didnt you tell me the truth she asked so thats your idea of gratitude he screamed so thats how you feel after everything ive done for you everybody told me that crudeness and selfishness was all i could expect for lifting a cheap little alley cat by the scruff of her neck she looked at him as if he were making inarticulate sounds that connected to nothing inside her mind why didnt you tell me the truth is that all the love you felt for me you sneaky little hypocrite is that all i get in return for my faith in you why did you lie why did you let me think what i thought you should be ashamed of yourself you should be ashamed to face me or speak to me the inarticulate sounds had connected but she could not believe the sum they made what are you trying to do jim she asked her voice incredulous and distant have you thought of my feelings have you thought of what this would do to my feelings you should have considered my feelings first thats the first obligation of any wifeand of a woman in your position in particular theres nothing lower and uglier than ingratitude for the flash of one instant she grasped the unthinkable fact of a man who was guilty and knew it and was trying to escape by inducing an emotion of guilt in his victim but she could not hold the fact inside her brain she felt a stab of horror the convulsion of a mind rejecting a sight that would destroy ita stab like a swift recoil from the edge of insanity by the time she dropped her head closing her eyes she knew only that she felt disgust a sickening disgust for a nameless reason when she raised her head it seemed to herthat she caught a glimpse of him watching her with the uncertain retreating calculating look of a man whose trick has not worked but before she had time to believe it his face was hidden again under an expression of injury and anger she said as if she were naming her thoughts for the benefit of the rational being who was not present but whose presence she had to assume since no other could be addressed that night those headlines that glory it was not you at all it was dagny shut up you rotten little bitch she looked at him blankly without reaction she looked as if nothing could reach her because her dying words had been uttered he made the sound of a sob cherryl im sorry i didnt mean it i take it back i didnt mean it she remained standing leaning against the wall as she had stood from the first he dropped down on the edge of a couch in a posture of helpless dejection how could i have explained it to you he said in the tone of abandoning hope its all so big and so complex how could i have told you anything about a transcontinental railroad unless you knew all the details and ramifications how could i have explained to you my years of work my oh whats the use ive always been misunderstood and i should have been accustomed to it by now only i thought that you were different and that i had a chance jim why did you marry me he chuckled sadly thats what everybody kept asking me i didnt think youd ever ask it why because i love you she wondered at how strange it was that this wordwhich was supposed to be the simplest in the human language the word understood by all the universal bond among menconveyed to her no meaning whatever she did not know what it was that it named in his mind nobodys ever loved me he said there isnt any love in the world people dont feel i feel things who cares about that all they care for is time schedules and freight loads and money i cant live among those people im very lonely ive always longed to find understanding maybe im just a hopeless idealist looking for the impossible nobody will ever understand me jim she said with an odd little note of severity in her voice what ive struggled for all this time is to understand you he dropped his hand in a motion of brushing her words aside not offensively but sadly i thought you could youre all i have but maybe understanding is just not possible between human beings why should it be impossible why dont you tell me what it is that you want why dont you help me to understand you he sighed thats it thats the troubleyour asking all those whys your constant asking of a why for everything what im talking about cant be put into words it cant be named it has to be felt either you feel it or you dont its not a thing of the mind but of the heart dont you ever feel just feel without asking all those questions cant you understand me as a human being not as if i were a scientific object in a laboratory the great understanding that transcends our shabby words and helpless minds no i guess i shouldnt look for it but ill always seek and hope youre my last hope youre all i have she stood at the wall without moving i need you he wailed softly fm all alone youre not like the others i believe in you i trust you what has all that money and fame and business and struggle given me youre all i have she stood without moving and the direction of her glance lowered to look down at him was the only form of recognition she gave him the things he said about his suffering were lies she thought but the suffering was real he was a man torn by some continual anguish which he seemed unable to tell her but which perhaps she could learn to understand she still owed him this muchshe thought with the grayness of a sense of dutyin payment for the position he had given her which perhaps was all he had to give she owed him an effort to understand him it was strange to feel in the days that followed that she had become a stranger to herself a stranger who had nothing to want or to seek in place of a love made by the brilliant fire of hero worship she was left with the gnawing drabness of pity in place of the men she had struggled to find men who fought for their goals and refused to suffershe was left with a man whose suffering was his only claim to value and his only offer in exchange for her life but it made no difference to her any longer the one who was she had looked with eagerness at the turn of every corner ahead the passive stranger who had taken her place was like all the over groomed people around her the people who said that they were adult because they did not try to think or to desire but the stranger was still haunted by a ghost who was herself and the ghost had a mission to accomplish she had to learn to understand the things that had destroyed her she had to know and she lived with a sense of ceaseless waiting she had to know even though she felt that the headlight was closer and in the moment of knowledge she would be struck by the wheels what do you want of mewas the question that kept beating in her mind as a clue what do you want of meshe kept crying soundlessly at dinner tables in drawing rooms on sleepless nights crying it to jim and those who seemed to share his secret to balph eubank to dr simon pritchettwhat do you want of me she did not ask it aloud she knew that they would not answer what do you want of meshe asked feeling as if she were running but no way were open to escape what do you want of meshe asked looking at the whole long torture of her marriage that had not lasted the full span of one year what do you want of me she asked aloudand saw that she was sitting at the table in her dining room looking at jim at his feverish face and at a drying stain of water on the table she did not know how long a span of silence had stretched between them she was startled by her own voice and by thequestion she had not intended to utter she did not expect him to understand it he had never seemed to understand much simpler queriesand she shook her head struggling to recapture the reality of the present she was startled to see him looking at her with a touch of derision as if he were mocking her estimate of his understanding love he answered she felt herself sagging with hopelessness in the face of that answer which was at once so simple and so meaningless you dont love me he said accusingly she did not answer you dont love me or you wouldnt ask such a question i did love you once she said dully but it wasnt what you wanted i loved you for your courage your ambition your ability but it wasnt real any of it his lower lip swelled a little in a faint contemptuous thrust what a shabby idea of love he said jim what is it that you want to be loved for what a cheap shopkeepers attitude she did not speak she looked at him her eyes stretched by a silent question to be lovedfor he said his voice grating with mockery and righteousness so you think that love is a matter of mathematics of exchange of weighing and measuring like a pound of butter on a grocery counter i dont want to be loved for anything i want to be loved for myselfnot for anything i do or have or say or think for myselfnot for my body or mind or words or works or actions but then what is yourself if you loved me you wouldnt ask it his voice had a shrill note of nervousness as if he were swaying dangerously between caution and some blindly heedless impulse you wouldnt ask youd know youd feel it why do you always try to tag and label everything cant you rise above those petty materialistic definitions dont you ever feeljust feel yes jim i do she said her voice low but i am trying not to because because what t feel is fear of me he asked hopefully no not exactly not fear of what you can do to me but of what you are he dropped his eyelids with the swiftness of slamming a doorbut she caught a flash of his eyes and the flash incredibly was terror youre not capable of love you cheap little golddigger he cried suddenly in a tone stripped of all color but the desire to hurt yes i said golddigger there are many forms of it other than greed for money other and worse youre a golddigger of the spirit you didnt marry me for my cashbut you married me for my ability or courage or whatever value it was that you set as the price of your love do you want love to be causeless love is its own cause love is above causes and reasons love is blind but you wouldnt be capable of it you have the mean scheming calculating little soul of a shopkeeper who trades but never gives love is a gifta great free unconditional gift that transcends and forgives everything whats the generosity of loving a man for his virtues what do you give him nothing its no more than cold justice no more than hes earned her eyes were dark with the dangerous intensity of glimpsing her goal you want it to be unearned she said not in the tone of a question but of a verdict oh you dont understand yes jim i do thats what you wantthats what all of you really wantnot money not material benefits not economic security not any of the handouts you keep demanding she spoke in a flat monotone as if reciting her thoughts to herself intent upon giving the solid identity of words to the torturous shreds of chaos twisting in her mind all of you welfare preachersits not unearned money that youre after you want handouts but of a different kind im a golddigger of the spirit you said because i look for value then you the welfare preachers its the spirit that you want to loot i never thought and nobody ever told us how it could be thought of and what it would meanthe unearned in spirit but that is what you want you want unearned love you want unearned admiration you want unearned greatness you want to be a man like hank rearden without the necessity of being what he is without the necessity of being anything without the necessity of being shut up he screamed they looked at each other both in terror both feeling as if they were swaying on an edge which she could not and he would not name both knowing that one more step would be fatal what do you think youre saying he asked in a tone of petty anger which sounded almost benevolent by bringing them back into the realm of the normal into the nearwholesomeness of nothing worse than a family quarrel what sort of metaphysical subject are you trying to deal with i dont know she said wearily dropping her head as if some shape she had tried to capture had slipped once more out of her grasp i dont know it doesnt seem possible youd better not try to wade in way over your head or but he had to stop because the butler entered bringing the glittering ice bucket with the champagne ordered for celebration they remained silent letting the room be filled by the sounds which centuries of men and of struggle had established as the symbol of joyous attainment the blast of the cork the laughing tinkle of a pale gold liquid running into two broad cups filled with the weaving reflections of candles the whisper of bubbles rising through two crystal stems almost demanding that everything in sight rise too in the same aspiration they remained silent till the butler had gone taggart sat looking down at the bubbles holding the stem of his glass between two limply casual fingers then his hand closed suddenly about the stem into an awkwardly convulsed fist and he raised it not as one lifts a glass of champagne but as one would lift a butcher knife to francisco danconia he said she put her glass down no she answered drink it he screamed no she answered her voice like a drop of lead they held each others glances for a moment the light playing on the golden liquid not reaching their faces or eyes oh go to hell he cried leaping to his feet flinging his glass to smash on the floor and rushing out of the room she sat at the table not moving for a long time then rose slowly and pressed the bell she walked to her room her steps unnaturally even she opened the door of a closet she reached for a suit and a pair of shoes she took off the housecoat moving with cautious precision as if her life depended on not jarring anything about or within her she held onto a single thought that she had to get out of this housejust get out of it for a while if only for the next hourand then later she would be able to face all that had to be faced the lines were blurring on the paper before her and raising her head dagny realized that it had long since grown dark she pushed the papers aside unwilling to turn on the lamp permitting herself the luxury of idleness and darkness it cut her off from the city beyond the windows of her living room the calendar in the distance said august the month behind her had gone leaving nothing but the blank of dead time it had gone into the planless thankless work of racing from emergency to emergency of delaying the collapse of a railroada month like a waste pile of disconnected days each given to averting the disaster of the moment it had not been a sum of achievements brought into existence but only a sum of zeros of that which had not happened a sum of prevented catastrophesnot a task in the service of life but only a race against death there had been times when an unsummoned visiona sight of the valleyhad seemed to rise before her not as a sudden appearance but as a constant hidden presence that suddenly chose to assume an insistent reality she had faced it through moments of blinded stillness in a contest between an unmoving decision and an unyielding pain a pain to be fought by acknowledgment by saying all right even this there had been mornings when awakening with rays of sunlight on her face she had thought that she must hurry to hammonds market to get fresh eggs for breakfast then recapturing full consciousness seeing the haze of new york beyond the window of her bedroom she had felt a tearing stab like a touch of death the touch of rejecting reality you knew itshe had told herself severelyyou knew what it would be like when you made your choice and dragging her body like an unwilling weight out of bed to face an unwelcome day she would whisper all right even this the worst of the torture had been the moments when walking down the street she had caught a sudden glimpse of chestnutgold a glowing streak of hair among the heads of strangers and had felt as if the city had vanished as if nothing but the violent stillness within her were delaying the moment when she would rush to him and seize him but that next moment had come as the sight of some meaningless faceand she had stood not wishing to live through the following step not wishing to generate the energy of living she had tried to avoid such moments she had tried to forbid herself to look she had walked keeping her eyes on the pavements she had failed by some will of their own her eyes had kept leaping to every streak of gold she had kept the blinds raised on the windows of her office remembering his promise thinking only if you are watching me wherever you are there were no buildings close to the height of her office but she had looked at the distant towers wondering which window was his observation post wondering whether some invention of his own some device of rays and lenses permitted him to observe her every movement from some skyscraper a block or a mile away she had sat at her desk at her uncurtained windows thinking just to know that youre seeing me even if im never to see you again and remembering it now in the darkness of her room she leaped to her feet and snapped on the light then she dropped her head for an instant smiling in mirthless amusement at herself she wondered whether her lighted windows in the black immensity of the city were a flare of distress calling for his helpor a lighthouse still protecting the rest of the world the doorbell rang when she opened the door she saw the silhouette of a girl with a faintly familiar faceand it took her a moment of startled astonishment to realize that it was cherryl taggart except for a formal exchange of greetings on a few chance encounters in the halls of the taggart building they had not seen each other since the wedding cherryls face was composed and unsmiling would you permit me to speak to youshe hesitated and ended onmiss taggart of course said dagny gravely come in she sensed some desperate emergency in the unnatural calm of cherryls manner she became certain of it when she looked at the girls face in the light of the living room sit down she said but cherryl remained standing i came to pay a debt said cherryl her voice solemn with the effort to permit herself no sound of emotion i want to apologize for the things i said to you at my wedding theres no reason why you should forgive me but its my place to tell you that i know i was insulting everything i admire and defending everything i despise i know that admitting it now doesnt make up for it and even coming here is only another presumption theres no reason why you should want to hear it so i cant even cancel the debt i can only ask for a favorthat you let me say the things i want to say to you dagnys shock of emotion incredulous warm and painful was the wordless equivalent of the sentence what a distance to travel in less than a year she answered the unsmiling earnestness of her voice like a hand extended in support knowing that a smile would upset some precarious balance but it does make up for it and i do want to hear it i know that it was you who ran taggart transcontinental it was you who built the john galt line it was you who had the mind and the courage that kept all of it alive i suppose you thought that i married jim for his moneyas what shop girl wouldnt have but you see i married jim because i i thought that he was you i thought that he was taggart transcontinental now i know that hesshe hesitated then went on firmly as if not to spare herself anythinghes some sort of vicious moocher though i cant understand of what kind or why when i spoke to you at my wedding i thought that i was defending greatness and attacking its enemy but it was in reverse it was in such horrible unbelievable reverse so i wanted to tell you that i know the truth not so much for your sake i have no right to presume that youd care but but for the sake of the things i loved dagny said slowly of course i forgive it thank you she whispered and turned to go sit down she shook her head that that was all miss taggart dagny allowed herself the first touch of a smile no more than in the look of her eyes as she said cherryl my name is dagny cherryls answer was no more than a faint tremulous crease of her mouth as if together they had completed a single smile i i didnt know whether i should were sisters arent we no not through jim it was an involuntary cry no through our own choice sit down cherryl the girl obeyed struggling not to show the eagerness of her acceptance not to grasp for support not to break youve had a terrible time havent you yes but that doesnt matter thats my own problem and my own fault i dont think it was your own fault cherryl did not answer then said suddenly desperately look what i dont want is charity jim must have told youand its truethat i never engage in charity yes he did but what i mean is i know what you mean but theres no reason why you should have to feel concern for me i didnt come here to complain and and load another burden on your shoulders that i happen to suffer doesnt give me a claim on you no it doesnt but that you value all the things i value does you mean if you want to talk to me its not alms not just because you feel sorry for me i feel terribly sorry for you cherryl and id like to help younot because you suffer but because you havent deserved to suffer you mean you wouldnt be kind to anything weak or whining or rotten about me only to whatever you see in me thats good of course cherryl did not move her head but she looked as if it were liftedas if some bracing current were relaxing her features into that rare look which combines pain and dignity its not alms cherryl dont be afraid to speak to me its strange youre the first person i can talk to and it feels so easy yet i i was afraid to speak to you i wanted to ask your forgiveness long ago ever since i learned the truth i went as far as the door of your office but i stopped and stood there in the hall and didnt have the courage to go in i didnt intend to come here tonight i went out only to to think something over and then suddenly i knew that i wanted to see you that in the whole of the city this was the only place for me to go and the only thing still left for me to do im glad you did you know miss tagdagny she said softly in wonder youre not as i expected you to be at all they jim and his friends they said you were hard and cold and unfeeling but its true cherryl i am in the sense they meanonly have they ever told you in just what sense they mean it no they never do they only sneer at me when i ask them what they mean by anything about anything what did they mean about you whenever anyone accuses some person of being unfeeling he means that that person is just he means that that person has no causeless emotions and will not grant him a feeling which he does not deserve he means that to feel is to go against reason against moral values against reality he means whats the matter she asked seeing the abnormal intensity of the girls face its its something ive tried so hard to understand for such a long time well observe that you never hear that accusation in defense of innocence but always in defense of guilt you never hear it said by a good person about those who fail to do him justice but you always hear it said by a rotter about those who treat him as a rotter those who dont feel any sympathy for the evil hes committed or for the pain he suffers as a consequence well its truethat is what i do not feel but those who feel it feel nothing for any quality of human greatness for any person or action that deserves admiration approval esteem these are the things feel youll find that its one or the other those who grant sympathy to guilt grant none to innocence ask yourself which of the two are the unfeeling persons and then youll see what motive is the opposite of charity what she whispered justice cherryl cherryl shuddered suddenly and dropped her head oh god she moaned if you knew what hell jim has been giving me because i believed just what you said she raised her face in the sweep of another shudder as if the things she had tried to control had broken through the look in her eyes was terror dagny she whispered dagny im afraid of them of jim and all the others not afraid of something theyll do if it were that i could escape but afraid as if theres no way out afraid of what they are and and that they exist dagny came forward swiftly to sit on the arm of her chair and seize her shoulder in a steadying grasp quiet kid she said youre wrong you must never feel afraid of people in that way you must never think that their existence is a reflection on yoursyet thats what youre thinking yes yes i feel that theres no chance for me to exist if they do no chance no room no world i can cope with i dont want to feel it i keep pushing it back but its coming closer and know i have no place to run i cant explain what it feels like i cant catch hold of itand thats part of the terror that you cant catch hold of anythingits as if the whole world were suddenly destroyed but not by an explosionan explosion is something hard and solidbut destroyed by by some horrible kind of softening as if nothing were solid nothing held any shape at all and you could poke your finger through stone walls and the stone would give like jelly and mountains would slither and buildings would switch their shapes like cloudsand that would be the end of the world not fire and brimstone but goo cherryl cherryl you poor kid there have been centuries of philosophers plotting to turn the world into just thatto destroy peoples minds by making them believe that thats what theyre seeing but you dont have to accept it you dont have to see through the eyes of others hold onto yours stand on your own judgment you know that what is issay it aloud like the holiest of prayers and dont let anyone tell you otherwise but but nothing is any more jim and his friendstheyre not i dont know what im looking at when im among them i dont know what im hearing when they speak its not real any of it its some ghastly sort of act that theyre all going through and i dont know what theyre after dagny weve always been told that human beings have such a great power of knowledge so much greater than animals but ii feel blinder than any animal right now blinder and more helpless an animal knows who are its friends and who are its enemies and when to defend itself it doesnt expect a friend to step on it or to cut its throat it doesnt expect to be told that love is blind that plunder is achievement that gangsters are statesmen and that its great to break the spine of hank reardenoh god what am i saying i know what youre saying i mean how am i to deal with people i mean if nothing held firm for the length of one hourwe couldnt go on could we well i know that things are solidbut people dagny theyre nothing and anything theyre not beings theyre only switches just constant switches without any shape but i have to live among them how am i to do it cherryl what youve been struggling with is the greatest problem in history the one that has caused ail of human suffering youve understood much more than most people who suffer and die never knowing what killed them ill help you to understand its a big subject and a hard battlebut first above all dont be afraid the look on cherryls face was an odd wistful longing as if seeing dagny from a great distance she were straining and failing to come closer i wish i could wish to fight she said softly but i dont i dont even want to win any longer theres one change that i dont seem to have the strength to make you see i had never expected anything like my marriage to jim then when it happened i thought that life was much more wonderful than i had expected and now to get used to the idea that life and people are much more horrible than anything i had imagined and that my marriage was not a glorious miracle but some unspeakable kind of evil which im still afraid to learn fullythat is what i cant force myself to take i cant get past it she glanced up suddenly dagny how did you do it how did you manage to remain unmangled by holding to just one rule which to place nothingnothingabove the verdict of my own mind youve taken some terrible beatings maybe worse than i did worse than any of us what held you through it the knowledge that my life is the highest of values too high to give up without a fight she saw a look of astonishment of incredulous recognition on cherryls face as if the girl were struggling to recapture some sensation across a span of years dagnyher voice was a whisperthats thats what i felt when i was a child thats what i seem to remember most about myself that kind of feeling and i never lost it its there its always been there but as i grew up i thought it was something that i must hide i never had any name for it but just now when you said it it struck me that thats what it was dagny to feel that way about your own lifeis that good cherryl listen to me carefully that feelingwith everything which it requires and impliesis the highest noblest and only good on earth the reason i ask is because i i wouldnt have dared to think that somehow people always made me feel as if they thought it was a sin as if that were the thing in me which they resented and and wanted to destroy its true some people do want to destroy it and when you learn to understand their motive youll know the darkest ugliest and only evil in the world but youll be safely out of its reach cherryls smile was like a feeble flicker struggling to retain its hold upon a few drops of fuel to catch them to flare up its the first time in months she whispered that ive felt as if as if theres still a chance she saw dagnys eyes watching her with attentive concern and she added ill be all right let me get used to itto you to all the things you said i think ill come to believe it to believe that its real and that jim doesnt matter she rose to her feet as if trying to retain the moment of assurance prompted by a sudden causeless certainty dagny said sharply cherryl i dont want you to go home tonight oh no im all right im not afraid that way not of going home didnt something happen there tonight no not really nothing worse than usual it was just that i began to see things a little more clearly that was all im all right i have to think think harder than i ever did before and then ill decide what i must do may i she hesitated yes may i come back to talk to you again of course thank you i im very grateful to you will you promise me that youll come back i promise dagny saw her walking off down the hall toward the elevator saw the slump of her shoulders then the effort that lifted them saw the slender figure that seemed to sway then marshal all of its strength to remain erect she looked like a plant with a broken stem still held together by a single fiber struggling to heal the breach which one more gust of wind would finish through the open door of his study james taggart had seen cherryl cross the anteroom and walk out of the apartment he had slammed his door and slumped down on the davenport with patches of spilled champagne still soaking the cloth of his trousers as if his own discomfort were a revenge upon his wife and upon a universe that would not provide him with the celebration he had wanted after a while he leaped to his feet tore off his coat and threw it across the room he reached for a cigarette but snapped it in half and flung it at a painting over the fireplace he noticed a vase of venetian glassa museum piece centuries old with an intricate system of blue and gold arteries twisting through its transparent body he seized it and flung it at the wall it burst into a rain of glass as thin as a shattered light bulb he had bought that vase for the satisfaction of thinking of all the connoisseurs who could not afford it now he experienced the satisfaction of a revenge upon the centuries which had prized itand the satisfaction of thinking that there were millions of desperate families any one of whom could have lived for a year on the price of that vase he kicked off his shoes and fell back on the davenport letting his stocking feet dangle in midair the sound of the doorbell startled him it seemed to match his mood it was the kind of brusque demanding impatient snap of sound he would have produced if he were now jabbing his finger at someones doorbell he listened to the butlers steps promising himself the pleasure of refusing admittance to whoever was seeking it in a moment he heard the knock at his door and the butler entered to announce mrs rearden to see you sir what oh well have her come in he swung his feet down to the floor but made no other concession and waited with half a smile of alerted curiosity choosing not to rise until a moment after lillian had entered the room she wore a winecolored dinner gown an imitation of an empire traveling suit with a miniature doublebreasted jacket gripping her high waistline over the long sweep of the skirt and a small hat clinging to one ear with a feather sweeping down to curl under her chin she entered with a brusque unrhythmical motion the train of her dress and the feather of her hat swirling then flapping against her legs and throat like pennants signaling nervousness lillian my dear am i to be flattered delighted or just plain flabbergasted oh dont make a fuss about it i had to see you and it had to be immediately thats all the impatient tone the peremptory movement with which she sat down were a confession of weakness by the rules of their unwritten language one did not assume a demanding manner unless one were seeking a favor and had no valueno threatto barter why didnt you stay at the gonzales reception she asked her casual smile failing to hide the tone of irritation i dropped in on them after dinner just to catch hold of youbut they said you hadnt been feeling well and had gone home he crossed the room and picked up a cigarette for the pleasure of padding in his stocking feet past the formal elegance of her costume i was bored he answered i cant stand them she said with a little shudder he glanced at her in astonishment the words sounded involuntary and sincere i cant stand senor gonzales and that whore hes got himself for a wife its disgusting that theyve become so fashionable they and their parties i dont feel like going anywhere any longer its not the same style any more not the same spirit i havent run into balph eubank for months or dr pritchett or any of the boys and all those new faces that look like butchers assistants after all our crowd were gentlemen yeah he said reflectively yeah theres some funny kind of difference its like on the railroad too i could get along with gem weatherby he was civilized but cuffy meigsthats something else again thats he stopped abruptly its perfectly preposterous she said in the tone of a challenge to the space at large they cant get away with it she did not explain who or with what he knew what she meant through a moment of silence they looked as if they were clinging to each other for reassurance in the next moment he was thinking with pleasurable amusement that lillian was beginning to show her age the deep burgundy color of her gown was unbecoming it seemed to draw a purplish tinge out of her skin a tinge that gathered like twilight in the small gullies of her face softening her flesh to a texture of tired slackness changing her look of bright mockery into a look of stale malice he saw her studying him smiling and saying crisply with the smile as license for insult you are unwell arent you jim you look like a disorganized stable boy he chuckled i can afford it i know it darling youre one of the most powerful men in new york city she added its a good joke on new york city it is i concede that youre in a position to do anything thats why i had to see you she added a small grunt like sound of amusement to dilute her statements frankness good he said his voice comfortable and noncommittal i had to come here because i thought it best in this particular matter not to be seen together in public that is always wise i seem to remember having been useful to you in the past in the pastyes i am sure that i can count on you of courseonly isnt that an oldfashioned unphilosophical remark how can we ever be sure of anything jim she snapped suddenly youve got to help me my dear im at your disposal id do anything to help you he answered the rules of their language requiring that any open statement be answered by a blatant lie lillian was slipping he thoughtand he experienced the pleasure of dealing with an inadequate adversary she was neglecting he noted even the perfection of her particular trademark her grooming a few strands were escaping from the drilled waves of her hairher nails matching her gown were the deep shade of coagulated blood which made it easy to notice the chipped polish at their tipsand against the broad smooth creamy expanse of her skin in the low square cut of her gown he observed the tiny glitter of a safety pin holding the strap of her slip youve got to prevent it she said in the belligerent tone of a plea disguised as a command youve got to stop it really what my divorce oh his features dropped into sudden earnestness you know that hes going to divorce me dont you ive heard some rumors about it its set for next month and when i say set thats just what i mean oh its cost him plentybut hes bought the judge the clerks the bailiffs their backers their backers backers a few legislators half a dozen administratorshes bought the whole legal process like a private thoroughfare and theres no single crossroad left for me to squeeze through to stop it i see you know of course what made him start divorce proceedings i can guess and i did it as a favor to you her voice was growing anxiously shrill i told you about your sister in order to let you get that gift certificate for your friends which i swear i dont know who let it out he cried hastily only a very few at the top knew that youd been our informer and im sure nobody would dare mention oh im sure nobody did hed have the brains to guess it wouldnt he yes i suppose so well then you knew that you were taking a chance i didnt think hed go that far i didnt think hed ever divorce me i didnt he chuckled suddenly with a glance of astonishing perceptiveness you didnt think that guilt is a rope that wears thin did you lillian she looked at him startled then answered stonily i dont think it does it does my dearfor men such as your husband i dont want him to divorce me it was a sudden scream i dont want to let him go free i wont permit it i wont let the whole of my life be a total failure she stopped abruptly as if she had admitted too much he was chuckling softly nodding his head with a slow movement that had an air of intelligence almost of dignity by signifying a complete understanding i mean after all hes my husband she said defensively yes lillian yes i know do you know what hes planning hes going to get the decree and hes going to cut me off without a pennyno settlement no alimony nothing hes going to have the last word dont you see if he gets away with it then then the gift certificate was no victory for me at all yes my dear i see and besides its preposterous that i should have to think of it but what am i going to live on the little money i had of my own is worth nothing nowadays its mainly stock in factories of my fathers time that have closed long ago what am i going to do but lillian he said softly i thought you had no concern for money or for any material rewards you dont understand im not talking about moneyim talking about poverty real stinking hallbedroom poverty thats out of bounds for any civilized person ii to have to worry about food and rent he was watching her with a faint smile for once his soft aging face seemed tightened into a look of wisdom he was discovering the pleasure of full perceptionin a reality which he could permit himself to perceive jim youve got to help me my lawyer is powerless ive spent the little i had on him and on his investigators friends and fixersbut all they could do for me was find out that they can do nothing my lawyer gave me his final report this afternoon he told me bluntly that i havent a chance i dont seem to know anyone who can help against a setup of this kind i had counted on bertram scudder but well you know what happened to bertram and that too was because i had tried to help you you pulled yourself out of that one jim youre the only person who can pull me out now youve got your gopherhole pipe line straight up to the top you can reach the big boys slip a word to your friends to slip a word to their friends one word from wesley would do it have them order that divorce decree to be refused just have it be refused he shook his head slowly almost compassionately like a tired professional at an overzealous amateur it cant be done lillian he said firmly id like to do itfor the same reasons as yoursand i think you know it but whatever power i have is not enough in this case she was looking at him her eyes dark with an odd lifeless stillness when she spoke the motion of her lips was twisted by so evil a contempt that he did not dare identify it beyond knowing that it embraced them both she said i know that youd like to do it he felt no desire to pretend oddly for the first time for this one chance truth seemed much more pleasurabletruth for once serving his particular kind of enjoyment i think you know that it cant be done he said nobody does favors nowadays if theres nothing to gain in return and the stakes are getting higher and higher the gopher holes as you called them are so complex so twisted and intertwisted that everybody has something on everybody else and nobody dares move because he cant tell wholl crack which way or when so hell move only when he has to when the stakes are life or deathand thats practically the only kind of stakes were playing for now well whats your private life to any of those boys that youd like to hold your husbandwhats in it for them one way or another and my personal stockintradewell theres nothing i could offer them at the moment in exchange for trying to blast a whole court clique out of a highly profitable deal besides right now the top boys wouldnt do it at any price they have to be mighty careful of your husbandhes the man whos safe from them right nowever since that radio broadcast of my sisters you asked me to force her to speak on that broadcast i know lillian we lost both of us that time and we lose both of us now yes she said with the same darkness of contempt in her eyes both of us it was the contempt that pleased him it was the strange heedless unfamiliar pleasure of knowing that this woman saw him as he was yet remained held by his presence remained and leaned back in her chair as if declaring her bondage youre a wonderful person jim she said it had the sound of damnation yet it was a tribute and she meant it as such and his pleasure came from the knowledge that they were in a realm where damnation was value you know he said suddenly youre wrong about those butchers assistants like gonzales they have their uses have you ever liked francisco danconia i cant stand him well do you know the real purpose of that cocktailswilling occasion staged by senor gonzales tonight it was to celebrate the agreement to nationalize danconia copper in about a month she looked at him for a moment the corners of her lips lifting slowly into a smile he was your friend wasnt he her voice had a tone he had never earned before the tone of an emotion which he had drawn from people only by fraud but which now for the first time was granted with full awareness to the real the actual nature of his deed a tone of admiration suddenly he knew that this was the goal of his restless hours this was the pleasure he had despaired of finding this was the celebration he had wanted lets have a drink lil he said pouring the liquor he glanced at her across the room as she lay stretched limply in her chair let him get his divorce he said he wont have the last word they will the butchers assistants senor gonzales and cuffy meigs she did not answer when he approached she took the glass from him with a sloppily indifferent sweep of her hand she drank not in the manner of a social gesture but like a lonely drinker in a saloonfor the physical sake of the liquor he sat down on the arm of the davenport improperly close to her and sipped his drink watching her face after a while he asked what does he think of me the question did not seem to astonish her he thinks youre a fool she answered he thinks lifes too short to have to notice your existence hed notice it if he stopped if you bashed him over the head with a club im not too sure hed merely blame himself for not having moved out of the clubs reach still that would be your only chance she shifted her body sliding lower in the armchair stomach forward as if relaxation were ugliness as if she were granting him the kind of intimacy that required no poise and no respect that was the first thing i noticed about him she said when i met him for the first time that he was not afraid he looked as if he felt certain that there was nothing any of us could do to himso certain that he didnt even know the issue or the nature of what he felt how long since you saw him last three months i havent seen him since since the gift certificate i saw him at an industrial meeting two weeks ago he still looks that wayonly more so now he looks as if he knows it he added you have failed lillian she did not answer she pushed her hat off with the back of her hand it rolled down to the carpet its feather curling like a question mark i remember the first time i saw his mills she said his mills you cant imagine what he felt about them you wouldnt know the kind of intellectual arrogance it takes to feel as if anything pertaining to him anything he touched were made sacred by the touch his mills his metal his money his bed his wife she glanced up at him a small flicker piercing the lethargic emptiness of her eyes he never noticed your existence he did notice mine im still mrs reardenat least for another month yes he said looking down at her with a sudden new interest mrs rearden she chuckled you wouldnt know what that meant to him no feudal lord ever felt or demanded such reverence for the title of his wifeor held it as such a symbol of honor of his unbending untouchable inviolate stainless honor she waved her hand in a vague motion indicating the length of her sprawled body caesars wife she chuckled do you remember what she was supposed to be no you wouldnt she was supposed to be above reproach he was staring down at her with the heavy blind stare of impotent hatreda hatred of which she was the sudden symbol not the object he didnt like it when his metal was thrown into common public use for any chance passerby to make did he no he didnt his words were blurring a little as if weighted with drops of the liquor he had swallowed dont tell me that you helped us to get that gift certificate as a favor to me and that you gained nothing i know why you did it you knew it at the time sure thats why i like you lillian his eyes kept coming back to the low cut of her gown it was not the smooth skin that attracted his glance not the exposed rise of her breasts but the fraud of the safety pin beyond the edge id like to see him beaten he said id like to hear him scream with pain just once you wont jimmy why does he think hes better than the rest of ushe and that sister of mine she chuckled he rose as if she had slapped him he went to the bar and poured himself another drink not offering to refill her glass she was speaking into space staring past him he did notice my existenceeven though i cant lay railroad tracks for him and erect bridges to the glory of his metal i cant build his millsbut i can destroy them i cant produce his metalbut i can take it away from him i cant bring men down to their knees in admirationbut i can bring them down to their knees shut up he screamed in terror as if she were coming too close to that fogbound alley which had to remain unseen she glanced up at his face youre such a coward jim why dont you get drunk he snapped sticking his unfinished drink at her mouth as if he wanted to strike her her fingers halfclosed limply about the glass and she drank spilling the liquor down her chin her breast and her gown oh hell lillian youre a mess he said and not troubling to reach for his handkerchief he stretched out his hand to wipe the liquor with the flat of his palm his fingers slipped under the gowns neckline closing over her breast his breath catching in a sudden gulp like a hiccough his eyelids were drawing closed but he caught a glimpse of her face leaning back unresistingly her mouth swollen with revulsion when he reached for her mouth her arms embraced him obediently and her mouth responded but the response was just a pressure not a kiss he raised his head to glance at her face her teeth were bared in a smile but she was staring past him as if mocking some invisible presence her smile lifeless yet loud with malice like the grin of a fleshless skull he jerked her closer to stifle the sight and his own shudder his hands were going through the automatic motions of intimacyand she complied but in a manner that made him feel as if the beats of her arteries under his touch were snickering giggles they were both performing an expected routine a routine invented by someone and imposed upon them performing it in mockery in hatred in defiling parody on its inventors he felt a sightless heedless fury parthorror partpleasurethe horror of committing an act he would never dare confess to anyonethe pleasure of committing it in blasphemous defiance of those to whom he would not dare confess it he was himselfthe only conscious part of his rage seemed to be screaming to himhe was at last himself they did not speak they knew each others motive only two words were pronounced between them mrs rearden he said they did not look at each other when he pushed her into his bedroom and onto his bed falling against her body as against a soft stuffed object their faces had a look of secrecy the look of partners in guilt the furtive smutty look of children defiling someones clean fence by chalking sneaky scratches intended as symbols of obscenity afterward it did not disappoint him that what he had possessed was an inanimate body without resistance or response it was not a woman that he had wanted to possess it was not an act in celebration of life that he had wanted to performbut an act in celebration of the triumph of impotence cherryl unlocked the door and slipped in quietly almost surreptitiously as if hoping not to be seen or to see the place which was her home the sense of dagnys presenceof dagnys worldhad supported her on her way back but when she entered her own apartment the walls seemed to swallow her again into the suffocation of a trap the apartment was silent a wedge of light cut across the anteroom from a door left halfopen she dragged herself mechanically in the direction of her room then she stopped the open band of light was the door of jims study and on the illuminated strip of its carpet she saw a womans hat with a feather stirring faintly in a draft she took a step forward the room was empty she saw two glasses one on a table the other on the floor and a womans purse lying on the seat of an armchair she stood in unexacting stupor until she heard the muffled drawl of two voices behind the door of jims bedroom she could not distinguish the words only the quality of the sounds jims voice had a tone of irritation the womansof contempt then she found herself in her own room fumbling frantically to lock her door she had been flung here by the blind panic of escape as if it were she who had to hide she who had to run from the ugliness of being seen in the act of seeing thema panic made of revulsion of pity of embarrassment of that mental chastity which recoils from confronting a man with the unanswerable proof of his evil she stood in the middle of her room unable to grasp what action was now possible to her then her knees gave way folding gently she found herself sitting on the floor and she stayed there staring at the carpet shaking it was neither anger nor jealousy nor indignation but the blank horror of dealing with the grotesquely senseless it was the knowledge that neither their marriage nor his love for her nor his insistence on holding her nor his love for that other woman nor this gratuitous adultery had any meaning whatever that there was no shred of sense in any of it and no use to grope for explanations she had always thought of evil as purposeful as a means to some end what she was seeing now was evil for evils sake she did not know how long she had sat there when she heard their steps and voices then the sound of the front door closing she got up with no purpose in mind but impelled by some instinct from the past as if acting in a vacuum where honesty was not relevant any longer but knowing no other way to act she met jim in the anteroom for a moment they looked at each other as if neither could believe the others reality when did you come back he snapped how long have you been home i dont know he was looking at her face whats the matter with you jim i she struggled gave up and waved her hand toward his bedroom jim i know what do you know you were there with a woman his first action was to push her into his study and slam the door as if to hide them both he could no longer say from whom an unadmitted rage was boiling in his mind struggling between escape and explosion and it blew up into the sensation that this negligible little wife of his was depriving him of his triumph that he would not surrender to her his new enjoyment sure he screamed so what what are you going to do about it she stared at him blankly sure i was there with a woman thats what i did because thats what i felt like doing do you think youre going to scare me with your gasps your stares your whimpering virtue he snapped his fingers that for your opinion i dont give a hoot in hell about your opinion take it and like it it was her white defenseless face that drove him on lashing him into a state of pleasure the pleasure of feeling as if his words were blows disfiguring a human face do you think youre going to make me hide im sick of having to put on an act for your righteous satisfaction who the hell are you you cheap little nobody ill do as i please and youll keep your mouth shut and go through the right tricks in public like everybody else and stop demanding that i act in my own homenobody is virtuous in his own home the show is only for companybut if you expect me to mean itto mean it you damn little foolyoud better grow up in a hurry it was not her face that he was seeing it was the face of the man at whom he wanted and would never be able to throw his deed of this nightbut she had always stood as the worshipper the defender the agent of that man in his eyes he had married her for it so she could serve his purpose now and he screamed do you know who she was the woman i laid it was no she cried jim i dont have to know it it was mrs rearden mrs hank rearden she stepped back he felt a brief flash of terrorbecause she was looking at him as if she were seeing that which had to remain unadmitted to himself she asked in a dead voice that had the incongruous sound of common sense i suppose you will now want us to get divorced he burst out laughing you goddamn fool you still mean it you still want it big and pure i wouldnt think of divorcing youand dont go imagining that ill let you divorce me you think its as important as that listen you fool there isnt a husband who doesnt sleep with other women and there isnt a wife who doesnt know it but they dont talk about it ill lay anybody i please and you go and do the same like all those bitches and keep your mouth shut he saw the sudden startling sight of a look of hard unclouded unfeeling almost inhuman intelligence in her eyes jim if i were the kind who did or would you wouldnt have married me no i wouldnt have why did you marry me he felt himself drawn as by a whirlpool part in relief that the moment of danger was past part in irresistible defiance of the same danger because you were a cheap helpless preposterous little guttersnipe whod never have a chance at anything to equal me because i thought youd love me i thought youd know that you had to love me as you are without daring to ask what i am without reasons without putting me on the spot always to live up to reason after reason after reason like being on some goddamn dress parade to the end of my days you loved me because i was worthless well what did you think you were you loved me for being rotten what else did you have to offer but you didnt have the humility to appreciate it i wanted to be generous i wanted to give you securitywhat security is there in being loved for ones virtues the competitions wide open like a jungle market place a better person will always come along to beat you but ii was willing to love you for your flaws for your faults and weaknesses for your ignorance your crudeness your vulgarityand thats safe youd have nothing to fear nothing to hide you could be yourself your real stinking sinful ugly selfeverybodys self is a gutterbut you could hold my love with nothing demanded of you you wanted me to accept your love as alms did you imagine that you could earn it did you imagine that you could deserve to marry me you poor little tramp i used to buy the likes of you for the price of a meal i wanted you to know with every step you took with every mouthful of caviar you swallowed that you owed it all to me that you had nothing and were nothing and could never hope to equal deserve or repay i tried to deserve it of what use would you be to me if you had you didnt want me to oh you goddamn fool you didnt want me to improve you didnt want me to rise you thought me rotten and you wanted me to stay rotten of what use would you be to me if you earned it all and i had to work to hold you and you could trade elsewhere if you chose you wanted it to be alms for both of us and from both you wanted us to be two beggars chained to each other yes you goddamn evangelist yes you goddamn hero worshipper yes you chose me because i was worthless yes youre lying jim his answer was only a startled glance of astonishment those girls that you used to buy for the price of a meal they would have been glad to let their real selves become a gutter they would have taken your alms and never tried to rise but you would not marry one of them you married me because you knew that i did not accept the gutter inside or out that i was struggling to rise and would go on strugglingdidnt you yes he cried then the headlight she had felt rushing upon her hit its goaland she screamed in the bright explosion of the impactshe screamed in physical terror backing away from him whats the matter with you he cried shaking not daring to see in her eyes the thing she had seen she moved her hands in groping gestures halfwaving it away half trying to grasp it when she answered her words did not quite name it but they were the only words she could find you youre a killer for the sake of killing it was too close to the unnamed shaking with terror he swung out blindly and struck her in the face she fell against the side of an armchair her head striking the floor but she raised her head in a moment and looked up at him blankly without astonishment as if physical reality were merely taking the form she had expected a single pearshaped drop of blood went slithering slowly from the corner of her mouth he stood motionlessand for a moment they looked at each other as if neither dared to move she moved first she sprang to her feetand ran she ran out of the room out of the apartmenthe heard her running down the hall tearing open the iron door of the emergency stairway not waiting to ring for the elevator she ran down the stairs opening doors on random landings running through the twisting hallways of the building then down the stairs again until she found herself in the lobby and ran to the street after a while she saw that she was walking down a littered sidewalk in a dark neighborhood with an electric bulb glaring in the cave of a subway entrance and a lighted billboard advertising soda crackers on the black roof of a laundry she did not remember how she had come here her mind seemed to work in broken spurts without connections she knew only that she had to escape and that escape was impossible she had to escape from jim she thought whereshe asked looking around her with a glance like a cry of prayer she would have seized upon a job in a fiveandten or in that laundry or in any of the dismal shops she passed but she would work she thought and the harder she worked the more malevolence she would draw from the people around her and she would not know when truth would be expected of her and when a lie but the stricter her honesty the greater the fraud she would be asked to suffer at their hands she had seen it before and had borne it in the home of her family in the shops of the slums but she had thought that these were vicious exceptions chance evils to escape and forget now she knew that they were not exceptions that theirs was the code accepted by the world that it was a creed of living known by all but kept unnamed leering at her from peoples eyes in that sly guilty look she had never been able to understandand at the root of the creed hidden by silence lying in wait for her in the cellars of the city and in the cellars of their souls there was a thing with which one could not live why are you doing it to meshe cried soundlessly to the darkness around her because youre goodsome enormous laughter seemed to be answering from the roof tops and from the sewers then i wont want to be good any longerbut you willi dont have toyou willi cant bear ityou will she shuddered and walked fasterbut ahead of her in the foggy distance she saw the calendar above the roofs of the cityit was long past midnight and the calendar said august but it seemed to her suddenly that she saw september written above the city in letters of bloodand she thought if she worked if she struggled if she rose she would take a harder beating with each step of her climb until at the end whatever she reached be it a copper company or an unmortgaged cottage she would see it seized by jim on some september and she would see it vanish to pay for the parties where jim made his deals with his friends then i wontshe screamed and whirled around and went running back along the streetbut it seemed to her that in the black sky grinning at her from the steam of the laundry there weaved an enormous figure that would hold no shape but its grin remained the same on its changing faces and its face was jims and her childhood preachers and the woman social workers from the personnel department of the fiveandtenand the grin seemed to say to her people like you will always stay honest people like you will always struggle to rise people like you will always work so were safe and you have no choice she ran when she looked around her once more she was walking down a quiet street past the glass doorways where lights were burning in the carpeted lobbies of luxurious buildings she noticed that she was limping and saw that the heel of her pump was loose she had broken it somewhere in her blank span of running from the sudden space of a broad intersection she looked at the great skyscrapers in the distance they were vanishing quietly into a veil of fog with the faint breath of a glow behind them with a few lights like a smile of farewell once they had been a promise and from the midst of the stagnant sloth around her she had looked to them for proof that another kind of men existed now she knew that they were tombstones slender obelisks soaring in memory of the men who had been destroyed for having created them they were the frozen shape of the silent cry that the reward of achievement was martyrdom somewhere in one of those vanishing towers she thought there was dagnybut dagny was a lonely victim fighting a losing battle to be destroyed and to sink into fog like the others there is no place to go she thought and stumbled ont cant stand still nor move much longeri can neither work nor resti can neither surrender nor fightbut this this is what they want of me this is where they want meneither living nor dead neither thinking nor insane but just a chunk of pulp that screams with fear to be shaped by them as they please they who have no shape of their own she plunged into the darkness behind a corner shrinking in dread from any human figure no she thought theyre not evil not all people theyre only their own first victims but they all believe in jims creed and i cant deal with them once i know it and if i spoke to them they would try to grant me their good will but id know what it is that they hold as the good and i would see death staring out of their eyes the sidewalk had shrunk to a broken strip and splashes of garbage ran over from the cans at the stoops of crumbling houses beyond the dusty glow of a saloon she saw a lighted sign young womens rest club above a locked door she knew the institutions of that kind and the women who ran them the women who said that theirs was the job of helping sufferers if she went inshe thought stumbling pastif she faced them and begged them for help what is your guilt they would ask her drink dope pregnancy shoplifting she would answer i have no guilt i am innocent but im sorry we have no concern for the pain of the innocent she ran she stopped regaining her eyesight on the corner of a long wide street the buildings and pavements merged with the skyand two lines of green lights hung in open space going off into an endless distance as if stretching into other towns and oceans and foreign lands to encircle the earth the green glow had a look of serenity like an inviting unlimited path open to confident travel then the lights switched to red dropping heavily lower turning from sharp circles into foggy smears into a warning of unlimited danger she stood and watched a giant truckgo by its enormous wheels crushing one more layer of shiny polish into the flattened cobbles of the street the lights went back to the green of safetybut she stood trembling unable to move thats how it works for the travel of ones body she thought but what have they done to the traffic of the soul they have set the signals in reverseand the road is safe when the lights are the red of evilbut when the lights are the green of virtue promising that yours is the rightofway you venture forth and are ground by the wheels all over the world she thoughtthose inverted lights go reaching into every land they go on encircling the earth and the earth is littered with mangled cripples who dont know what has hit them or why who crawl as best they can on their crushed limbs through their lightless days with no answer save that pain is the core of existenceand the traffic cops of morality chortle and tell them that man by his nature is unable to walk these were not words in her mind these were the words which would have named had she had the power to find them what she knew only as a sudden fury that made her beat her fists in futile horror against the iron post of the traffic light beside her against the hollow tube where the hoarse rusty chuckle of a relentless mechanism went grating on and on she could not smash it with her fists she could not batter one by one all the posts of the street stretching off beyond eyesightas she could not smash that creed from the souls of the men she would encounter one by one she could not deal with people any longer she could not take the paths they tookbut what could she say to them she who had no words to name the thing she knew and no voice that people would hear what could she tell them how could she reach them all where were the men who could have spoken these were not words in her mind these were only the blows of her fists against metalthen she saw herself suddenly battering her knuckles to blood against an immovable post and the sight made her shudderand she stumbled away she went on seeing nothing around her feeling trapped in a maze with no exit no exither shreds of awareness were saying beating it into the pavements in the sound of her stepsno exit no refuge no signals no way to tell destruction from safety or enemy from friend like that dog she had heard about she thought somebodys dog in somebodys laboratory the dog who got his signals switched on him and saw no way to tell satisfaction from torture saw food changed to beatings and beatings to food saw his eyes and ears deceiving him and his judgment futile and his consciousness impotent in a shifting swimming shapeless worldand gave up refusing to eat at that price or to live in a world of that kind nowas the only conscious word in her brainnonononot your way not your worldeven if this no is all thats to be left of mine it was in the darkest hour of the night in an alley among wharfs and warehouses that the social worker saw her the social worker was a woman whose gray face and gray coat blended with the walls of the district she saw a young girl wearing a suit too smart and expensive for the neighborhood with no hat no purse with a broken heel disheveled hair and a bruise at the corner of her mouth a girl staggering blindly not knowing sidewalks from pavements the street was only a narrow crack between the sheer blank walls of storage structures but a ray of light fell through a fog dank with the odor of rotting water a stone parapet ended the street on the edge of a vast black hole merging river and sky the social worker approached her and asked severely are you in troubleand saw one wary eye the other hidden by a lock of hair and the face of a wild creature who has forgotten the sound of human voices but listens as to a distant echo with suspicion yet almost with hope the social worker seized her arm its a disgrace to come to such a state if you society girls had something to do besides indulging your desires and chasing pleasures you wouldnt be wandering drunk as a tramp at this hour of the night if you stopped living for your own enjoyment stopped thinking of yourself and found some higher then the girl screamedand the scream went beating against the blank walls of the street as in a chamber of torture an animal scream of terror she tore her arm loose and sprang back then screamed in articulate sounds no no not your kind of world then she ran ran by the sudden propulsion of a burst of power the power of a creature running for its life she ran straight down the street that ended at the riverand in a single streak of speed with no break no moment of doubt with full consciousness of acting in selfpreservation she kept running till the parapet barred her way and not stopping went over into space chapter v their brothers keepers on the morning of september a copper wire broke in california between two telephone poles by the track of the pacific branch line of taggart transcontinental a slow thin rain had been falling since midnight and there had been no sunrise only a gray light seeping through a soggy skyand the brilliant raindrops hanging on the telephone wires had been the only sparks glittering against the chalk of the clouds the lead of the ocean and the steel of the oil derricks descending as lone bristles down a desolate hillside the wires had been worn by more rains and years than they had been intended to carry one of them had kept sagging through the hours of that morning under the fragile load of raindrops then its one last drop had grown on the wires curve and had hung like a crystal bead gathering the weight of many seconds the bead and the wire had given up together and as soundless as the fall of tears the wire had broken and fallen with the fall of the bead the men at the division headquarters of taggart transcontinental avoided looking at one another when the break of the telephone line was discovered and reported they made statements painfully miscalculated to seem to refer to the problem yet to state nothing none fooling the others they knew that copper wire was a vanishing commodity more precious than gold or honor they knew that the division storekeeper had sold their stock of wire weeks ago to unknown dealers who came by night and were not businessmen in the daytime but only men who had friends in sacramento and in washingtonjust as the storekeeper recently appointed to the division had a friend in new york named cuffy meigs about whom one asked no questions they knew that the man who would now assume the responsibility of ordering repairs and initiating the action which would lead to the discovery that the repairs could not be made would incur retaliation from unknown enemies that his fellow workers would become mysteriously silent and would not testify to help him that he would prove nothing and if he attempted to do his job it would not be his any longer they did not know what was safe or dangerous these days when the guilty were not punished but the accusers were and like animals they knew that immobility was the only protection when in doubt and in danger they remained immobile they spoke about the appropriate procedure of sending reports to the appropriate authorities on the appropriate dates a young roadmaster walked out of the room and out of the headquarters building to the safety of a telephone booth in a drugstore and at his own expense ignoring the continent and the tiers of appropriate executives between he telephoned dagny taggart in new york she received the call in her brothers office interrupting an emergency conference the young roadmaster told her only that the telephone line was broken and that there was no wire to repair it he said nothing else and he did not explain why he had found it necessary to call her in person she did not question him she understood thank you was all that she answered an emergency file in her office kept a record of all the crucial materials still on hand on every division of taggart transcontinental like the file of a bankrupt it kept registering losses while the rare additions of new supplies seemed like the malicious chuckles of some tormentor throwing crumbs at a starving continent she looked through the file closed it sighed and said montana eddie phone the montana line to ship half their stock of wire to california montana might be able to last without itfor another week and as eddie willers was about to protest she added oil eddie california is one of the last producers of oil left in the country we dont dare lose the pacific line then she went back to the conference in her brothers office copper wire said james taggart with an odd glance that went from her face to the city beyond the window in a very short while we wont have any trouble about copper why she asked but he did not answer there was nothing special to see beyond the window only the clear sky of a sunny day the quiet light of early afternoon on the roofs of the city and above them the page of the calendar saying september she did not know why he had insisted on holding this conference in his own office why he had insisted on speaking to her alone which he had always tried to avoid or why he kept glancing at his wrist watch things are it seems to me going wrong he said something has to be done there appears to exist a state of dislocation and confusion tending toward an uncoordinated unbalanced policy what i mean is theres a tremendous national demand for transportation yet were losing money it seems to me she sat looking at the ancestral map of taggart transcontinental on the wall of his office at the red arteries winding across a yellowed continent there had been a time when the railroad was called the blood system of the nation and the stream of trains had been like a living circuit of blood bringing growth and wealth to every patch of wilderness it touched now it was still like a stream of blood but like the oneway stream that runs from a wound draining the last of a bodys sustenance and life oneway trafficshe thought indifferentlyconsumers traffic there was train number she thought six weeks ago train number had been sent with a load of steel not to faulkton nebraska where the spencer machine tool company the best machine tool concern still in existence had been idle for two weeks waiting for the shipmentbut to sand creek illinois where confederated machines had been wallowing in debt for over a year producing unreliable goods at unpredictable times the steel had been allocated by a directive which explained that the spencer machine tool company was a rich concern able to wait while confederated machines was bankrupt and could not be allowed to collapse being the sole source of livelihood of the community of sand creek illinois the spencer machine tool company had closed a month ago confederated machines had closed two weeks later the people of sand creek illinois had been placed on national relief but no food could be found for them in the empty granaries of the nation at the frantic call of the momentso the seed grain of the farmers of nebraska had been seized by order of the unification boardand train number had carried the unplanted harvest and the future of the people of nebraska to be consumed by the people of illinois in this enlightened age eugene lawson had said in a radio broadcast we have come at last to realize that each one of us is his brothers keeper in a precarious period of emergency like the present james taggart was saying while she looked at the map it is dangerous to find ourselves forced to miss pay days and accumulate wage arrears on some of our divisions a temporary condition of course but she chuckled the railroad unification plan isnt working is it jim i beg your pardon youre to receive a big cut of the atlantic southerns gross income out of the common pool at the end of the yearonly there wont be any gross income left for the pool to seize will there thats not true its just that the bankers are sabotaging the plan those bastardswho used to give us loans in the old days with no security at all except our own railroadnow refuse to let me have a few measly hundredthousands on short term just to take care of a few payrolls when i have the entire plant of all the railroads of the country to offer them as security for my loan she chuckled we couldnt help it he cried its not the fault of the plan that some people refuse to carry their fair share of our burdens jim was this all you wanted to tell me if it is ill go i have work to do his eyes shot to his wrist watch no no thats not all its most urgent that we discuss the situation and arrive at some decision which she listened blankly to the next stream of generalities wondering about his motive he was marking time yet he wasnt not fully she felt certain that he was holding her here for some specific purpose and simultaneously that he was holding her for the mere sake of her presence it was some new trait in him which she had begun to notice ever since cherryls death he had come running to her rushing unannounced into her apartment on the evening of the day when cherryls body had been found and the story of her suicide had filled the newspapers given by some social worker who had witnessed it an inexplicable suicide the newspapers had called it unable to discover any motive it wasnt my fault he had screamed to her as if she were the only judge whom he had to placate im not to blame for it im not to blame he had been shaking with terroryet she had caught a few glances thrown shrewdly at her face which had seemed inconceivably to convey a touch of triumph get out of here jim was all she had said to him he had never spoken to her again about cherry but he had started coming to her office more often than usual he had stopped her in the halls for snatches of pointless discussionsand such moments had grown into a sum that gave her an incomprehensible sensation as if while clinging to her for support and protection against some nameless terror his arms were sliding to embrace her and to plunge a knife into her back i am eager to know your views he was saying insistently as she looked away it is most urgent that we discuss the situation and and you havent said anything she did not turn its not as if there were no money to be had out of the railroad business but she glanced at him sharply his eyes scurried away what i mean is some constructive policy has to be devised he droned on hastily something has to be done by somebody in times of emergency she knew what thought he had scurried to avoid what hint he had given her yet did not want her to acknowledge or discuss she knew that no train schedules could be maintained any longer no promises kept no contracts observed that regular trains were cancelled at a moments notice and transformed into emergency specials sent by unexplained orders to unexpected destinationsand that the orders came from cuffy meigs sole judge of emergencies and of the public welfare she knew that factories were closing some with their machinery stilled for lack of supplies that had not been received others with their warehouses full of goods that could not be delivered she knew that the old industriesthe giants who had built their power by a purposeful course projected over a span of timewere left to exist at the whim of the moment a moment they could not foresee or control she knew that the best among them those of the longest range and most complex function had long since goneand those still struggling to produce struggling savagely to preserve the code of an age when production had been possible were now inserting into their contracts a line shameful to a descendant of nat taggart transportation permitting and yet there were menand she knew itwho were able to obtain transportation whenever they wished as by a mystic secret as by the grace of some power which one was not to question or explain they were the men whose dealings with cuffy meigs were regarded by people as that unknowable of mystic creeds which smites the observer for the sin of looking so people kept their eyes closed dreading not ignorance but knowledge she knew that deals were made whereby those men sold a commodity known as transportation pulla term which all understood but none would dare define she knew that these were the men of the emergency specials the men who could cancel her scheduled trains and send them to any random spot of the continent which they chose to strike with their voodoo stamp the stamp superseding contract property justice reason and lives the stamp stating that the public welfare required the immediate salvation of that spot these were the men who sent trains to the relief of the smather brothers and their grapefruit in arizonato the relief of a factory in florida engaged in the production of pinball machinesto the relief of a horse farm in kentuckyto the relief of orren boyles associated steel these were the men who made deals with desperate industrialists to provide transportation for the goods stalled in their warehousesor failing to obtain the percentage demanded made deals to purchase the goods when the factory closed at the bankruptcy sale at ten cents on the dollar and to speed the goods away in freight cars suddenly available away to markets where dealers of the same kind were ready for the kill these were the men who hovered over factories waiting for the last breath of a furnace to pounce upon the equipmentand over desolate sidings to pounce upon the freight cars of undelivered goodsthese were a new biological species the hitandrun businessmen who did not stay in any line of business longer than the span of one deal who had no payrolls to meet no overhead to carry no real estate to own no equipment to build whose only asset and sole investment consisted of an item known as friendship these were the men whom official speeches described as the progressive businessmen of our dynamic age but whom people called the pull peddlersthe species included many breeds those of transportation pull and of steel pull and oil pull and wageraise pull and suspended sentence pullmen who were dynamic who kept darting all over the country while no one else could move men who were active and mindless active not like animals but like that which breeds feeds and moves upon the stillness of a corpse she knew that there was money to be had out of the railroad business and she knew who was now obtaining it cuffy meigs was selling trains as he was selling the last of the railroads supplies whenever he could rig a setup which would not let it be discovered or provedselling rail to roads in guatemala or to trolley companies in canada selling wire to manufacturers of juke boxes selling crossties for fuel in resort hotels did it mattershe thought looking at the mapwhich part of the corpse had been consumed by which type of maggot by those who gorged themselves or by those who gave the food to other maggots so long as living flesh was prey to be devoured did it matter whose stomachs it had gone to fill there was no way to tell which devastation had been accomplished by the humanitarians and which by undisguised gangsters there was no way to tell which acts of plunder had been prompted by the charitylust of the lawsons and which by the gluttony of cuffy meigsno way to tell which communities had been immolated to feed another community one week closer to starvation and which to provide yachts for the pullpeddlers did it matter both were alike in fact as they were alike in spirit both were in need and need was regarded as sole title to property both were acting in strictest accordance with the same code of morality both held the immolation of men as proper and both were achieving it there wasnt even any way to tell who were the cannibals and who the victimsthe communities that accepted as their rightful due the confiscated clothing or fuel of a town to the east of them found next week their granaries confiscated to feed a town to the westmen had achieved the ideal of the centuries they were practicing it in unobstructed perfection they were serving need as their highest ruler need as first claim upon them need as their standard of value as the coin of their realm as more sacred than right and life men had been pushed into a pit where shouting that man is his brothers keeper each was devouring his neighbor and was being devoured by his neighbors brother each was proclaiming the righteousness of the unearned and wondering who was stripping the skin off his back each was devouring himself while screaming in terror that some unknowable evil was destroying the earth what complaint do they now have to make she heard hugh akstons voice in her mind that the universe is irrational is it she sat looking at the map her glance dispassionately solemn as if no emotion save respect were permissible when observing the awesome power of logic she was seeingin the chaos of a perishing continent the precise mathematical execution of all the ideas men had held they had not wanted to know that this was what they wanted they had not wanted to see that they had the power to wish but not the power to fakeand they had achieved their wish to the letter to the last bloodstained comma of it what were they thinking now the champions of need and the lechers of pityshe wondered what were they counting on those who had once simpered i dont want to destroy the rich i only want to seize a little of their surplus to help the poor just a little theyll never miss itthen later had snapped the tycoons can stand being squeezed theyve amassed enough to last them for three generationsthen later had yelled why should the people suffer while businessmen have reserves to last a yearnow were screaming why should we starve while some people have reserves to last a week what were they counting onshe wondered you must do something cried james taggart she whirled to face him i its your job its your province its your duty what is to act to do to dowhat how should i know its your special talent youre the doer she glanced at him the statement was so oddly perceptive and so incongruously irrelevant she rose to her feet is this all jim no no i want a discussion go ahead but you havent said anything you havent either but what i mean is there are practical problems to solve which for instance what was that matter of our last allocation of new rail vanishing from the storehouse in pittsburgh cuffy meigs stole it and sold it can you prove it he snapped defensively have your friends left any means methods rules or agencies of proof then dont talk about it dont be theoretical weve got to deal with facts weve got to deal with facts as they are today i mean weve got to be realistic and devise some practical means to protect our supplies under existing conditions not under unprovable assumptions which she chuckled there was the form of the formless she thought there was the method of his consciousness he wanted her to protect him from cuffy meigs without acknowledging meigs existence to fight it without admitting its reality to defeat it without disturbing its game what do you find so damn funny he snapped angrily you know it i dont know whats the matter with you i dont know whats happened to you in the last two months ever since you came back youve never been so uncooperative why jim i havent argued with you in the last two months thats what i mean he caught himself hastily but not fast enough to miss her smile i mean i wanted to have a conference i wanted to know your view of the situation you know it but you havent said a word i said everything i had to say three years ago i told you where your course would take you it has now there you go again whats the use of theorizing were here were not back three years ago weve got to deal with the present not the past maybe things would have been different if we had followed your opinion maybe but the fact is that we didntand weve got to deal with facts weve got to take reality as it is now today well take it i beg your pardon take your reality ill merely take your orders thats unfair im asking for your opinion youre asking for reassurance jim youre not going to get it i beg your pardon im not going to help you pretendby arguing with youthat the reality youre talking about is not what it is that theres still a way to make it work and to save your neck there isnt well there was no explosion no angeronly the feebly uncertain voice of a man on the verge of abdication well what would you want me to do give up he looked at her blankly give upall of you you and your washington friends and your looting planners and the whole of your cannibal philosophy give up and get out of the way and let those of us who can start from scratch out of the ruins no the explosion came oddly now it was the scream of a man who would die rather than betray his idea and it came from a man who had spent his life evading the existence of ideas acting with the expediency of a criminal she wondered whether she had ever understood the essence of criminals she wondered about the nature of the loyalty to the idea of denying ideas no he cried his voice lower hoarser and more normal sinking from the tone of a zealot to the tone of an overbearing executive thats impossible thats out of the question who said so never mind its so why do you always think of the impractical why dont you accept reality as it is and do something about it youre the realist youre the doer the mover the producer the nat taggart youre the person whos able to achieve any goal she chooses you could save us now you could find a way to make things workif you wanted to she burst out laughing there she thought was the ultimate goal of all that loose academic prattle which businessmen had ignored for years the goal of all the slipshod definitions the sloppy generalities the soupy abstractions all claiming that obedience to objective reality is the same as obedience to the state that there is no difference between a law of nature and a bureaucrats directive that a hungry man is not free that man must be released from the tyranny of food shelter and clothingall of it for years that the day might come when nat taggart the realist would be asked to consider the will of cuffy meigs as a fact of nature irrevocable and absolute like steel rails and gravitation to accept the meigs made world as an objective unchangeable realitythen to continue producing abundance in that world there was the goal of all those con men of library and classroom who sold their revelations as reason their instincts as science their cravings as knowledge the goal of all the savages of the nonobjective the nonabsolute the relative the tentative the probablethe savages who seeing a farmer gather a harvest can consider it only as a mystic phenomenon unbound by the law of causality and created by the farmers omnipotent whim who then proceed to seize the farmer to chain him to deprive him of tools of seeds of water of soil to push him out on a barren rock and to command now grow a harvest and feed us noshe thought expecting jim to ask itit would be useless to try to explain what she was laughing at he would not be able to understand it but he did not ask it instead she saw him slumping and heard him sayterrifyingly because his words were so irrelevant if he did not understand and so monstrous if he did dagny im your brother she drew herself up her muscles growing rigid as if she were about to face a killers gun dagnyhis voice was the soft nasal monotonous whine of a beggari want to be president of a railroad i want it why cant i have my wish as you always have yours why shouldnt i be given the fulfillment of my desires as you always fulfill any desire of your own why should you be happy while i suffer oh yes the world is yours youre the one who has the brains to run it then why do you permit suffering in your world you proclaim the pursuit of happiness but you doom me to frustration dont i have the right to demand any form of happiness i choose isnt that a debt which you owe me am i not your brother his glance was like a prowlers flashlight searching her face for a shred of pity it found nothing but a look of revulsion its your sin if i suffer its your moral failure im your brother therefore im your responsibility but youve failed to supply my wants therefore youre guilty all of mankinds moral leaders have said so for centurieswho are you to say otherwise youre so proud of yourself you think that youre pure and goodbut you cant be good so long as im wretched my misery is the measure of your sin my contentment is the measure of your virtue i want this kind of world todays world it gives me my share of authority it allows me to feel importantmake it work for medo somethinghow do i know whatits your problem and your duty you have the privilege of strength but ii have the right of weakness thats a moral absolute dont you know it dont you dont you his glance was now like the hands of a man hanging over an abyss groping frantically for the slightest fissure of doubt but slipping on the clean polished rock of her face you bastard she said evenly without emotion since the words were not addressed to anything human it seemed to her that she saw him fall into the abysseven though there was nothing to see in his face except the look of a con man whose trick has not worked there was no reason to feel more revulsion than usual she thought he had merely uttered the things which were preached heard and accepted everywhere but this creed was usually expounded in the third person and jim had had the open effrontery to expound it in the first she wondered whether people accepted the doctrine of sacrifice provided its recipients did not identify the nature of their own claims and actions she turned to leave no no wait he cried leaping to his feet with a glance at his wrist watch its time now theres a particular news broadcast that i want you to hear she stopped held by curiosity he pressed the switch of the radio watching her face openly intently almost insolently his eyes had a look of fear and of oddly lecherous anticipation ladies and gentlemen the voice of the radio speaker leaped forth abruptly it had a tone of panic news of a shocking development has just reached us from santiago chile she saw the jerk of taggarts head and a sudden anxiety in his bewildered frown as if something about the words and voice were not what he had expected a special session of the legislature of the peoples state of chile had been called for ten oclock this morning to pass an act of utmost importance to the people of chile argentina and other south american peoples states in line with the enlightened policy of senior ramirez the new head of the chilean statewho came to power on the moral slogan that man is his brothers keeperthe legislature was to nationalize the chilean properties of danconia copper thus opening the way for the peoples state of argentina to nationalize the rest of the danconia properties the world over this however was known only to a very few of the toplevel leaders of both nations the measure had been kept secret in order to avoid debate and reactionary opposition the seizure of the multibillion dollar danconia copper was to come as a munificent surprise to the country on the stroke of ten in the exact moment when the chairmans gavel struck the rostrum opening the sessionalmost as if the gavels blow had set it offthe sound of a tremendous explosion rocked the hall shattering the glass of its windows it came from the harbor a few streets awayand when the legislators rushed to the windows they saw a long column of flame where once there had risen the familiar silhouettes of the ore docks of danconia copper the ore docks had been blown to bits the chairman averted panic and called the session to order the act of nationalization was read to the assembly to the sound of fire alarm sirens and distant cries it was a gray morning dark with rain clouds the explosion had broken an electric transmitterso that the assembly voted on the measure by the light of candles while the red glow of the fire kept sweeping over the great vaulted ceiling above their heads but more terrible a shock came later when the legislators called a hasty recess to announce to the nation the good news that the people now owned danconia copper while they were voting word had come from the closest and farthest points of the globe that there was no danconia copper left on earth ladies and gentlemen not anywhere in that same instant on the stroke of ten by an infernal marvel of synchronization every property of danconia copper on the face of the globe from chile to siam to spain to pottsville montana had been blown up and swept away the danconia workers everywhere had been handed their last pay checks in cash at nine am and by ninethirty had been moved off the premises the ore docks the smelters the laboratories the office buildings were demolished nothing was left of the danconia ore ships which had been in portand only lifeboats carrying the crews were left of those ships which had been at sea as to the danconia mines some were buried under tons of blasted rock while others were found not to be worth the price of blasting an astounding number of these mines as reports pouring in seem to indicate had continued to be run even though exhausted years ago among the thousands of danconia employees the police have found no one with any knowledge of how this monstrous plot had been conceived organized and carried out but the cream of the danconia staff are not here any longer the most efficient of the executives mineralogists engineers superintendents have vanishedall the men upon whom the peoples state had been counting to carry on the work and cushion the process of readjustment the most ablecorrection the most selfishof the men are gone reports from the various banks indicate that there are no danconia accounts left anywhere the money has been spent down to the last penny ladies and gentlemen the danconia fortunethe greatest fortune on earth the legendary fortune of the centurieshas ceased to exist in place of the golden dawn of a new age the peoples states of chile and argentina are left with a pile of rubble and hordes of unemployed on their hands no clue has been found to the fate or the whereabouts of senor francisco danconia he has vanished leaving nothing behind him not even a message of farewell thank you my darlingthank you in the name of the last of us even if you will not hear it and will not care to hear it was not a sentence but the silent emotion of a prayer in her mind addressed to the laughing face of a boy she had known at sixteen then she noticed that she was clinging to the radio as if the faint electric beat within it still held a tie to the only living force on earth which it had transmitted for a few brief moments and which now filled the room where all else was dead as distant remnants of the explosions wreckage she noticed a sound that came from jim partmoan partscream partgrowlthen the sight of jims shoulders shaking over a telephone and his distorted voice screaming but rodrigo you said it was safe rodrigooh goddo you know how much id sunk into itthen the shriek of another phone on his desk and his voice snarling into another receiver his hand still clutching the first shut your trap orren what are you to do what do i care god damn you there were people rushing into the office the telephones were screaming and alternating between pleas and curses jim kept yelling into one receiver get me santiago get washington to get me santiago distantly as on the margin of her mind she could see what sort of game the men behind the shrieking phones had played and lost they seemed far away like tiny commas squirming on the white field under the lens of a microscope she wondered how they could ever expect to be taken seriously when a francisco danconia was possible on earth she saw the glare of the explosion in every face she met through the rest of the dayand in every face she passed in the darkness of the streets that evening if francisco had wanted a worthy funeral pyre for danconia copper she thought he had succeeded there it was in the streets of new york city the only city on earth still able to understand itin the faces of people in their whispers the whispers crackling tensely like small tongues of fire the faces lighted by a look that was both solemn and frantic the shadings of expressions appearing to sway and weave as if cast by a distant flame some frightened some angry most of them uneasy uncertain expectant but all of them acknowledging a fact much beyond an industrial catastrophe all of them knowing what it meant though none would name us meaning all of them carrying a touch of laughter a laughter of amusement and defiance the bitter laughter of perishing victims who feel that they are avenged she saw it in the face of hank rearden when she met him for dinner that evening as his tall confident figure walked toward herthe only figure that seemed at home in the costly setting of a distinguished restaurantshe saw the look of eagerness fighting the sternness of his features the look of a young boy still open to the enchantment of the unexpected he did not speak of this days event but she knew that it was the only image in his mind they had been meeting whenever he came to the city spending a brief rare evening togetherwith their past still alive in their silent acknowledgmentwith no future in their work and in their common struggle but with the knowledge that they were allies gaining support from the fact of each others existence he did not want to mention todays event he did not want to speak of francisco but she noticed as they sat at the table that the strain of a resisted smile kept pulling at the hollows of his cheeks she knew whom he meant when he said suddenly his voice soft and low with the weight of admiration he did keep his oath didnt he his oath she asked startled thinking of the inscription on the temple of atlantis he said to me i swearby the woman i lovethat i am your friend he was he is he shook his head i have no right to think of him i have no right to accept what hes done as an act in my defense and yet he stopped but it was hank in defense of all of usand of you most of all he looked away out at the city they sat at the side of the room with a sheet of glass as an invisible protection against the sweep of space and streets sixty floors below the city seemed abnormally distant it lay flattened down to the pool of its lowest stories a few blocks away its tower merging into darkness the calendar hung at the level of their faces not as a small disturbing rectangle but as an enormous screen eerily close and large flooded by the dead white glow of light projected through an empty film empty but for the letters september rearden steel is now working at capacity he was saying indifferently theyve lifted the production quotas off my millsfor the next five minutes i guess i dont know how many of their own regulations theyve suspended i dont think they know it either they dont bother keeping track of legality any longer im sure im a lawbreaker on five or six counts which nobody could prove or disproveall i know is that the gangster of the moment told me to go full steam ahead he shrugged when another gangster kicks him out tomorrow ill probably be shut down as penalty for illegal operation but according to the plan of the present splitsecond theyve begged me to keep pouring my metal in any amount and by any means i choose she noticed the occasional surreptitious glances that people were throwing in their direction she had noticed it before ever since her broadcast ever since the two of them had begun to appear in public together instead of the disgrace he had dreaded there was an air of awed uncertainty in peoples manneruncertainty of their own moral precepts awe in the presence of two persons who dared to be certain of being right people were looking at them with anxious curiosity with envy with respect with the fear of offending an unknown proudly rigorous standard some almost with an air of apology that seemed to say please forgive us for being married there were some who had a look of angry malice and a few who had a look of admiration dagny he asked suddenly do you suppose hes in new york no ive called the waynefalkland they told me that the lease on his suite had expired a month ago and he did not renew it theyre looking for him all over the world he said smiling theyll never find him the smile vanished neither will i his voice slipped back to the flat gray tone of duty well the mills are working but im not im doing nothing but running around the country like a scavenger searching for illegal ways to purchase raw materials hiding sneaking lyingjust to get a few tons of ore or coal or copper they havent lifted their regulations off my raw materials they know that im pouring more metal than the quotas they give me could produce they dont care he added they think i do tired hank bored to death there was a time she thought when his mind his energy his inexhaustible resourcefulness had been given to the task of a producer devising better ways to deal with nature now they were switched to the task of a criminal outwitting men she wondered how long a man could endure a change of that kind its becoming almost impossible to get iron ore he said indifferently then added his voice suddenly alive now its going to be completely impossible to get copper he was grinning she wondered how long a man could continue to work against himself to work when his deepest desire was not to succeed but to fail she understood the connection of his thoughts when he said ive never told you but ive met ragnar danneskjold he told me what where did you ever he stopped of course he said his voice tense and low he would be one of them you would have met him dagny what are they like those men who no dont answer me in a moment he added so ive met one of their agents youve met two of them his response was a span of total stillness of course he said dully i knew it i just wouldnt admit to myself that i knew he was their recruiting agent wasnt he one of their earliest and best he chuckled it was a sound of bitterness and longing that night when they got ken danagger i thought that they had not sent anyone after me the effort by which he made his face grow rigid was almost like the slow resisted turn of a key locking a sunlit room he could not permit himself to examine after a while he said impassively dagny that new rail we discussed last monthi dont think ill be able to deliver it they havent lifted their regulations off my output theyre still controlling my sales and disposing of my metal as they please but the bookkeeping is in such a snarl that im smuggling a few thousand tons into the black market every week i think they know it theyre pretending not to they dont want to antagonize me right now but you see ive been shipping every ton i could snatch to some emergency customers of mine dagny i was in minnesota last month ive seen whats going on there the country will starve not next year but this winter unless a few of us act and act fast there are no grain reserves left anywhere with nebraska gone oklahoma wrecked north dakota abandoned kansas barely subsistingthere isnt going to be any wheat this winter not for the city of new york nor for any eastern city minnesota is our last granary theyve had two bad years in succession but they have a bumper crop this falland they have to be able to harvest it have you had a chance to take a look at the condition of the farmequipment industry theyre not big enough any of them to keep a staff of efficient gangsters in washington or to pay percentages to pullpeddlers so they havent been getting many allocations of materials twothirds of them have shut down and the rest are about to and farms are perishing all over the countryfor lack of tools you should have seen those farmers in minnesota theyve been spending more time fixing old tractors that cant be fixed than plowing their fields i dont know how they managed to survive till last spring i dont know how they managed to plant their wheat but they did they did there was a look of intensity on his face as if he were contemplating a rare forgotten sight a vision of menand she knew what motive was still holding him to his job dagny they had to have tools for their harvest ive been selling all the metal i could steal out of my own mills to the manufacturers of farm equipment on credit theyve been sending the equipment to minnesota as fast as they could put it out selling it in the same wayillegally and on credit but they will be paid this fall and so will i charity hell were helping producersand what tenacious producersnot lousy mooching consumers were giving loans not alms were supporting ability not need ill be damned if ill stand by and let those men be destroyed while the pull peddlers grow rich he was looking at the image of a sight he had seen in minnesota the silhouette of an abandoned factory with the light of the sunset streaming unopposed through the holes of its windows and the cracks of its roof with the remnant of a sign ward harvester company oh i know he said well save them this winter but the looters will devour them next year still well save them this winter well thats why i wont be able to smuggle any rail for you not in the immediate futureand theres nothing left to us but the immediate future i dont know what is the use of feeding a country if it loses its railroadsbut what is the use of railroads where there is no food what is the use anyway its all right hank well last with such rail as we have for she stopped for a month for the winteri hope cutting across their silence a shrill voice reached them from another table and they turned to look at a man who had the jittery manner of a cornered gangster about to reach for his gun an act of antisocial destruction he was snarling to a sullen companion at a time when theres such a desperate shortage of copper we cant permit it we cant permit it to be true rearden turned abruptly to look off at the city id give anything to know where he is he said his voice low just to know where he is right now at this moment what would you do if you knew it he dropped his hand in a gesture of futility wouldnt approach him the only homage i can still pay him is not to cry for forgiveness where no forgiveness is possible they remained silent they listened to the voices around them to the splinters of panic trickling through the luxurious room she had not been aware that the same presence seemed to be an invisible guest at every table that the same subject kept breaking through the attempts at any other conversation people sat in a manner not quite of cringing but as if they found the room too large and too exposeda room of glass blue velvet aluminum and gentle lighting they looked as if they had come to this room at the price of countless evasions to let it help them pretend that theirs was still a civilized existencebut an act oј primeval violence had blasted the nature of their world into the open and they were no longer able not to see how could he how could he a woman was demanding with petulant terror he had no right to do it it was an accident said a young man with a staccato voice and an odor of public payroll it was a chain of coincidences as any statistical curve of probabilities can easily prove it is unpatriotic to spread rumors exaggerating the power of the peoples enemies right and wrong is all very well for academic conversations said a woman with a schoolroom voice and a barroom mouth but how can anybody take his own ideas seriously enough to destroy a fortune when people need it f dont understand it an old man was saying with quavering bitterness after centuries of efforts to curb mans innate brutality after centuries of teaching training and indoctrination with the gentle and the humane a womans bewildered voice rose uncertainly and trailed off i thought we were living in an age of brotherhood im scared a young girl was repeating im scared oh i dont know im just scared he couldnt have done it he did but why i refuse to believe it its not human but why just a worthless playboy but why the muffled scream of a woman across the room and some half grasped signal on the edge of dagnys vision came simultaneously and made her whirl to look at the city the calendar was run by a mechanism locked in a room behind the screen unrolling the same film year after year projecting the dates in steady rotation in changeless rhythm never moving but on the stroke of midnight the speed of dagnys turn gave her time to see a phenomenon as unexpected as if a planet had reversed its orbit in the sky she saw the words september moving upward and vanishing past the edge of the screen then written across the enormous page stopping time as a last message to the world and to the worlds motor which was new york she saw the lines of a sharp intransigent handwriting brother you asked for it francisco domingo carlos andres sebastian danconia she did not know which shock was greater the sight of the message or the sound of reardens laughterrearden standing on his feet in full sight and hearing of the room behind him laughing above their moans of panic laughing in greeting in salute in acceptance of the gift he had tried to reject in release in triumph in surrender on the evening of september a copper wire broke in montana stopping the motor of a loading crane on a spur track of taggart transcontinental at the rim of the stanford copper mine the mine had been working on three shifts its days and nights blending into a single stretch of struggle to lose no minute no drop of copper it could squeeze from the shelves of a mountain into the nations industrial desert the crane broke down at the task of loading a train it stopped abruptly and hung still against the evening sky between a string of empty cars and piles of suddenly immovable ore the men of the railroad and of the mine stopped in dazed bewilderment they found that in all the complexity of their equipment among the drills the motors the derricks the delicate gauges the ponderous floodlights beating down into the pits and ridges of a mountainthere was no wire to mend the crane they stopped like men on an ocean liner propelled by tenthousandhorsepower generators but perishing for lack of a safety pin the station agent a young man with a swift body and a brusque voice stripped the wiring from the station building and set the crane in motion againand while the ore went clattering to fill the cars the light of candles came trembling through the dusk from the windows of the station minnesota eddie said dagny grimly closing the drawer of her special file tell the minnesota division to ship half their stock of wire to montana but good god dagnywith the peak of the harvest rush approaching theyll hold through iti think we dont dare lose a single supplier of copper but i have screamed james taggart when she reminded him once more i have obtained for you the top priority on copper wire the first claim the uppermost ration level ive given you all the cards certificates documents and requisitionswhat else do you want the copper wire ive done all i could nobody can blame me she did not argue the afternoon newspaper was lying on his deskand she was staring at an item on the back page an emergency state tax had been passed in california for the relief of the states unemployed in the amount of fifty per cent of any local corporations gross income ahead of other taxes the california oil companies had gone out of business dont worry mr rearden said an unctuous voice over a long distance telephone line from washington i just wanted to assure you that you will not have to worry about what asked rearden baffled about that temporary bit of confusion in california well straighten it out in no time it was an act of illegal insurrection their state government had no right to impose local taxes detrimental to national taxes well negotiate an equitable arrangement immediatelybut in the meantime if you have been disturbed by any unpatriotic rumors about the california oil companies i just wanted to tell you that rearden steel has been placed in the top category of essential need with first claim upon any oil available anywhere in the nation very top category mr reardenso i just wanted you to know that you wont have to worry about the problem of fuel this winter rearden hung up the telephone receiver with a frown of worry not about the problem of fuel and the end of the california oil fieldsdisasters of this kind had become habitualbut about the fact that the washington planners found it necessary to placate him this was new he wondered what it meant through the years of his struggle he had learned that an apparently causeless antagonism was not hard to deal with but an apparently causeless solicitude was an ugly danger the same wonder struck him again when walking down an alley between the mill structures he caught sight of a slouching figure whose posture combined an air of insolence with an air of expecting to be swatted it was his brother philip ever since he had moved to philadelphia rearden had not visited his former home and had not heard a word from his family whose bills he went on paying then inexplicably twice in the last few weeks he had caught philip wandering through the mills for no apparent reason he had been unable to tell whether philip was sneaking to avoid him or waiting to catch his attention it had looked like both he had been unable to discover any clue to philips purpose only some incomprehensible solicitude of a kind philip had never displayed before the first time in answer to his startled what are you doing here philip had said vaguely well i know that you dont like me to come to your office what do you want oh nothing but well mother is worried about you mother can call me any time she wishes philip had not answered but had proceeded to question him in an unconvincingly casual manner about his work his health his business the questions had kept hitting oddly beside the point not questions about business but more about his reardens feelings toward business rearden had cut him short and waved him away but had been left with the small nagging sense of an incident that remained inexplicable the second time philip had said as sole explanation we just want to know how you feel whos we why mother and i these are difficult times and well mother wants to know how you feel about it all tell her that i dont the words had seemed to hit philip in some peculiar manner almost as if this were the one answer he dreaded get out of here rearden had ordered wearily and the next time you want to see me make an appointment and come to my office but dont come unless you have something to say this is not a place where one discusses feelings mine or anybody elses philip had not called for an appointmentbut now there he was again slouching among the giant shapes of the furnaces with an air of guilt and snobbishness together as if he were both snooping and slumming but i do have something to say i do he cried hastily in answer to the angry frown on reardens face why didnt you come to my office you dont want me in your office i dont want you here either but im only im only trying to be considerate and not to take your time when youre so busy and you are very busy arent you and and well i just wanted to catch you in a spare moment to talk to you about what i well i need a job he said it belligerently and drew back a little rearden stood looking at him blankly henry i want a job i mean here at the mills i want you to give me something to do i need a job i need to earn my living im tired of alms he was groping for something to say his voice both offended and pleading as if the necessity to justify the plea were an unfair imposition upon him i want a livelihood of my own im not asking you for charity im asking you to give me a chance this is a factory philip not a gambling joint uh we dont take chances or give them im asking you to give me a job why should i because i need it rearden pointed to the red spurts of flame shooting from the black shape of a furnace shooting safely into space four hundred feet of steelclayandsteamembodied thought above them i needed that furnace philip it wasnt my need that gave it to me philips face assumed a look of not having heard youre not officially supposed to hire anybody bat thats just a technicality if youll put me on my friends will okay it without any trouble and something about reardens eyes made him stop abruptly then ask in an angrily impatient voice well whats the matter what have i said thats wrong what you havent said i beg your pardon what youre squirming to leave unmentioned what that youd be of no use to me whatever is that what you philip started with automatic righteousness but stopped and did not finish yes said rearden smiling thats what i think of first philips eyes oozed away when he spoke his voice sounded as if it were darting about at random picking stray sentences everybody is entitled to a livelihood how am i going to get it if nobody gives me my chance how did i get mine i wasnt born owning a steel plant was i i can do anything you canif youll teach me who taught me why do you keep saying that im not talking about you i am in a moment philip muttered what do you have to worry about its not your livelihood thats in question rearden pointed to the figures of men in the steaming rays of the furnace can you do what theyre doing i dont see what youre what will happen if i put you there and you ruin a heat of steel for me whats more important that your damn steel gets poured or that i eat how do you propose to eat if the steel doesnt get poured philips face assumed a look of reproach im not in a position to argue with you right now since you hold the upper hand then dont argue uh keep your mouth shut and get out of here but i meant he stopped rearden chuckled you meant that its i who should keep my mouth shut because i hold the upper hand and should give in to you because you hold no hand at all thats a peculiarly crude way of stating a moral principle but thats what your moral principle amounts to doesnt it you cant discuss morality in materialistic terms were discussing a job in a steel plantand boy is that a materialistic place philips body drew a shade tighter together and his eyes became a shade more glazed as if in fear of the place around him in resentment of its sight in an effort not to concede its reality he said in the soft stubborn whine of a voodoo incantation its a moral imperative universally conceded in our day and age that every man is entitled to a job his voice rose im entitled to it you are go on then collect your claim uh collect your job pick it off the bush where you think it grows i mean you mean that it doesnt you mean that you need it but cant create it you mean that youre entitled to a job which i must create for you yes and if i dont the silence went stretching through second after second i dont understand you said philip his voice had the angry bewilderment of a man who recites the formulas of a welltested role but keeps getting the wrong cues in answer i dont understand why one cant talk to you any more i dont understand what sort of theory youre propounding and oh yes you do as if refusing to believe that the formulas could fail philip burst out with since when did you take to abstract philosophy youre only a businessman youre not qualified to deal with questions of principle you ought to leave it to the experts who have conceded for centuries cut it philip whats the gimmick gimmick why the sudden ambition well at a time like this like what well every man has the right to have some means of support and and not be left to be tossed aside when things are so uncertain a mans got to have some security some foothold i mean at a time like this if anything happened to you id have no what do you expect to happen to me oh i dont i dont the cry was oddly incomprehensibly genuine i dont expect anything to happen do you such as what how do i know but ive got nothing except the pittance you give me and and you might change your mind any time i might and i havent any hold on you at all why did it take you that many years to realize it and start worrying why now because because youve changed you you used to have a sense of duty and moral responsibility but youre losing it youre losing it arent you rearden stood studying him silently there was something peculiar in philips manner of sliding toward questions as if his words were accidental but the too casual the faintly insistent questions were the key to his purpose well ill be glad to take the burden off your shoulders if im a burden to you philip snapped suddenly just give me a job and your conscience wont have to bother you about me any longer it doesnt thats what i mean you dont care you dont care what becomes of any of us do you of whom why mother and me and and mankind in general but im not going to appeal to your better self i know that youre ready to ditch me at a moments notice so youre lying philip thats not what youre worried about if it were youd be angling for a chunk of cash not for a job not no i want a job the cry was immediate and almost frantic dont try to buy me off with cash i want a job pull yourself together you poor louse do you hear what youre saying philip spit out his answer with impotent hatred you cant talk to me that way can you i only to buy you off why should i try to buy you offinstead of kicking you out as i should have years ago well after all im your brother what is that supposed to mean ones supposed to have some sort of feeling for ones brother do you philips mouth swelled petulantly he did not answer he waited rearden let him wait philip muttered youre supposed at least to have some consideration for my feelings but you havent have you for mine yours your feelings it was not malice in philips voice but worse it was a genuine indignant astonishment you havent any feelings youve never felt anything at all youve never suffered it was as if a sum of years hit rearden in the face by means of a sensation and a sight the exact sensation of what he had felt in the cab of the first trains engine on the john galt lineand the sight of philips eyes the pale halfliquid eyes presenting the uttermost of human degradation an uncontested pain and with the obscene insolence of a skeleton toward a living being demanding that this pain be held as the highest of values youve never suffered the eyes were saying to him accusinglywhile he was seeing the night in his office when his ore mines were taken away from himthe moment when he had signed the gift certificate surrendering rearden metalthe month of days inside a plane that searched for the remains of dagnys body youve never suffered the eyes were saying with selfrighteous scornwhile he remembered the sensation of proud chastity with which he had fought through those moments refusing to surrender to pain a sensation made of his love of his loyalty of his knowledge that joy is the goal of existence and joy is not to be stumbled upon but to be achieved and the act of treason is to let its vision drown in the swamp of the moments torture youve never suffered the dead stare of the eyes was saying youve never felt anything because only to suffer is to feeltheres no such thing as joy theres only pain and the absence of pain only pain and the zero when one feels nothingi suffer im twisted by suffering im made of undiluted suffering thats my purity thats my virtueand yours you the untwisted one you the uncomplaining yours is to relieve me of my paincut your unsuffering body to patch up mine cut your unfeeling soul to stop mine from feelingand well achieve the ultimate ideal the triumph over life the zero he was seeing the nature of those who for centuries had not recoiled from the preachers of annihilationhe was seeing the nature of the enemies he had been fighting all his life philip he said get out of here his voice was like a ray of sunlight in a morgue it was the plain dry daily voice of a businessman the sound of health addressed to an enemy one could not honor by anger nor even by horror and dont ever try to enter these mills again because there will be orders at every gate to throw you out if you try it well after all said philip in the angry and cautious tone of a tentative threat i could have my friends assign me to a job here and compel you to accept it rearden had started to go but he stopped and turned to look at his brother philips moment of grasping a sudden revelation was not accomplished by means of thought but by means of that dark sensation which was his only mode of consciousness he felt a sensation of terror squeezing his throat shivering down into his stomachhe was seeing the spread of the mills with the roving streamers of flame with the ladles of molten metal sailing through space on delicate cables with open pits the color of glowing coal with cranes coming at his head pounding past holding tons of steel by the invisible power of magnetsand he knew that he was afraid of this place afraid to the death that he dared not move without the protection and guidance of the man before himthen he looked at the tall straight figure standing casually still the figure with the unflinching eyes whose sight had cut through rock and flame to build this placeand then he knew how easily the man he was proposing to compel could let a single bucket of metal tilt over a second ahead of its time or let a single crane drop its load a foot short of its goal and there would be nothing left of him of philip the claimantand his only protection lay in the fact that his mind would think of such actions but the mind of hank rearden would not but wed better keep it on a friendly basis said philip youd better said rearden and walked away men who worship painthought rearden staring at the image of the enemies he had never been able to understandtheyre men who worship pain it seemed monstrous yet peculiarly devoid of importance he felt nothing it was like trying to summon emotion toward inanimate objects toward refuse sliding down a mountainside to crush him one could flee from the slide or build retaining walls against it or be crushed but one could not grant any anger indignation or moral concern to the senseless motions of the unliving no worse he thoughtthe antiliving the same sense of detached unconcern remained with him while he sat in a philadelphia courtroom and watched men perform the motions which were to grant him his divorce he watched them utter mechanical generalities recite vague phrases of fraudulent evidence play an intricate game of stretching words to convey no facts and no meaning he had paid them to do ithe whom the law permitted no other way to gain his freedom no right to state the facts and plead the truththe law which delivered his fate not to objective rules objectively defined but to the arbitrary mercy of a judge with a wizened face and a look of empty cunning lillian was not present in the courtroom her attorney made gestures once in a while with the energy of letting water run through his fingers they all knew the verdict in advance and they knew its reason no other reason had existed for years where no standards save whim had existed they seemed to regard it as their rightful prerogative they acted as if the purpose of the procedure were not to try a case but to give them jobs as if their jobs were to recite the appropriate formulas with no responsibility to know what the formulas accomplished as if a courtroom were the one place where questions of right and wrong were irrelevant and they the men in charge of dispensing justice were safely wise enough to know that no justice existed they acted like savages performing a ritual devised to set them free of objective reality but the ten years of his marriage had been real he thoughtand these were the men who assumed the power to dispose of it to decide whether he would have a chance of contentment on earth or be condemned to torture for the rest of his lifetime he remembered the austerely pitiless respect he had felt for his contract of marriage for all his contracts and all his legal obligationsand he saw what sort of legality his scrupulous observance was expected to serve he noticed that the puppets of the courtroom had started by glancing at him in the sly wise manner of fellow conspirators sharing a common guilt mutually safe from moral condemnation then when they observed that he was the only man in the room who looked steadily straight at anyones face he saw resentment growing in their eyes incredulously he realized what it was that had been expected of him he the victim chained bound gagged and left with no recourse save to bribery had been expected to believe that the farce he had purchased was a process of law that the edicts enslaving him had moral validity that he was guilty of corrupting the integrity of the guardians of justice and that the blame was his not theirs it was like blaming the victim of a holdup for corrupting the integrity of the thug and yethe thought through all the generations of political extortion it was not the looting bureaucrats who had taken the blame but the chained industrialists not the men who peddled legal favors but the men who were forced to buy them and through all those generations of crusades against corruption the remedy had always been not the liberating of the victims but the granting of wider powers for extortion to the extortionists the only guilt of the victims he thought had been that they accepted it as guilt when he walked out of the courtroom into the chilly drizzle of a gray afternoon he felt as if he had been divorced not only from lillian but from the whole of the human society that supported the procedure he had witnessed the face of his attorney an elderly man of the oldfashioned school wore an expression that made it look as if he longed to take a bath say hank he asked as sole comment is there something the looters are anxious to get from you right now not that i know of why the thing went too smoothly there were a few points at which i expected pressure and hints for some extras but the boys sailed past and took no advantage of it looks to me as if orders had come from on high to treat you gently and let you have your way are they planning something new against your mills not that i know of said rearden and was astonished to hear in his mind not that i care it was on the same afternoon at the mills that he saw the wet nurse hurrying toward hima gangling coltish figure with a peculiar mixture of brusqueness awkwardness and decisiveness mr rearden i would like to speak to you his voice was diffident yet oddly firm go ahead theres something i want to ask you the boys face was solemn and taut i want you to know that i know you should refuse me but i want to ask it just the same and and if its presumptuous then just tell me to go to hell okay try it mr rearden would you give me a job it was the effort to sound normal that betrayed the days of struggle behind the question i want to quit what im doing and go to work i mean real workin steel making like i thought id started to once i want to earn my keep im tired of being a bedbug rearden could not resist smiling and reminding him in the tone of a quotation now why use such words nonabsolute if we dont use ugly words we wont have any ugliness and but he saw the desperate earnestness of the boys face and stopped his smile vanishing i mean it mr rearden and i know what the word means and its the right word im tired of being paid with your money to do nothing except make it impossible for you to make any money at all i know that anyone who works today is only a sucker for bastards like me but well god damn it id rather be a sucker if thats all theres left to be his voice had risen to a cry i beg your pardon mr rearden he said stiffly looking away in a moment he went on in his woodenly unemotional tone i want to get out of the deputydirectorofdistribution racket i dont know that id be of much use to you ive got a college diploma in metallurgy but thats not worth the paper its printed on but i think ive learned a little about the work in the two years ive been hereand if you could use me at all as sweeper or scrap man or whatever youd trust me with id tell them where to put the deputy directorship and id go to work for you tomorrow next week this minute or whenever you say he avoided looking at rearden not in a manner of evasion but as if he had no right to do it why were you afraid to ask me said rearden gently the boy glanced at him with indignant astonishment as if the answer were selfevident because after the way i started here and the way i acted and what im deputy of if i come asking you for favors you ought to kick me in the teeth you have learned a great deal in the two years youve been here no i he glanced at rearden understood looked away and said woodenly yeah if thats what you mean listen kid id give you a job this minute and id trust you with more than a sweepers job if it were up to me but have you forgotten the unification board im not allowed to hire you and youre not allowed to quit sure men are quitting all the time and were hiring others under phony names and fancy papers proving that theyve worked here for years you know it and thanks for keeping your mouth shut but do you think that if i hired you that way your friends in washington would miss it the boy shook his head slowly do you think that if you quit their service to become a sweeper they wouldnt understand your reason the boy nodded would they let you go the boy shook his head after a moment he said in a tone of forlorn astonishment i hadnt thought of that at all mr rearden i forgot them i kept thinking of whether youd want me or not and that the only thing that counted was your decision i know and it is the only thing that counts in fact yes nonabsolute in fact the boys mouth jerked suddenly into the brief mirthless twist of a smile i guess im tied worse than any sucker yes theres nothing you can do now except apply to the unification board for permission to change your job ill support your application if you want to tryonly i dont think theyll grant it i dont think theyll let you work for me no they wont if you maneuver enough and lie enough they might permit you to transfer to a private jobwith some other steel company no i dont want to go anywhere else i dont want to leave this place he stood looking off at the invisible vapor of rain over the flame of the furnaces after a while he said quietly id better stay put i guess id better go on being a deputy looter besides if i left god only knows what sort of bastard theyd saddle you with in my place he turned theyre up to something mr rearden i dont know what it is but theyre getting ready to spring something on you what i dont know but theyve been watching every opening here in the last few weeks every desertion and slipping their own gang in a queer sort of gang tooreal goons some of them that id swear never stepped inside a steel plant before ive had orders to get as many of our boys in as possible they wouldnt tell me why i dont know what it is theyre planning ive tried to pump them but theyre acting pretty cagey about it i dont think they trust me any more im losing the right touch i guess all i know is theyre getting set to pull something here thanks for warning me ill try to get the dope on it ill try my damndest to get it in time he turned brusquely and started off but stopped mr rearden if it were up to you you would have hired me i would have gladly and at once thank you mr rearden he said his voice solemn and low then walked away rearden stood looking after him seeing with a tearing smile of pity what it was that the exrelativist the expragmatist the examoralist was carrying away with him for consolation on the afternoon of september a copper wire broke in minnesota stopping the belts of a grain elevator at a small country station of taggart transcontinental a flood of wheat was moving down the highways the roads the abandoned trails of the countryside emptying thousands of acres of farmland upon the fragile dams of the railroads stations it was moving day and night the first trickles growing into streams then rivers then torrentsmoving on palsied trucks with coughing tubercular motorson wagons pulled by the rusty skeletons of starving horseson carts pulled by oxenon the nerves and last energy of men who had lived through two years of disaster for the triumphant reward of this autumns giant harvest men who had patched their trucks and carts with wire blankets ropes and sleepless nights to make them hold together for this one more journey to carry the grain and collapse at destination but to give their owners a chance at survival every year at this season another movement had gone clicking across the country drawing freight cars from all corners of the continent to the minnesota division of taggart transcontinental the beat of train wheels preceding the creak of the wagons like an advance echo rigorously planned ordered and timed to meet the flood the minnesota division drowsed through the year to come to violent life for the weeks of the harvest fourteen thousand freight cars had jammed its yards each year fifteen thousand were expected this time the first of the wheat trains had started to channel the flood into the hungry flour mills then bakeries then stomachs of the nationbut every train car and storage elevator counted and there was no minute or inch of space to spare eddie willers watched dagnys face as she went through the cards of her emergency file he could tell the content of the cards by her expression the terminal she said quietly closing the file phone the terminal downstairs and have them ship half their stock of wire to minnesota eddie said nothing and obeyed he said nothing the morning when he put on her desk a telegram from the taggart office in washington informing them of the directive which due to the critical shortage of copper ordered government agents to seize all copper mines and operate them as a public utility well she said dropping the telegram into the wastebasket thats the end of montana she said nothing when james taggart announced to her that he was issuing an order to discontinue all dining cars on taggart trains we cant afford it any longer he explained weve always lost money on those goddamn diners and when theres no food to get when restaurants are closing because they cant grab hold of a pound of horse meat anywhere how can railroads be expected to do it why in hell should we have to feed the passengers anyway theyre lucky if we give them transportation theyd travel in cattle cars if necessary let em pack their own box lunches what do we caretheyve got no other trains to take the telephone on her desk had become not a voice of business but an alarm siren for the desperate appeals of disaster miss taggart we have no copper wire nails miss taggart plain nails could you tell somebody to send us a keg of nails can you find any paint miss taggart any sort of waterproof paint anywhere but thirty million dollars of subsidy money from washington had been plowed into project soybeanan enormous acreage in louisiana where a harvest of soybeans was ripening as advocated and organized by emma chalmers for the purpose of reconditioning the dietary habits of the nation emma chalmers better known as kips ma was an old sociologist who had hung about washington for years as other women of her age and type hang about barrooms for some reason which nobody could define the death of her son in the tunnel catastrophe had given her in washington an aura of martyrdom heightened by her recent conversion to buddhism the soybean is a much more sturdy nutritious and economical plant than all the extravagant foods which our wasteful selfindulgent diet has conditioned us to expect kips ma had said over the radio her voice always sounded as if it were falling in drops not of water but of mayonnaise soybeans make an excellent substitute for bread meat cereals and coffeeand if all of us were compelled to adopt soybeans as our staple diet it would solve the national food crisis and make it possible to feed more people the greatest food for the greatest numberthats my slogan at a time of desperate public need its our duty to sacrifice our luxurious tastes and eat our way back to prosperity by adapting ourselves to the simple wholesome foodstuff on which the peoples of the orient have so nobly subsisted for centuries theres a great deal that we could learn from the peoples of the orient copper tubing miss taggart could you get some copper tubing for us somewhere the voices were pleading over her telephone rail spikes miss taggart screwdrivers miss taggart light bulbs miss taggart theres no electric light bulbs to be had anywhere within two hundred miles of us but five million dollars was being spent by the office of morale conditioning on the peoples opera company which traveled through the country giving free performances to people who on one meal a day could not afford the energy to walk to the opera house seven million dollars had been granted to a psychologist in charge of a project to solve the world crisis by research into the nature of brotherlove ten million dollars had been granted to the manufacturer of a new electronic cigarette lighterbut there were no cigarettes in the shops of the country there were flashlights on the market but no batteries there were radios but no tubes there were cameras but no film the production of airplanes had been declared temporarily suspended air travel for private purposes had been forbidden and reserved exclusively for missions of public need an industrialist traveling to save his factory was not considered as publicly needed and could not get aboard a plane an official traveling to collect taxes was and could people are stealing nuts and bolts out of rail plates miss taggart stealing them at night and our stock is running out the division storehouse is bare what are we to do miss taggart but a supercolorfourfootscreen television set was being erected for tourists in a peoples park in washingtonand a supercyclotron for the study of cosmic rays was being erected at the state science institute to be completed in ten years the trouble with our modern world dr robert stadler said over the radio at the ceremonies launching the construction of the cyclotron is that too many people think too much it is the cause of all our current fears and doubts an enlightened citizenry should abandon the superstitious worship of logic and the outmoded reliance on reason just as laymen leave medicine to doctors and electronics to engineers so people who are not qualified to think should leave all thinking to the experts and have faith in the experts higher authority only experts are able to understand the discoveries of modern science which have proved that thought is an illusion and that the mind is a myth this age of misery is gods punishment to man for the sin of relying on his mind snarled the triumphant voices of mystics of every sect and sort on street corners in rainsoaked tents in crumbling temples this world ordeal is the result of mans attempt to live by reason this is where thinking logic and science have brought you and theres to be no salvation until men realize that their mortal mind is impotent to solve their problems and go back to faith faith in god faith in a higher authority and confronting her daily there was the final product of it all the heir and collectorcuffy meigs the man impervious to thought cuffy meigs strode through the offices of taggart transcontinental wearing a semimilitary tunic and slapping a shiny leather briefcase against his shiny leather leggings he carried an automatic pistol in one pocket and a rabbits foot in the other cuffy meigs tried to avoid her his manner was part scorn as if he considered her an impractical idealist part superstitious awe as if she possessed some incomprehensible power with which he preferred not to tangle he acted as if her presence did not belong to his view of a railroad yet as if hers were the one presence he dared not challenge there was a touch of impatient resentment in his manner toward jim as if it were jims duty to deal with her and to protect him just as he expected jim to keep the railroad in running order and leave him free for activities of more practical a nature so he expected jim to keep her in line as part of the equipment beyond the window of her office like a patch of adhesive plaster stuck over a wound on the sky the page of the calendar hung blank in the distance the calendar had never been repaired since the night of franciscos farewell the officials who had rushed to the tower that night had knocked the calendars motor to a stop while tearing the film out of the projector they had found the small square of franciscos message pasted into the strip of numbered days but who had pasted it there who had entered the locked room and when and how was never discovered by the three commissions still investigating the case pending the outcome of their efforts the page hung blank and still above the city it was blank on the afternoon of september when the telephone rang in her office a man from minnesota said the voice of her secretary she had told her secretary that she would accept all calls of this kind they were the appeals for help and her only source of information at a time when the voices of railroad officials uttered nothing but sounds designed to avoid communication the voices of nameless men were her last link to the system the last sparks of reason and tortured honesty flashing briefly through the miles of taggart track miss taggart it is not my place to call you but nobody else will said the voice that came on the wire this time the voice sounded young and too calm in another day or two a disasters going to happen here the like of which theyve never seen and they wont be able to hide it any longer only it will be too late by then and maybe its too late already what is it who are you one of your employees of the minnesota division miss taggart in another day or two the trains will stop running out of hereand you know what that means at the height of the harvest at the height of the biggest harvest weve ever had theyll stop because we have no cars the harvest freight cars have not been sent to us this year what did you say she felt as if minutes went by between the words of the unnatural voice that did not sound like her own the cars have not been sent fifteen thousand should have been here by now as far as i could learn about eight thousand cars is all we got ive been calling division headquarters for a week theyve been telling me not to worry last time they told me to mind my own damn business every shed silo elevator warehouse garage and dance hall along the track is filled with wheat at the sherman elevators theres a line of farmers trucks and wagons two miles long waiting on the road at lakewood station the square is packed solid and has been for three nights they keep telling us its only temporary the cars are coming and well catch up we wont there arent any cars coming ive called everyone i could i know by the way they answer they know and not one of them wants to admit it theyre scared scared to move or speak or ask or answer all theyre thinking of is who will be blamed when that harvest rots here around the stationsand not of whos going to move it maybe nobody can now maybe theres nothing you can do about it either but i thought youre the only person left whod want to know and that somebody had to tell you i she made an effort to breathe i see who are you the name wouldnt matter when i hang up i will have become a deserter i dont want to stay here to see it when it happens i dont want any part of it any more good luck to you miss taggart she heard the click thank you she said over a dead wire the next time she noticed the office around her and permitted herself to feel it was noon of the following day she stood in the middle of the office running stiff spread fingers through a strand of hair brushing it back off her faceand for an instant she wondered where she was and what was the unbelievable thing that had happened in the last twenty hours what she felt was horror and she knew that she had felt it from the first words of the man on the wire only there had been no time to know it there was not much that remained in her mind of the last twenty hours only disconnected bits held together by the single constant that had made them possibleby the soft loose faces of men who fought to hide from themselves that they knew the answers to the questions she asked from the moment when she was told that the manager of the car service department had been out of town for a week and had left no address where one could reach himshe knew that the report of the man from minnesota was true then came the faces of the assistants in the car service department who would neither confirm the report nor deny it but kept showing her papers orders forms file cards that bore words in the english language but no connection to intelligible facts were the freight cars sent to minnesota form w is filled out in every particular as required by the office of the coordinator in conformance with the instructions of the comptroller and by directive were the freight cars sent to minnesota the entries for the months of august and september have been processed by were the freight cars sent to minnesota my files indicate the locations of freight cars by state date classification and do you know whether the cars were sent to minnesota as to the interstate motion of freight cars i would have to refer you to the files of mr benson and of there was nothing to learn from the files there were careful entries each conveying four possible meanings with references which led to references which led to a final reference which was missing from the files it did not take her long to discover that the cars had not been sent to minnesota and that the order had come from cuffy meigsbut who had carried it out who had tangled the trail what steps had been taken by what compliant men to preserve the appearance of a safely normal operation without a single cry of protest to arouse some braver mans attention who had falsified the reports and where the cars had goneseemed at first impossible to learn through the hours of that nightwhile a small desperate crew under the command of eddie willers kept calling every division point every yard depot station spur and siding of taggart transcontinental for every freight car in sight or reach ordering them to unload drop dump scuttle anything and proceed to minnesota at once while they kept calling the yards stations and presidents of every railroad still half in existence anywhere across the map begging for cars for minnesotashe went through the task of tracing from face to cowards face the destination of the freight cars that had vanished she went from railroad executives to wealthy shippers to washington officials and back to the railroadby cab by phone by wirepursuing a trail of halfuttered hints the trail approached its end when she heard the pinchlipped voice of a public relations woman in a washington office saying resentfully over the telephone wire well after all it is a matter of opinion whether wheat is essential to a nations welfarethere are those of more progressive views who feel that the soybean is perhaps of far greater valueand then by noon she stood in the middle of her office knowing that the freight cars intended for the wheat of minnesota had been sent instead to carry the soybeans from the louisiana swamps of kips mas project the first story of the minnesota disaster appeared in the newspapers three days later it reported that the farmers who had waited in the streets of lakewood for six days with no place to store their wheat and no trains to carry it had demolished the local courthouse the mayors home and the railroad station then the stories vanished abruptly and the newspapers kept silent then began to print admonitions urging people not to believe unpatriotic rumors while the flour mills and grain markets of the country were screaming over the phones and the telegraph wires sending pleas to new york and delegations to washington while strings of freight cars from random corners of the continent were crawling like rusty caterpillars across the map in the direction of minnesotathe wheat and hope of the country were waiting to perish along an empty track under the unchanging green lights of signals that called for motion to trains that were not there at the communication desks of taggart transcontinental a small crew kept calling for freight cars repeating like the crew of a sinking ship an sos that remained unheard there were freight cars held loaded for months in the yards of the companies owned by the friends of pullpeddlers who ignored the frantic demands to unload the cars and release them you can tell that railroad to followed by untransmissible words was the message of the smather brothers of arizona in answer to the sos of new york in minnesota they were seizing cars from every siding from the mesabi range from the ore mines of paul larkin where the cars had stood waiting for a dribble of iron they were pouring wheat into ore cars into coal cars into boarded stock cars that went spilling thin gold trickles along the track as they clattered off they were pouring wheat into passenger coaches over seats racks and fixtures to send it off to get it moving even if it went moving into trackside ditches in the sudden crash of breaking springs in the explosions set off by burning journal boxes they fought for movement for movement with no thought of destination for movement as such like a paralytic under a stroke struggling in wild stiff incredulous jerks against the realization that movement was suddenly impossible there were no other railroads james taggart had killed them there were no boats on the lakes paul larkin had destroyed them there was only the single line of rail and a net of neglected highways the trucks and wagons of waiting farmers started trickling blindly down the roads with no maps no gas no feed for horsesmoving south south toward the vision of flour mills awaiting them somewhere with no knowledge of the distances ahead but with the knowledge of death behind themmoving to collapse on the roads in the gullies in the breaks of rotted bridges one farmer was found half a mile south of the wreck of his truck lying dead in a ditch face down still clutching a sack of wheat on his shoulders then rain clouds burst over the prairies of minnesota the rain went eating the wheat into rot at the waiting railroad stations it went hammering the piles spilled along the roads washing gold kernels into the soil the men in washington were last to be reached by the panic they watched not the news from minnesota but the precarious balance of their friendships and commitments they weighed not the fate of the harvest but the unknowable result of unpredictable emotions in unthinking men of unlimited power they waited they evaded all pleas they declared oh ridiculous theres nothing to worry about those taggart people have always moved that wheat on schedule theyll find some way to move it then when the state chief executive of minnesota sent a request to washington for the assistance of the army against the riots he was unable to controlthree directives burst forth within two hours stopping all trains in the country commandeering all cars to speed to minnesota an order signed by wesley mouch demanded the immediate release of the freight cars held in the service of kips ma but by that time it was too late mas freight cars were in california where the soybeans had been sent to a progressive concern made up of sociologists preaching the cult of oriental austerity and of businessmen formerly in the numbers racket in minnesota farmers were setting fire to their own farms they were demolishing grain elevators and the homes of county officials they were fighting along the track of the railroad some to tear it up some to defend it with their livesand with no goal to reach save violence they were dying in the streets of gutted towns and in the silent gullies of a roadless night then there was only the acrid stench of grain rotting in halfsmouldering pilesa few columns of smoke rising from the plains standing still in the air over blackened ruinsand in an office in pennsylvania hank rearden sitting at his desk looking at a list of men who had gone bankrupt they were the manufacturers of farm equipment who could not be paid and would not be able to pay him the harvest of soybeans did not reach the markets of the country it had been reaped prematurely it was moldy and unfit for consumption on the night of october a copper wire broke in new york city in an underground control tower of the taggart terminal extinguishing the lights of the signals it was only the breach of one wire but it produced a short circuit in the interlocking traffic system and the signals of motion or danger disappeared from the panels of the control towers and from among the strands of rail the red and green lenses remained red and green not with the living radiance of sight but with the dead stare of glass eyes on the edge of the city a cluster of trains gathered at the entrance to the terminal tunnels and grew through the minutes of stillness like blood dammed by a clot inside a vein unable to rush into the chambers of the heart dagny that night was sitting at a table in a private dining room of the waynefalkland the wax of candles was dripping down on the white camellias and laurel leaves at the base of the silver candlesticks arithmetical calculations were penciled on the damask linen tablecloth and a cigar butt was swimming in a finger bowl the six men in formal dinner jackets facing her about the table were wesley mouch eugene lawson dr floyd ferris clem weatherby james taggart and cuffy meigs why she had asked when jim had told her that she had to attend that dinner well because our board of directors is to meet next week and youre interested in whats going to be decided about our minnesota line arent you is that going to be decided at the board meeting well not exactly is it going to be decided at this dinner not exactly but oh why do you always have to be so definite nothings ever definite besides they insisted that they wanted you to come why isnt that sufficient she did not ask why those men chose to make all their crucial decisions at parties of this kind she knew that they did she knew that behind the clattering lumbering pretense of their council sessions committee meetings and mass debates the decisions were made in advance in furtive informality at luncheons dinners and bars the graver the issue the more casual the method of settling it it was the first time that they had asked her the outsider the enemy to one of those secret sessions it was she thought an acknowledgment of the fact that they needed her and perhaps the first step of their surrender it was a chance she could not leave untaken but as she sat in the candlelight of the dining room she felt certain that she had no chance she felt restlessly unable to accept that certainty since she could not grasp its reason yet lethargically reluctant to pursue any inquiry as i think you will concede miss taggart there now seems to be no economic justification for the continued existence of a railroad line in minnesota which and even miss taggart will im sure agree that certain temporary retrenchments seem to be indicated until nobody not even miss taggart will deny that there are times when it is necessary to sacrifice the parts for the sake of the whole as she listened to the mentions of her name tossed into the conversation at halfhour intervals tossed perfunctorily with the speakers eyes never glancing in her direction she wondered what motive had made them want her to be present it was not an attempt to delude her into believing that they were consulting her but worse an attempt to delude themselves into believing that she had agreed they asked her questions at times and interrupted her before she had completed the first sentence of the answer they seemed to want her approval without having to know whether she approved or not some crudely childish form of selfdeception had made them choose to give to this occasion the decorous setting of a formal dinner they acted as if they hoped to gain from the objects of gracious luxury the power and the honor of which those objects had once been the product and symbolthey acted she thought like those savages who devour the corpse of an adversary in the hope of acquiring his strength and his virtue she regretted that she was dressed as she was its formal jim had told her but dont overdo it what i mean is dont look too rich business people should avoid any appearance of arrogance these days not that you should look shabby but if you could just seem to suggest well humility it would please them you know it would make them feel big really she had said turning away she wore a black dress that looked as if it were no more than a piece of cloth crossed over her breasts and falling to her feet in the soft folds of a grecian tunic it was made of satin a satin so light and thin that it could have served as the stuff of a nightgown the luster of the cloth streaming and shifting with her movements made it look as if the light of the room she entered were her personal property sensitively obedient tothe motions of her body wrapping her in a sheet of radiance more luxurious than the texture of brocade underscoring the pliant fragility of her figure giving her an air of so natural an elegance that it could afford to be scornfully casual she wore a single piece of jewelry a diamond clip at the edge of the black neckline that kept flashing with the imperceptible motion of her breath like a transformer converting a flicker into fire making one conscious not of the gems but of the living beat behind them it flashed like a military decoration like wealth worn as a badge of honor she wore no other ornament only the sweep of a black velvet cape more arrogantly ostentatiously patrician than any spread of sables she regretted it now as she looked at the men before her she felt the embarrassing guilt of pointlessness as if she had tried to defy the figures in a waxworks she saw a mindless resentment in their eyes and a sneaking trace of the lifeless sexless smutty leer with which men look at a poster advertising burlesque its a great responsibility said eugene lawson to hold the decision of life or death over thousands of people and to sacrifice them when necessary but we mast have the courage to do it his soft lips seemed to twist into a smile the only factors to consider are land acreage and population figures said dr ferris in a statistical voice blowing smoke rings at the ceiling since it is no longer possible to maintain both the minnesota line and the transcontinental traffic of this railroad the choice is between minnesota and those states west of the rockies which were cut off by the failure of the taggart tunnel as well as the neighboring states of montana idaho oregon which means practically speaking the whole of the northwest when you compute the acreage and the number of heads in both areas its obvious that we should scuttle minnesota rather than give up our lines of communication over a third of a continent wont give up the continent said wesley mouch staring down at his dish of ice cream his voice hurt and stubborn she was thinking of the mesabi range the last of the major sources of iron ore she was thinking of the minnesota farmers such as were left of them the best producers of wheat in the countryshe was thinking that the end of minnesota would end wisconsin then michigan then illinoisshe was seeing the red breath of the factories dying out over the industrial eastas against the empty miles of western sands of scraggly pastures and abandoned ranches the figures indicate said mr weatherby primly that the continued maintenance of both areas seems to be impossible the railway track and equipment of one has to be dismantled to provide the material for the maintenance of the other she noticed that clem weatherby their technical expert on railroads was the man of least influence among them and cuffy meigsof most cuffy meigs sat sprawled in his chair with a look of patronizing tolerance for their game of wasting time on discussions he spoke little but when he did it was to snap decisively with a contemptuous grin pipe down jimmy or nuts wes youre talking through your hat she noticed that neither jim nor mouch resented it they seemed to welcome the authority of his assurance they were accepting him as their master we have to be practical dr ferris kept saying we have to be scientific i need the economy of the country as a whole wesley mouch kept repeating i need the production of a nation is it economics that youre talking about is it production she said whenever her cold measured voice was able to seize a brief stretch of their tune if it is then give us leeway to save the eastern states thats all thats left of the countryand of the world if you let us save that well have a chance to rebuild the rest if not its the end let the atlantic southern take care of such transcontinental traffic as still exists let the local railroads take care of the northwest but let taggart transcontinental drop everything elseyes everythingand devote all our resources equipment and rail to the traffic of the eastern states let us shrink back to the start of this country but let us hold that start well run no trains west of the missouri well become a local railroadthe local of the industrial east let us save our industries theres nothing left to save in the west you can run agriculture for centuries by manual labor and oxcarts but destroy the last of this countrys industrial plantand centuries of effort wont be able to rebuild it or to gather the economic strength to make a start how do you expect our industriesor railroadsto survive without steel how do you expect any steel to be produced if you cut off the supply of iron ore save minnesota whatevers left of it the country you have no country to save if its industries perish you can sacrifice a leg or an arm you cant save a body by sacrificing its heart and brain save our industries save minnesota save the eastern seaboard it was no use she said it as many times with as many details statistics figures proofs as she could force out of her weary mind into their evasive hearing it was no use they neither refuted nor agreed they merely looked as if her arguments were beside the point there was a sound of hidden emphasis in their answers as if they were giving her an explanation but in a code to which she had no key theres trouble in california said wesley mouch sullenly their state legislatures been acting pretty huffy theres talk of seceding from the union oregon is overrun by gangs of deserters said clem weatherby cautiously they murdered two tax collectors within the last three months the importance of industry to a civilization has been grossly overemphasized said dr ferris dreamily what is now known as the peoples state of india has existed for centuries without any industrial development whatever people could do with fewer material gadgets and a sterner discipline of privations said eugene lawson eagerly it would be good for them oh hell are you going to let that dame talk you into letting the richest country on earth slip through your fingers said cuffy meigs leaping to his feet its a fine time to give up a whole continentand in exchange for what for a dinky little state thats milked dry anyway i say ditch minnesota but hold onto your transcontinental dragnet with trouble and riots everywhere you wont be able to keep people in line unless you have transportationtroop transportationunless you hold your soldiers within a few days journey of any point on the continent this is no time to retrench dont get yellow listening to all that talk youve got the country in your pocket just keep it there in the long run mouch started uncertainly in the long run well all be dead snapped cuffy meigs he was pacing restlessly retrenching hell theres plenty of pickings left in california and oregon and all those places what ive been thinking is we ought to think of expandingthe way things are theres nobody to stop us its there for the takingmexico and canada maybeit ought to be a cinch then she saw the answer she saw the secret premise behind their words with all of their noisy devotion to the age of science their hysterically technological jargon their cyclotrons their sound rays these men were moved forward not by the image of an industrial skyline but by the vision of that form of existence which the industrialists had swept awaythe vision of a fat unhygienic rajah of india with vacant eyes staring in indolent stupor out of stagnant layers of flesh with nothing to do but run precious gems through his fingers and once in a while stick a knife into the body of a starved toildazed germeaten creature as a claim to a few grains of the creatures rice then claim it from hundreds of millions of such creatures and thus let the rice grains gather into gems she had thought that industrial production was a value not to be questioned by anyone she had thought that these mens urge to expropriate the factories of others was their acknowledgment of the factories value she born of the industrial revolution had not held as conceivable had forgotten along with the tales of astrology and alchemy what these men knew in their secret furtive souls knew not by means of thought but by means of that nameless muck which they called their instincts and emotions that so long as men struggle to stay alive theyll never produce so little but that the man with the club wont be able to seize it and leave them still less provided millions of them are willing to submitthat the harder their work and the less their gain the more submissive the fiber of their spiritthat men who live by pulling levers at an electric switchboard are not easily ruled but men who live by digging the soil with their naked fingers arethat the feudal baron did not need electronic factories in order to drink his brains away out of jeweled goblets and neither did the rajahs of the peoples state of india she saw what they wanted and to what goal their instincts which they called unaccountable were leading them she saw that eugene lawson the humanitarian took pleasure at the prospect of human starvationand dr ferris the scientist was dreaming of the day when men would return to the handplow incredulity and indifference were her only reaction incredulity because she could not conceive of what would bring human beings to such a stateindifference because she could not regard those who reached it as human any longer they went on talking but she was unable to speak or to listen she caught herself feeling that her only desire was now to get home and fall asleep miss taggart said a politely rational faintly anxious voiceand jerking her head up she saw the courteous figure of a waiter the assistant manager of the taggart terminal is on the telephone requesting permission to speak to you at once he says its an emergency it was a relief to leap to her feet and get out of that room even if in answer to the call of some new disaster it was a relief to hear the assistant managers voice even though it was saying the interlocker system is out miss taggart the signals are dead there are eight incoming trains held up and six outgoing we cant move them in or out of the tunnels we cant find the chief engineer we cant locate the breach of the circuit we have no copper wire for repairs we dont know what to do we be right down she said dropping the receiver hurrying to the elevator then halfrunning through the stately lobby of the waynefalkland she felt herself returning to life at the summons of the possibility of action taxicabs were rare these days and none came in answer to the doormans whistle she started rapidly down the street forgetting what she wore wondering why the touch of the wind seemed too cold and too ultimately close her mind on the terminal ahead she was startled by the loveliness of a sudden sight she saw the slender figure of a woman hurrying toward her the ray of a lamppost sweeping over lustrous hair naked arms the swirl of a black cape and the flame of a diamond on her breast with the long empty corridor of a city street behind her and skyscrapers drawn by lonely dots of light the knowledge that she was seeing her own reflection in the side mirror of a florists window came an instant too late she had felt the enchantment of the full context to which that image and city belonged then she felt a stab of desolate loneliness much wider a loneliness than the span of an empty streetand a stab of anger at herself at the preposterous contrast between her appearance and the context of this night and age she saw a taxi turn a corner she waved to it and leaped in slamming the door against a feeling which she hoped to leave behind her on the empty pavement by a florists window but she knewin self mockery in bitterness in longingthat this feeling was the sense of expectation she had felt at her first ball and at those rare times when she had wanted the outward beauty of existence to match its inner splendor what a time to think of it she told herself in mockerynot now she cried to herself in angerbut a desolate voice kept asking her quietly to the rattle of the taxis wheels you who believed you must live for your happiness what do you now have left of itwhat are you gaining from your struggleyes say it honestly whats in it for youor are you becoming one of those abject altruists who has no answer to that question any longer not nowshe ordered as the glowing entrance to the taggart terminal flared up in the rectangle of the taxis windshield the men in the terminal managers office were like extinguished signals as if here too a circuit were broken and there were no living current to make them move they looked at her with a kind of inanimate passivity as if it made no difference whether she let them stay still or threw a switch to set them in motion the terminal manager was absent the chief engineer could not be found he had been seen at the terminal two hours ago not since the assistant manager had exhausted his power of initiative by volunteering to call her the others volunteered nothing the signal engineer was a collegeboyish man in his thirties who kept saying aggressively but this has never happened before miss taggart the interlocker has never failed its not supposed to fail we know our jobs we can take care of it as well as anybody canbut not if it breaks down when its not supposed to she could not tell whether the dispatcher an elderly man with years of railroad work behind him still retained his intelligence but chose to hide it or whether months of suppressing it had choked it for good granting him the safety of stagnation we dont know what to do miss taggart we dont know whom to call for what sort of permission there are no rules to cover an emergency of this kind there arent even any rules about whos to lay down the rules for it she listened she reached for the telephone without a word of explanation she ordered the operator to get her the operating vicepresident of the atlantic southern in chicago to get him at his home and out of bed if necessary george dagny taggart she said when the voice of her competitor came on the wire will you lend me the signal engineer of your chicago terminal charles murray for twentyfour hours yes right put him aboard a plane and get him here as fast as you can tell him well pay three thousand dollars yes for the one day yes as bad as that yes ill pay him in cash out of my own pocket if necessary ill pay whatever it takes to bribe his way aboard a plane but get him on the first plane out of chicago no george not onenot a single mind left on taggart transcontinental yes ill get all the papers exemptions exceptions and emergency permissions thanks george so long she hung up and spoke rapidly to the men before her not to hear the stillness of the room and of the terminal where no sound of wheels was beating any longer not to hear the bitter words which the stillness seemed to repeat not a single mind left on taggart transcontinental get a wrecking train and crew ready at once she said send them out on the hudson line with orders to tear down every foot of copper wire any copper wire lights signals telephone everything thats company property have it here by morning but miss taggart our service on the hudson line is only temporarily suspended and the unification board has refused us permission to dismantle the line ill be responsible but how are we going to get the wrecking train out of here when there arent any signals there will be signals in half an hour how come on she said rising to her feet they followed her as she hurried down the passenger platforms past the huddling shifting groups of travelers by the motionless trains she hurried down a narrow catwalk through a maze of rail past blinded signals and frozen switches with nothing but the beat of her satin sandals to fill the great vaults of the underground tunnels of taggart transcontinental with the hollow creaking of planks under the slower steps of men trailing her like a reluctant echoshe hurried to the lighted glass cube of tower a that hung in the darkness like a crown without a body the crown of a deposed ruler above a realm of empty tracks the tower director was too expert a man at too exacting a job to be able wholly to conceal the dangerous burden of intelligence he understood what she wanted him to do from her first few words and answered only with an abrupt yes maam but he was bent over his charts by the time the others came following her up the iron stairway he was grimly at work on the most humiliating job of calculation he had ever had to perform in his long career she knew how fully he understood it from a single glance he threw at her a glance of indignation and endurance that matched some emotion he had caught in her face well do it first and feel about it afterwards she said even though he had made no comment yes maam he answered woodenly his room on the top of an underground tower was like a glass verandah overlooking what had once been the swiftest richest and most orderly stream in the world he had been trained to chart the course of over ninety trains an hour and to watch them roll safely through a maze of tracks and switches in and out of the terminal under his glass walls and his fingertips now for the first time he was looking out at the empty darkness of a dried channel through the open door of the relay room she saw the tower men standing grimly idlethe men whose jobs had never permitted a moments relaxationstanding by the long rows that looked like vertical copper pleats like shelves of books and as much of a monument to human intelligence the pull of one of the small levers which protruded like bookmarks from the shelves threw thousands of electric circuits into motion made thousands of contacts and broke as many others set dozens of switches to clear a chosen course and dozens of signals to light it with no error left possible no chance no contradiction an enormous complexity of thought condensed into one movement of a human hand to set and insure the course of a train that hundreds of trains might safely rush by that thousands of tons of metal and lives might pass in speeding streaks a breath away from one another protected by nothing but a thought the thought of the man who devised the levers but theyshe looked at the face of her signal engineer they believed that that muscular contraction of a hand was the only thing required to move the trafficand now the tower men stood idleand on the great panels in front of the tower director the red and green lights which had flashed announcing the progress of trains at a distance of miles were now so many glass beadslike the glass beads for which another breed of savages had once sold the island of manhattan calf all of your unskilled laborers she said to the assistant manager the section hands trackwalkers engine wipers whoevers in the terminal right now and have them come here at once here here she said pointing at the tracks outside the tower call all your switchmen too phone your storehouse and have them bring here every lantern they can lay their hands on any sort of lantern conductors lanterns storm lanterns anything lanterns miss taggart get going yes maam what is it were doing miss taggart asked the dispatcher were going to move trains and were going to move them manually manually said the signal engineer yes brother now why should you be shocked she could not resist it man is only muscles isnt he were going backback to where there were no interlocking systems no semaphores no electricity back to the time when train signals were not steel and wire but men holding lanterns physical men serving as lampposts youve advocated it long enoughyou got what you wanted oh you thought that your tools would determine your ideas but it happens to be the other way aroundand now youre going to see the kind of tools your ideas have determined but even to go back took an act of intelligenceshe thought feeling the paradox of her own position as she looked at the lethargy of the faces around her how will we work the switches miss taggart by hand and the signals by hand how by placing a man with a lantern at every signal post how theres not enough clearance well use alternate tracks how will the men know which way to throw the switches by written orders uh by written ordersjust as in the old days she pointed to the tower director hes working out a schedule of how to move the trains and which tracks to use hell write out an order for every signal and switch hell pick some men as runners and theyll keep delivering the orders to every postand it will take hours to do what used to take minutes but well get those waiting trains into the terminal and out on the road were to work it that way all night and all day tomorrowuntil the engineer whos got the brains for it shows you how to repair the interlocker theres nothing in the union contracts about men standing with lanterns theres going to be trouble the union will object let them come to me the unification board will object ill be responsible well i wouldnt want to be held for giving the orders ill give the orders she stepped out on the landing of the iron stairway that hung on the side of the tower she was fighting for selfcontrol it seemed to her for a moment as if she too were a precision instrument of high technology left without electric current trying to run a transcontinental railroad by means of her two hands she looked out at the great silent darkness of the taggart undergroundand she felt a stab of burning humiliation that she should now see it brought down to the level where human lampposts would stand in its tunnels as its last memorial statues she could barely distinguish the faces of the men when they gathered at the foot of the tower they came streaming silently through the darkness and stood without moving in the bluish murk with blue bulbs on the walls behind them and patches of light falling on their shoulders from the towers windows she could see the greasy garments the slack muscular bodies the limply hanging arms of men drained by the unrewarding exhaustion of a labor that required no thought these were the dregs of the railroad the younger men who could now seek no chance to rise and the older men who had never wanted to seek it they stood in silence not with the apprehensive curiosity of workmen but with the heavy indifference of convicts the orders which you are about to receive have come from me she said standing above them on the iron stairs speaking with resonant clarity the men wholl issue them are acting under my instructions the interlocking control system has broken down it will now be replaced by human labor train service will be resumed at once she noticed some faces in the crowd staring at her with a peculiar look with a veiled resentment and the kind of insolent curiosity that made her suddenly conscious of being a woman then she remembered what she wore and thought that it did look preposterousand then at the sudden stab of some violent impulse that felt like defiance and like loyalty to the full real meaning of the moment she threw her cape back and stood in the raw glare of light under the sooted columns like a figure at a formal reception sternly erect flaunting the luxury of naked arms of glowing black satin of a diamond flashing like a military cross the tower director will assign switchmen to their posts he will select men for the job of signaling trains by means of lanterns and for the task of transmitting his orders trains will she was fighting to drown a bitter voice that seemed to be saying thats all theyre fit for these men if even that theres not a single mind left anywhere on taggart transcontinental trains will continue to be moved in and out of the terminal you will remain at your posts until then she stopped it was his eyes and hair that she saw firstthe ruthlessly perceptive eyes the streaks of hair shaded from gold to copper that seemed to reflect the glow of sunlight in the murk of the undergroundshe saw john galt among the chain gang of the mindless john galt in greasy overalls and rolled shirt sleeves she saw his weightless way of standing his face held lifted his eyes looking at her as if he had seen this moment many moments ago whats the matter miss taggart it was the soft voice of the tower director who stood by her side with some sort of paper in his handand she thought it was strange to emerge from a span of unconsciousness which had been the span of the sharpest awareness she had ever experienced only she did not know how long it had lasted or where she was or why she had been aware of galts face she had been seeing in the shape of his mouth in the planes of his cheeks the crackup of that implacable serenity which had always been his but he still retained it in his look of acknowledging the breach of admitting that this moment was too much even for him she knew that she went on speaking because those around her looked as if they were listening though she could not hear a sound she went on speaking as if carrying out a hypnotic order given to herself some endless time ago knowing only that the completion of that order was a form of defiance against him neither knowing nor hearing her own words she felt as if she were standing in a radiant silence where sight was her only capacity and his face was its only object and the sight of his face was like a speech in the form of a pressure at the base of her throat it seemed so natural that he should be here it seemed so unendurably simpleshe felt as if the shock were not his presence but the presence of others on the tracks of her railroad where he belonged and they did not she was seeing those moments aboard a train when at its plunge into the tunnels she had felt a sudden solemn tension as if this place were showing her in naked simplicity the essence of her railroad and of her life the union of consciousness and matter the frozen form of a minds ingenuity giving physical existence to its purpose she had felt a sense of sudden hope as if this place held the meaning of all of her values and a sense of secret excitement as if a nameless promise were awaiting her under the groundit was right that she should now meet him here he had been the meaning and the promiseshe was not seeing his clothing any longer nor to what level her railroad had reduced himshe was seeing only the vanishing torture of the months when he had been outside her reachshe was seeing in his face the confession of what those months had cost him the only speech she heard was as if she were saying to him this is the reward for all my daysand as if he were answering for all of mine she knew that she had finished speaking to the strangers when she saw that the tower director had stepped forward and was saying something to them glancing at a list in his hand then drawn by a sense of irresistible certainty she found herself descending the stairs slipping away from the crowd not toward the platforms and the exit but into the darkness of the abandoned tunnels you will follow me she thought and felt as if the thought were not in words but in the tension of her muscles the tension of her will to accomplish a thing she knew to be outside her power yet she knew with certainty that it would be accomplished and by her wish no she thought not by her wish but by its total tightness you will follow meit was neither plea nor prayer nor demand but the quiet statement of a fact it contained the whole of her power of knowledge and the whole of the knowledge she had earned through the years you will follow me if we are what we are you and i if we live if the world exists if you know the meaning of this moment and cant let it slip by as others let it slip into the senselessness of the unwilled and unreached you will follow meshe felt an exultant assurance which was neither hope nor faith but an act of worship for the logic of existence she was hurrying down the remnants of abandoned rails down the long dark corridors twisting through granite she lost the sound of the directors voice behind her then she felt the beat of her arteries and heard in answering rhythm the beat of the city above her head but she felt as if she heard the motion of her blood as a sound filling the silence and the motion of the city as the beat inside her bodyand far behind her she heard the sound of steps she did not glance back she went faster she went past the locked iron door where the remnant of his motor was still hidden she did not stop but a faint shudder was her answer to the sudden glimpse of the unity and logic in the events of the last two years a string of blue lights went on into the darkness over patches of glistening granite over broken sandbags spilling drifts on the rails over rusty piles of scrap metal when she heard the steps coming closer she stopped and turned to look back she saw a sweep of blue light flash briefly on the shining strands of galts hair she caught the pale outline of his face and the dark hollows of his eyes the face disappeared but the sound of his steps served as the link to the next blue light that swept across the line of his eyes the eyes that remained held level directed aheadand she felt certain that she had stayed in his sight from the moment he had seen her at the tower she heard the beat of the city above themthese tunnels she had once thought were the roots of the city and of all the motion reaching to the skybut they she thought john galt and she were the living power within these roots they were the start and aim and meaninghe too she thought heard the beat of the city as the beat of his body she threw her cape back she stood defiantly straight as he had seen her stand on the steps of the toweras he had seen her for the first time ten years ago here under the groundshe was hearing the words of his confession not as words but by means of that beating which made it so difficult to breathe you looked like a symbol of luxury and you belonged in the place that was its source you seemed to bring the enjoyment of life back to its rightful owners you had a look of energy and of its reward together and i was the first man who had ever stated in what manner these two were inseparable the next span of moments was like flashes of light in stretches of blinded unconsciousnessthe moment when she saw his face as he stopped beside her when she saw the unastonished calm the leashed intensity the laughter of understanding in the dark green eyesthe moment when she knew what he saw in her face by the tight drawn harshness of his lipsthe moment when she felt his mouth on hers when she felt the shape of his mouth both as an absolute shape and as a liquid filling her bodythen the motion of his lips down the line of her throat a drinking motion that left a trail of bruisesthen the sparkle of her diamond clip against the trembling copper of his hair then she was conscious of nothing but the sensations of her body because her body acquired the sudden power to let her know her most complex values by direct perception just as her eyes had the power to translate wave lengths of energy into sight just as her ears had the power to translate vibrations into sound so her body now had the power to translate the energy that had moved all the choices of her life into immediate sensory perception it was not the pressure of a hand that made her tremble but the instantaneous sum of its meaning the knowledge that it was his hand that it moved as if her flesh were his possession that its movement was his signature of acceptance under the whole of that achievement which was herselfit was only a sensation of physical pleasure but it contained her worship of him of everything that was his person and his lifefrom the night of the mass meeting in a factory in wisconsin to the atlantis of a valley hidden in the rocky mountains to the triumphant mockery of the green eyes of the superlative intelligence above a workers figure at the foot of the towerit contained her pride in herself and that it should be she whom he had chosen as his mirror that it should be her body which was now giving him the sum of his existence as his body was giving her the sum of hers these were the things it containedbut what she knew was only the sensation of the movement of his hand on her breasts he tore off her cape and she felt the slenderness of her own body by means of the circle of his arms as if his person were only a tool for her triumphant awareness of herself but that self were only a tool for her awareness of him it was as if she were reaching the limit of her capacity to feel yet what she felt was like a cry of impatient demand which she was now incapable of naming except that it had the same quality of ambition as the course of her life the same inexhaustible quality of radiant greed he pulled her head back for a moment to look straight into her eyes to let her see his to let her know the full meaning of their actions as if throwing the spotlight of consciousness upon them for the meeting of their eyes in a moment of intimacy greater than the one to come then she felt the mesh of burlap striking the skin of her shoulders she found herself lying on the broken sandbags she saw the long tight gleam of her stockings she felt his mouth pressed to her ankle then rising in a tortured motion up the line of her leg as if he wished to own its shape by means of his lips then she felt her teeth sinking into the flesh of his arm she felt the sweep of his elbow knocking her head aside and his mouth seizing her lips with a pressure more viciously painful than hersthen she felt when it hit her throat that which she knew only as an upward streak of motion that released and united her body into a single shock of pleasurethen she knew nothing but the motion of his body and the driving greed that went reaching on and on as if she were not a person any longer only a sensation of endless reaching for the impossiblethen she knew that it was possible and she gasped and lay still knowing that nothing more could be desired ever he lay beside her on his back looking up at the darkness of the granite vault above them she saw him stretched on the jagged slant of sandbags as if his body were fluid in relaxation she saw the black wedge of her cape flung across the rails at their feet there were beads of moisture twinkling on the vault shifting slowly running into invisible cracks like the lights of a distant traffic when he spoke his voice sounded as if he were quietly continuing a sentence in answer to the questions in her mind as if he had nothing to hide from her any longer and what he owed her now was only the act of undressing his soul as simply as he would have undressed his body this is how ive watched you for ten years from here from under the ground under your feet knowing every move you made in your office at the top of the building but never seeing you never enough ten years of nights spent waiting to catch a glimpse of you here on the platforms when you boarded a train whenever the order came down to couple your car id know of it and wait and see you come down the ramp and wish you didnt walk so fast it was so much like you that walk id know it anywhere your walk and those legs of yours it was always your legs that id see first hurrying down the ramp going past me as i looked up at you from a dark side track below i think i could have molded a sculpture of your legs i knew them not with my eyes but with the palms of my hands when i watched you go by when i turned back to my work when i went home just before sunrise for the three hours of sleep which i didnt get i love you she said her voice quiet and almost toneless except for a fragile sound of youth he closed his eyes as if letting the sound travel through the years behind them ten years dagny except that once there were a few weeks when i had you before me in plain sight within reach not hurrying away but held still as on a lighted stage a private stage for me to watch and i watched you for hours through many evenings in the lighted window of an office that was called the john galt line and one night her breath was a faint gasp was it you that night did you see me i saw your shadow on the pavement pacing back and forth it looked like a struggle it looked like she stopped she did not want to say torture it was he said quietly that night i wanted to walk in to face you to speak to that was the night i came closest to breaking my oath when i saw you slumped across your desk when i saw you broken by the burden you were carrying john that night it was you that i was thinking of only i didnt know it but you see knew it it was you all my life through everything i did and everything i wanted i know it john the hardest was not when i left you in the valley it was your radio speech the day you returned yes were you listening of course im glad you did it it was a magnificent thing to do and ii knew it anyway you knew about hank rearden before i saw you in the valley was it when you learned about him had you expected it no was it she stopped hard yes but only for the first few days that next night do you want me to tell you what i did the night after i learned it yes i had never seen hank rearden only pictures of him in the newspapers i knew that he was in new york that night at some conference of big industrialists i wanted to have just one look at him i went to wait at the entrance of the hotel where that conference was held there were bright lights under the marquee of the entrance but it was dark beyond on the pavement so i could see without being seen there were a few loafers and vagrants hanging around there was a drizzle of rain and we clung to the walls of the building one could tell the members of the conference when they began filing out by their clothes and their mannerostentatiously prosperous clothes and a manner of overbearing timidity as if they were guiltily trying to pretend that they were what they appeared to be for that moment there were chauffeurs driving up their cars there were a few reporters delaying them for questions and hangerson trying to catch a word from them they were worn men those industrialists aging flabby frantic with the effort to disguise uncertainty and then i saw him he wore an expensive trenchcoat and a hat slanting across his eyes he walked swiftly with the kind of assurance that has to be earned as hed earned it some of his fellow industrialists pounced on him with questions and those tycoons were acting like hangerson around him i caught a glimpse of him as he stood with his hand on the door of his car his head lifted i saw the brief flare of a smile under the slanting brim a confident smile impatient and a little amused and then for one instant i did what i had never done before what most men wreck their lives on doingi saw that moment out of context i saw the world as he made it look as if it matched him as if he were its symboli saw a world of achievement of unenslaved energy of unobstructed drive through purposeful years to the enjoyment of ones rewardi saw as i stood in the rain in a crowd of vagrants what my years would have brought me if that world had existed and i felt a desperate longinghe was the image of everything i should have been and he had everything that should have been mine but it was only a moment then i saw the scene in full context again and in all of its actual meaningi saw what price he was paying for his brilliant ability what torture he was enduring in silent bewilderment struggling to understand what i had understoodi saw that the world he suggested did not exist and was yet to be made i saw him again for what he was the symbol of my battle the unrewarded hero whom i was to avenge and to releaseand then then i accepted what i had learned about you and him i saw that it changed nothing that i should have expected itthat it was right he heard the faint sound of her moan and he chuckled softly dagny its not that i dont suffer its that i know the unimportance of suffering i know that pain is to be fought and thrown aside not to be accepted as part of ones soul and as a permanent scar across ones view of existence dont feel sorry for me it was gone right then she turned her head to look at him in silence and he smiled lifting himself on an elbow to look down at her face as she lay helplessly still she whispered youve been a track laborer hereherefor twelve years yes ever since ever since i quit the twentieth century the night when you saw me for the first time you were working here then yes and the morning when you offered to work for me as my cook i was only your track laborer on leave of absence do you see why i laughed as i did she was looking up at his face hers was a smile of pain hisof pure gaiety john say it but say it all you were here all those years yes all those years while the railroad was perishing while i was searching for men of intelligence while i was struggling to hold onto any scrap of it i could find while you were combing the country for the inventor of my motor while you were feeding james taggart and wesley mouch while you were naming your best achievement after the enemy whom you wanted to destroy she closed her eyes i was here all those years he said within your reach inside your own realm watching your struggle your loneliness your longing watching you in a battle you thought you were fighting for me a battle in which you were supporting my enemies and taking an endless defeat i was here hidden by nothing but an error of your sight as atlantis is hidden from men by nothing but an optical illusioni was here waiting for the day when you would see when you would know that by the code of the world you were supporting its to the darkest bottom of the underground that all the things you valued would have to be consigned and that its there that you would have to look i was here i was waiting for you i love you dagny i love you more than my life i who have taught men how life is to be loved ive taught them also never to expect the unpaid forand what i did tonight i did it with full knowledge that i would pay for it and that my life might have to be the price no he smiled nodding oh yes you know that youve broken me for once that i broke the decision i had set for myselfbut i did it consciously knowing what it meant i did it not in blind surrender to the moment but with full sight of the consequences and full willingness to bear them i could not let this kind of moment pass us by it was ours my love we had earned it but youre not ready to quit and join meyou dont have to tell me i knowand since i chose to take what i wanted before it was fully mine ill have to pay for it i have no way of knowing how or when i know only that if i give in to an enemy ill take the consequences he smiled in answer to the look on her face no dagny youre not my enemy in mindand that is what brought me to thisbut you are in fact in the course youre pursuing though you dont see it yet but i do my actual enemies are of no danger to me you are youre the only one who can lead them to find me they would never have the capacity to know what i am but with your help they will no no not by your intention and youre free to change your course but so long as you follow it youre not free to escape its logic dont frown the choice was mine and its a danger i chose to accept i am a trader dagny in all things i wanted you i had no power to change your decision i had only the power to consider the price and decide whether i could afford it i could my life is mine to spend or to invest and you youreas if his gesture were continuing his sentence he raised her across his arm and kissed her mouth while her body hung limply in surrender her hair streaming down her head falling back held only by the pressure of his lipsyoure the one reward i had to have and chose to buy i wanted you and if my life is the price ill give it my lifebut not my mind there was a sudden glint of hardness in his eyes as he sat up and smiled and asked would you want me to join you and go to work would you like me to repair that interlocking signal system of yours within an hour no the cry was immediatein answer to the flash of a sudden image the image of the men in the private dining room of the wayne falkland he laughed why not i dont want to see you working as their serf and yourself i think that theyre crumbling and that ill win i can stand it just a little longer true its just a little longernot till you win but till you learn i cant let it go it was a cry of despair not yet he said quietly he got up and she rose obediently unable to speak i will remain here on my job he said but dont try to see me youll have to endure what ive endured and wanted to spare youyoull have to go on knowing where i am wanting me as ill want you but never permitting yourself to approach me dont seek me here dont come to my home dont ever let them see us together and when you reach the end when youre ready to quit dont tell them just chalk a dollar sign on the pedestal of nat taggarts statuewhere it belongs then go home and wait ill come for you in twentyfour hours she inclined her head in silent promise but when he turned to go a sudden shudder ran through her body like a first jolt of awakening or a last convulsion of life and it ended in an involuntary cry where are you going to be a lamppost and stand holding a lantern till dawnwhich is the only work your world relegates me to and the only work its going to get she seized his arm to hold him to follow to follow him blindly abandoning everything but the sight of his face john he gripped her wrist twisted her hand and threw it off no he said then he took her hand and raised it to his lips and the pressure of his mouth was more passionate a statement than any he had chosen to confess then he walked away down the vanishing line of rail and it seemed to her that both the rail and the figure were abandoning her at the same time when she staggered out into the concourse of the terminal the first blast of rolling wheels went shuddering through the walls of the building like the sudden beat of a heart that had stopped the temple of nathaniel taggart was silent and empty its changeless light beating down on a deserted stretch of marble some shabby figures shuffled across it as if lost in its shining expanse on the steps of the pedestal under the statue of the austere exultant figure a ragged bum sat slumped in passive resignation like a wingplucked bird with no place to go resting on any chance cornice she fell down on the steps of the pedestal like another derelict her dustsmeared cape wrapped tightly about her she sat still her head on her arm past crying or reeling or moving it seemed to her only that she kept seeing a figure with a raised arm holding a light and it looked at times like the statue of liberty and then it looked like a man with sunstreaked hair holding a lantern against a midnight sky a red lantern that stopped the movement of the world dont take it to heart lady whatever it is said the bum in a tone of exhausted compassion nothings to be done about it anyway whats the use lady who is john galt chapter vi the concerto of deliverance on october the steel workers union of rearden steel demanded a raise in wages hank rearden learned it from the newspaper no demand had been presented to him and it had not been considered necessary to inform him the demand was made to the unification board it was not explained why no other steel company was presented with a similar claim he was unable to tell whether the demanders did or did not represent his workers the boards rules on union elections having made it a matter impossible to define he learned only that the group consisted of those newcomers whom the board had slipped into his mills in the past few months on october the unification board rejected the unions petition refusing to grant the raise if any hearings had been held on the matter rearden had not known about it he had not been consulted informed or notified he had waited volunteering no questions on october the newspapers of the country controlled by the same men who controlled the board began a campaign of commiseration with the workers of rearden steel they printed stories about the refusal of the wage raise omitting any mention of who had refused it or who held the exclusive legal power to refuse as if counting on the public to forget legal technicalities under a barrage of stories implying that an employer was the natural cause of all miseries suffered by employees they printed a story describing the hardships of the workers of rearden steel under the present rise in the cost of their livingnext to a story describing hank reardens profits of five years ago they printed a story on the plight of a rearden workers wife trudging from store to store in a hopeless quest for foodnext to a story about a champagne bottle broken over somebodys head at a drunken party given by an unnamed steel tycoon at a fashionable hotel the steel tycoon had been orren boyle but the story mentioned no names inequalities still exist among us the newspapers were saying and cheat us of the benefits of our enlightened age privations have worn the nerves and temper of the people the situation is reaching the danger point we fear an outbreak of violence we fear an outbreak of violence the newspapers kept repeating on october a group of the new workers at rearden steel attacked a foreman and knocked the tuyeres off a blast furnace two days later a similar group broke the groundfloor windows of the administration building a new worker smashed the gears of a crane upsetting a ladle of molten metal within a yard of five bystanders guess i went nuts worrying about my hungry kids he said when arrested this is no time to theorize about whos right or wrong the newspapers commented our sole concern is the fact that an inflammatory situation is endangering the steel output of the country rearden watched asking no questions he waited as if some final knowledge were in the process of unraveling before him a process not to be hastened or stopped nohe thought through the early dusk of autumn evenings looking out the window of his officeno he was not indifferent to his millsbut the feeling which had once been passion for a living entity was now like the wistful tenderness one feels for the memory of the loved and dead the special quality of what one feels for the dead he thought is that no action is possible any longer on the morning of october he received a notice informing him that all of his property including his bank accounts and safety deposit boxes had been attached to satisfy a delinquent judgment obtained against him in a trial involving a deficiency in his personal income tax of three years ago it was a formal notice complying with every requirement of the lawexcept that no such deficiency had ever existed and no such trial had ever taken place no he said to his indignationchoked attorney dont question them dont answer dont object but this is fantastic any more fantastic than the rest hank do you want me to do nothing to take it lying down no standing up and i mean standing dont move dont act but theyve left you helpless have they he asked softly smiling he had a few hundred dollars in cash left in his wallet nothing else but the odd glowing warmth in his mind like the feel of a distant handshake was the thought that in a secret safe of his bedroom there lay a bar of solid gold given to him by a goldhaired pirate next day on november he received a telephone call from washington from a bureaucrat whose voice seemed to come sliding down the wire on its knees in protestations of apology a mistake mr rearden it was nothing but an unfortunate mistake that attachment was not intended for you you know how it is nowadays with the inefficiency of all office help and with the amount of red tape were tangled in some bungling fool mixed the records and processed the attachment order against youwhen it wasnt your case at all it was in fact the case of a soap manufacturer please accept our apologies mr rearden our deepest personal apologies at the top level the voice slid to a slight expectant pause mr rearden im listening i cant tell you how sorry we are to have caused you any embarrassment or inconvenience and with all those damn formalities that we have to go throughyou know how it is red tapeit will take a few days perhaps a week to deprocess that order and to lift the attachment mr rearden i heard you were desperately sorry and ready to make any amends within our power you will of course be entitled to claim damages for any inconvenience this might cause you and we are prepared to pay we wont contest it you will of course file such a claim and i have not said that uh no you havent that is well what have you said mr rearden i have said nothing late on the next afternoon another voice came pleading from washington this one did not seem to slide but to bounce on the telephone wire with the gay virtuosity of a tightrope walker it introduced itself as tinky holloway and pleaded that rearden attend a conference an informal little conference just a few of us the toplevel few to be held in new york at the waynefalkland hotel day after next there have been so many misunderstandings in the past few weeks said tinky holloway such unfortunate misunderstandingsand so unnecessary we could straighten everything out in a jiffy mr rearden if we had a chance to have a little talk with you were extremely anxious to see you you can issue a subpoena for me any time you wish oh no no no the voice sounded frightened no mr rearden why think of such things you dont understand us were anxious to meet you on a friendly basis were seeking nothing but your voluntary cooperation holloway paused tensely wondering whether he had heard the faint sound of a distant chuckle he waited but heard nothing else mr rearden yes surely mr rearden at a time like this a conference with us could be to your great advantage a conferenceabout what youve encountered so many difficultiesand were anxious to help you in any way we can i have not asked for help these are precarious times mr rearden the public mood is so uncertain and inflammatory so so dangerous and we want to be able to protect you i have not asked for protection but surely you realize that were in a position to be of value to you and if theres anything you want from us any there isnt but you must have problems youd like to discuss with us i havent then well then giving up the attempt at the play of granting a favor holloway switched to an open pleathen wont you just give us a hearing if you have anything to say to me we have mr rearden we certainly have thats all were asking fora hearing just give us a chance just come to this conference you wouldnt be committing yourself to anything he said it involuntarily and stopped hearing a bright mocking stab of life in reardens voice an unpromisingsound as rearden answered i know it well i mean that is well then will you come all tight said rearden ill come he did not listen to holloways assurances of gratitude he noted only that holloway kept repeating at seven pm november fourth mr rearden november fourth as if the date had some special significance rearden dropped the receiver and lay back in his chair looking at the glow of furnace flames on the ceiling of his office he knew that the conference was a trap he knew also that he was walking into it with nothing for any trappers to gain tinky holloway dropped the receiver in his washington office and sat up tensely frowning claude slagenhop president of friends of global progress who had sat in an armchair nervously chewing a matchstick glanced up at him and asked not so good holloway shook his head hell come but no not so good he added i dont think hell take it thats what my punk told me i know the punk said wed better not try it god damn your punk weve got to well have to risk it the punk was philip rearden who weeks ago had reported to claude slagenhop no he wont let me in he wont give me a job ive tried as you wanted me to ive tried my

my sort of spirit remember and after all ive done for them after all my faith and service and loyalty to the cause you damn fool slagenhop had snapped of what use are you to us without him on the morning of november hank rearden was awakened by the ringing of the telephone he opened his eyes to the sight of a clear pale sky the sky of early dawn in the window of his bedroom a sky the delicate color of aquamarine with the first rays of an invisible sun giving a shade of porcelain pink to philadelphias ancient roof tops for a moment while his consciousness had a purity to equal the skys while he was aware of nothing but himself and had not yet reharnessed his soul to the burden of alien memories he lay still held by the sight and by the enchantment of a world to match it a world where the style of existence would be a continuous morning the telephone threw him back into exile it was screaming at spaced intervals like a nagging chronic cry for help the kind of cry that did not belong in his world he lifted the receiver frowning hello good morning henry said a quavering voice it was his mother motherat this hour he asked dryly oh youre always up at dawn and i wanted to catch you before you went to the office yes what is it ive got to see you henry ive got to speak to you today sometime today its important has anything happened no yes that is ive got to have a talk with you in person will you come im sorry i cant i have an appointment in new york tonight if you want me to come tomorrow no no not tomorrow its got to be today its got to there was a dim tone of panic in her voice but it was the stale panic of chronic helplessness not the sound of an emergencyexcept for an odd echo of fear in her mechanical insistence what is it mother i cant talk about it over the telephone ive got to see you then if you wish to come to the office no not at the office ive got to sec you alone where we can talk cant you come here today as a favor its your mother whos asking you a favor youve never come to see us at all and maybe youre not the one to blame for it either but cant you do it for me this once if i beg you to all right mother ill be there at four oclock this afternoon that will be fine henry thank you henry that will be fine it seemed to him that there was a touch of tension in the air of the mills that day it was a touch too slight to definebut the mills to him were like the face of a loved wife where he could catch shades of feeling almost ahead of expression he noticed small clusters of the new workers just three or four of them huddling together in conversation once or twice too often he noticed their manner a manner suggesting a poolroom corner not a factory he noticed a few glances thrown at him as he went by glances a shade too pointed and lingering he dismissed it it was not quite enough to wonder aboutand he had no time to wonder when he drove up to his former home that afternoon he stopped his car abruptly at the foot of the hill he had not seen the house since that may six months ago when he had walked out of itand the sight brought back to him the sum of all he had felt in ten years of daily homecoming the strain the bewilderment the gray weight of unconfessed unhappiness the stern endurance that forbade him to confess it the desperate innocence of the effort to understand his family the effort to be just he walked slowly up the path toward the door he felt no emotion only the sense of a great solemn clarity he knew that this house was a monument of guiltof his guilt toward himself he had expected to see his mother and philip he had not expected the third person who rose as they did at his entrance into the living room it was lillian he stopped on the threshold they stood looking at his face and at the open door behind him their faces had a look of fear and cunning the look of that blackmailthroughvirtue which he had learned to understand as if they hoped to get away with it by means of nothing but his pity to hold him trapped when a single step back could take him out of their reach they had counted on his pity and dreaded his anger they had not dared consider the third alternative his indifference what is she doing here he asked turning to his mother his voice dispassionately flat lillians been living here ever since your divorce she answered defensively i couldnt let her starve on the city pavements could i the look in his mothers eyes was halfplea as if she were begging him not to slap her face halftriumph as if she had slapped his he knew her motive it was not compassion there had never been much love between lillian and her it was their common revenge against him it was the secret satisfaction of spending his money on the exwife he had refused to support lillians head was poised to bow in greeting with the tentative hint of a smile on her lips halftimid halfbrash he did not pretend to ignore her he looked at her as if he were seeing her fully yet as if no presence were being registered in his mind he said nothing closed the door and stepped into the room his mother gave a small sigh of uneasy relief and dropped hastily into the nearest chair watching him nervously uncertain of whether he would follow her example what was it you wanted he asked sitting down his mother sat erect and oddly hunched her shoulders raised her head halflowered mercy henry she whispered what do you mean dont you understand me no wellshe spread her hands in an untidily fluttering gesture of helplessnesswell her eyes darted about struggling to escape his attentive glance well there are so many things to say and and i dont know how to say them but well theres one practical matter but its not important by itself its not why i called you here what is it the practical matter our allowance checksphilips and mine its the first of the month but on account of that attachment order the checks couldnt come through you know that dont you i know it well what are we going to do i dont know i mean what are you going to do about it nothing his mother sat staring at him as if counting the seconds of silence nothing henry i have no power to do anything they were watching his face with a kind of searching intensity he felt certain that his mother had told him the truth that immediate financial worry was not their purpose that it was only the symbol of a much wider issue but henry were caught short so was i but cant you send us some cash or something they gave me no warning no time to get any cash then look henry the thing was so unexpected it scared people i guessthe grocery store refuses to give us credit unless you ask for it i think they want you to sign a credit card or something so will you speak to them and arrange it i will not you wont she choked on a small gasp why i will not assume obligations that i cant fulfill what do you mean i will not assume debts i have no way of repaying what do you mean no way that attachment is only some sort of technicality its only temporary everybody knows that do they i dont but henrya grocery bill youre not sure youll be able to pay a grocery bill you with all the millions you own im not going to defraud the grocer by pretending that i own those millions what are you talking about who owns them nobody what do you mean mother i think you understand me fully i think you understood it before i did there isnt any ownership left in existence or any property its what youve approved of and believed in for years you wanted me tied im tied now its too late to play any games about it are you going to let some political ideas of yours she saw the look on his face and stopped abruptly lillian sat looking down at the floor as if afraid to glance up at this moment philip sat cracking his knuckles his mother dragged her eyes into focus again and whispered dont abandon us henry some faint stab of life in her voice told him that the lid of her real purpose was cracking open these are terrible times and were scared thats the truth of it henry were scared because youre turning away from us oh i dont mean just that grocery bill but thats a signa year ago you wouldnt have let that happen to us now now you dont care she made an expectant pause do you no well well i guess the blame is ours thats what i wanted to tell youthat we know were to blame we havent treated you right all these years weve been unfair to you weve made you suffer weve used you and given you no thanks in return were guilty henry weve sinned against you and we confess it what more can we say to you now will you find it in your heart to forgive us what is it you want me to do he asked in the clear flat tone of a business conference i dont know who am i to know but thats not what im talking of right now not of doing only of feeling its your feeling that im begging you for henryjust your feelingeven if we dont deserve it youre generous and strong will you cancel the past henry will you forgive us the look of terror in her eyes was real a year ago he would have told himself that this was her way of making amends he would have choked his revulsion against her words words which conveyed nothing to him but the fog of the meaningless he would have violated his mind to give them meaning even if he did not understand he would have ascribed to her the virtue of sincerity in her own terms even if they were not his but he was through with granting respect to any terms other than his own will you forgive us mother it would be best not to speak of that dont press me to tell you why i think you know it as well as i do if theres anything you want done tell me what it is theres nothing else to discuss but i dont understand you i dont thats what i called you here forto ask your forgiveness are you going to refuse to answer me very well what would it mean my forgiveness uh i said what would it mean she spread her hands out in an astonished gesture to indicate the selfevident why it it would make us feel better will it change the past it would make us feel better to know that youve forgiven it do you wish me to pretend that the past has not existed oh god henry cant you see all we want is only to know that you that you feel some concern for us i dont feel it do you wish me to fake it but thats what im begging you forto feel it on what ground ground in exchange for what henry henry its not business were talking about not steel tonnages and bank balances its feelingsand you talk like a trader i am one what he saw in her eyes was terrornot the helpless terror of struggling and failing to understand but the terror of being pushed toward the edge where to avoid understanding would no longer be possible look henry said philip hastily mother cant understand those things we dont know how to approach you we cant speak your language i dont speak yours what shes trying to say is that were sorry were terribly sorry that weve hurt you you think were not paying for it but we are were suffering remorse the pain in philips face was real a year ago rearden would have felt pity now he knew that they had held him through nothing but his reluctance to hurt them his fear of their pain he was not afraid of it any longer were sorry henry we know weve harmed you we wish we could atone for it but what can we do the past is past we cant undo it neither can i you can accept our repentance said lillian in a voice glassy with caution i have nothing to gain from you now i only want you to know that whatever ive done ive done it because i loved you he turned away without answering henry cried his mother whats happened to you whats changed you like that you dont seem to be human any more you keep pressing us for answers when we havent any answers to give you keep beating us with logicwhats logic at a time like thiswhats logic when people are suffering we cant help it cried philip were at your mercy said lillian they were throwing their pleas at a face that could not be reached they did not knowand their panic was the last of their struggle to escape the knowledgethat his merciless sense of justice which had been their only hold on him which had made him take any punishment and give them the benefit of every doubt was now turned against themthat the same force that had made him tolerant was now the force that made him ruthlessthat the justice which would forgive miles of innocent errors of knowledge would not forgive a single step taken in conscious evil henry dont you understand us his mother was pleading i do he said quietly she looked away avoiding the clarity of his eyes dont you care what becomes of us i dont arent you human her voice grew shrill with anger arent you capable of any love at all its your heart im trying to reach not your mind love is not something to argue and reason and bargain about its something to give to feel oh god henry cant you feel without thinking i never have in a moment her voice came back low and droning were not as smart as you are not as strong if weve sinned and blundered its because were helpless we need you youre all weve gotand were losing youand were afraid these are terrible times and getting worse people are scared to death scared and blind and not knowing what to do how are we to cope with it if you leave us were small and weak and well be swept like driftwood in that terror thats running loose in the world maybe we had our share of guilt for it maybe we helped to bring it about not knowing any better but whats done is doneand we cant stop it now if you abandon us were lost if you give up and vanish like all those men who it was not a sound that stopped her it was only a movement of his eyebrows the brief swift movement of a check mark then they saw him smile the nature of the smile was the most terrifying of answers so thats what youre afraid of he said slowly you cant quit his mother screamed in blind panic you cant quit now you could have last year but not now not today you cant turn deserter because now they take it out on your family theyll leave us penniless theyll seize everything theyll leave us to starve theyll keep still cried lillian more adept than the others at reading danger signs in reardens face his face held the remnant of a smile and they knew that he was not seeing them any longer but it was not in their power to know why his smile now seemed to hold pain and an almost wistful longing or why he was looking across the room at the niche of the farthest window he was seeing a finely sculptured face held composed under the lashing of his insults he was hearing a voice that had said to him quietly here in this room it is against the sin of forgiveness that i wanted to warn you you who had known it then he thought but he did not finish the sentence in his mind he let it end in the bitter twist of his smile because he knew what he had been about to think you who had known it thenforgive me there it washe thought looking at his familythe nature of their pleas for mercy the logic of those feelings they so righteously proclaimed as nonlogicalthere was the simple brutal essence of all men who speak of being able to feel without thought and of placing mercy over justice they had known what to fear they had grasped and named before he had the only way of deliverance left open to him they had understood the hopelessness of his industrial position the futility of his struggle the impossible burdens descending to crush him they had known that in reason in justice in selfpreservation his only course was to drop it all and runyet they wanted to hold him to keep him in the sacrificial furnace to make him let them devour the last of him in the name of mercy forgiveness and brothercannibal love if you still want me to explain it mother he said very quietly if youre still hoping that i wont be cruel enough to name what youre pretending not to know then heres whats wrong with your idea of forgiveness you regret that youve hurt me and as your atonement for it you ask that i offer myself to total immolation logic she screamed there you go again with your damn logic its pity that we need pity not logic he rose to his feet wait dont go henry dont abandon us dont sentence us to perish whatever we are were human we want to live why no he started in quiet astonishment and ended in quiet horror as the thought struck him fully i dont think you do if you did you would have known how to value me as if in silent proof and answer philips face went slowly into an expression intended as a smile of amusement yet holding nothing but fear and malice you wont be able to quit and run away said philip you cant run away without money it seemed to strike its goal rearden stopped short then chuckled thanks philip he said uh philip gave a nervous jerk of bewilderment so thats the purpose of the attachment order thats what your friends are afraid of i knew they were getting set to spring something on me today i didnt know that the attachment was their idea of cutting off escape he turned incredulously to look at his mother and thats why you had to see me today before the conference in new york mother didnt know it cried philip then caught himself and cried louder i dont know what youre talking about i havent said anything i havent said it his fear now seemed to have some much less mystic and much more practical quality dont worry you poor little louse i wont tell them that youve told me anything and if you were trying he did not finish he looked at the three faces before him and a sudden smile ended his sentence a smile of weariness of pity of incredulous revulsion he was seeing the final contradiction the grotesque absurdity at the end of the irrationalists game the men in washington had hoped to hold him by prompting these three to try for the role of hostages you think youre so good dont you it was a sudden cry and it came from lillian she had leaped to her feet to bar his exit her face was distorted as he had seen it once before on that morning when she had learned the name of his mistress youre so good youre so proud of yourself well i have something to tell you she looked as if she had not believed until this moment that her game was lost the sight of her face struck him like a last shred completing a circuit and in sudden clarity he knew what her game had been and why she had married him if to choose a person as the constant center of ones concern as the focus of ones view of life was to lovehe thoughtthen it was true that she loved him but if to him love was a celebration of ones self and of existencethen to the selfhaters and lifehaters the pursuit of destruction was the only form and equivalent of love it was for the best of his virtues that lillian had chosen him for his strength his confidence his prideshe had chosen him as one chooses an object of love as the symbol of mans living power but the destruction of that power had been her goal he saw them as they had been at their first meeting he the man of violent energy and passionate ambition the man of achievement lighted by the flame of his success and flung into the midst of those pretentious ashes who called themselves an intellectual elite the burned out remnants of undigested culture feeding on the afterglow of the minds of others offering their denial of the mind as their only claim to distinction and a craving to control the world as their only lustshe the woman hangeron of that elite wearing their shopworn sneer as her answer to the universe holding impotence as superiority and emptiness as virtuehe unaware of their hatred innocently scornful of their posturing fraudshe seeing him as the danger to their world as a threat as a challenge as a reproach the lust that drives others to enslave an empire had become in her limits a passion for power over him she had set out to break him as if unable to equal his value she could surpass it by destroying it as if the measure of his greatness would thus become the measure of hers as ifhe thought with a shudderas if the vandal who smashed a statue were greater than the artist who had made it as if the murderer who killed a child were greater than the mother who had given it birth he remembered her hammering derision of his work his mills his metal his success he remembered her desire to see him drunk just once her attempts to push him into infidelity her pleasure at the thought that he had fallen to the level of some sordid romance her terror on discovering that that romance had been an attainment not a degradation her line of attack which he had found so baffling had been constant and clearit was his selfesteem she had sought to destroy knowing that a man who surrenders his value is at the mercy of anyones will it was his moral purity she had struggled to breach it was his confident rectitude she had wanted to shatter by means of the poison of guiltas if were he to collapse his depravity would give her a right to hers for the same purpose and motive for the same satisfaction as others weave complex systems of philosophy to destroy generations of establish dictatorships to destroy a country so she possessing no weapons except femininity had made it her goal to destroy one man yours was the code of lifehe remembered the voice of his lost young teacherwhat then is theirs i have something to tell you cried lillian with the sound of that impotent rage which wishes that words were brass knuckles youre so proud of yourself arent you youre so proud of your name rearden steel rearden metal rearden wife thats what i was wasnt i mrs rearden mrs henry rearden the sounds she was making were now a string of cackling gasps an unrecognizable corruption of laughter well i think youd like to know that your wifes been laid by another man ive been unfaithful to you do you hear me ive been unfaithful not with some great noble lover but with the scummiest louse with jim taggart three months ago before your divorce while i was your wife while i was still your wife he stood listening like a scientist studying a subject of no personal relevance whatever there he thought was the final abortion of the creed of collective interdependence the creed of nonidentity nonproperty nonfact the belief that the moral stature of one is at the mercy of the action of another ive been unfaithful to you dont you hear me you stainless puritan ive slept with jim taggart you incorruptible hero dont you hear me dont you hear me dont you he was looking at her as he would have looked if a strange woman had approached him on the street with a personal confessiona look like the equivalent of the words why tell it to me her voice trailed off he had not known what the destruction of a person would be like but he knew that he was seeing the destruction of lillian he saw it in the collapse of her face in the sudden slackening of features as if there were nothing to hold them together in the eyes blind yet staring staring inward filled with that terror which no outer threat can equal it was not the look of a person losing her mind but the look of a mind seeing total defeat and in the same instant seeing her own nature for the first timethe look of a person seeing that after years of preaching nonexistence she had achieved it he turned to go his mother stopped him at the door seizing his arm with a look of stubborn bewilderment with the last of her effort at selfdeceit she moaned in a voice of tearfully petulant reproach are you really incapable of forgiveness no mother he answered im not i would have forgiven the pastif today you had urged me to quit and disappear there was a cold wind outside tightening his overcoat about him like an embrace there was the great fresh sweep of country stretching at the foot of the hill and the clear receding sky of twilight like two sunsets ending the day the red glow of the sun was a straight still band in the west and the breathing red band in the east was the glow of his mills the feel of the steering wheel under his hands and of the smooth highway streaming past as he sped to new york had an oddly bracing quality it was a sense of extreme precision and of relaxation together a sense of action without strain which seemed inexplicably youthfuluntil he realized that this was the way he had acted and had expected always to act in his youthand what he now felt was like the simple astonished question why should one ever have to act in any other manner it seemed to him that the skyline of new york when it rose before him had a strangely luminous clarity though its shapes were veiled by distance a clarity that did not seem to rest in the object but felt as if the illumination came from him he looked at the great city with no tie to any view or usage others had made of it it was not a city of gangsters or panhandlers or derelicts or whores it was the greatest industrial achievement in the history of man its only meaning was that which it meant to him there was a personal quality in his sight of it a quality of possessiveness and of unhesitant perception as if he were seeing it for the first timeor the last he paused in the silent corridor of the waynefalkland at the door of the suite he was to enter it took him a long moments effort to lift his hand and knock it was the suite that had belonged to francisco danconia there were coils of cigarette smoke weaving through the air of the drawing room among the velvet drapes and bare polished tables with its costly furniture and the absence of all personal belongings the room had that air of dreary luxury which pertains to transient occupancy as dismal as the air of a flophouse five figures rose in the fog at his entrance wesley mouch eugene lawson james taggart dr floyd ferris and a slim slouching man who looked like a ratfaced tennis player and was introduced to him as tinky holloway all right said rearden cutting off the greetings the smiles the offers of drinks and the comments on the national emergency what did you want were here as your friends mr rearden said tinky holloway purely as your friends for an informal conversation with a view to closer mutual teamwork were anxious to avail ourselves of your outstanding ability said lawson and your expert advice on the countrys industrial problems its men like you that we need in washington said dr ferris theres no reason why you should have remained an outsider for so long when your voice is needed at the top level of national leadership the sickening thing about it thought rearden was that the speeches were only halflies the other half in their tone of hysterical urgency was the unstated wish to have it somehow be true what did you want he asked why to listen to you mr rearden said wesley mouch the jerk of his features imitating a frightened smile the smile was faked the fear was real we we want the benefit of your opinion on the nations industrial crisis i have nothing to say but mr rearden said dr ferris all we want is a chance to cooperate with you ive told you once publicly that i dont cooperate at the point of a gun cant we bury the hatchet at a time like this said lawson beseechingly the gun go ahead uh its you whore holding it bury it if you think you can that that was just a figure of speech lawson explained blinking i was speaking metaphorically i wasnt cant we all stand together for the sake of the country in this hour of emergency said dr ferris cant we disregard our differences of opinion were willing to meet you halfway if theres any aspect of our policy which you oppose just tell us and well issue a directive to cut it boys i didnt come here to help you pretend that im not in the position im in and that any halfway is possible between us now come to the point youve prepared some new gimmick to spring on the steel industry what is it as a matter of fact said mouch we do have a vital question to discuss in regard to the steel industry but but your language mr rearden we dont want to spring anything on you said holloway we asked you here to discuss it with you i came here to take orders give them but mr rearden we dont want to look at it that way we dont want to give you orders we want your voluntary consent rearden smiled i know it you do holloway started eagerly but something about reardens smile made him slide into uncertainty well then and you brother said rearden know that that is the flaw in your game the fatal flaw that will blast it skyhigh now do you tell me what clout on my head youre working so hard not to let me noticeor do i go home oh no mr rearden cried lawson with a sudden dart of his eyes to his wrist watch you cant go nowthat is i mean you wouldnt want to go without hearing what we have to say then let me hear it he saw them glancing at one another wesley mouch seemed afraid to address him mouchs face assumed an expression of petulant stubbornness like a signal of command pushing the others forward whatever their qualifications to dispose of the fate of the steel industry they had been brought here to act as mouchs conversational bodyguards rearden wondered about the reason for the presence of james taggart taggart sat in gloomy silence sullenly sipping a drink never glancing in his direction we have worked out a plan said dr ferris too cheerfully which will solve the problems of the steel industry and which will meet with your full approval as a measure providing for the general welfare while protecting your interests and insuring your safety in a dont try to tell me what im going to think give me the facts it is a plan which is fair sound equitable and dont tell me your evaluation give me the facts it is a plan which dr ferris stopped he had lost the habit of naming facts under this plan said wesley mouch we will grant the industry a five per cent increase in the price of steel he paused triumphantly rearden said nothing of course some minor adjustments will be necessary said holloway airily leaping into the silence as onto a vacant tennis court a certain increase in prices will have to be granted to the producers of iron oreoh three per cent at mostin view of the added hardships which some of them mr larkin of minnesota for instance will now encounter inasmuch as theyll have to ship their ore by the costly means of trucks since mr james taggart has had to sacrifice his minnesota branch line to the public welfare and of course an increase in freight rates will have to be granted to the countrys railroadslets say seven per cent roughly speakingin view of the absolutely essential need for holloway stopped like a player emerging from a whirlwind activity to notice suddenly that no opponent was answering his shots but there will be no increase in wages said dr ferris hastily an essential point of the plan is that we will grant no increase in wages to the steel workers in spite of their insistent demands we do wish to be fair to you mr rearden and to protect your interestseven at the risk of popular resentment and indignation of course if we expect labor to make a sacrifice said lawson we must show them that management too is making certain sacrifices for the sake of the country the mood of labor in the steel industry is extremely tense at present mr rearden it is dangerously explosive and and in order to protect you from from he stopped yes said rearden from from possible violence certain measures are necessary which look jimhe turned suddenly to james taggartwhy dont you explain it to mr rearden as a fellow industrialist well somebodys got to support the railroads said taggart sullenly not looking at him the country needs railroads and somebodys got to help us carry the load and if we dont get an increase in freight rates no no no snapped wesley mouch tell mr rearden about the working of the railroad unification plan well the plan is a full success said taggart lethargically except for the not fully controllable element of time it is only a question of time before our unified teamwork puts every railroad in the country back on its feet the plan im in a position to assure you would work as successfully for any other industry no doubt about that said rearden and turned to mouch why do you ask the stooge to waste my time what has the railroad unification plan to do with me but mr rearden cried mouch with desperate cheerfulness thats the pattern were to follow thats what we called you here to discuss what the steel unification plan there was an instant of silence as of breaths drawn after a plunge rearden sat looking at them with a glance that seemed to be a glance of interest in view of the critical plight of the steel industry said mouch with a sudden rush as if not to give himself time to know what made him uneasy about the nature of reardens glance and since steel is the most vitally crucially basic commodity the foundation of our entire industrial structure drastic measures must be taken to preserve the countrys steelmaking facilities equipment and plant the tone and impetus of public speaking carried him that far and no farther with this objective in view our plan is our plan is our plan is really very simple said tinky holloway striving to prove it by the gaily bouncing simplicity of his voice well lift all restrictions from the production of steel and every company will produce all it can according to its ability but to avoid the waste and danger of dogeatdog competition all the companies will deposit their gross earnings into a common pool to be known as the steel unification pool in charge of a special board at the end of the year the board will distribute these earnings by totaling the nations steel output and dividing it by the number of openhearth furnaces in existence thus arriving at an average which will be fair to alland every company will be paid according to its need the preservation of its furnaces being its basic need every company will be paid according to the number of furnaces it owns he stopped waited then added thats it mr rearden and getting no answer said oh theres a lot of wrinkles to be ironed out but but thats it whatever reaction they had expected it was not the one they saw rearden leaned back in his chair his eyes attentive but fixed on space as if looking at a not too distant distance then he asked with an odd note of quietly impersonal amusement will you tell me just one thing boys what is it youre counting on he knew that they understood he saw on their faces that stubbornly evasive look which he had once thought to be the look of a liar cheating a victim but which he now knew to be worse the look of a man cheating himself of his own consciousness they did not answer they remained silent as if struggling not to make him forget his question but to make themselves forget that they had heard it its a sound practical plan snapped james taggart unexpectedly with an angry edge of sudden animation in his voice it will work it has to work we want it to work no one answered him mr rearden said holloway timidly well let me see said rearden orren boyles associated steel owns openhearth furnaces onethird of them standing idle and the rest producing an average of tons of steel per furnace per day i own openhearth furnaces working at capacity producing tons of rearden metal per furnace per day so we own so pooled furnaces with a pooled output of tons which makes an average of tons per furnace each day of the year i producing tons will be paid for tons boyle producing tons will be paid for tons never mind the other members of the pool they wont change the scale except to bring the average still lower most of them doing worse than boyle none of them producing as much as i now how long do you expect me to last under your plan there was no answer then lawson cried suddenly blindly righteously in time of national peril it is your duty to serve suffer and work for the salvation of the country i dont see why pumping my earnings into orren boyles pocket is going to save the country you have to make certain sacrifices to the public welfare i dont see why orren boyle is more the public than i am oh its not a question of mr boyle at all its much wider than any one person its a matter of preserving the countrys natural resourcessuch as factoriesand saving the whole of the nations industrial plant we cannot permit the ruin of an establishment as vast as mr boyles the country needs it i think said rearden slowly that the country needs me much more than it needs orren boyle but of course cried lawson with startled enthusiasm the country needs you mr rearden you do realize that dont you but lawsons avid pleasure at the familiar formula of selfimmolation vanished abruptly at the sound of reardens voice a cold traders voice answering i do its not boyle alone whos involved said holloway pleadingly the countrys economy would not be able to stand a major dislocation at the present moment there are thousands of boyles workers suppliers and customers what would happen to them if associated steel went bankrupt what will happen to the thousands of my workers suppliers and customers when i go bankrupt you mr rearden said holloway incredulously but youre the richest safest and strongest industrialist in the country at this moment what about the moment after next uh how long do you expect me to be able to produce at a loss oh mr rearden i have complete faith in you to hell with your faith how do you expect me to do it youll manage how there was no answer we cant theorize about the future cried wesley mouch when heres an immediate national collapse to avoid weve got to save the countrys economy weve got to do something reardens imperturbible glance of curiosity drove him to heedlessness if you dont like it do you have a better solution to offer sure said rearden easily if its production that you want then get out of the way junk all of your damn regulations let orren boyle go broke let me buy the plant of associated steeland it will be pouring a thousand tons a day from every one of its sixty furnaces oh but but we couldnt gasped mouch that would be monopoly rearden chuckled okay he said indifferently then let my mills superintendent buy it hell do a better job than boyle oh but that would be letting the strong have an advantage over the weak we couldnt do that then dont talk about saving the countrys economy all we want is he stopped all you want is production without men whore able to produce isnt it that thats theory thats just a theoretical extreme all we want is a temporary adjustment youve been making those temporary adjustments for years dont you see that youve run out of time thats just theo his voice trailed off and stopped well now look here said holloway cautiously its not as if mr boyle were actually weak mr boyle is an extremely able man its just that hes suffered some unfortunate reverses quite beyond his control he had invested large sums in a publicspirited project to assist the undeveloped peoples of south america and that copper crash of theirs has dealt him a severe financial blow so its only a matter of giving him a chance to recover a helping hand to bridge the gap a bit of temporary assistance nothing more all we have to do is just equalize the sacrificethen everybody will recover and prosper youve been equalizing sacrifice for over a hundredhe stopped for thousands of years said rearden slowly dont you see that youre at the end of the road thats just theory snapped wesley mouch rearden smiled i know your practice he said softly its your theory that im trying to understand he knew that the specific reason behind the plan was orren boyle he knew that the working of an intricate mechanism operated by pull threat pressure blackmaila mechanism like an irrational adding machine run amuck and throwing up any chance sum at the whim of any momenthad happened to add up to boyles pressure upon these men to extort for him this last piece of plunder he knew also that boyle was not the cause of it or the essential to consider that boyle was only a chance rider not the builder of the infernal machine that had destroyed the world that it was not boyle who had made it possible nor any of the men in this room they too were only riders on a machine without a driver they were trembling hitchhikers who knew that their vehicle was about to crash into its final abyssand it was not love or fear of boyle that made them cling to their course and press on toward their end it was something else it was some one nameless element which they knew and evaded knowing something which was neither thought nor hope something he identified only as a certain look in their faces a furtive look saying i can get away with it whyhe thought why do they think they can we cant afford any theories cried wesley mouch weve got to act well then ill offer you another solution why dont you take over my mills and be done with it the jolt that shook them was genuine terror oh no gasped mouch we wouldnt think of it cried holloway we stand for free enterprise cried dr ferris we dont want to harm you cried lawson were your friends mr rearden cant we all work together were your friends there across the room stood a table with a telephone the same table most likely and the same instrumentand suddenly rearden felt as if he were seeing the convulsed figure of a man bent over that telephone a man who had then known what he rearden was now beginning to learn a man fighting to refuse him the same request which he was now refusing to the present tenants of this roomhe saw the finish of that fight a mans tortured face lifted to confront him and a desperate voice saying steadily mr rearden i swear to you by the woman i love that i am your friend this was the act he had then called treason and this was the man he had rejected in order to go on serving the men confronting him now who then had been the traitorhe thought he thought it almost without feeling without right to feel conscious of nothing but a solemnly reverent clarity who had chosen to give its present tenants the means to acquire this room whom had he sacrificed and to whose profit mr rearden moaned lawson whats the matter he turned his head saw lawsons eyes watching him fearfully and guessed what look lawson had caught in his face we dont want to seize your mills cried mouch we dont want to deprive you of your property cried dr ferris you dont understand us im beginning to a year ago he thought they would have shot him two years ago they would have confiscated his property generations ago men of their kind had been able to afford the luxury of murder and expropriation the safety of pretending to themselves and their victims that material loot was their only objective but their time was running out and his fellow victims had gone gone sooner than any historical schedule had promised and they the looters were now left to face the undisguised reality of their own goal look boys he said wearily i know what you want you want to eat my mills and have them too and all i want to know is this what makes you think its possible i dont know what you mean said mouch in an injured tone of voice we said we didnt want your mills all right ill say it more precisely you want to eat me and have me too how do you propose to do it i dont know how you can say that after weve given you every assurance that we consider you of invaluable importance to the country to the steel industry to i believe you thats what makes the riddle harder you consider me of invaluable importance to the country hell you consider me of invaluable importance even to your own necks you sit there trembling because you know that im the last one left to save your livesand you know that time is as short as that yet you propose a plan to destroy me a plan which demands with an idiots crudeness without loopholes detours or escape that i work at a lossthat i work with every ton i pour costing me more than ill get for itthat i feed the last of my wealth away until we all starve together that much irrationality is not possible to any man or any looter for your own sakenever mind the countrys or mineyou must be counting on something what he saw the gettingawaywithit look on their faces a peculiar look that seemed secretive yet resentful as if incredibly it were he who was hiding some secret from them i dont see why you should choose to take such a defeatist view of the situation said mouch sullenly defeatist do you really expect me to be able to remain in business under your plan but its only temporary theres no such thing as a temporary suicide but its only for the duration of the emergency only until the country recovers how do you expect it to recover there was no answer how do you expect me to produce after i go bankrupt you wont go bankrupt youll always produce said dr ferris indifferently neither in praise nor in blame merely in the tone of stating a fact of nature as he would have said to another man youll always be a bum you cant help it its in your blood or to be more scientific youre conditioned that way rearden sat up it was as if he had been struggling to find the secret combination of a lock and felt at those words a faint click within as of the first tumbrel falling into place its only a matter of weathering this crisis said mouch of giving people a reprieve a chance to catch up and then then things will improve how there was no answer what will improve them there was no answer who will improve them christ mr rearden people dont just stand still cried holloway they do things they grow they move forward what people holloway waved his hand vaguely people he said what people the people to whom youre going to feed the last of rearden steel without getting anything in return the people wholl go on consuming more than they produce conditions will change wholl change them there was no answer have you anything left to loot if you didnt see the nature of your policy beforeits not possible that you dont see it now look around you all those damned peoples states all over the earth have been existing only on the handouts which you squeezed for them out of this country but youyou have no place left to sponge on or mooch from no country on the face of the globe this was the greatest and last youve drained it youve milked it dry of all that irretrievable splendor im only one remnant the last what will you do you and your peoples globe after youve finished me what are you hoping for what do you see aheadexcept plain stark animal starvation they did not answer they did not look at him their faces wore expressions of stubborn resentment as if his were the plea of a liar then lawson said softly half in reproach half in scorn well after all you businessmen have kept predicting disasters for years youve cried catastrophe at every progressive measure and told us that well perishbut we havent he started a smile but drew back from the sudden intensity of reardens eyes rearden had felt another click in his mind the sharper click of the second tumbrel connecting the circuits of the lock he leaned forward what are you counting on he asked his tone had changed it was low it had the steady pressing droning sound of a drill its only a matter of gaining time cried mouch there isnt any time left to gain all we need is a chance cried lawson there are no chances left its only until we recover cried holloway there is no way to recover only until our policies begin to work cried dr ferris theres no way to make the irrational work there was no answer what can save you now oh youll do something cried james taggart theneven though it was only a sentence he had heard all his lifehe felt a deafening crash within him as of a steel door dropping open at the touch of the final tumbrel the one small number completing the sum and releasing the intricate lock the answer uniting all the pieces the questions and the unsolved wounds of his life in the moment of silence after the crash it seemed to him that he heard franciscos voice asking him quietly in the ballroom of this building yet asking it also here and now who is the guiltiest man in this room he heard his own answer of the past i supposejames taggart and franciscos voice saying without reproach no mr rearden its not james taggartbut here in this room and this moment his mind answered i am he had cursed these looters for their stubborn blindness it was he who had made it possible from the first extortion he had accepted from the first directive he had obeyed he had given them cause to believe that reality was a thing to be cheated that one could demand the irrational and someone somehow would provide it if he had accepted the equalization of opportunity bill if he had accepted directive if he had accepted the law that those who could not equal his ability had the right to dispose of it that those who had not earned were to profit but he who had was to lose that those who could not think were to command but he who could was to obey themthen were they illogical in believing that they existed in an irrational universe he had made it for them he had provided it were they illogical in believing that theirs was only to wish to wish with no concern for the possibleand that his was to fulfill their wishes by means they did not have to know or name they the impotent mystics struggling to escape the responsibility of reason had known that he the rationalist had undertaken to serve their whims they had known that he had given them a blank check on realityhis was not to ask whytheirs was not to ask howlet them demand that he give them a share of his wealth then all that he owns then more than he ownsimpossibleno hell do something he did not know that he had leaped to his feet that he stood staring down at james taggart seeing in the unbridled shapelessness of taggarts features the answer to all the devastation he had witnessed through the years of his life whats the matter mr rearden what have i said taggart was asking with rising anxietybut he was out of the reach of taggarts voice he was seeing the progression of the years the monstrous extortions the impossible demands the inexplicable victories of evil the preposterous plans and unintelligible goals proclaimed in volumes of muddy philosophy the desperate wonder of the victims who thought that some complex malevolent wisdom was moving the powers destroying the worldand all of it had rested on one tenet behind the shifty eyes of the victors hell do something well get away with ithell let ushell do something you businessmen kept predicting that wed perish but we havent it was true he thought they had not been blind to reality he hadblind to the reality he himself had created no they had not perished but who had who had perished to pay for their manner of survival ellis wyatt ken danagger francisco danconia he was reaching for his hat and coat when he noticed that the men in the room were trying to stop him that their faces had a look of panic and their voices were crying in bewilderment whats the matter mr rearden why but why what have we said youre not going you cant go its too early not yet oh not yet he felt as if he were seeing them from the rear window of a speeding express as if they stood on the track behind him waving their arms in futile gestures and screaming indistinguishable sounds their figures growing smaller in the distance their voices fading one of them tried to stop him as he turned to the door he pushed him out of his way not roughly but with a simple smooth sweep of his arm as one brushes aside an obstructing curtain then walked out silence was his only sensation as he sat at the wheel of his car speeding back down the road to philadelphia it was the silence of immobility within him as if possessing knowledge he could now afford to rest with no further activity of soul he felt nothing neither anguish nor elation it was as if by an effort of years he had climbed a mountain to gain a distant view and having reached the top had fallen to lie still to rest before he looked free to spare himself for the first time he was aware of the long empty road streaming then curving then streaming straight before him of the effortless pressure of his hands on the wheel and the screech of the tires on the curves but he felt as if he were speeding down a skyway suspended and coiling in empty space the passersby at the factories the bridges the power plants along his road saw a sight that had once been natural among them a trim expensively powerful car driven by a confident man with the concept of success proclaimed more loudly than by any electric sign proclaimed by the drivers garments by his expert steering by his purposeful speed they watched him go past and vanish into the haze equating earth with night he saw his mills rising in the darkness as a black silhouette against a breathing glow the glow was the color of burning gold and rearden steel stood written across the sky in the cool white fire of crystal he looked at the long silhouette the curves of blast furnaces standing like triumphal arches the smokestacks rising like a solemn colonnade along an avenue of honor in an imperial city the bridges hanging like garlands the cranes saluting like lances the smoke waving slowly like flags the sight broke the stillness within him and he smiled in greeting it was a smile of happiness of love of dedication he had never loved his mills as he did in that moment forseeing them by an act of his own vision cleared of all but his own code of values in a luminous reality that held no contradictionshe was seeing the reason of his love the mills were an achievement of his mind devoted to his enjoyment of existence erected in a rational world to deal with rational men if those men had vanished if that world was gone if his mills had ceased to serve his valuesthen the mills were only a pile of dead scrap to be left to crumble the sooner the betterto be left not as an act of treason but as an act of loyalty to their actual meaning the mills were still a mile ahead when a small spurt of flame caught his sudden attention among all the shades of fire in the vast spread of structures he could tell the abnormal and the outofplace this one was too raw a shade of yellow and it was darting from a spot where no fire had reason to be from a structure by the gate of the main entrance in the next instant he heard the dry crack of a gunshot then three answering cracks in swift succession like an angry hand slapping a sudden assailant then the black mass barring the road in the distance took shape it was not mere darkness and it did not recede as he came closerit was a mob squirming at the main gate trying to storm the mills he had time to distinguish waving arms some with clubs some with crowbars some with riflesthe yellow flames of burning wood gushing from the window of the gatekeepers officethe blue cracks of gunfire darting out of the mob and the answers spitting from the roofs of the structureshe had time to see a human figure twisting backward and falling from the top of a carthen he sent his wheels into a shrieking curve turning into the darkness of a side road he was going at the rate of sixty miles an hour down the ruts of an unpaved soil toward the eastern gate of the millsand the gate was in sight when the impact of tires on a gully threw the car off the road to the edge of a ravine where an ancient slag heap lay at the bottom with the weight of his chest and elbow on the wheel pitted against two tons of speeding metal the curve of his body forced the curve of the car to complete its screaming halfcircle sweeping it back onto the road and into the control of his hands it had taken one instant but in the next his foot went down on the brake tearing the engine to a stop for in the moment when his headlights had swept the ravine he had glimpsed an oblong shape darker than the gray of the weeds on the slope and it had seemed to him that a brief white blur had been a human hand waving for help throwing off his overcoat he went hurrying down the side of the ravine lumps of earth giving way under his feet he went catching at the dried coils of brush halfrunning halfsliding toward the long black form which he could now distinguish to be a human body a scum of cotton was swimming against the moon he could see the white of a hand and the shape of an arm lying stretched in the weeds but the body lay still with no sign of motion mr rearden it was a whisper struggling to be a cry it was the terrible sound of eagerness fighting against a voice that could be nothing but a moan of pain he did not know which came first it felt like a single shock his thought that the voice was familiar a ray of moonlight breaking through the cotton the movement of falling down on his knees by the white oval of a face and the recognition it was the wet nurse he felt the boys hand clutching his with the abnormal strength of agony while he was noticing the tortured lines of the face the drained lips the glazing eyes and the thin dark trickle from a small black hole in too wrong too close a spot on the left side of the boys chest mr rearden i wanted to stop them i wanted to save you what happened to you kid they shot me so i wouldnt talk i wanted to preventhis hand fumbled toward the red glare in the skywhat theyre doing i was too late but ive tried to ive tried and and im still able to talk listen they you need help lets get you to a hospital and no wait i i dont think i have much time left to me and and ive got to tell you listen that riot its staged on orders from washington its not workers not your workers its those new boys of theirs and and a lot of goons hired on the outside dont believe a word theyll tell you about it its a frameup its their rotten kind of frameup there was a desperate intensity in the boys face the intensity of a crusaders battle his voice seemed to gain a sound of life from some fuel burning in broken spurts within himand rearden knew that the greatest assistance he could now render was to listen they theyve got a steel unification plan ready and they need an excuse for it because they know that the country wont take it and you wont stand for it theyre afraid this ones going to be too much for everybody its just a plan to skin you alive thats all so they want to make it look like youre starving your workers and the workers are running amuck and youre unable to control them and the governments got to step in for your own protection and for public safety thats going to be their pitch mr rearden rearden was noticing the torn flesh of the boys hands the drying mud of blood and dust on his palms and his clothing gray patches of dust on knees and stomach scrambled with the needles of burs in the intermittent fits of moonlight he could see the trail of flattened weeds and glistening smears going off into the darkness below he dreaded to think how far the boy had crawled and for how long they didnt want you to be here tonight mr rearden they didnt want you to see their peoples rebellion afterwards you know how they screw up the evidence there wont be a straight story to get anywhere and they hope to fool the country and you that theyre acting to protect you from violence dont let them get away with it mr rearden tell the country tell the people tell the newspapers tell them that i told you its under oath i swear it that makes it legal doesnt it doesnt it that gives you a chance rearden pressed the boys hand in his thank you kid i im sorry im late mr rearden but but they didnt let me in on it till the last minute till just before it started they called me in on a a strategy conference there was a man there by the name of peters from the unification board hes a stooge of tinky holloway whos a stooge of orren boyle what they wanted from me was they wanted me to sign a lot of passes to let some of the goons in so theyd start trouble from the inside and the outside together to make it look like they really were your workers i refused to sign the passes you did after theyd let you in on their game but but of course mr rearden did you think id play that kind of game no kid no i guess not only what only thats when you stuck your neck out but i had to i couldnt help them wreck the mills could i how long was i to keep from sticking my neck out till they broke yours and what would i do with my neck if thats how i had to keep it you you understand it dont you mr rearden yes i do i refused them i ran out of the office i ran to look for the superintendent to tell him everything but i couldnt find him and then i heard shots at the main gate and i knew it had started i tried to phone your home the phone wires were cut i ran to get my car i wanted to reach you or a policeman or a newspaper or somebody but they must have been following me thats when they shot me in the parking lot from behind all i remember is falling and and then when i opened my eyes they had dumped me here on the slag heap on the slag heap said rearden slowly knowing that the heap was a hundred feet below the boy nodded pointing vaguely down into the darkness yeah down there and then i i started crawling crawling up i wanted i wanted to last till i told somebody whod tell you the paintwisted lines of his face smoothed suddenly into a smile his voice had the sound of a lifetimes triumph as he added i have then he jerked his head up and asked in the tone of a childs astonishment at a sudden discovery mr rearden is this how it feels to to want something very much very desperately much and to make it yes kid thats how it feels the boys head dropped back against reardens arm the eyes closing the mouth relaxing as if to hold a moments profound contentment but you cant stop there youre not through youve got to hang on till i get you to a doctor and he was lifting the boy cautiously but a convulsion of pain ran through the boys face his mouth twisting to stop a cryand rearden had to lower him gently back to the ground the boy shook his head with a glance that was almost apology i wont make it mr rearden no use fooling myself i know im through then as if by some dim recoil against selfpity he added reciting a memorized lesson his voice a desperate attempt at his old cynical intellectual tone what does it matter mr rearden man is only a collection of conditioned chemicals and a mans dying doesnt make any more difference than an animals you know better than that yes he whispered yes i guess i do his eyes wandered over the vast darkness then rose to reardens face the eyes were helpless longing childishly bewildered i know its crap all those things they taught us all of it everything they said about living or or dying dying it wouldnt make any difference to chemicals but he stopped and all of his desperate protest was only in the intensity of his voice dropping lower to say but it does to me and and i guess it makes a difference to an animal too but they said there are no values only social customs no values his hand clutched blindly at the hole in his chest as if trying to hold that which he was losing no values then his eyes opened wider with the sudden calm of full frankness id like to live mr rearden god how id like to his voice was passionately quiet not because im dying but because ive just discovered it tonight what it means really to be alive and its funny do you know when discovered it in the office when i stuck my neck out when i told the bastards to go to hell theres theres so many things i wish id known sooner but well its no use crying over spilled milk he saw reardens involuntary glance at the flattened trail below and added over spilled anything mr rearden listen kid said rearden sternly i want you to do me a favor now mr rearden yes now why of course mr rearden if i can youve done me a big favor tonight but i want you to do a still bigger one youve done a great job climbing out of that slag heap now will you try for something still harder you were willing to die to save my mills will you try to live for me for you mr rearden for me because im asking you to because i want you to because we still have a great distance to climb together you and i does it does it make a difference to you mr rearden it does will you make up your mind that you want to livejust as you did down there on the slag heap that you want to last and live will you fight for it you wanted to fight my battle will you fight this one with me as our first he felt the clutching of the boys hand it conveyed the violent eagerness of the answer the voice was only a whisper ill try mr rearden now help me to get you to a doctor just relax take it easy and let me lift you yes mr rearden with the jerk of a sudden effort the boy pulled himself up to lean on an elbow take it easy tony he saw a sudden flicker in the boys face an attempt at his old bright impudent grin not nonabsolute any more no not any more youre a full absolute now and you know it yes i know several of them now theres onehe pointed at the wound in his chestthats an absolute isnt it andhe went on speaking while rearden was lifting him from the ground by imperceptible seconds and inches speaking as if the trembling intensity of his words were serving as an anesthetic against the painand men cant live if rotten bastards like the ones in washington get away with things like like the one theyre doing tonight if everything becomes a stinking fake and nothing is real and nobody is anybody men cant live that way thats an absolute isnt it yes tony thats an absolute rearden rose to his feet by a long cautious effort he saw the tortured spasm of the boys features as he settled him slowly against his chest like a baby held tight in his armsbut the spasm twisted into another echo of the impudent grin and the boy asked whos the wet nurse now i guess i am he took the first steps up the slant of crumbling soil his body tensed to the task of shock absorber for his fragile burden to the task of maintaining a steady progression where there was no foothold to find the boys head dropped on reardens shoulder hesitantly almost as if this were a presumption rearden bent down and pressed his lips to the duststreaked forehead the boy jerked back raising his head with a shock of incredulous indignant astonishment do you know what you did he whispered as if unable to believe that it was meant for him put your head down said rearden and ill do it again the boys head dropped and rearden kissed his forehead it was like a fathers recognition granted to a sons battle the boy lay still his face hidden his hands clutching reardens shoulders then with no hint of sound with only the sudden beat of faint spaced rhythmic shudders to show it rearden knew that the boy was cryingcrying in surrender in admission of all the things which he could not put into the words he had never found rearden went on moving slowly upward step by groping step fighting for firmness of motion against the weeds the drifts of dust the chunks of scrap metal the refuse of a distant age he went on toward the line where the red glow of his mills marked the edge of the pit above him his movement a fierce struggle that had to take the form of a gentle unhurried flow he heard no sobs but he felt the rhythmic shudders and through the cloth of his shirt in place of tears he felt the small warm liquid spurts flung from the wound by the shudders he knew that the tight pressure of his arms was the only answer which the boy was now able to hear and understandand he held the trembling body as if the strength of his arms could transfuse some part of his living power into the arteries beating ever fainter against him then the sobbing stopped and the boy raised his head his face seemed thinner and paler but the eyes were lustrous and he looked up at rearden straining for the strength to speak mr rearden i i liked you very much i know it the boys features had no power to form a smile but it was a smile that spoke in his glance as he looked at reardens faceas he looked at that which he had not known he had been seeking through the brief span of his life seeking as the image of that which he had not known to be his values then his head fell back and there was no convulsion in his face only his mouth relaxing to a shape of serenitybut there was a brief stab of convulsion in his body like a last cry of protestand rearden went on slowly not altering his pace even though he knew that no caution was necessary any longer because what he was carrying in his arms was now that which had been the boys teachers idea of mana collection of chemicals he walked as if this were his form of last tribute and funeral procession for the young life that had ended in his arms he felt an anger too intense to identify except as a pressure within him it was a desire to kill the desire was not directed at the unknown thug who had sent a bullet through the boys body or at the looting bureaucrats who had hired the thug to do it but at the boys teachers who had delivered him disarmed to the thugs gunat the soft safe assassins of college classrooms who incompetent to answer the queries of a quest for reason took pleasure in crippling the young minds entrusted to their care somewhere he thought there was this boys mother who had trembled with protective concern over his groping steps while teaching him to walk who had measured his baby formulas with a jewelers caution who had obeyed with a zealots fervor the latest words of science on his diet and hygiene protecting his unhardened body from germsthen had sent him to be turned into a tortured neurotic by the men who taught him that he had no mind and must never attempt to think had she fed him tainted refuse he thought had she mixed poison into his food it would have been more kind and less fatal he thought of all the living species that train their young in the art of survival the cats who teach their kittens to hunt the birds who spend such strident effort on teaching their fledglings to flyyet man whose tool of survival is the mind does not merely fail to teach a child to think but devotes the childs education to the purpose of destroying his brain of convincing him that thought is futile and evil before he has started to think from the first catchphrases flung at a child to the last it is like a series of shocks to freeze his motor to undercut the power of his consciousness dont ask so many questions children should be seen and not heardwho are you to think its so because i say sodont argue obeydont try to understand believedont rebel adjustdont stand out belongdont struggle compromiseyour heart is more important than your mindwho are you to know your parents know bestwho are you to know society knows bestwho are you to know the bureaucrats know bestwho are you to object all values are relativewho are you to want to escape a thugs bullet thats only a personal prejudice men would shudder he thought if they saw a mother bird plucking the feathers from the wings of her young then pushing him out of the nest to struggle for survivalyet that was what they did to their children armed with nothing but meaningless phrases this boy had been thrown to fight for existence he had hobbled and groped through a brief doomed effort he had screamed his indignant bewildered protest and had perished in his first attempt to soar on his mangled wings but a different breed of teachers had once existed he thought and had reared the men who created this country he thought that mothers should set out on their knees to look for men like hugh akston to find them and beg them to return he went through the gate of the mills barely noticing the guards who let him enter who stared at his face and his burden he did not pause to listen to their words as they pointed to the fighting in the distance he went on walking slowly toward the wedge of light which was the open door of the hospital building he stepped into a lighted room full of men bloody bandages and the odor of antiseptics he deposited his burden on a bench with no word of explanation to anyone and walked out not glancing behind him he walked in the direction of the front gate toward the glare of fire and the bursts of guns he saw once in a while a few figures running through the cracks between structures or darting behind black corners pursued by groups of guards and workers he was astonished to notice that his workers were well armed they seemed to have subdued the hoodlums inside the mills and only the siege at the front gate remained to be beaten he saw a lout scurrying across a patch of lamplight swinging a length of pipe at a wall of glass panes battering them down with an animal relish dancing like a gorilla to the sound of crashing glass until three husky human figures descended upon him carrying him writhing to the ground the siege of the gate appeared to be ebbing as if the spine of the mob had been broken he heard the distant screeches of their criesbut the shots from the road were growing rarer the fire set to the gatekeepers office was put out there were armed men on the ledges and at windows posted in wellplanned defense on the roof of a structure above the gate he saw as he came closer the slim silhouette of a man who held a gun in each hand and from behind the protection of a chimney kept firing at intervals down into the mob firing swiftly and it seemed in two directions at once like a sentinel protecting the approaches to the gate the confident skill of his movements his manner of firing with no time wasted to take aim but with the kind of casual abruptness that never misses a target made him look like a hero of western legendand rearden watched him with detached impersonal pleasure as if the battle of the mills were not his any longer but he could still enjoy the sight of the competence and certainty with which men of that distant age had once combatted evil the beam of a roving searchlight struck reardens face and when the light swept past he saw the man on the roof leaning down as if peering in his direction the man waved to someone to replace him then vanished abruptly from his post rearden hurried on through the short stretch of darkness ahead but then from the side from the crack of an alley he heard a drunken voice yell there he is and whirled to see two beefy figures advancing upon him he saw a leering mindless face with a mouth hung loose in a joyless chuckle and a club in a rising fisthe heard the sound of running steps approaching from another direction he attempted to turn his head then the club crashed down on his skull from behindand in the moment of splitting darkness when he wavered refusing to believe it then felt himself going down he felt a strong protective arm seizing him and breaking his fall he heard a gun exploding an inch above his ear then another explosion from the same gun in the same second but it seemed faint and distant as if he had fallen down a shaft his first awareness when he opened his eyes was a sense of profound serenity then he saw that he was lying on a couch in a modern sternly gracious roomthen he realized that it was his office and that the two men standing beside him were the mills doctor and the superintendent he felt a distant pain in his head which would have been violent had he cared to notice it and he felt a strip of tape across his hair on the side of his head the sense of serenity was the knowledge that he was free the meaning of his bandage and the meaning of his office were not to be accepted or to exist togetherit was not a combination for men to live withthis was not his battle any longer nor his job nor his business i think ill be all right doctor he said raising his head yes mr rearden fortunately the doctor was looking at him as if still unable to believe that this had happened to hank rearden inside his own mills the doctors voice was tense with angry loyalty and indignation nothing serious just a scalp wound and a slight concussion but you must take it easy and allow yourself to rest i will said rearden firmly its all over said the superintendent waving at the mills beyond the window weve got the bastards beaten and on the run you dont have to worry mr rearden its all over it is said rearden there must be a lot of work left for you to do doctor oh yes i never thought id live to see the day when i know go ahead take care of it ill be all right yes mr rearden ill take care of the place said the superintendent as the doctor hurried out everythings under control mr rearden but it was the dirtiest i know said rearden who was it that saved my life somebody grabbed me as i fell and fired at the thugs did he straight at their faces blew their heads off that was that new furnace foreman of ours been here two months best man ive ever had hes the one who got wise to what the gravy boys were planning and warned me this afternoon told me to arm our men as many as we could we got no help from the police or the state troopers they dodged all over the place with the fanciest delays and excuses i ever heard of it was all fixed in advance the goons werent expecting any armed resistance it was that furnace foremanfrank adams is his namewho organized our defense ran the whole battle and stood on a roof picking off the scum that came too close to the gate boy what a marksman i shudder to think how many of our lives he saved tonight those bastards were out for blood mr rearden id like to see him hes waiting somewhere outside its he who brought you here and he asked permission to speak to you when possible send him in then go back out there take charge finish the job is there anything else i can do for you mr rearden no nothing else he lay still alone in the silence of his office he knew that the meaning of his mills had ceased to exist and the fullness of the knowledge left no room for the pain of regretting an illusion he had seen in a final image the soul and essence of his enemies the mindless face of the thug with the club it was not the face itself that made him draw back in horror but the professors the philosophers the moralists the mystics who had released that face upon the world he felt a peculiar cleanliness it was made of pride and of love for this earth this earth which was his not theirs it was the feeling which had moved him through his life the feeling which some among men know in their youth then betray but which he had never betrayed and had carried within him as a battered attacked unidentified but living motorthe feeling which he could now experience in its full uncontested purity the sense of his own superlative value and the superlative value of his life it was the final certainty that his life was his to be lived with no bondage to evil and that that bondage had never been necessary it was the radiant serenity of knowing that he was free of fear of pain of guilt if its true he thought that there are avengers who are working for the deliverance of men like me let them see me now let them tell me their secret let them claim me let themcome in he said aloud in answer to the knock on his door the door opened and he lay still the man standing on the threshold with disheveled hair a sootstreaked face and furnacesmudged arms dressed in scorched overalls and bloodstained shirt standing as if he wore a cape waving behind him in the wind was francisco danconia it seemed to rearden that his consciousness shot forward ahead of his body it was his body that refused to move stunned by shock while his mind was laughing telling him that this was the most natural the mosttohavebeenexpected event in the world francisco smiled a smile of greeting to a childhood friend on a summer morning as if nothing else had ever been possible between themand rearden found himself smiling in answer some part of him feeling an incredulous wonder yet knowing that it was irresistibly right youve been torturing yourself for months said francisco approaching him wondering what words youd use to ask my forgiveness and whether you had the right to ask it if you ever saw me again but now you see that it isnt necessary that theres nothing to ask or to forgive yes said rearden the word coming as an astonished whisper but by the time he finished his sentence he knew that this was the greatest tribute he could offer yes i know it francisco sat down on the couch beside him and slowly moved his hand over reardens forehead it was like a healing touch that closed the past theres only one thing i want to tell you said rearden i want you to hear it from me you kept your oath you were my friend i knew that you knew it you knew it from the first you knew it no matter what you thought of my actions you slapped me because you could not force yourself to doubt it that whispered rearden staring at him that was the thing i had no right to tell you no right to claim as my excuse didnt you suppose id understand it i wanted to find you i had no right to look for you and all that time you were he pointed at franciscos clothes then his hand dropped helplessly and he closed his eyes i was your furnace foreman said francisco grinning i didnt think youd mind that you offered me the job yourself youve been here as my bodyguard for two months yes youve been here ever since he stopped thats right on the morning of the day when you were reading my farewell message over the roofs of new york i was reporting here for my first shift as your furnace foreman tell me said rearden slowly that night at james taggarts wedding when you said that you were after your greatest conquest you meant me didnt you of course francisco drew himself up a little as if for a solemn task his face earnest the smile remaining only in his eyes i have a great deal to tell you he said but first will you repeat a word you once offered me and i i had to reject because i knew that i was not free to accept it rearden smiled what word francisco francisco inclined his head in acceptance and answered thank you hank then he raised his head now ill tell you the things i had come to say but did not finish that night when i came here for the first time i think youre ready to hear it i am the glare of steel being poured from a furnace shot to the sky beyond the window a red glow went sweeping slowly over the walls of the office over the empty desk over reardens face as if in salute and farewell chapter vii this is john galt speaking the doorbell was ringing like an alarm in a long demanding scream broken by the impatient stabs of someones frantic finger leaping out of bed dagny noticed the cold pale sunlight of late morning and a clock on a distant spire marking the hour of ten she had worked at the office till four am and had left word not to expect her till noon the white face ungroomed by panic that confronted her when she threw the door open was james taggart hes gone he cried who hank rearden hes gone quit vanished disappeared she stood still for a moment holding the belt of the dressing gown she had been tying then as the full knowledge reached her her hands jerked the belt tightas if snapping her body in two at the waistlinewhile she burst out laughing it was a sound of triumph he stared at her in bewilderment whats the matter with you he gasped havent you understood come in jim she said turning contemptuously walking into the living room oh yes ive understood hes quit gone gone like all the others left his mills his bank accounts his property everything just vanished took some clothing and whatever he had in the safe in his apartmentthey found a safe left open in his bedroom open and emptythats all no word no note no explanation they called me from washington but its all over town the news i mean the story they cant keep it quiet theyve tried to but nobody knows how it got out but it went through the mills like one of those furnace breakouts the word that hed gone and then before anyone could stop it a whole bunch of them vanished the superintendent the chief metallurgist the chief engineer reardens secretary even the hospital doctor and god knows how many others deserting the bastards deserting us in spite of all the penalties weve set up hes quit and the rest are quitting and those mills are just left there standing still do you understand what that means do you she asked he had thrown his story at her sentence by sentence as if trying to knock the smile off her face an odd unmoving smile of bitterness and triumph he had failed its a national catastrophe whats the matter with you dont you see that its a fatal blow it will break the last of the countrys morale and economy we cant let him vanish youve got to bring him back her smile disappeared you can he cried youre the only one who can hes your lover isnt he oh dont look like that its no time for squeamishness its no time for anything except that weve got to have him you must know where he is you can find him you must reach him and bring him back the way she now looked at him was worse than her smileshe looked as if she were seeing him naked and would not endure the sight much longer i cant bring him back she said not raising her voice and i wouldnt if i could now get out of here but the national catastrophe get out she did not notice his exit she stood alone in the middle of her living room her head dropping her shoulders sagging while she was smiling a smile of pain of tenderness of greeting to hank rearden she wondered dimly why she should feel so glad that he had found liberation so certain that he was right and yet refuse herself the same deliverance two sentences were beating in her mind one was the triumphant sweep of hes free hes out of their reachthe other was like a prayer of dedication theres still a chance to win but let me be the only victim it was strangeshe thought in the days that followed looking at the men around herthat catastrophe had made them aware of hank rearden with an intensity that his achievements had not aroused as if the paths of their consciousness were open to disaster but not to value some spoke of him in shrill cursesothers whispered with a look of guilt and terror as if a nameless retribution were now to descend upon themsome tried with hysterical evasiveness to act as if nothing had happened the newspapers like puppets on tangled strings were shouting with the same belligerence and on the same dates it is social treason to ascribe too much importance to hank reardens desertion and to undermine public morale by the oldfashioned belief that an individual can be of any significance to society it is social treason to spread rumors about the disappearance of hank rearden mr rearden has not disappeared he is in his office running his mills as usual and there has been no trouble at rearden steel except a minor disturbance a private scuffle among some workers it is social treason to cast an unpatriotic light upon the tragic loss of hank rearden mr rearden has not deserted he was killed in an automobile accident on his way to work and his griefstricken family has insisted on a private funeral it was strange she thought to obtain news by means of nothing but denials as if existence had ceased facts had vanished and only the frantic negatives uttered by officials and columnists gave any clue to the reality they were denying it is not true that the miller steel foundry of new jersey has gone out of business it is not true that the jansen motor company of michigan has closed its doors it is a vicious antisocial lie that manufacturers of steel products are collapsing under the threat of a steel shortage there is no reason to expect a steel shortage it is a slanderous unfounded rumor that a steel unification plan had been in the making and that it had been favored by mr orren boyle mr boyles attorney has issued an emphatic denial and has assured the press that mr boyle is now vehemently opposed to any such plan mr boyle at the moment is suffering from a nervous breakdown but some news could be witnessed in the streets of new york in the cold dank twilight of autumn evenings a crowd gathered in front of a hardware store where the owner had thrown the doors open inviting people to help themselves to the last of his meager stock while he laughed in shrieking sobs and went smashing his plateglass windowsa crowd gathered at the door of a rundown apartment house where a police ambulance stood waiting while the bodies of a man his wife and their three children were being removed from a gasfilled room the man had been a small manufacturer of steel castings if they see hank reardens value nowshe thoughtwhy didnt they see it sooner why hadnt they averted their own doom and spared him his years of thankless torture she found no answer in the silence of sleepless nights she thought that hank rearden and she had now changed places he was in atlantis and she was locked out by a screen of lighthe was perhaps calling to her as she had called to his struggling airplane but no signal could reach her through that screen yet the screen split open for one brief breakfor the length of a letter she received a week after he vanished the envelope bore no return address only the postmark of some hamlet in colorado the letter contained two sentences i have met him i dont blame you hr she sat still for a long time looking at the letter as if unable to move or to feel she felt nothing she thought then noticed that her shoulders were trembling in a faint continuous shudder then grasped that the tearing violence within her was made of an exultant tribute of gratitude and of despairher tribute to the victory that the meeting of these two men implied the final victory of bothher gratitude that those in atlantis still regarded her as one of them and had granted her the exception of receiving a messagethe despair of the knowledge that her blankness was a struggle not to hear the questions she was now hearing had galt abandoned her had he gone to the valley to meet his greatest conquest would he come back had he given her up the unendurable was not that these questions had no answer but that the answer was so simply so easily within her reach and that she had no right to take a step to reach it she had made no attempt to see him every morning for a month on entering her office she had been conscious not of the room around her but of the tunnels below under the floors of the buildingand she had worked feeling as if some marginal part of her brain was computing figures reading reports making decisions in a rush of lifeless activity while her living mind was inactive and still frozen in contemplation forbidden to move beyond the sentence hes down there the only inquiry she had permitted herself had been a glance at the payroll list of the terminal workers she had seen the name galt john the list had carried it openly for over twelve years she had seen an address next to the nameand for a month had struggled to forget it it had seemed hard to live through that monthyet now as she looked at the letter the thought that galt had gone was still harder to bear even the struggle of resisting his proximity had been a link to him a price to pay a victory achieved in his name now there was nothing except a question that was not to be asked his presence in the tunnels had been her motor through those daysjust as his presence in the city had been her motor through the months of that summerjust as his presence somewhere in the world had been her motor through the years before she ever heard his name now she felt as if her motor too had stopped she went on with the bright pure glitter of a fivedollar gold piece which she kept in her pocket as her last drop of fuel she went on protected from the world around her by a last armor indifference the newspapers did not mention the outbreaks of violence that had begun to burst across the countrybut she watched them through the reports of train conductors about bulletriddled cars dismantled tracks attacked trains besieged stations in nebraska in oregon in texas in montanathe futile doomed outbreaks prompted by nothing but despair ending in nothing but destruction some were the explosions of local gangs some spread wider there were districts that rose in blind rebellion arrested the local officials expelled the agents of washington killed the tax collectorsthen announcing their secession from the country went on to the final extreme of the very evil that had destroyed them as if fighting murder with suicide went on to seize all property within their reach to declare community bondage of all to all and to perish within a week their meager loot consumed in the bloody hatred of all for all in the chaos of no rule save that of the gun to perish under the lethargic thrust of a few worn soldiers sent out from washington to bring order to the ruins the newspapers did not mention it the editorials went on speaking of selfdenial as the road to future progress of selfsacrifice as the moral imperative of greed as the enemy of love as the solutiontheir threadbare phrases as sickeningly sweet as the odor of ether in a hospital rumors went spreading through the country in whispers of cynical terroryet people read the newspapers and acted as if they believed what they read each competing with the others on who would keep most blindly silent each pretending that he did not know what he knew each striving to believe that the unnamed was the unreal it was as if a volcano were cracking open yet the people at the foot of the mountain ignored the sudden fissures the black fumes the boiling trickles and went on believing that their only danger was to acknowledge the reality of these signs listen to mr thompsons report on the world crisis november it was the first acknowledgment of the unacknowledged the announcements began to appear a week in advance and went ringing across the country mr thompson will give the people a report on the world crisis listen to mr thompson on every radio station and television channel at pm on november first the front pages of the newspapers and the shouts of the radio voices had explained it to counteract the fears and rumors spread by the enemies of the people mr thompson will address the country on november and will give us a full report on the state of the world in this solemn moment of global crisis mr thompson will put an end to those sinister forces whose purpose is to keep us in terror and despair he will bring light into the darkness of the world and will show us the way out of our tragic problemsa stern way as befits the gravity of this hour but a way of glory as granted by the rebirth of light mr thompsons address will be carried by every radio station in this country and in all countries throughout the world wherever radio waves may still be heard then the chorus broke loose and went growing day by day listen to mr thompson on november said daily headlines dont forget mr thompson on november cried radio stations at the end of every program mr thompson will tell you the truth said placards in subways and busesthen posters on the walls of buildings then billboards on deserted highways dont despair listen to mr thompson said pennants on government cars dont give up listen to mr thompson said banners in offices and shops have faith listen to mr thompson said voices in churches mr thompson will give you the answer wrote army airplanes across the sky the letters dissolving in space and only the last two words remaining by the time the sentence was completed public loudspeakers were built in the squares of new york for the day of the speech and came to rasping life once an hour in time with the ringing of distant clocks to send over the worn rattle of the traffic over the heads of the shabby crowds the sonorous mechanical cry of an alarmtoned voice listen to mr thompsons report on the world crisis november a cry rolling through the frosted air and vanishing among the foggy roof tops under the blank page of a calendar that bore no date on the afternoon of november james taggart told dagny that mr thompson wished to meet her for a conference before the broadcast in washington she asked incredulously glancing at her watch well i must say that you havent been reading the newspapers or keeping track of important events dont you know that mr thompson is to broadcast from new york he has come here to confer with the leaders of industry as well as of labor science the professions and the best of the countrys leadership in general he has requested that i bring you to the conference where is it to be held at the broadcasting studio they dont expect me to speak on the air in support of their policies do they dont worry they wouldnt let you near a microphone they just want to hear your opinion and you cant refuse not in a national emergency not when its an invitation from mr thompson in person he spoke impatiently avoiding her eyes when is that conference to be held at seventhirty not much time to give to a conference about a national emergency is it mr thompson is a very busy man now please dont argue dont start being difficult i dont see what youre all right she said indifferently ill come and added prompted by the kind of feeling that would have made her reluctant to venture without a witness into a conference of gangsters but ill bring eddie willers along with me he frowned considering it for a moment with a look of annoyance more than anxiety oh all right if you wish he snapped shrugging she came to the broadcasting studio with james taggart as a policeman at one side of her and eddie willers as a bodyguard at the other taggarts face was resentful and tense eddiesresigned yet wondering and curious a stage set of pasteboard walls had been erected in a corner of the vast dim space representing a stiffly traditional suggestion of a cross between a stately drawing room and a modest study a semicircle of empty armchairs filled the set suggesting a grouping from a family album with microphones dangling like bait at the end of long poles extended for fishing among the chairs the best leadership of the country that stood about in nervous clusters had the look of a remnant sale in a bankrupt store she saw wesley mouch eugene lawson chick morrison tinky holloway dr floyd ferris dr simon pritchett ma chalmers fred kinnan and a seedy handful of businessmen among whom the halfscared halfflattered figure of mr mowen of the amalgamated switch and signal company was incredibly intended to represent an industrial tycoon but the figure that gave her an instants shock was dr robert stadler she had not known that a face could age so greatly within the brief space of one year the look of timeless energy of boyish eagerness was gone and nothing remained of the face except the lines of contemptuous bitterness he stood alone apart from the others and she saw the moment when his eyes saw her enter he looked like a man in a whorehouse who had accepted the nature of his surroundings until suddenly caught there by his wife it was a look of guilt in the process of becoming hatred then she saw robert stadler the scientist turn away as if he had not seen heras if his refusal to see could wipe a fact out of existence mr thompson was pacing among the groups snapping at random bystanders in the restless manner of a man of action who feels contempt for the duty of making speeches he was clutching a sheaf of typewritten pages as if it were a bundle of old clothing about to be discarded james taggart caught him in midstep to say uncertainly and loudly mr thompson may i present my sister miss dagny taggart so nice of you to come miss taggart said mr thompson shaking her hand as if she were another voter from back home whose name he had never heard before then he marched briskly off wheres the conference jim she asked and glanced at the clock it was a huge white dial with a black hand slicing the minutes like a knife moving toward the hour of eight i cant help it i dont run this show he snapped eddie willers glanced at her with a look of bitterly patient astonishment and stepped closer to her side a radio receiver was playing a program of military marches broadcast from another studio halfdrowning the fragments of nervous voices of hastily aimless steps of screeching machinery being pulled to focus upon the drawingroom set stay tuned to hear mr thompsons report on the world crisis at eight pm cried the martial voice of an announcer from the radio receiverwhen the hand on the dial reached the hour of step on it boys step on it snapped mr thompson while the radio burst into another march it was when chick morrison the morale conditioner who seemed to be in charge cried ah right boys and girls all right lets take our places waving a bunch of notepaper like a baton toward the lightflooded circle of armchairs mr thompson thudded down upon the central chair in the manner of grabbing a vacant seat in a subway chick morrisons assistants were herding the crowd toward the circle of light a happy family chick morrison explained the country must see us as a big united happywhats the matter with that thing the radio music had gone off abruptly choking on an odd little gasp of static cut in the middle of a ringing phrase it was he shrugged and went on happy family hurry up boys take closeups of mr thompson first the hand of the clock went slicing off the minutes while press photographers clicked their cameras at mr thompsons sourly impatient face mr thompson will sit between science and industry chick morrison announced dr stadler pleasethe chair on mr thompsons left miss taggartthis way pleaseon mr thompsons right dr stadler obeyed she did not move its not just for the press its for the television audiences chick morrison explained to her in the tone of an inducement she made a step forward i will not take part in this program she said evenly addressing mr thompson you wont he asked blankly with the kind of look he would have worn if one of the flower vases had suddenly refused to perform its part dagny for christs sake cried james taggart in panic whats the matter with her asked mr thompson but miss taggart why cried chick morrison you all know why she said to the faces around her you should have known better than to try that again miss taggart yelled chick morrison as she turned to go its a national emer then a man came rushing toward mr thompson and she stopped as did everyone elseand the look on the mans face swept the crowd into an abruptly total silence he was the stations chief engineer and it was odd to see a look of primitive terror struggling against his remnant of civilized control mr thompson he said we we might have to delay the broadcast what cried mr thompson the hand of the dial stood at were trying to fix it mr thompson were trying to find out what it is but we might not be on time and what are you talking about what happened were trying to locate the what happened i dont know but we we cant get on the air mr thompson there was a moment of silence then mr thompson asked his voice unnaturally low are you crazy i must be i wish i were i cant make it out the station is dead mechanical trouble yelled mr thompson leaping to his feet mechanical trouble god damn you at a time like this if thats how you run this station the chief engineer shook his head slowly in the manner of an adult who is reluctant to frighten a child its not this station mr thompson he said softly its every station in the country as far as weve been able to check and there is no mechanical trouble neither here nor elsewhere the equipment is in order in perfect order and they all report the same but but all radio stations went off the air at sevenfiftyone and and nobody can discover why but cried mr thompson stopped glanced about him and screamed not tonight you cant let it happen tonight youve got to get me on the air mr thompson the man said slowly weve called the electronic laboratory of the state science institute they theyve never seen anything like it they said it might be a natural phenomenon some sort of cosmic disturbance of an unprecedented kind only well only they dont think it is we dont either they said it looks like radio waves but of a frequency never produced before never observed anywhere never discovered by anybody no one answered him in a moment he went on his voice oddly solemn it looks like a wall of radio waves jamming the air and we cant get through it we cant touch it we cant break it whats more we cant locate its source not by any of our usual methods those waves seem to come from a transmitter that that makes any known to us look like a childs toy but thats not possible the cry came from behind mr thompson and they all whirled in its direction startled by its note of peculiar terror it came from dr stadler theres no such thing theres nobody on earth to make it the chief engineer spread his hands out thats it dr stadler he said wearily it cant be possible it shouldnt be possible but there it is well do something about it cried mr thompson to the crowd at large no one answered or moved i wont permit this cried mr thompson i wont permit it tonight of all nights ive got to make that speech do something solve it whatever it is i order you to solve it the chief engineer was looking at him blankly ill fire the lot of you for this ill fire every electronic engineer in the country ill put the whole profession on trial for sabotage desertion and treason do you hear me now do something god damn you do something the chief engineer was looking at him impassively as if words were not conveying anything any longer isnt there anybody around to obey an order cried mr thompson isnt there a brain left in this country the hand of the clock reached the dot of ladies and gentlemen said a voice that came from the radio receivera mans clear calm implacable voice the kind of voice that had not been heard on the airwaves for yearsmr thompson will not speak to you tonight his time is up i have taken it over you were to hear a report on the world crisis that is what you are going to hear three gasps of recognition greeted the voice but nobody had the power to notice them among the sounds of the crowd which were beyond the stage of cries one was a gasp of triumph anotherof terror the thirdof bewilderment three persons had recognized the speaker dagny dr stadler eddie willers nobody glanced at eddie willers but dagny and dr stadler glanced at each other she saw that his face was distorted by as evil a terror as one could ever bear to see he saw that she knew and that the way she looked at him was as if the speaker had slapped his face for twelve years you have been asking who is john galt this is john galt speaking i am the man who loves his life i am the man who does not sacrifice his love or his values i am the man who has deprived you of victims and thus has destroyed your world and if you wish to know why you are perishingyou who dread knowledgei am the man who will now tell you the chief engineer was the only one able to move he ran to a television set and struggled frantically with its dials but the screen remained empty the speaker had not chosen to be seen only his voice filled the airways of the countryof the world thought the chief engineersounding as if he were speaking here in this room not to a group but to one man it was not the tone of addressing a meeting but the tone of addressing a mind you have heard it said that this is an age of moral crisis you have said it yourself half in fear half in hope that the words had no meaning you have cried that mans sins are destroying the world and you have cursed human nature for its unwillingness to practice the virtues you demanded since virtue to you consists of sacrifice you have demanded more sacrifices at every successive disaster in the name of a return to morality you have sacrificed all those evils which you held as the cause of your plight you have sacrificed justice to mercy you have sacrificed independence to unity you have sacrificed reason to faith you have sacrificed wealth to need you have sacrificed selfesteem to selfdenial you have sacrificed happiness to duty you have destroyed all that which you held to be evil and achieved all that which you held to be good why then do you shrink in horror from the sight of the world around you that world is not the product of your sins it is the product and the image of your virtues it is your moral ideal brought into reality in its full and final perfection you have fought for it you have dreamed of it you have wished it and i i am the man who has granted you your wish your ideal had an implacable enemy which your code of morality was designed to destroy i have withdrawn that enemy i have taken it out of your way and out of your reach i have removed the source of all those evils you were sacrificing one by one i have ended your battle i have stopped your motor i have deprived your world of mans mind men do not live by the mind you say i have withdrawn those who do the mind is impotent you say i have withdrawn those whose mind isnt there are values higher than the mind you say i have withdrawn those for whom there arent while you were dragging to your sacrificial altars the men of justice of independence of reason of wealth of selfesteemi beat you to it i reached them first i told them the nature of the game you were playing and the nature of that moral code of yours which they had been too innocently generous to grasp i showed them the way to live by another moralitymine it is mine that they chose to follow all the men who have vanished the men you hated yet dreaded to lose it is i who have taken them away from you do not attempt to find us we do not choose to be found do not cry that it is our duty to serve you we do not recognize such duty do not cry that you need us we do not consider need a claim do not cry that you own us you dont do not beg us to return we are on strike we the men of the mind we are on strike against selfimmolation we are on strike against the creed of unearned rewards and unrewarded duties we are on strike against the dogma that the pursuit of ones happiness is evil we are on strike against the doctrine that life is guilt there is a difference between our strike and all those youve practiced for centuries our strike consists not of making demands but of granting them we are evil according to your morality we have chosen not to harm you any longer we are useless according to your economics we have chosen not to exploit you any longer we are dangerous and to be shackled according to your politics we have chosen not to endanger you nor to wear the shackles any longer we are only an illusion according to your philosophy we have chosen not to blind you any longer and have left you free to face realitythe reality you wanted the world as you see it now a world without mind we have granted you everything you demanded of us we who had always been the givers but have only now understood it we have no demands to present to you no terms to bargain about no compromise to reach you have nothing to offer us we do not need you are you now crying no this was not what you wanted a mindless world of ruins was not your goal you did not want us to leave you you moral cannibals i know that youve always known what it was that you wanted but your game is up because now we know it too through centuries of scourges and disasters brought about by your code of morality you have cried that your code had been broken that the scourges were punishment for breaking it that men were too weak and too selfish to spill al the blood it required you damned man you damned existence you damned this earth but never dared to question your code your victims took the blame and struggled on with your curses as reward for their martyrdomwhile you went on crying that your code was noble but human nature was not good enough to practice it and no one rose to ask the question goodby what standard you wanted to know john galts identity i am the man who has asked that question yes this is an age of moral crisis yes you are bearing punishment for your evil but it is not man who is now on trial and it is not human nature that will take the blame it is your moral code thats through this time your moral code has reached its climax the blind alley at the end of its course and if you wish to go on living what you now need is not to return to moralityyou who have never known anybut to discover it you have heard no concepts of morality but the mystical or the social you have been taught that morality is a code of behavior imposed on you by whim the whim of a supernatural power or the whim of society to serve gods purpose or your neighbors welfare to please an authority beyond the grave or else next doorbut not to serve your life or pleasure your pleasure you have been taught is to be found in immorality your interests would best be served by evil and any moral code must be designed not for you but against you not to further your life but to drain it for centuries the battle of morality was fought between those who claimed that your life belongs to god and those who claimed that it belongs to your neighborsbetween those who preached that the good is selfsacrifice for the sake of ghosts in heaven and those who preached that the good is selfsacrifice for the sake of incompetents on earth and no one came to say that your life belongs to you and that the good is to live it both sides agreed that morality demands the surrender of your self interest and of your mind that the moral and the practical are opposites that morality is not the province of reason but the province of faith and force both sides agreed that no rational morality is possible that there is no right or wrong in reasonthat in reason theres no reason to be moral whatever else they fought about it was against mans mind that all your moralists have stood united it was mans mind that all their schemes and systems were intended to despoil and destroy now choose to perish or to learn that the antimind is the antilife mans mind is his basic tool of survival life is given to him survival is not his body is given to him its sustenance is not his mind is given to him its content is not to remain alive he must act and before he can act he must know the nature and purpose of his action he cannot obtain his food without a knowledge of food and of the way to obtain it he cannot dig a ditchor build a cyclotronwithout a knowledge of his aim and of the means to achieve it to remain alive he must think but to think is an act of choice the key to what you so recklessly call human nature the open secret you live with yet dread to name is the fact that man is a being of volitional consciousness reason does not work automatically thinking is not a mechanical process the connections of logic are not made by instinct the function of your stomach lungs or heart is automatic the function of your mind is not in any hour and issue of your life you are free to think or to evade that effort but you are not free to escape from your nature from the fact that reason is your means of survivalso that for you who are a human being the question to be or not to be is the question to think or not to think a being of volitional consciousness has no automatic course of behavior he needs a code of values to guide his actions value is that which one acts to gain and keep virtue is the action by which one gains and keeps it value presupposes an answer to the question of value to whom and for what value presupposes a standard a purpose and the necessity of action in the face of an alternative where there are no alternatives no values are possible there is only one fundamental alternative in the universe existence or nonexistenceand it pertains to a single class of entities to living organisms the existence of inanimate matter is unconditional the existence of life is not it depends on a specific course of action matter is indestructible it changes its forms but it cannot cease to exist it is only a living organism that faces a constant alternative the issue of life or death life is a process of selfsustaining and selfgenerated action if an organism fails in that action it dies its chemical elements remain but its life goes out of existence it is only the concept of life that makes the concept of value possible it is only to a living entity that things can be good or evil a plant must feed itself in order to live the sunlight the water the chemicals it needs are the values its nature has set it to pursue its life is the standard of value directing its actions but a plant has no choice of action there are alternatives in the conditions it encounters but there is no alternative in its function it acts automatically to further its life it cannot act for its own destruction an animal is equipped for sustaining its life its senses provide it with an automatic code of action an automatic knowledge of what is good for it or evil it has no power to extend its knowledge or to evade it in conditions where its knowledge proves inadequate it dies but so long as it lives it acts on its knowledge with automatic safety and no power of choice it is unable to ignore its own good unable to decide to choose the evil and act as its own destroyer man has no automatic code of survival his particular distinction from all other living species is the necessity to act in the face of alternatives by means of volitional choice he has no automatic knowledge of what is good for him or evil what values his life depends on what course of action it requires are you prattling about an instinct of self preservation an instinct of selfpreservation is precisely what man does not possess an instinct is an unerring and automatic form of knowledge a desire is not an instinct a desire to live does not give you the knowledge required for living and even mans desire to live is not automatic your secret evil today is that hat is the desire you do not hold your fear of death is not a love for life and will not give you the knowledge needed to keep it man must obtain his knowledge and choose his actions by a process of thinking which nature will not force him to perform man has the power to act as his own destroyerand that is the way he has acted through most of his history a living entity that regarded its means of survival as evil would not survive a plant that struggled to mangle its roots a bird that fought to break its wings would not remain for long in the existence they affronted but the history of man has been a struggle to deny and to destroy his mind man has been called a rational being but rationality is a matter of choiceand the alternative his nature offers him is rational being or suicidal animal man has to be manby choice he has to hold his life as a valueby choice he has to learn to sustain itby choice he has to discover the values it requires and practice his virtuesby choice a code of values accepted by choice is a code of morality whoever you are you who are hearing me now i am speaking to whatever living remnant is left uncorrupted within you to the remnant of the human to your mind and i say there is a morality of reason a morality proper to man and mans life is its standard of value ah that which is proper to the life of a rational being is the good all that which destroys it is the evil mans life as required by his nature is not the life of a mindless brute of a looting thug or a mooching mystic but the life of a thinking beingnot life by means of force or fraud but life by means of achievementnot survival at any price since theres only one price that pays for mans survival reason mans life is the standard of morality but your own life is its purpose if existence on earth is your goal you must choose your actions and values by the standard of that which is proper to manfor the purpose of preserving fulfilling and enjoying the irreplaceable value which is your life since life requires a specific course of action any other course will destroy it a being who does not hold his own life as the motive and goal of his actions is acting on the motive and standard of death such a being is a metaphysical monstrosity struggling to oppose negate and contradict the fact of his own existence running blindly amuck on a trail of destruction capable of nothing but pain happiness is the successful state of life pain is an agent of death happiness is that state of consciousness which proceeds from the achievement of ones values a morality that dares to tell you to find happiness in the renunciation of your happinessto value the failure of your valuesis an insolent negation of morality a doctrine that gives you as an ideal the role of a sacrificial animal seeking slaughter on the altars of others is giving you death as your standard by the grace of reality and the nature of life manevery manis an end in himself he exists for his own sake and the achievement of his own happiness is his highest moral purpose but neither life nor happiness can be achieved by the pursuit of irrational whims just as man is free to attempt to survive in any random manner but will perish unless he lives as his nature requires so he is free to seek his happiness in any mindless fraud but the torture of frustration is all he will find unless he seeks the happiness proper to man the purpose of morality is to teach you not to suffer and die but to enjoy yourself and live sweep aside those parasites of subsidized classrooms who live on the profits of the mind of others and proclaim that man needs no morality no values no code of behavior they who pose as scientists and claim that man is only an animal do not grant him inclusion in the law of existence they have granted to the lowest of insects they recognize that every living species has a way of survival demanded by its nature they do not claim that a fish can live out of water or that a dog can live without its sense of smellbut man they claim the most complex of beings man can survive in any way whatever man has no identity no nature and theres no practical reason why he cannot live with his means of survival destroyed with his mind throttled and placed at the disposal of any orders they might care to issue sweep aside those hatredeaten mystics who pose as friends of humanity and preach that the highest virtue man can practice is to hold his own life as of no value do they tell you that the purpose of morality is to curb mans instinct of selfpreservation it is for the purpose of selfpreservation that man needs a code of morality the only man who desires to be moral is the man who desires to live no you do not have to live it is your basic act of choice but if you choose to live you must live as a manby the work and the judgment of your mind no you do not have to live as a man it is an act of moral choice but you cannot live as anything elseand the alternative is that state of living death which you now see within you and around you the state of a thing unfit for existence no longer human and less than animal a thing that knows nothing but pain and drags itself through its span of years in the agony of unthinking selfdestruction no you do not have to think it is an act of moral choice but someone had to think to keep you alive if you choose to default you default on existence and you pass the deficit to some moral man expecting him to sacrifice his good for the sake of letting you survive by your evil no you do not have to be a man but today those who are are not there any longer i have removed your means of survivalyour victims if you wish to know how i have done it and what i told them to make them quit you are hearing it now i told them in essence the statement i am making tonight they were men who had lived by my code but had not known how great a virtue it represented i made them see it i brought them not a reevaluation but only an identification of their values we the men of the mind are now on strike against you in the name of a single axiom which is the root of our moral code just as the root of yours is the wish to escape it the axiom that existence exists existence existsand the act of grasping that statement implies two corollary axioms that something exists which one perceives and that one exists possessing consciousness consciousness being the faculty of perceiving that which exists if nothing exists there can be no consciousness a consciousness with nothing to be conscious of is a contradiction in terms a consciousness conscious of nothing but itself is a contradiction in terms before it could identify itself as consciousness it had to be conscious of something if that which you claim to perceive does not exist what you possess is not consciousness whatever the degree of your knowledge these twoexistence and consciousnessare axioms you cannot escape these two are the irreducible primaries implied in any action you undertake in any part of your knowledge and in its sum from the first ray of light you perceive at the start of your life to the widest erudition you might acquire at its end whether you know the shape of a pebble or the structure of a solar system the axioms remain the same that it exists and that you know it to exist is to be something as distinguished from the nothing of nonexistence it is to be an entity of a specific nature made of specific attributes centuries ago the man who wasno matter what his errors the greatest of your philosophers has stated the formula defining the concept of existence and the rule of all knowledge a is a a thing is itself you have never grasped the meaning of his statement i am here to complete it existence is identity consciousness is identification whatever you choose to consider be it an object an attribute or an action the law of identity remains the same a leaf cannot be a stone at the same time it cannot be all red and all green at the same time it cannot freeze and burn at the same time a is a or if you wish it stated in simpler language you cannot have your cake and eat it too are you seeking to know what is wrong with the world ah the disasters that have wrecked your world came from your leaders attempt to evade the fact that a is a all the secret evil you dread to face within you and all the pain you have ever endured came from your own attempt to evade the fact that a is a the purpose of those who taught you to evade it was to make you forget that man is man man cannot survive except by gaining knowledge and reason is his only means to gain it reason is the faculty that perceives identifies and integrates the material provided by his senses the task of his senses is to give him the evidence of existence but the task of identifying it belongs to his reason his senses tell him only that something is but what it is must be learned by his mind all thinking is a process of identification and integration man perceives a blob of color by integrating the evidence of his sight and his touch he learns to identity it as a solid object he learns to identify the object as a table he learns that the table is made of wood he learns that the wood consists of cells that the cells consist of molecules that the molecules consist of atoms all through this process the work of his mind consists of answers to a single question what is it his means to establish the truth of his answers is logic and logic rests on the axiom that existence exists logic is the art of noncontradictory identification a contradiction cannot exist an atom is itself and so is the universe neither can contradict its own identity nor can a part contradict the whole no concept man forms is valid unless he integrates it without contradiction into the total sum of his knowledge to arrive at a contradiction is to confess an error in ones thinking to maintain a contradiction is to abdicate ones mind and to evict oneself from the realm of reality reality is that which exists the unreal does not exist the unreal is merely that negation of existence which is the content of a human consciousness when it attempts to abandon reason truth is the recognition of reality reason mans only means of knowledge is his only standard of truth the most depraved sentence you can now utter is to ask whose reason the answer is yours no matter how vast your knowledge or how modest it is your own mind that has to acquire it it is only with your own knowledge that you can deal it is only your own knowledge that you can claim to possess or ask others to consider your mind is your only judge of truthand if others dissent from your verdict reality is the court of final appeal nothing but a mans mind can perform that complex delicate crucial process of identification which is thinking nothing can direct the process but his own judgment nothing can direct his judgment but his moral integrity you who speak of a moral instinct as if it were some separate endowment opposed to reasonmans reason is his moral faculty a process of reason is a process of constant choice in answer to the question true or falseright or wrong is a seed to be planted in soil in order to growright or wrong is a mans wound to be disinfected in order to save his liferight or wrong does the nature of atmospheric electricity permit it to be converted into kinetic powerright or wrong it is the answers to such questions that gave you everything you haveand the answers came from a mans mind a mind of intransigent devotion to that which is right a rational process is a moral process you may make an error at any step of it with nothing to protect you but your own severity or you may try to cheat to fake the evidence and evade the effort of the questbut if devotion to truth is the hallmark of morality then there is no greater nobler more heroic form of devotion than the act of a man who assumes the responsibility of thinking that which you call your soul or spirit is your consciousness and that which you call free will is your minds freedom to think or not the only will you have your only freedom the choice that controls all the choices you make and determines your life and your character thinking is mans only basic virtue from which all the others proceed and his basic vice the source of all his evils is that nameless act which all of you practice but struggle never to admit the act of blanking out the willful suspension of ones consciousness the refusal to thinknot blindness but the refusal to see not ignorance but the refusal to know it is the act of unfocusing your mind and inducing an inner fog to escape the responsibility of judgmenton the unstated premise that a thing will not exist if only you refuse to identify it that a will not be a so long as you do not pronounce the verdict it is nonthinking is an act of annihilation a wish to negate existence an attempt to wipe out reality but existence exists reality is not to be wiped out it will merely wipe out the wiper by refusing to say it is you are refusing to say i am by suspending your judgment you are negating your person when a man declares who am i to knowhe is declaring who am i to live this in every hour and every issue is your basic moral choice thinking or nonthinking existence or nonexistence a or nona entity or zero to the extent to which a man is rational life is the premise directing his actions to the extent to which he is irrational the premise directing his actions is death you who prattle that morality is social and that man would need no morality on a desert islandit is on a desert island that he would need it most let him try to claim when there are no victims to pay for it that a rock is a house that sand is clothing that food will drop into his mouth without cause or effort that he will collect a harvest tomorrow by devouring his stock seed todayand reality will wipe him out as he deserves reality will show him that life is a value to be bought and that thinking is the only coin noble enough to buy it if i were to speak your kind of language i would say that mans only moral commandment is thou shall think but a moral commandment is a contradiction in terms the moral is the chosen not the forced the understood not the obeyed the moral is the rational and reason accepts no commandments my morality the morality of reason is contained in a single axiom existence existsand in a single choice to live the rest proceeds from these to live man must hold three things as the supreme and ruling values of his life reasonpurposeselfesteem reason as his only tool of knowledgepurpose as his choice of the happiness which that tool must proceed to achieveselfesteem as his inviolate certainty that his mind is competent to think and his person is worthy of happiness which means is worthy of living these three values imply and require all of mans virtues and all his virtues pertain to the relation of existence and consciousness rationality independence integrity honesty justice productiveness pride rationality is the recognition of the fact that existence exists that nothing can alter the truth and nothing can take precedence over that act of perceiving it which is thinkingthat the mind is ones only judge of values and ones only guide of actionthat reason is an absolute that permits no compromisethat a concession to the irrational invalidates ones consciousness and turns it from the task of perceiving to the task of faking realitythat the alleged shortcut to knowledge which is faith is only a shortcircuit destroying the mindthat the acceptance of a mystical invention is a wish for the annihilation of existence and properly annihilates ones consciousness independence is the recognition of the fact that yours is the responsibility of judgment and nothing can help you escape itthat no substitute can do your thinking as no pinchhitter can live your lifethat the vilest form of selfabasement and selfdestruction is the subordination of your mind to the mind of another the acceptance of an authority over your brain the acceptance of his assertions as facts his sayso as truth his edicts as middleman between your consciousness and your existence integrity is the recognition of the fact that you cannot fake your consciousness just as honesty is the recognition of the fact that you cannot fake existencethat man is an indivisible entity an integrated unit of two attributes of matter and consciousness and that he may permit no breach between body and mind between action and thought between his life and his convictionsthat like a judge impervious to public opinion he may not sacrifice his convictions to the wishes of others be it the whole of mankind shouting pleas or threats against himthat courage and confidence are practical necessities that courage is the practical form of being true to existence of being true to truth and confidence is the practical form of being true to ones own consciousness honesty is the recognition of the fact that the unreal is unreal and can have no value that neither love nor fame nor cash is a value if obtained by fraudthat an attempt to gain a value by deceiving the mind of others is an act of raising your victims to a position higher than reality where you become a pawn of their blindness a slave of their nonthinking and their evasions while their intelligence their rationality their perceptiveness become the enemies you have to dread and fleethat you do not care to live as a dependent least of all a dependent on the stupidity of others or as a fool whose source of values is the fools he succeeds in foolingthat honesty is not a social duty not a sacrifice for the sake of others but the most profoundly selfish virtue man can practice his refusal to sacrifice the reality of his own existence to the deluded consciousness of others justice is the recognition of the fact that you cannot fake the character of men as you cannot fake the character of nature that you must judge all men as conscientiously as you judge inanimate objects with the same respect for truth with the same incorruptible vision by as pure and as rational a process of identificationthat every man must be judged for what he is and treated accordingly that just as you do not pay a higher price for a rusty chunk of scrap than for a piece of shining metal so you do not value a rotter above a herothat your moral appraisal is the coin paying men for their virtues or vices and this payment demands of you as scrupulous an honor as you bring to financial transactionsthat to withhold your contempt from mens vices is an act of moral counterfeiting and to withhold your admiration from their virtues is an act of moral embezzlementthat to place any other concern higher than justice is to devaluate your moral currency and defraud the good in favor of the evil since only the good can lose by a default of justice and only the evil can profitand that the bottom of the pit at the end of that road the act of moral bankruptcy is to punish men for their virtues and reward them for their vices that that is the collapse to full depravity the black mass of the worship of death the dedication of your consciousness to the destruction of existence productiveness is your acceptance of morality your recognition of the fact that you choose to livethat productive work is the process by which mans consciousness controls his existence a constant process of acquiring knowledge and shaping matter to fit ones purpose of translating an idea into physical form of remaking the earth in the image of ones valuesthat all work is creative work ft done by a thinking mind and no work is creative if done by a blank who repeats in uncritical stupor a routine he has learned from othersthat your work is yours to choose and the choice is as wide as your mind that nothing more is possible to you and nothing less is humanthat to cheat your way into a job bigger than your mind can handle is to become a fear corroded ape on borrowed motions and borrowed time and to settle down into a job that requires less than your minds full capacity is to cut your motor and sentence yourself to another kind of motion decaythat your work is the process of achieving your values and to lose your ambition for values is to lose your ambition to livethat your body is a machine but your mind is its driver and you must drive as far as your mind will take you with achievement as the goal of your roadthat the man who has no purpose is a machine that coasts downhill at the mercy of any boulder to crash in the first chance ditch that the man who stifles his mind is a stalled machine slowly going to rust that the man who lets a leader prescribe his course is a wreck being towed to the scrap heap and the man who makes another man his goal is a hitchhiker no driver should ever pick upthat your work is the purpose of your life and you must speed past any killer who assumes the right to stop you that any value you might find outside your work any other loyalty or love can be only travelers you choose to share your journey and must be travelers going on their own power in the same direction pride is the recognition of the fact that you are your own highest value and like all of mans values it has to be earnedthat of any achievements open to you the one that makes all others possible is the creation of your own characterthat your character your actions your desires your emotions are the products of the premises held by your mindthat as man must produce the physical values he needs to sustain his life so he must acquire the values of character that make his life worth sustainingthat as man is a being of selfmade wealth so he is a being of selfmade soulthat to live requires a sense of selfvalue but man who has no automatic values has no automatic sense of selfesteem and must earn it by shaping his soul in the image of his moral ideal in the image of man the rational being he is born able to create but must create by choicethat the first precondition of selfesteem is that radiant selfishness of soul which desires the best in all things in values of matter and spirit a soul that seeks above all else to achieve its own moral perfection valuing nothing higher than itselfand that the proof of an achieved selfesteem is your souls shudder of contempt and rebellion against the role of a sacrificial animal against the vile impertinence of any creed that proposes to immolate the irreplaceable value which is your consciousness and the incomparable glory which is your existence to the blind evasions and the stagnant decay of others are you beginning to see who is john galt i am the man who has earned the thing you did not fight for the thing you have renounced betrayed corrupted yet were unable fully to destroy and are now hiding as your guilty secret spending your me in apologies to every professional cannibal lest it be discovered that somewhere within you you still long to say what i am now saying to the hearing of the whole of mankind i am proud of my own value and of the fact that i wish to live this wishwhich you share yet submerge as an evilis the only remnant of the good within you but it is a wish one must learn to deserve his own happiness is mans only moral purpose but only his own virtue can achieve it virtue is not an end in itself virtue is not its own reward or sacrificial fodder for the reward of evil life is the reward of virtueand happiness is the goal and the reward of life just as your body has two fundamental sensations pleasure and pain as signs of its welfare or injury as a barometer of its basic alternative life or death so your consciousness has two fundamental emotions joy and suffering in answer to the same alternative your emotions are estimates of that which furthers your life or threatens it lightning calculators giving you a sum of your profit or loss you have no choice about your capacity to feel that something is good for you or evil but what you will consider good or evil what will give you joy or pain what you will love or hate desire or fear depends on your standard of value emotions are inherent in your nature but their content is dictated by your mind your emotional capacity is an empty motor and your values are the fuel with which your mind fills it if you choose a mix of contradictions it will clog your motor corrode your transmission and wreck you on your first attempt to move with a machine which you the driver have corrupted if you hold the irrational as your standard of value and the impossible as your concept of the good if you long for rewards you have not earned for a fortune or a love you dont deserve for a loophole in the law of causality for an a that becomes nona at your whim if you desire the opposite of existenceyou will reach it do not cry when you reach it that life is frustration and that happiness is impossible to man check your fuel it brought you where you wanted to go happiness is not to be achieved at the command of emotional whims happiness is not the satisfaction of whatever irrational wishes you might blindly attempt to indulge happiness is a state of non contradictory joya joy without penalty or guilt a joy that does not clash with any of your values and does not work for your own destruction not the joy of escaping from your mind but of using your minds fullest power not the joy of faking reality but of achieving values that are real not the joy of a drunkard but of a producer happiness is possible only to a rational man the man who desires nothing but rational goals seeks nothing but rational values and finds his joy in nothing but rational actions just as i support my life neither by robbery nor alms but by my own effort so i do not seek to derive my happiness from the injury or the favor of others but earn it by my own achievement just as i do not consider the pleasure of others as the goal of my life so i do not consider my pleasure as the goal of the lives of others just as there are no contradictions in my values and no conflicts among my desiresso there are no victims and no conflicts of interest among rational men men who do not desire the unearned and do not view one another with a cannibals lust men who neither make sacrifices nor accept them the symbol of all relationships among such men the moral symbol of respect for human beings is the trader we who live by values not by loot are traders both in matter and in spirit a trader is a man who earns what he gets and does not give or take the undeserved a trader does not ask to be paid for his failures nor does he ask to be loved for his flaws a trader does not squander his body as fodder or his soul as alms just as he does not give his work except in trade for material values so he does not give the values of his spirithis love his friendship his esteemexcept in payment and in trade for human virtues in payment for his own selfish pleasure which he receives from men he can respect the mystic parasites who have throughout the ages reviled the traders and held them in contempt while honoring the beggars and the looters have known the secret motive of their sneers a trader is the entity they dreada man of justice do you ask what moral obligation i owe to my fellow men noneexcept the obligation i owe to myself to material objects and to all of existence rationality i deal with men as my nature and theirs demands by means of reason i seek or desire nothing from them except such relations as they care to enter of their own voluntary choice it is only with their mind that i can deal and only for my own self interest when they see that my interest coincides with theirs when they dont i enter no relationship i let dissenters go their way and i do not swerve from mine i win by means of nothing but logic and i surrender to nothing but logic i do not surrender my reason or deal with men who surrender theirs i have nothing to gain from fools or cowards i have no benefits to seek from human vices from stupidity dishonesty or fear the only value men can offer me is the work of their mind when i disagree with a rational man i let reality be our final arbiter if i am right he will learn if i am wrong i will one of us will win but both will profit whatever may be open to disagreement there is one act of evil that may not the act that no man may commit against others and no man may sanction or forgive so long as men desire to live together no man may initiatedo you hear me no man may startthe use of physical force against others to interpose the threat of physical destruction between a man and his perception of reality is to negate and paralyze his means of survival to force him to act against his own judgment is like forcing him to act against his own sight whoever to whatever purpose or extent initiates the use of force is a killer acting on the premise of death in a manner wider than murder the premise of destroying mans capacity to live do not open your mouth to tell me that your mind has convinced you of your right to force my mind force and mind are opposites morality ends where a gun begins when you declare that men are irrational animals and propose to treat them as such you define thereby your own character and can no longer claim the sanction of reasonas no advocate of contradictions can claim it there can be no right to destroy the source of rights the only means of judging right and wrong the mind to force a man to drop his own mind and to accept your will as a substitute with a gun in place of a syllogism with terror in place of proof and death as the final argumentis to attempt to exist in defiance of reality reality demands of man that he act for his own rational interest your gun demands of him that he act against it reality threatens man with death if he does not act on his rational judgment you threaten him with death if he does you place him into a world where the price of his life is the surrender of all the virtues required by lifeand death by a process of gradual destruction is all that you and your system will achieve when death is made to be the ruling power the winning argument in a society of men be it a highwayman who confronts a traveler with the ultimatum your money or your life or a politician who confronts a country with the ultimatum your childrens education or your life the meaning of that ultimatum is your mind or your lifeand neither is possible to man without the other if there are degrees of evil it is hard to say who is the more contemptible the brute who assumes the right to force the mind of others or the moral degenerate who grants to others the right to force his mind that is the moral absolute one does not leave open to debate i do not grant the terms of reason to men who propose to deprive me of reason i do not enter discussions with neighbors who think they can forbid me to think i do not place my moral sanction upon a murderers wish to kill me when a man attempts to deal with me by force i answer himby force it is only as retaliation that force may be used and only against the man who starts its use no i do not share his evil or sink to his concept of morality i merely grant him his choice destruction the only destruction he had the right to choose his own he uses force to seize a value i use it only to destroy destruction a holdup man seeks to gain wealth by killing me i do not grow richer by killing a holdup man i seek no values by means of evil nor do i surrender my values to evil in the name of all the producers who had kept you alive and received your death ultimatums in payment i now answer you with a single ultimatum of our own our work or your guns you can choose either you cant have both we do not initiate the use of force against others or submit to force at their hands if you desire ever again to live in an industrial society it will be on our moral terms our terms and our motive power are the antithesis of yours you have been using fear as your weapon and have been bringing death to man as his punishment for rejecting your morality we offer him life as his reward for accepting ours you who are worshippers of the zeroyou have never discovered that achieving life is not the equivalent of avoiding death joy is not the absence of pain intelligence is not the absence of stupidity light is not the absence of darkness an entity is not the absence of a nonentity building is not done by abstaining from demolition centuries of sitting and waiting in such abstinence will not raise one single girder for you to abstain from demolishingand now you can no longer say to me the builder produce and feed us in exchange for our not destroying your production i am answering in the name of all your victims perish with and in your own void existence is not a negation of negatives evil not value is an absence and a negation evil is impotent and has no power but that which we let it extort from us perish because we have learned that a zero cannot hold a mortgage over life you seek escape from pain we seek the achievement of happiness you exist for the sake of avoiding punishment we exist for the sake of earning rewards threats will not make us function fear is not our incentive it is not death that we wish to avoid but life that we wish to live you who have lost the concept of the difference you who claim that fear and joy are incentives of equal powerand secretly add that fear is the more practicalyou do not wish to live and only fear of death still holds you to the existence you have damned you dart in panic through the trap of your days looking for the exit you have closed running from a pursuer you dare not name to a terror you dare not acknowledge and the greater your terror the greater your dread of the only act that could save you thinking the purpose of your struggle is not to know not to grasp or name or hear the thing i shall now state to your hearing that yours is the morality of death death is the standard of your values death is your chosen goal and you have to keep running since there is no escape from the pursuer who is out to destroy you or from the knowledge that that pursuer is yourself stop running for oncethere is no place to runstand naked as you dread to stand but as i see you and take a look at what you dared to call a moral code damnation is the start of your morality destruction is its purpose means and end your code begins by damning man as evil then demands that he practice a good which it defines as impossible for him to practice it demands as his first proof of virtue that he accept his own depravity without proof it demands that he start not with a standard of value but with a standard of evil which is himself by means of which he is then to define the good the good is that which he is not it does not matter who then becomes the profiteer on his renounced glory and tormented soul a mystic god with some incomprehensible design or any passerby whose rotting sores are held as some inexplicable claim upon himit does not matter the good is not for him to understand his duty is to crawl through years of penance atoning for the guilt of his existence to any stray collector of unintelligible debts his only concept of a value is a zero the good is that which is nonman the name of this monstrous absurdity is original sin a sin without volition is a slap at morality and an insolent contradiction in terms that which is outside the possibility of choice is outside the province of morality if man is evil by birth he has no will no power to change it if he has no will he can be neither good nor evil a robot is amoral to hold as mans sin a fact not open to his choice is a mockery of morality to hold mans nature as his sin is a mockery of nature to punish him for a crime he committed before he was born is a mockery of justice to hold him guilty in a matter where no innocence exists is a mockery of reason to destroy morality nature justice and reason by means of a single concept is a feat of evil hardly to be matched yet that is the root of your code do not hide behind the cowardly evasion that man is born with free will but with a tendency to evil a free will saddled with a tendency is like a game with loaded dice it forces man to struggle through the effort of playing to bear responsibility and pay for the game but the decision is weighted in favor of a tendency that he had no power to escape if the tendency is of his choice he cannot possess it at birth if it is not of his choice his will is not free what is the nature of the guilt that your teachers call his original sin what are the evils man acquired when he fell from a state they consider perfection their myth declares that he ate the fruit of the tree of knowledgehe acquired a mind and became a rational being it was the knowledge of good and evilhe became a moral being he was sentenced to earn his bread by his laborhe became a productive being he was sentenced to experience desirehe acquired the capacity of sexual enjoyment the evils for which they damn him are reason morality creativeness joyall the cardinal values of his existence it is not his vices that their myth of mans fall is designed to explain and condemn it is not his errors that they hold as his guilt but the essence of his nature as man whatever he wasthat robot in the garden of eden who existed without mind without values without labor without lovehe was not man mans fall according to your teachers was that he gained the virtues required to live these virtues by their standard are his sin his evil they charge is that hes man his guilt they charge is that he lives they call it a morality of mercy and a doctrine of love for man no they say they do not preach that man is evil the evil is only that alien object his body no they say they do not wish to kill him they only wish to make him lose his body they seek to help him they say against his painand they point at the torture rack to which theyve tied him the rack with two wheels that pull him in opposite directions the rack of the doctrine that splits his soul and body they have cut man in two setting one half against the other they have taught him that his body and his consciousness are two enemies engaged in deadly conflict two antagonists of opposite natures contradictory claims incompatible needs that to benefit one is to injure the other that his soul belongs to a supernatural realm but his body is an evil prison holding it in bondage to this earthand that the good is to defeat his body to undermine it by years of patient struggle digging his way to that glorious jailbreak which leads into the freedom of the grave they have taught man that he is a hopeless misfit made of two elements both symbols of death a body without a soul is a corpse a soul without a body is a ghostyet such is their image of mans nature the battleground of a struggle between a corpse and a ghost a corpse endowed with some evil volition of its own and a ghost endowed with the knowledge that everything known to man is nonexistent that only the unknowable exists do you observe what human faculty that doctrine was designed to ignore it was mans mind that had to be negated in order to make him fall apart once he surrendered reason he was left at the mercy of two monsters whom he could not fathom or control of a body moved by unaccountable instincts and of a soul moved by mystic revelationshe was left as the passively ravaged victim of a battle between a robot and a dictaphone and as he now crawls through the wreckage groping blindly for a way to live your teachers offer him the help of a morality that proclaims that hell find no solution and must seek no fulfillment on earth real existence they tell him is that which he cannot perceive true consciousness is the faculty of perceiving the nonexistentand if he is unable to understand it that is the proof that his existence is evil and his consciousness impotent as products of the split between mans soul and body there are two kinds of teachers of the morality of death the mystics of spirit and the mystics of muscle whom you call the spiritualists and the materialists those who believe in consciousness without existence and those who believe in existence without consciousness both demand the surrender of your mind one to their revelations the other to their reflexes no matter how loudly they posture in the roles of irreconcilable antagonists their moral codes are alike and so are their aims in matterthe enslavement of mans body in spiritthe destruction of his mind the good say the mystics of spirit is god a being whose only definition is that he is beyond mans power to conceivea definition that invalidates mans consciousness and nullifies his concepts of existence the good say the mystics of muscle is societya thing which they define as an organism that possesses no physical form a superbeing embodied in no one in particular and everyone in general except yourself mans mind say the mystics of spirit must be subordinated to the will of god mans mind say the mystics of muscle must be subordinated to the will of society mans standard of value say the mystics of spirit is the pleasure of god whose standards are beyond mans power of comprehension and must be accepted on faith mans standard of value say the mystics of muscle is the pleasure of society whose standards are beyond mans right of judgment and must be obeyed as a primary absolute the purpose of mans life say both is to become an abject zombie who serves a purpose he does not know for reasons he is not to question his reward say the mystics of spirit will be given to him beyond the grave his reward say the mystics of muscle will be given on earthto his greatgrandchildren selfishnesssay bothis mans evil mans goodsay bothis to give up his personal desires to deny himself renounce himself surrender mans good is to negate the life he lives sacrificecry bothis the essence of morality the highest virtue within mans reach whoever is now within reach of my voice whoever is man the victim not man the killer i am speaking at the deathbed of your mind at the brink of that darkness in which youre drowning and if there still remains within you the power to struggle to hold on to those fading sparks which had been yourselfuse it now the word that has destroyed you is sacrifice use the last of your strength to understand its meaning youre still alive you have a chance sacrifice does not mean the rejection of the worthless but of the precious sacrifice does not mean the rejection of the evil for the sake of the good but of the good for the sake of the evil sacrifice is the surrender of that which you value in favor of that which you dont if you exchange a penny for a dollar it is not a sacrifice if you exchange a dollar for a penny it is if you achieve the career you wanted after years of struggle it is not a sacrifice if you then renounce it for the sake of a rival it is if you own a bottle of milk and give it to your starving child it is not a sacrifice if you give it to your neighbors child and let your own die it is if you give money to help a friend it is not a sacrifice if you give it to a worthless stranger it is if you give your friend a sum you can afford it is not a sacrifice if you give him money at the cost of your own discomfort it is only a partial virtue according to this sort of moral standard if you give him money at the cost of disaster to yourselfthat is the virtue of sacrifice in full if you renounce all personal desires and dedicate your life to those you love you do not achieve full virtue you still retain a value of your own which is your love if you devote your life to random strangers it is an act of greater virtue if you devote your life to serving men you hatethat is the greatest of the virtues you can practice a sacrifice is the surrender of a value full sacrifice is full surrender of all values if you wish to achieve full virtue you must seek no gratitude in return for your sacrifice no praise no love no admiration no selfesteem not even the pride of being virtuous the faintest trace of any gain dilutes your virtue if you pursue a course of action that does not taint your life by any joy that brings you no value in matter no value in spirit no gain no profit no rewardif you achieve this state of total zero you have achieved the ideal of moral perfection you are told that moral perfection is impossible to manand by this standard it is you cannot achieve it so long as you live but the value of your life and of your person is gauged by how closely you succeed in approaching that ideal zero which is death if you start however as a passionless blank as a vegetable seeking to be eaten with no values to reject and no wishes to renounce you will not win the crown of sacrifice it is not a sacrifice to renounce the unwanted it is not a sacrifice to give your life for others if death is your personal desire to achieve the virtue of sacrifice you must want to live you must love it you must burn with passion for this earth and for all the splendor it can give youyou must feel the twist of every knife as it slashes your desires away from your reach and drains your love out of your body it is not mere death that the morality of sacrifice holds out to you as an ideal but death by slow torture do not remind me that it pertains only to this life on earth i am concerned with no other neither are you if you wish to save the last of your dignity do not call your best actions a sacrifice that term brands you as immoral if a mother buys food for her hungry child rather than a hat for herself it is not a sacrifice she values the child higher than the hat but it is a sacrifice to the kind of mother whose higher value is the hat who would prefer her child to starve and feeds him only from a sense of duty if a man dies fighting for his own freedom it is not a sacrifice he is not willing to live as a slave but it is a sacrifice to the kind of man whos willing if a man refuses to sell his convictions it is not a sacrifice unless he is the sort of man who has no convictions sacrifice could be proper only for those who have nothing to sacrificeno values no standards no judgmentthose whose desires are irrational whims blindly conceived and lightly surrendered for a man of moral stature whose desires are born of rational values sacrifice is the surrender of the right to the wrong of the good to the evil the creed of sacrifice is a morality for the immorala morality that declares its own bankruptcy by confessing that it cant impart to men any personal stake in virtues or values and that their souls are sewers of depravity which they must be taught to sacrifice by its own confession it is impotent to teach men to be good and can only subject them to constant punishment are you thinking in some foggy stupor that its only material values that your morality requires you to sacrifice and what do you think are material values matter has no value except as a means for the satisfaction of human desires matter is only a tool of human values to what service are you asked to give the material tools your virtue has produced to the service of that which you regard as evil to a principle you do not share to a person you do not respect to the achievement of a purpose opposed to your ownelse your gift is not a sacrifice your morality tells you to renounce the material world and to divorce your values from matter a man whose values are given no expression in material form whose existence is unrelated to his ideals whose actions contradict his convictions is a cheap little hypocriteyet that is the man who obeys your morality and divorces his values from matter the man who loves one woman but sleeps with anotherthe man who admires the talent of a worker but hires anotherthe man who considers one cause to be just but donates his money to the support of anotherthe man who holds high standards of craftsmanship but devotes his effort to the production of trashthese are the men who have renounced matter the men who believe that the values of their spirit cannot be brought into material reality do you say it is the spirit that such men have renounced yes of course you cannot have one without the other you are an indivisible entity of matter and consciousness renounce your consciousness and you become a brute renounce your body and you become a fake renounce the material world and you surrender it to evil and that is precisely the goal of your morality the duty that your code demands of you give to that which you do not enjoy serve that which you do not admire submit to that which you consider evilsurrender the world to the values of others deny reject renounce your self your self is your mind renounce it and you become a chunk of meat ready for any cannibal to swallow it is your mind that they want you to surrenderall those who preach the creed of sacrifice whatever their tags or their motives whether they demand it for the sake of your soul or of your body whether they promise you another life in heaven or a full stomach on this earth those who start by saying it is selfish to pursue your own wishes you must sacrifice them to the wishes of othersend up by saying it is selfish to uphold your convictions you must sacrifice them to the convictions of others this much is true the most selfish of all things is the independent mind that recognizes no authority higher than its own and no value higher than its judgment of truth you are asked to sacrifice your intellectual integrity your logic your reason your standard of truthin favor of becoming a prostitute whose standard is the greatest good for the greatest number if you search your code for guidance for an answer to the question what is the goodthe only answer you will find is the good of others the good is whatever others wish whatever you feel they feel they wish or whatever you feel they ought to feel the good of others is a magic formula that transforms anything into gold a formula to be recited as a guarantee of moral glory and as a fumigator for any action even the slaughter of a continent your standard of virtue is not an object not an act not a principle but an intention you need no proof no reasons no success you need not achieve in fact the good of others all you need to know is that your motive was the good of others not your own your only definition of the good is a negation the good is the nongood for me your codewhich boasts that it upholds eternal absolute objective moral values and scorns the conditional the relative and the subjective your code hands out as its version of the absolute the following rule of moral conduct if you wish it its evil if others wish it its good if the motive of your action is your welfare dont do it if the motive is the welfare of others then anything goes as this doublejointed doublestandard morality splits you in half so it splits mankind into two enemy camps one is you the other is all the rest of humanity you are the only outcast who has no right to wish or live you are the only servant the rest are the masters you are the only giver the rest are the takers you are the eternal debtor the rest are the creditors never to be paid off you must not question their right to your sacrifice or the nature of their wishes and their needs their right is conferred upon them by a negative by the fact that they are nonyou for those of you who might ask questions your code provides a consolation prize and boobytrap it is for your own happiness it says that you must serve the happiness of others the only way to achieve your joy is to give it up to others the only way to achieve your prosperity is to surrender your wealth to others the only way to protect your life is to protect all men except yourselfand if you find no joy in this procedure it is your own fault and the proof of your evil if you were good you would find your happiness in providing a banquet for others and your dignity in existing on such crumbs as they might care to toss you you who have no standard of selfesteem accept the guilt and dare not ask the questions but you know the unadmitted answer refusing to acknowledge what you see what hidden premise moves your world you know it not in honest statement but as a dark uneasiness within you while you flounder between guiltily cheating and grudgingly practicing a principle too vicious to name i who do not accept the unearned neither in values nor in guilt am here to ask the questions you evaded why is it moral to serve the happiness of others but not your own if enjoyment is a value why is it moral when experienced by others but immoral when experienced by you if the sensation of eating a cake is a value why is it an immoral indulgence in your stomach but a moral goal for you to achieve in the stomach of others why is it immoral for you to desire but moral for others to do so why is it immoral to produce a value and keep it but moral to give it away and if it is not moral for you to keep a value why is it moral for others to accept it if you are selfless and virtuous when you give it are they not selfish and vicious when they take it does virtue consist of serving vice is the moral purpose of those who are good selfimmolation for the sake of those who are evil the answer you evade the monstrous answer is no the takers are not evil provided they did not earn the value you gave them it is not immoral for them to accept it provided they are unable to produce it unable to deserve it unable to give you any value in return it is not immoral for them to enjoy it provided they do not obtain it by right such is the secret core of your creed the other half of your double standard it is immoral to live by your own effort but moral to live by the effort of othersit is immoral to consume your own product but moral to consume the products of othersit is immoral to earn but moral to moochit is the parasites who are the moral justification for the existence of the producers but the existence of the parasites is an end in itselfit is evil to profit by achievement but good to profit by sacrificeit is evil to create your own happiness but good to enjoy it at the price of the blood of others your code divides mankind into two castes and commands them to live by opposite rules those who may desire anything and those who may desire nothing the chosen and the damned the riders and the carriers the eaters and the eaten what standard determines your caste what passkey admits you to the moral elite the passkey is lack of value whatever the value involved it is your lack of it that gives you a claim upon those who dont lack it it is your need that gives you a claim to rewards if you are able to satisfy your need your ability annuls your right to satisfy it but a need you are unable to satisfy gives you first right to the lives of mankind if you succeed any man who fails is your master if you fail any man who succeeds is your serf whether your failure is just or not whether your wishes are rational or not whether your misfortune is undeserved or the result of your vices it is misfortune that gives you a right to rewards it is pain regardless of its nature or cause pain as a primary absolute that gives you a mortgage on all of existence if you heal your pain by your own effort you receive no moral credit your code regards it scornfully as an act of selfinterest whatever value you seek to acquire be it wealth or food or love or rights if you acquire it by means of your virtue your code does not regard it as a moral acquisition you occasion no loss to anyone it is a trade not alms a payment not a sacrifice the deserved belongs in the selfish commercial realm of mutual profit it is only the undeserved that calls for that moral transaction which consists of profit to one at the price of disaster to the other to demand rewards for your virtue is selfish and immoral it is your lack of virtue that transforms your demand into a moral right a morality that holds need as a claim holds emptinessnonexistenceas its standard of value it rewards an absence a defect weakness inability incompetence suffering disease disaster the lack the fault the flawthe zero who provides the account to pay these claims those who are cursed for being nonzeros each to the extent of his distance from that ideal since all values are the product of virtues the degree of your virtue is used as the measure of your penalty the degree of your faults is used as the measure of your gain your code declares that the rational man must sacrifice himself to the irrational the independent man to parasites the honest man to the dishonest the man of justice to the unjust the productive man to thieving loafers the man of integrity to compromising knaves the man of selfesteem to sniveling neurotics do you wonder at the meanness of soul in those you see around you the man who achieves these virtues will not accept your moral code the man who accepts your moral code will not achieve these virtues under a morality of sacrifice the first value you sacrifice is morality the next is selfesteem when need is the standard every man is both victim and parasite as a victim he must labor to fill the needs of others leaving himself in the position of a parasite whose needs must be filled by others he cannot approach his fellow men except in one of two disgraceful roles he is both a beggar and a sucker you fear the man who has a dollar less than you that dollar is rightfully his he makes you feel like a moral defrauder you hate the man who has a dollar more than you that dollar is rightfully yours he makes you feel that you are morally defrauded the man below is a source of your guilt the man above is a source of your frustration you do not know what to surrender or demand when to give and when to grab what pleasure in life is rightfully yours and what debt is still unpaid to othersyou struggle to evade as theory the knowledge that by the moral standard youve accepted you are guilty every moment of your life there is no mouthful of food you swallow that is not needed by someone somewhere on earthand you give up the problem in blind resentment you conclude that moral perfection is not to be achieved or desired that you will muddle through by snatching as snatch can and by avoiding the eyes of the young of those who look at you as if selfesteem were possible and they expected you to have it guilt is all that you retain within your souland so does every other man as he goes past avoiding your eyes do you wonder why your morality has not achieved brotherhood on earth or the good will of man to man the justification of sacrifice that your morality propounds is more corrupt than the corruption it purports to justify the motive of your sacrifice it tells you should be lovethe love you ought to feel for every man a morality that professes the belief that the values of the spirit are more precious than matter a morality that teaches you to scorn a whore who gives her body indiscriminately to all menthis same morality demands that you surrender your soul to promiscuous love for all comers as there can be no causeless wealth so there can be no causeless love or any sort of causeless emotion an emotion is a response to a fact of reality an estimate dictated by your standards to love is to value the man who tells you that it is possible to value without values to love those whom you appraise as worthless is the man who tells you that it is possible to grow rich by consuming without producing and that paper money is as valuable as gold observe that he does not expect you to feel a causeless fear when his kind get into power they are expert at contriving means of terror at giving you ample cause to feel the fear by which they desire to rule you but when it comes to love the highest of emotions you permit them to shriek at you accusingly that you are a moral delinquent if youre incapable of feeling causeless love when a man feels fear without reason you call him to the attention of a psychiatrist you are not so careful to protect the meaning the nature and the dignity of love love is the expression of ones values the greatest reward you can earn for the moral qualities you have achieved in your character and person the emotional price paid by one man for the joy he receives from the virtues of another your morality demands that you divorce your love from values and hand it down to any vagrant not as response to his worth but as response to his need not as reward but as alms not as a payment for virtues but as a blank check on vices your morality tells you that the purpose of love is to set you free of the bonds of morality that love is superior to moral judgment that true love transcends forgives and survives every manner of evil in its object and the greater the love the greater the depravity it permits to the loved to love a man for his virtues is paltry and human it tells you to love him for his flaws is divine to love those who are worthy of it is selfinterest to love the unworthy is sacrifice you owe your love to those who dont deserve it and the less they deserve it the more love you owe themthe more loathsome the object the nobler your lovethe more unfastidious your love the greater your virtueand if you can bring your soul to the state of a dump heap that welcomes anything on equal terms if you can cease to value moral values you have achieved the state of moral perfection such is your morality of sacrifice and such are the twin ideals it offers to refashion the life of your body in the image of a human stockyards and the life of your spirit in the image of a dump such was your goaland youve reached it why do you now moan complaints about mans impotence and the futility of human aspirations because you were unable to prosper by seeking destruction because you were unable to find joy by worshipping pain because you were unable to live by holding death as your standard of value the degree of your ability to live was the degree to which you broke your moral code yet you believe that those who preach it are friends of humanity you damn yourself and dare not question their motives or their goals take a look at them now when you face your last choiceand if you choose to perish do so with full knowledge of how cheaply how small an enemy has claimed your life the mystics of both schools who preach the creed of sacrifice are germs that attack you through a single sore your fear of relying on your mind they tell you that they possess a means of knowledge higher than the mind a mode of consciousness superior to reasonlike a special pull with some bureaucrat of the universe who gives them secret tips withheld from others the mystics of spirit declare that they possess an extra sense you lack this special sixth sense consists of contradicting the whole of the knowledge of your five the mystics of muscle do not bother to assert any claim to extrasensory perception they merely declare that your senses are not valid and that their wisdom consists of perceiving your blindness by some manner of unspecified means both kinds demand that you invalidate your own consciousness and surrender yourself into their power they offer you as proof of their superior knowledge the fact that they assert the opposite of everything you know and as proof of their superior ability to deal with existence the fact that they lead you to misery selfsacrifice starvation destruction they claim that they perceive a mode of being superior to your existence on this earth the mystics of spirit call it another dimension which consists of denying dimensions the mystics of muscle call it the future which consists of denying the present to exist is to possess identity what identity are they able to give to their superior realm they keep telling you what it is not but never tell you what it is all their identifications consist of negating god is that which no human mind can know they sayand proceed to demand that you consider it knowledgegod is nonman heaven is nonearth soul is nonbody virtue is nonprofit a is nona perception is nonsensory knowledge is nonreason their definitions are not acts of defining but of wiping out it is only the metaphysics of a leech that would cling to the idea of a universe where a zero is a standard of identification a leech would want to seek escape from the necessity to name its own natureescape from the necessity to know that the substance on which it builds its private universe is blood what is the nature of that superior world to which they sacrifice the world that exists the mystics of spirit curse matter the mystics of muscle curse profit the first wish men to profit by renouncing the earth the second wish men to inherit the earth by renouncing all profit their nonmaterial nonprofit worlds are realms where rivers run with milk and coffee where wine spurts from rocks at their command where pastry drops on them from clouds at the price of opening their mouth on this material profitchasing earth an enormous investment of virtueof intelligence integrity energy skillis required to construct a railroad to carry them the distance of one mile in their nonmaterial nonprofit world they travel from planet to planet at the cost of a wish if an honest person asks them howthey answer with righteous scorn that a how is the concept of vulgar realists the concept of superior spirits is somehow on this earth restricted by matter and profit rewards are achieved by thought in a world set free of such restrictions rewards are achieved by wishing and that is the whole of their shabby secret the secret of all their esoteric philosophies of all their dialectics and supersenses of their evasive eyes and snarling words the secret for which they destroy civilization language industries and lives the secret for which they pierce their own eyes and eardrums grind out their senses blank out their minds the purpose for which they dissolve the absolutes of reason logic matter existence realityis to erect upon that plastic fog a single holy absolute their wish the restriction they seek to escape is the law of identity the freedom they seek is freedom from the fact that an a will remain an a no matter what their tears or tantrumsthat a river will not bring them milk no matter what their hungerthat water will not run uphill no matter what comforts they could gain if it did and if they want to lift it to the roof of a skyscraper they must do it by a process of thought and labor in which the nature of an inch of pipe line counts but their feelings do notthat their feelings are impotent to alter the course of a single speck of dust in space or the nature of any action they have committed those who tell you that man is unable to perceive a reality undistorted by his senses mean that they are unwilling to perceive a reality undistorted by their feelings things as they are are things as perceived by your mind divorce them from reason and they become things as perceived by your wishes there is no honest revolt against reasonand when you accept any part of their creed your motive is to get away with something your reason would not permit you to attempt the freedom you seek is freedom from the fact that if you stole your wealth you are a scoundrel no matter how much you give to charity or how many prayers you recitethat if you sleep with sluts youre not a worthy husband no matter how anxiously you feel that you love your wife next morningthat you are an entity not a series of random pieces scattered through a universe where nothing sticks and nothing commits you to anything the universe of a childs nightmare where identities switch and swim where the rotter and the hero are interchangeable parts arbitrarily assumed at willthat you are a manthat you are an entitythat you are no matter how eagerly you claim that the goal of your mystic wishing is a higher mode of life the rebellion against identity is the wish for nonexistence the desire not to be anything is the desire not to be your teachers the mystics of both schools have reversed causality in their consciousness then strive to reverse it in existence they take their emotions as a cause and their mind as a passive effect they make their emotions their tool for perceiving reality they hold their desires as an irreducible primary as a fact superseding all facts an honest man does not desire until he has identified the object of his desire he says it is therefore i want it they say i want it therefore it is they want to cheat the axiom of existence and consciousness they want their consciousness to be an instrument not of perceiving but of creating existence and existence to be not the object but the subject of their consciousnessthey want to be that god they created in their image and likeness who creates a universe out of a void by means of an arbitrary whim but reality is not to be cheated what they achieve is the opposite of their desire they want an omnipotent power over existence instead they lose the power of their consciousness by refusing to know they condemn themselves to the horror of a perpetual unknown those irrational wishes that draw you to their creed those emotions you worship as an idol on whose altar you sacrifice the earth that dark incoherent passion within you which you take as the voice of god or of your glands is nothing more than the corpse of your mind an emotion that clashes with your reason an emotion that you cannot explain or control is only the carcass of that stale thinking which you forbade your mind to revise whenever you committed the evil of refusing to think and to see of exempting from the absolute of reality some one small wish of yours whenever you chose to say let me withdraw from the judgment of reason the cookies i stole or the existence of god let me have my one irrational whim and i will be a man of reason about all elsethat was the act of subverting your consciousness the act of corrupting your mind your mind then became a fixed jury who takes orders from a secret underworld whose verdict distorts the evidence to fit an absolute it dares not touchand a censored reality is the result a splintered reality where the bits you chose to see are floating among the chasms of those you didnt held together by that embalming fluid of the mind which is an emotion exempted from thought the links you strive to drown are causal connections the enemy you seek to defeat is the law of causality it permits you no miracles the law of causality is the law of identity applied to action al actions are caused by entities the nature of an action is caused and determined by the nature of the entities that act a thing cannot act in contradiction to its nature an action not caused by an entity would be caused by a zero which would mean a zero controlling a thing a nonentity controlling an entity the nonexistent ruling the existentwhich is the universe of your teachers desire the cause of their doctrines of causeless action the reason of their revolt against reason the goal of their morality their politics their economics the ideal they strive for the reign of the zero the law of identity does not permit you to have your cake and eat it too the law of causality does not permit you to eat your cake before you have it but if you drown both laws in the blanks of your mind if you pretend to yourself and to others that you dont seethen you can try to proclaim your right to eat your cake today and mine tomorrow you can preach that the way to have a cake is to eat it first before you bake it that the way to produce is to start by consuming that all wishers have an equal claim to all things since nothing is caused by anything the corollary of the causeless in matter is the unearned in spirit whenever you rebel against causality your motive is the fraudulent desire not to escape it but worse to reverse it you want unearned love as if love the effect could give you personal value the causeyou want unearned admiration as if admiration the effect could give you virtue the causeyou want unearned wealth as if wealth the effect could give you ability the causeyou plead for mercy mercy not justice as if an unearned forgiveness could wipe out the cause of your plea and to indulge your ugly little shams you support the doctrines of your teachers while they run hogwild proclaiming that spending the effect creates riches the cause that machinery the effect creates intelligence the cause that your sexual desires the effect create your philosophical values the cause who pays for the orgy who causes the causeless who are the victims condemned to remain unacknowledged and to perish in silence lest their agony disturb your pretense that they do not exist we are we the men of the mind we are the cause of all the values that you covet we who perform the process of thinking which is the process of defining identity and discovering causal connections we taught you to know to speak to produce to desire to love you who abandon reasonwere it not for us who preserve it you would not be able to fulfill or even to conceive your wishes you would not be able to desire the clothes that had not been made the automobile that had not been invented the money that had not been devised as exchange for goods that did not exist the admiration that had not been experienced for men who had achieved nothing the love that belongs and pertains only to those who preserve their capacity to think to choose to value youwho leap like a savage out of the jungle of your feelings into the fifth avenue of our new york and proclaim that you want to keep the electric lights but to destroy the generatorsit is our wealth that you use while destroying us it is our values that you use while damning us it is our language that you use while denying the mind just as your mystics of spirit invented their heaven in the image of our earth omitting our existence and promised you rewards created by miracle out of nonmatterso your modern mystics of muscle omit our existence and promise you a heaven where matter shapes itself of its own causeless will into all the rewards desired by your nonmind for centuries the mystics of spirit had existed by running a protection racketby making life on earth unbearable then charging you for consolation and relief by forbidding all the virtues that make existence possible then riding on the shoulders of your guilt by declaring production and joy to be sins then collecting blackmail from the sinners we the men of the mind were the unnamed victims of their creed we who were willing to break their moral code and to bear damnation for the sin of reasonwe who thought and acted while they wished and prayedwe who were moral outcasts we who were bootleggers of life when life was held to be a crimewhile they basked in moral glory for the virtue of surpassing material greed and of distributing in selfless charity the material goods produced byblankout now we are chained and commanded to produce by savages who do not grant us even the identification of sinnersby savages who proclaim that we do not exist then threaten to deprive us of the life we dont possess if we fail to provide them with the goods we dont produce now we are expected to continue running railroads and to know the minute when a train will arrive after crossing the span of a continent we are expected to continue running steel mills and to know the molecular structure of every drop of metal in the cables of your bridges and in the body of the airplanes that support you in midairwhile the tribes of your grotesque little mystics of muscle fight over the carcass of our world gibbering in sounds of nonlanguage that there are no principles no absolutes no knowledge no mind dropping below the level of a savage who believes that the magic words he utters have the power to alter reality they believe that reality can be altered by the power of the words they do not utterand their magic tool is the blankout the pretense that nothing can come into existence past the voodoo of their refusal to identify it as they feed on stolen wealth in body so they feed on stolen concepts in mind and proclaim that honesty consists of refusing to know that one is stealing as they use effects while denying causes so they use our concepts while denying the roots and the existence of the concepts they are using as they seek not to build but to take over industrial plants so they seek not to think but to take over human thinking as they proclaim that the only requirement for running a factory is the ability to turn the cranks of the machines and blank out the question of who created the factoryso they proclaim that there are no entities that nothing exists but motion and blank out the fact that motion presupposes the thing which moves that without the concept of entity there can be no such concept as motion as they proclaim their right to consume the unearned and blank out the question of whos to produce itso they proclaim that there is no law of identity that nothing exists but change and blank out the fact that change presupposes the concepts of what changes from what and to what that without the law of identity no such concept as change is possible as they rob an industrialist while denying his value so they seek to seize power over all of existence while denying that existence exists we know that we know nothing they chatter blanking out the fact that they are claiming knowledgethere are no absolutes they chatter blanking out the fact that they are uttering an absoluteyou cannot prove that you exist or that youre conscious they chatter blanking out the fact that proof presupposes existence consciousness and a complex chain of knowledge the existence of something to know of a consciousness able to know it and of a knowledge that has learned to distinguish between such concepts as the proved and the unproved when a savage who has not learned to speak declares that existence must be proved he is asking you to prove it by means of nonexistencewhen he declares that your consciousness must be proved he is asking you to prove it by means of unconsciousnesshe is asking you to step into a void outside of existence and consciousness to give him proof of bothhe is asking you to become a zero gaining knowledge about a zero when he declares that an axiom is a matter of arbitrary choice and he doesnt choose to accept the axiom that he exists he blanks out the fact that he has accepted it by uttering that sentence that the only way to reject it is to shut ones mouth expound no theories and die an axiom is a statement that identifies the base of knowledge and of any further statement pertaining to that knowledge a statement necessarily contained in all others whether any particular speaker chooses to identify it or not an axiom is a proposition that defeats its opponents by the fact that they have to accept it and use it in the process of any attempt to deny it let the caveman who does not choose to accept the axiom of identity try to present his theory without using the concept of identity or any concept derived from itlet the anthropoid who does not choose to accept the existence of nouns try to devise a language without nouns adjectives or verbslet the witchdoctor who does not choose to accept the validity of sensory perception try to prove it without using the data he obtained by sensory perception let the headhunter who does not choose to accept the validity of logic try to prove it without using logiclet the pigmy who proclaims that a skyscraper needs no foundation after it reaches its fiftieth story yank the base from under his building not yourslet the cannibal who snarls that the freedom of mans mind was needed to create an industrial civilization but is not needed to maintain it be given an arrowhead and bearskin not a university chair of economics do you think they are taking you back to dark ages they are taking you back to darker ages than any your history has known their goal is not the era of prescience but the era of prelanguage their purpose is to deprive you of the concept on which mans mind his life and his culture depend the concept of an objective reality identify the development of a human consciousnessand you will know the purpose of their creed a savage is a being who has not grasped that a is a and that reality is real he has arrested his mind at the level of a babys at the stage when a consciousness acquires its initial sensory perceptions and has not learned to distinguish solid objects it is to a baby that the world appears as a blur of motion without things that moveand the birth of his mind is the day when he grasps that the streak that keeps flickering past him is his mother and the whirl beyond her is a curtain that the two are solid entities and neither can turn into the other that they are what they are that they exist the day when he grasps that matter has no volition is the day when he grasps that he hasand this is his birth as a human being the day when he grasps that the reflection he sees in a mirror is not a delusion that it is real but it is not himself that the mirage he sees in a desert is not a delusion that the air and the light rays that cause it are real but it is not a city it is a citys reflectionthe day when he grasps that he is not a passive recipient of the sensations of any given moment that his senses do not provide him with automatic knowledge in separate snatches independent of context but only with the material of knowledge which his mind must learn to integratethe day when he grasps that his senses cannot deceive him that physical objects cannot act without causes that his organs of perception are physical and have no volition no power to invent or to distort that the evidence they give him is an absolute but his mind must learn to understand it his mind must discover the nature the causes the full context of his sensory material his mind must identify the things that he perceivesthat is the day of his birth as a thinker and scientist we are the men who reach that day you are the men who choose to reach it partly a savage is a man who never does to a savage the world is a place of unintelligible miracles where anything is possible to inanimate matter and nothing is possible to him his world is not the unknown but that irrational horror the unknowable he believes that physical objects are endowed with a mysterious volition moved by causeless unpredictable whims while he is a helpless pawn at the mercy of forces beyond his control he believes that nature is ruled by demons who possess an omnipotent power and that reality is their fluid plaything where they can turn his bowl of meal into a snake and his wife into a beetle at any moment where the a he has never discovered can be any nona they choose where the only knowledge he possesses is that he must not attempt to know he can count on nothing he can only wish and he spends his life on wishing on begging his demons to grant him his wishes by the arbitrary power of their will giving them credit when they do taking the blame when they dont offering them sacrifices in token of his gratitude and sacrifices in token of his guilt crawling on his belly in fear and worship of sun and moon and wind and rain and of any thug who announces himself as their spokesman provided his words are unintelligible and his mask sufficiently frighteninghe wishes begs and crawls and dies leaving you as a record of his view of existence the distorted monstrosities of his idols partman partanimal partspider the embodiments of the world of nona his is the intellectual state of your modern teachers and his is the world to which they want to bring you if you wonder by what means they propose to do it walk into any college classroom and you will hear your professors teaching your children that man can be certain of nothing that his consciousness has no validity whatever that he can learn no facts and no laws of existence that hes incapable of knowing an objective reality what then is his standard of knowledge and truth whatever others believe is their answer there is no knowledge they teach theres only faith your belief that you exist is an act of faith no more valid than anothers faith in his right to kill you the axioms of science are an act of faith no more valid than a mystics faith in revelations the belief that electric light can be produced by a generator is an act of faith no more valid than the belief that it can be produced by a rabbits foot kissed under a stepladder on the first of the moontruth is whatever people want it to be and people are everyone except yourself reality is whatever people choose to say it is there are no objective facts there are only peoples arbitrary wishesa man who seeks knowledge in a laboratory by means of test tubes and logic is an oldfashioned superstitious fool a true scientist is a man who goes around taking public pollsand if it werent for the selfish greed of the manufacturers of steel girders who have a vested interest in obstructing the progress of science you would learn that new york city does not exist because a poll of the entire population of the world would tell you by a landslide majority that their beliefs forbid its existence for centuries the mystics of spirit have proclaimed that faith is superior to reason but have not dared deny the existence of reason their heirs and product the mystics of muscle have completed their job and achieved their dream they proclaim that everything is faith and call it a revolt against believing as revolt against unproved assertions they proclaim that nothing can be proved as revolt against supernatural knowledge they proclaim that no knowledge is possible as revolt against the enemies of science they proclaim that science is superstition as revolt against the enslavement of the mind they proclaim that there is no mind if you surrender your power to perceive if you accept the switch of your standard from the objective to the collective and wait for mankind to tell you what to think you will find another switch taking place before the eyes you have renounced you will find that your teachers become the rulers of the collective and if you then refuse to obey them protesting that they are not the whole of mankind they will answer by what means do you know that we are not are brother where did you get that oldfashioned term if you doubt that such is their purpose observe with what passionate consistency the mystics of muscle are striving to make you forget that a concept such as mind has ever existed observe the twists of undefined verbiage the words with rubber meanings the terms left floating in midstream by means of which they try to get around the recognition of the concept of thinking your consciousness they tell you consists of reflexes reactions experiences urges and drivesand refuse to identify the means by which they acquired that knowledge to identify the act they are performing when they tell it or the act you are performing when you listen words have the power to condition you they say and

obscenity of explaining mans industrial progressskyscrapers cable bridges power motors railroad trainsby declaring that man is an animal who possesses an instinct of toolmaking did you wonder what is wrong with the world you are now seeing the climax of the creed of the uncaused and unearned all your gangs of mystics of spirit or muscle are fighting one another for power to rule you snarling that love is the solution for all the problems of your spirit and that a whip is the solution for all the problems of your bodyyou who have agreed to have no mind granting man less dignity than they grant to cattle ignoring what an animal trainer could tell themthat no animal can be trained by fear that a tortured elephant will trample its torturer but will not work for him or carry his burdens they expect man to continue to produce electronic tubes supersonic airplanes atomsmashing engines and interstellar telescopes with his ration of meat for reward and a lash on his back for incentive make no mistake about the character of mystics to undercut your consciousness has always been their only purpose throughout the ages and power the power to rule you by force has always been their only lust from the rites of the jungle witchdoctors which distorted reality into grotesque absurdities stunted the minds of their victims and kept them in terror of the supernatural for stagnant stretches of centuriesto the supernatural doctrines of the middle ages which kept men huddling on the mud floors of their hovels in terror that the devil might steal the soup they had worked eighteen hours to earnto the seedy little smiling professor who assures you that your brain has no capacity to think that you have no means of perception and must blindly obey the omnipotent will of that supernatural force societyall of it is the same performance for the same and only purpose to reduce you to the kind of pulp that has surrendered the validity of its consciousness but it cannot be done to you without your consent if you permit it to be done you deserve it when you listen to a mystics harangue on the impotence of the human mind and begin to doubt your consciousness not his when you permit your precariously semirational state to be shaken by any assertion and decide it is safer to trust his superior certainty and knowledge the joke is on both of you your sanction is the only source of certainty he has the supernatural power that a mystic dreads the unknowable spirit he worships the consciousness he considers omnipotent isyours a mystic is a man who surrendered his mind at its first encounter with the minds of others somewhere in the distant reaches of his childhood when his own understanding of reality clashed with the assertions of others with their arbitrary orders and contradictory demands he gave in to so craven a fear of dependence that he renounced his rational faculty at the crossroads of the choice between i know and they say he chose the authority of others he chose to submit rather than to understand to believe rather than to think faith in the supernatural begins as faith in the superiority of others his surrender took the form of the feeling that he must hide his lack of understanding that others possess some mysterious knowledge of which he alone is deprived that reality is whatever they want it to be through some means forever denied to him from then on afraid to think he is left at the mercy of unidentified feelings his feelings become his only guide his only remnant of personal identity he clings to them with ferocious possessivenessand whatever thinking he does is devoted to the struggle of hiding from himself that the nature of his feelings is terror when a mystic declares that he feels the existence of a power superior to reason he feels it all right but that power is not an omniscient superspirit of the universe it is the consciousness of any passerby to whom he has surrendered his own a mystic is driven by the urge to impress to cheat to flatter to deceive to force that omnipotent consciousness of others they are his only key to reality he feels that he cannot exist save by harnessing their mysterious power and extorting their unaccountable consent they are his only means of perception and like a blind man who depends on the sight of a dog he feels he must leash them in order to live to control the consciousness of others becomes his only passion powerlust is a weed that grows only in the vacant lots of an abandoned mind every dictator is a mystic and every mystic is a potential dictator a mystic craves obedience from men not their agreement he wants them to surrender their consciousness to his assertions his edicts his wishes his whimsas his consciousness is surrendered to theirs he wants to deal with men by means of faith and forcehe finds no satisfaction in their consent if he must earn it by means of facts and reason reason is the enemy he dreads and simultaneously considers precarious reason to him is a means of deception he feels that men possess some power more potent than reasonand only their causeless belief or their forced obedience can give him a sense of security a proof that he has gained control of the mystic endowment he lacked his lust is to command not to convince conviction requires an act of independence and rests on the absolute of an objective reality what he seeks is power over reality and over mens means of perceiving it their mind the power to interpose his will between existence and consciousness as if by agreeing to fake the reality he orders them to fake men would in fact create it just as the mystic is a parasite in matter who expropriates the wealth created by othersjust as he is a parasite in spirit who plunders the ideas created by othersso he falls below the level of a lunatic who creates his own distortion of reality to the level of a parasite of lunacy who seeks a distortion created by others there is only one state that fulfills the mystics longing for infinity noncausality nonidentity death no matter what unintelligible causes he ascribes to his incommunicable feelings whoever rejects reality rejects existenceand the feelings that move him from then on are hatred for all the values of mans life and lust for all the evils that destroy it a mystic relishes the spectacle of suffering of poverty subservience and terror these give him a feeling of triumph a proof of the defeat of rational reality but no other reality exists no matter whose welfare he professes to serve be it the welfare of god or of that disembodied gargoyle he describes as the people no matter what ideal he proclaims in terms of some supernatural dimensionin fact in reality on earth his ideal is death his craving is to kill his only satisfaction is to torture destruction is the only end that the mystics creed has ever achieved as it is the only end that you see them achieving today and if the ravages wrought by their acts have not made them question their doctrines if they profess to be moved by love yet are not deterred by piles of human corpses it is because the truth about their souls is worse than the obscene excuse you have allowed them the excuse that the end justifies the means and that the horrors they practice are means to nobler ends the truth is that those horrors are their ends you whore depraved enough to believe that you could adjust yourself to a mystics dictatorship and could please him by obeying his ordersthere is no way to please him when you obey he will reverse his orders he seeks obedience for the sake of obedience and destruction for the sake of destruction you who are craven enough to believe that you can make terms with a mystic by giving in to his extortionsthere is no way to buy him off the bribe he wants is your life as slowly or as fast as you are willing to give it inand the monster he seeks to bribe is the hidden blankout in his mind which drives him to kill in order not to learn that the death he desires is his own you who are innocent enough to believe that the forces let loose in your world today are moved by greed for material plunderthe mystics scramble for spoils is only a screen to conceal from their mind the nature of their motive wealth is a means of human life and they clamor for wealth in imitation of living beings to pretend to themselves that they desire to live but their swinish indulgence in plundered luxury is not enjoyment it is escape they do not want to own your fortune they want you to lose it they do not want to succeed they want you to fail they do not want to live they want you to die they desire nothing they hate existence and they keep running each trying not to learn that the object of his hatred is himself you whove never grasped the nature of evil you who describe them as misguided idealistsmay the god you invented forgive youthey are the essence of evil they those antiliving objects who seek by devouring the world to fill the selfless zero of their soul it is not your wealth that theyre after theirs is a conspiracy against the mind which means against life and man it is a conspiracy without leader or direction and the random little thugs of the moment who cash in on the agony of one land or another are chance scum riding the torrent from the broken dam of the sewer of centuries from the reservoir of hatred for reason for logic for ability for achievement for joy stored by every whining antihuman who ever preached the superiority of the heart over the mind it is a conspiracy of all those who seek not to live but to get away with living those who seek to cut just one small corner of reality and are drawn by feeling to all the others who are busy cutting other cornersa conspiracy that unites by links of evasion all those who pursue a zero as a value the professor who unable to think takes pleasure in crippling the mind of his students the businessman who to protect his stagnation takes pleasure in chaining the ability of competitors the neurotic who to defend his selfloathing takes pleasure in breaking men of selfesteem the incompetent who takes pleasure in defeating achievement the mediocrity who takes pleasure in demolishing greatness the eunuch who takes pleasure in the castration of all pleasureand all their intellectual munitionmakers all those who preach that the immolation of virtue will transform vices into virtue death is the premise at the root of their theories death is the goal of their actions in practiceand you are the last of their victims we who were the living buffers between you and the nature of your creed are no longer there to save you from the effects of your chosen beliefs we are no longer willing to pay with our lives the debts you incurred in yours or the moral deficit piled up by all the generations behind you you had been living on borrowed timeand i am the man who has called in the loan i am the man whose existence your blankouts were intended to permit you to ignore i am the man whom you did not want either to live or to die you did not want me to live because you were afraid of knowing that i carried the responsibility you dropped and that your lives depended upon me you did not want me to die because you knew it twelve years ago when i worked in your world i was an inventor i was one of a profession that came last in human history and will be first to vanish on the way back to the subhuman an inventor is a man who asks why of the universe and lets nothing stand between the answer and his mind like the man who discovered the use of steam or the man who discovered the use of oil i discovered a source of energy which was available since the birth of the globe but which men had not known how to use except as an object of worship of terror and of legends about a thundering god i completed the experimental model of a motor that would have made a fortune for me and for those who had hired me a motor that would have raised the efficiency of every human installation using power and would have added the gift of higher productivity to every hour you spend at earning your living then one night at a factory meeting i heard myself sentenced to death by reason of my achievement i heard three parasites assert that my brain and my life were their property that my right to exist was conditional and depended on the satisfaction of their desires the purpose of my ability they said was to serve the needs of those who were less able i had no right to live they said by reason of my competence for living their right to live was unconditional by reason of their incompetence then i saw what was wrong with the world i saw what destroyed men and nations and where the battle for life had to be fought i saw that the enemy was an inverted moralityand that my sanction was its only power i saw that evil was impotentthat evil was the irrational the blind the antirealand that the only weapon of its triumph was the willingness of the good to serve it just as the parasites around me were proclaiming their helpless dependence on my mind and were expecting me voluntarily to accept a slavery they had no power to enforce just as they were counting on my selfimmolation to provide them with the means of their planso throughout the world and throughout mens history in every version and form from the extortions of loafing relatives to the atrocities of collectivized countries it is the good the able the men of reason who act as their own destroyers who transfuse to evil the blood of their virtue and let evil transmit to them the poison of destruction thus gaining for evil the power of survival and for their own valuesthe impotence of death i saw that there comes a point in the defeat of any man of virtue when his own consent is needed for evil to winand that no manner of injury done to him by others can succeed if he chooses to withhold his consent i saw that i could put an end to your outrages by pronouncing a single word in my mind i pronounced it the word was no i quit that factory i quit your world i made it my job to warn your victims and to give them the method and the weapon to fight you the method was to refuse to deflect retribution the weapon was justice if you want to know what you lost when i quit and when my strikers deserted your worldstand on an empty stretch of soil in a wilderness unexplored by men and ask yourself what manner of survival you would achieve and how long you would last if you refused to think with no one around to teach you the motions or if you chose to think how much your mind would be able to discoverask yourself how many independent conclusions you have reached in the course of your life and how much of your time was spent on performing the actions you learned from othersask yourself whether you would be able to discover how to till the soil and grow your food whether you would be able to invent a wheel a lever an induction coil a generator an electronic tubethen decide whether men of ability are exploiters who live by the fruit of your labor and rob you of the wealth that you produce and whether you dare to believe that you possess the power to enslave them let your women take a look at a jungle female with her shriveled face and pendulous breasts as she sits grinding meal in a bowl hour after hour century by centurythen let them ask themselves whether their instinct of toolmaking will provide them with their electric refrigerators their washing machines and vacuum cleaners and if not whether they care to destroy those who provided it all but not by instinct take a look around you you savages who stutter that ideas are created by mens means of production that a machine is not the product of human thought but a mystical power that produces human thinking you have never discovered the industrial ageand you cling to the morality of the barbarian eras when a miserable form of human subsistence was produced by the muscular labor of slaves every mystic had always longed for slaves to protect him from the material reality he dreaded but you you grotesque little atavists stare blindly at the skyscrapers and smokestacks around you and dream of enslaving the material providers who are scientists inventors industrialists when you clamor for public ownership of the means of production you are clamoring for public ownership of the mind i have taught my strikers that the answer you deserve is only try and get it you proclaim yourself unable to harness the forces of inanimate matter yet propose to harness the minds of men who are able to achieve the feats you cannot equal you proclaim that you cannot survive without us yet propose to dictate the terms of our survival you proclaim that you need us yet indulge the impertinence of asserting your right to rule us by forceand expect that we who are not afraid of that physical nature which fills you with terror will cower at the sight of any lout who has talked you into voting him a chance to command us you propose to establish a social order based on the following tenets that youre incompetent to run your own life but competent to run the lives of othersthat youre unfit to exist in freedom but fit to become an omnipotent rulerthat youre unable to earn your living by the use of your own intelligence but able to judge politicians and to vote them into jobs of total power over arts you have never seen over sciences you have never studied over achievements of which you have no knowledge over the gigantic industries where you by your own definition of your capacity would be unable successfully to fill the job of assistant greaser this idol of your cult of zeroworship this symbol of impotencethe congenital dependentis your image of man and your standard of value in whose likeness you strive to refashion your soul its only human you cry in defense of any depravity reaching the stage of selfabasement where you seek to make the concept human mean the weakling the fool the rotter the liar the failure the coward the fraud and to exile from the human race the hero the thinker the producer the inventor the strong the purposeful the pureas if to feel were human but to think were not as if to fail were human but to succeed were not as if corruption were human but virtue were not as if the premise of death were proper to man but the premise of life were not in order to deprive us of honor that you may then deprive us of our wealth you have always regarded us as slaves who deserve no moral recognition you praise any venture that claims to be nonprofit and damn the men who made the profits that make the venture possible you regard as in the public interest any project serving those who do not pay it is not in the public interest to provide any services for those who do the paying public benefit is anything given as alms to engage in trade is to injure the public public welfare is the welfare of those who do not earn it those who do are entitled to no welfare the public to you is whoever has failed to achieve any virtue or value whoever achieves it whoever provides the goods you require for survival ceases to be regarded as part of the public or as part of the human race what blankout permitted you to hope that you could get away with this muck of contradictions and to plan it as an ideal society when the no of your victims was sufficient to demolish the whole of your structure what permits any insolent beggar to wave his sores in the face of his betters and to plead for help in the tone of a threat you cry as he does that you are counting on our pity but your secret hope is the moral code that has taught you to count on our guilt you expect us to feel guilty of our virtues in the presence of your vices wounds and failuresguilty of succeeding at existence guilty of enjoying the life that you damn yet beg us to help you to live did you want to know who is john galt i am the first man of ability who refused to regard it as guilt i am the first man who would not do penance for my virtues or let them be used as the tools of my destruction i am the first man who would not suffer martyrdom at the hands of those who wished me to perish for the privilege of keeping them alive i am the first man who told them that i did not need them and until they learned to deal with me as traders giving value for value they would have to exist without me as i would exist without them then i would let them learn whose is the need and whose the abilityand if human survival is the standard whose terms would set the way to survive i have done by plan and intention what had been done throughout history by silent default there have always been men of intelligence who went on strike in protest and despair but they did not know the meaning of their action the man who retires from public life to think but not to share his thoughtsthe man who chooses to spend his years in the obscurity of menial employment keeping to himself the fire of his mind never giving it form expression or reality refusing to bring it into a world he despisesthe man who is defeated by revulsion the man who renounces before he has started the man who gives up rather than give in the man who functions at a fraction of his capacity disarmed by his longing for an ideal he has not foundthey are on strike on strike against unreason on strike against your world and your values but not knowing any values of their own they abandon the quest to knowin the darkness of their hopeless indignation which is righteous without knowledge of the right and passionate without knowledge of desire they concede to you the power of reality and surrender the incentives of their mindand they perish in bitter futility as rebels who never learned the object of their rebellion as lovers who never discovered their love the infamous times you call the dark ages were an era of intelligence on strike when men of ability went underground and lived undiscovered studying in secret and died destroying the works of their mind when only a few of the bravest of martyrs remained to keep the human race alive every period ruled by mystics was an era of stagnation and want when most men were on strike against existence working for less than their barest survival leaving nothing but scraps for their rulers to loot refusing to think to venture to produce when the ultimate collector of their profits and the final authority on truth or error was the whim of some gilded degenerate sanctioned as superior to reason by divine right and by grace of a club the road of human history was a string of blankouts over sterile stretches eroded by faith and force with only a few brief bursts of sunlight when the released energy of the men of the mind performed the wonders you gaped at admired and promptly extinguished again but there will be no extinction this time the game of the mystics is up you will perish in and by your own unreality we the men of reason will survive i have called out on strike the kind of martyrs who had never deserted you before i have given them the weapon they had lacked the knowledge of their own moral value i have taught them that the world is ours whenever we choose to claim it by virtue and grace of the fact that ours is the morality of life they the great victims who had produced all the wonders of humanitys brief summer they the industrialists the conquerors of matter had not discovered the nature of their right they had known that theirs was the power i taught them that theirs was the glory you who dare to regard us as the moral inferiors of any mystic who claims supernatural visionsyou who scramble like vultures for plundered pennies yet honor a fortuneteller above a fortune makeryou who scorn a businessman as ignoble but esteem any posturing artist as exaltedthe root of your standards is that mystic miasma which comes from primordial swamps that cult of death which pronounces a businessman immoral by reason of the fact that he keeps you alive you who claim that you long to rise above the crude concerns of the body above the drudgery of serving mere physical needswho is enslaved by physical needs the hindu who labors from sunrise to sunset at the shafts of a handplow for a bowl of rice or the american who is driving a tractor who is the conqueror of physical reality the man who sleeps on a bed of nails or the man who sleeps on an innerspring mattress which is the monument to the triumph of the human spirit over matter the germeaten hovels on the shorelines of the ganges or the atlantic skyline of new york unless you learn the answers to these questionsand learn to stand at reverent attention when you face the achievements of mans mindyou will not stay much longer on this earth which we love and will not permit you to damn you will not sneak by with the rest of your lifespan i have foreshortened the usual course of history and have let you discover the nature of the payment you had hoped to switch to the shoulders of others it is the last of your own living power that will now be drained to provide the unearned for the worshippers and carriers of death do not pretend that a malevolent reality defeated youyou were defeated by your own evasions do not pretend that you will perish for a noble idealyou will perish as fodder for the haters of man but to those of you who still retain a remnant of the dignity and will to love ones life i am offering the chance to make a choice choose whether you wish to perish for a morality you have never believed or practiced pause on the brink of selfdestruction and examine your values and your life you had known how to take an inventory of your wealth now take an inventory of your mind since childhood you have been hiding the guilty secret that you feel no desire to be moral no desire to seek selfimmolation that you dread and hate your code but dare not say it even to yourself that youre devoid of those moral instincts which others profess to feel the less you felt the louder you proclaimed your selfless love and servitude to others in dread of ever letting them discover your own self the self that you betrayed the self that you kept in concealment like a skeleton in the closet of your body and they who were at once your dupes and your deceivers they listened and voiced their loud approval in dread of ever letting you discover that they were harboring the same unspoken secret existence among you is a giant pretense an act you all perform for one another each feeling that he is the only guilty freak each placing his moral authority in the unknowable known only to others each faking the reality he feels they expect him to fake none having the courage to break the vicious circle no matter what dishonorable compromise youve made with your impracticable creed no matter what miserable balance halfcynicism halfsuperstition you now manage to maintain you still preserve the root the lethal tenet the belief that the moral and the practical are opposites since childhood you have been running from the terror of a choice you have never dared fully to identify if the practical whatever you must practice to exist whatever works succeeds achieves your purpose whatever brings you food and joy whatever profits you is eviland if the good the moral is the impractical whatever fails destroys frustrates whatever injures you and brings you loss or painthen your choice is to be moral or to live the sole result of that murderous doctrine was to remove morality from life you grew up to believe that moral laws bear no relation to the job of living except as an impediment and threat that mans existence is an amoral jungle where anything goes and anything works and in that fog of switching definitions which descends upon a frozen mind you have forgotten that the evils damned by your creed were the virtues required for living and you have come to believe that actual evils are the practical means of existence forgetting that the impractical good was selfsacrifice you believe that selfesteem is impractical forgetting that the practical evil was production you believe that robbery is practical swinging like a helpless branch in the wind of an uncharted moral wilderness you dare not fully to be evil or fully to live when you are honest you feel the resentment of a sucker when you cheat you feel terror and shame when you are happy your joy is diluted by guilt when you suffer your pain is augmented by the feeling that pain is your natural state you pity the men you admire you believe they are doomed to fail you envy the men you hate you believe they are the masters of existence you feel disarmed when you come up against a scoundrel you believe that evil is bound to win since the moral is the impotent the impractical morality to you is a phantom scarecrow made of duty of boredom of punishment of pain a crossbreed between the first schoolteacher of your past and the tax collector of your present a scarecrow standing in a barren field waving a stick to chase away your pleasures and pleasure to you is a liquorsoggy brain a mindless slut the stupor of a moron who stakes his cash on some animals race since pleasure cannot be moral if you identify your actual belief you will find a triple damnation of yourself of life of virtuein the grotesque conclusion you have reached you believe that morality is a necessary evil do you wonder why you live without dignity love without fire and die without resistance do you wonder why wherever you look you see nothing but unanswerable questions why your life is torn by impossible conflicts why you spend it straddling irrational fences to evade artificial choices such as soul or body mind or heart security or freedom private profit or public good do you cry that you find no answers by what means did you hope to find them you reject your tool of perceptionyour mindthen complain that the universe is a mystery you discard your key then wail that all doors are locked against you you start out in pursuit of the irrational then damn existence for making no sense the fence you have been straddling for two hourswhile hearing my words and seeking to escape themis the cowards formula contained in the sentence but we dont have to go to extremes the extreme you have always struggled to avoid is the recognition that reality is final that a is a and that the truth is true a moral code impossible to practice a code that demands imperfection or death has taught you to dissolve all ideas in fog to permit no firm definitions to regard any concept as approximate and any rule of conduct as elastic to hedge on any principle to compromise on any value to take the middle of any road by extorting your acceptance of supernatural absolutes it has forced you to reject the absolute of nature by making moral judgments impossible it has made you incapable of rational judgment a code that forbids you to cast the first stone has forbidden you to admit the identity of stones and to know when or if youre being stoned the man who refuses to judge who neither agrees nor disagrees who declares that there are no absolutes and believes that he escapes responsibility is the man responsible for all the blood that is now spilled in the world reality is an absolute existence is an absolute a speck of dust is an absolute and so is a human life whether you live or die is an absolute whether you have a piece of bread or not is an absolute whether you eat your bread or see it vanish into a looters stomach is an absolute there are two sides to every issue one side is right and the other is wrong but the middle is always evil the man who is wrong still retains some respect for truth if only by accepting the responsibility of choice but the man in the middle is the knave who blanks out the truth in order to pretend that no choice or values exist who is willing to sit out the course of any battle willing to cash in on the blood of the innocent or to crawl on his belly to the guilty who dispenses justice by condemning both the robber and the robbed to jail who solves conflicts by ordering the thinker and the fool to meet each other halfway in any compromise between food and poison it is only death that can win in any compromise between good and evil it is only evil that can profit in that transfusion of blood which drains the good to feed the evil the compromiser is the transmitting rubber tube you who are halfrational halfcoward have been playing a con game with reality but the victim you have conned is yourself when men reduce their virtues to the approximate then evil acquires the force of an absolute when loyalty to an unyielding purpose is dropped by the virtuous its picked up by scoundrelsand you get the indecent spectacle of a cringing bargaining traitorous good and a selfrighteously uncompromising evil as you surrendered to the mystics of muscle when they told you that ignorance consists of claiming knowledge so now you surrender to them when they shriek that immorality consists of pronouncing moral judgment when they yell that it is selfish to be certain that you are right you hasten to assure them that youre certain of nothing when they shout that its immoral to stand on your convictions you assure them that you have no convictions whatever when the thugs of europes peoples states snarl that you are guilty of intolerance because you dont treat your desire to live and their desire to kill you as a difference of opinionyou cringe and hasten to assure them that you are not intolerant of any horror when some barefoot bum in some pesthole of asia yells at you how dare you be richyou apologize and beg him to be patient and promise him youll give it all away you have reached the blind alley of the treason you committed when you agreed that you had no right to exist once you believed it was only a compromise you conceded it was evil to live for yourself but moral to live for the sake of your children then you conceded that it was selfish to live for your children but moral to live for your community then you conceded that it was selfish to live for your community but moral to live for your country now you are letting this greatest of countries be devoured by any scum from any corner of the earth while you concede that it is selfish to live for your country and that your moral duty is to live for the globe a man who has no right to life has no right to values and will not keep them at the end of your road of successive betrayals stripped of weapons of certainty of honor you commit your final act of treason and sign your petition of intellectual bankruptcy while the musclemystics of the peoples states proclaim that theyre the champions of reason and science you agree and hasten to proclaim that faith is your cardinal principle that reason is on the side of your destroyers but yours is the side of faith to the struggling remnants of rational honesty in the twisted bewildered minds of your children you declare that you can offer no rational argument to support the ideas that created this country that there is no rational justification for freedom for property for justice for rights that they rest on a mystical insight and can be accepted only on faith that in reason and logic the enemy is right but faith is superior to reason you declare to your children that it is rational to loot to torture to enslave to expropriate to murder but that they must resist the temptations of logic and stick to the discipline of remaining irrationalthat skyscrapers factories radios airplanes were the products of faith and mystic intuition while famines concentration camps and firing squads are the products of a reasonable manner of existencethat the industrial revolution was the revolt of the men of faith against that era of reason and logic which is known as the middle ages simultaneously in the same breath to the same child you declare that the looters who rule the peoples states will surpass this country in material production since they are the representatives of science but that its evil to be concerned with physical wealth and that one must renounce material prosperityyou declare that the looters ideals are noble but they do not mean them while you do that your purpose in fighting the looters is only to accomplish their aims which they cannot accomplish but you can and that the way to fight them is to beat them to it and give ones wealth away then you wonder why your children join the peoples thugs or become halfcrazed delinquents you wonder why the looters conquests keep creeping closer to your doorsand you blame it on human stupidity declaring that the masses are impervious to reason you blank out the open public spectacle of the looters fight against the mind and the fact that their bloodiest horrors are unleashed to punish the crime of thinking you blank out the fact that most mystics of muscle started out as mystics of spirit that they keep switching from one to the other that the men you call materialists and spiritualists are only two halves of the same dissected human forever seeking completion but seeking it by swinging from the destruction of the flesh to the destruction of the soul and vice versathat they keep running from your colleges to the slave pens of europe to an open collapse into the mystic muck of india seeking any refuge against reality any form of escape from the mind you blank it out and cling to your hypocrisy of faith in order to blank out the knowledge that the looters have a stranglehold upon you which consists of your moral codethat the looters are the final and consistent practitioners of the morality youre halfobeying halfevadingthat they practice it the only way it can be practiced by turning the earth into a sacrificial furnacethat your morality forbids you to oppose them in the only way they can be opposed by refusing to become a sacrificial animal and proudly asserting your right to existthat in order to fight them to the finish and with full rectitude it is your morality that you have to reject you blank it out because your selfesteem is tied to that mystic unselfishness which youve never possessed or practiced but spent so many years pretending to possess that the thought of denouncing it fills you with terror no value is higher than selfesteem but youve invested it in counterfeit securitiesand now your morality has caught you in a trap where you are forced to protect your selfesteem by fighting for the creed of selfdestruction the grim joke is on you that need of selfesteem which youre unable to explain or to define belongs to my morality not yours its the objective token of my code it is my proof within your own soul by a feeling he has not learned to identify but has derived from his first awareness of existence from his discovery that he has to make choices man knows that his desperate need of selfesteem is a matter of life or death as a being of volitional consciousness he knows that he must know his own value in order to maintain his own life he knows that he has to be right to be wrong in action means danger to his life to be wrong in person to be evil means to be unfit for existence every act of mans life has to be willed the mere act of obtaining or eating his food implies that the person he preserves is worthy of being preserved every pleasure he seeks to enjoy implies that the person who seeks it is worthy of finding enjoyment he has no choice about his need of selfesteem his only choice is the standard by which to gauge it and he makes his fatal error when he switches this gauge protecting his life into the service of his own destruction when he chooses a standard contradicting existence and sets his selfesteem against reality every form of causeless selfdoubt every feeling of inferiority and secret unworthiness is in fact mans hidden dread of his inability to deal with existence but the greater his terror the more fiercely he clings to the murderous doctrines that choke him no man can survive the moment of pronouncing himself irredeemably evil should he do it his next moment is insanity or suicide to escape itif hes chosen an irrational standardhe will fake evade blank out he will cheat himself of reality of existence of happiness of mind and he will ultimately cheat himself of selfesteem by struggling to preserve its illusion rather than to risk discovering its lack to fear to face an issue is to believe that the worst is true it is not any crime you have ever committed that infects your soul with permanent guilt it is none of your failures errors or flaws but the blankout by which you attempt to evade themit is not any sort of original sin or unknown prenatal deficiency but the knowledge and fact of your basic default of suspending your mind of refusing to think fear and guilt are your chronic emotions they are real and you do deserve them but they dont come from the superficial reasons you invent to disguise their cause not from your selfishness weakness or ignorance but from a real and basic threat to your existence fear because you have abandoned your weapon of survival guilt because you know you have done it volitionally the self you have betrayed is your mind selfesteem is reliance on ones power to think the ego you seek that essential you which you cannot express or define is not your emotions or inarticulate dreams but your intellect that judge of your supreme tribunal whom youve impeached in order to drift at the mercy of any stray shyster you describe as your feeling then you drag yourself through a selfmade night in a desperate quest for a nameless fire moved by some fading vision of a dawn you had seen and lost observe the persistence in mankinds mythologies of the legend about a paradise that men had once possessed the city of atlantis or the garden of eden or some kingdom of perfection always behind us the root of that legend exists not in the past of the race but in the past of every man you still retain a sensenot as firm as a memory but diffused like the pain of hopeless longingthat somewhere in the starting years of your childhood before you had learned to submit to absorb the terror of unreason and to doubt the value of your mind you had known a radiant state of existence you had known the independence of a rational consciousness facing an open universe that is the paradise which you have lost which you seekwhich is yours for the taking some of you will never know who is john galt but those of you who have known a single moment of love for existence and of pride in being its worthy lover a moment of looking at this earth and letting your glance be its sanction have known the state of being a man and i i am only the man who knew that that state is not to be betrayed i am the man who knew what made it possible and who chose consistently to practice and to be what you had practiced and been in that one moment that choice is yours to make that choicethe dedication to ones highest potentialis made by accepting the fact that the noblest act you have ever performed is the act of your mind in the process of grasping that two and two make four whoever you areyou who are alone with my words in this moment with nothing but your honesty to help you understandthe choice is still open to be a human being but the price is to start from scratch to stand naked in the face of reality and reversing a costly historical error to declare i am therefore ill think accept the irrevocable fact that your life depends upon your mind admit that the whole of your struggle your doubts your fakes your evasions was a desperate quest for escape from the responsibility of a volitional consciousnessa quest for automatic knowledge for instinctive action for intuitive certaintyand while you called it a longing for the state of an angel what you were seeking was the state of an animal accept as your moral ideal the task of becoming a man do not say that youre afraid to trust your mind because you know so little are you safer in surrendering to mystics and discarding the little that you know live and act within the limit of your knowledge and keep expanding it to the limit of your life redeem your mind from the hockshops of authority accept the fact that you are not omniscient but playing a zombie will not give you omnisciencethat your mind is fallible but becoming mindless will not make you infalliblethat an error made on your own is safer than ten truths accepted on faith because the first leaves you the means to correct it but the second destroys your capacity to distinguish truth from error in place of your dream of an omniscient automaton accept the fact that any knowledge man acquires is acquired by his own will and effort and that that is his distinction in the universe that is his nature his morality his glory discard that unlimited license to evil which consists of claiming that man is imperfect by what standard do you damn him when you claim it accept the fact that in the realm of morality nothing less than perfection will do but perfection is not to be gauged by mystic commandments to practice the impossible and your moral stature is not to be gauged by matters not open to your choice man has a single basic choice to think or not and that is the gauge of his virtue moral perfection is an unbreached rationalitynot the degree of your intelligence but the full and relentless use of your mind not the extent of your knowledge but the acceptance of reason as an absolute learn to distinguish the difference between errors of knowledge and breaches of morality an error of knowledge is not a moral flaw provided you are willing to correct it only a mystic would judge human beings by the standard of an impossible automatic omniscience but a breach of morality is the conscious choice of an action you know to be evil or a willful evasion of knowledge a suspension of sight and of thought that which you do not know is not a moral charge against you but that which you refuse to know is an account of infamy growing in your soul make every allowance for errors of knowledge do not forgive or accept any breach of morality give the benefit of the doubt to those who seek to know but treat as potential killers those specimens of insolent depravity who make demands upon you announcing that they have and seek no reasons proclaiming as a license that they just feel if or those who reject an irrefutable argument by saying its only logic which means its only reality the only realm opposed to reality is the realm and premise of death accept the fact that the achievement of your happiness is the only moral purpose of your life and that happinessnot pain or mindless selfindulgenceis the proof of your moral integrity since it is the proof and the result of your loyalty to the achievement of your values happiness was the responsibility you dreaded it required the kind of rational discipline you did not value yourself enough to assumeand the anxious staleness of your days is the monument to your evasion of the knowledge that there is no moral substitute for happiness that there is no more despicable coward than the man who deserted the battle for his joy fearing to assert his right to existence lacking the courage and the loyalty to life of a bird or a flower reaching for the sun discard the protective rags of that vice which you called a virtue humilitylearn to value yourself which means to fight for your happinessand when you learn that pride is the sum of all virtues you will learn to live like a man as a basic step of selfesteem learn to treat as the mark of a cannibal any mans demand for your help to demand it is to claim that your life is his propertyand loathsome as such claim might be theres something still more loathsome your agreement do you ask if its ever proper to help another man noif he claims it as his right or as a moral duty that you owe him yesif such is your own desire based on your own selfish pleasure in the value of his person and his struggle suffering as such is not a value only mans fight against suffering is if you choose to help a man who suffers do it only on the ground of his virtues of his fight to recover of his rational record or of the fact that he suffers unjustly then your action is still a trade and his virtue is the payment for your help but to help a man who has no virtues to help him on the ground of his suffering as such to accept his faults his need as a claim is to accept the mortgage of a zero on your values a man who has no virtues is a hater of existence who acts on the premise of death to help him is to sanction his evil and to support his career of destruction be it only a penny you will not miss or a kindly smile he has not earned a tribute to a zero is treason to life and to all those who struggle to maintain it it is of such pennies and smiles that the desolation of your world was made do not say that my morality is too hard for you to practice and that you fear it as you fear the unknown whatever living moments you have known were lived by the values of my code but you stifled negated betrayed it you kept sacrificing your virtues to your vices and the best among men to the worst look around you what you have done to society you had done it first within your soul one is the image of the other this dismal wreckage which is now your world is the physical form of the treason you committed to your values to your friends to your defenders to your future to your country to yourself wewhom you are now calling but who will not answer any longerwe had lived among you but you failed to know us you refused to think and to see what we were you failed to recognize the motor i inventedand it became in your world a pile of dead scrap you failed to recognize the hero in your souland you failed to know me when i passed you in the street when you cried in despair for the unattainable spirit which you felt had deserted your world you gave it my name but what you were calling was your own betrayed selfesteem you will not recover one without the other when you failed to give recognition to mans mind and attempted to rule human beings by forcethose who submitted had no mind to surrender those who had were men who dont submit thus the man of productive genius assumed in your world the disguise of a playboy and became a destroyer of wealth choosing to annihilate his fortune rather than surrender it to guns thus the thinker the man of reason assumed in your world the role of a pirate to defend his values by force against your force rather than submit to the rule of brutality do you hear me francisco danconia and ragnar danneskjold my first friends my fellow fighters my fellow outcasts in whose name and honor i speak it was the three of us who started what i am now completing it was the three of us who resolved to avenge this country and to release its imprisoned soul this greatest of countries was built on my moralityon the inviolate supremacy of mans right to existbut you dreaded to admit it and live up to it you stared at an achievement unequaled in history you looted its effects and blanked out its cause in the presence of that monument to human morality which is a factory a highway or a bridgeyou kept damning this country as immoral and its progress as material greed you kept offering apologies for this countrys greatness to the idol of primordial starvation to decaying europes idol of a leprous mystic bum this countrythe product of reasoncould not survive on the morality of sacrifice it was not built by men who sought selfimmolation or by men who sought handouts it could not stand on the mystic split that divorced mans soul from his body it could not live by the mystic doctrine that damned this earth as evil and those who succeeded on earth as depraved from its start this country was a threat to the ancient rule of mystics in the brilliant rocketexplosion of its youth this country displayed to an incredulous world what greatness was possible to man what happiness was possible on earth it was one or the other america or mystics the mystics knew it you didnt you let them infect you with the worship of needand this country became a giant in body with a mooching midget in place of its soul while its living soul was driven underground to labor and feed you in silence unnamed unhonored negated its soul and hero the industrialist do you hear me now hank rearden the greatest of the victims i have avenged neither he nor the rest of us will return until the road is clear to rebuild this countryuntil the wreckage of the morality of sacrifice has been wiped out of our way a countrys political system is based on its code of morality we will rebuild americas system on the moral premise which had been its foundation but which you treated as a guilty underground in your frantic evasion of the conflict between that premise and your mystic morality the premise that man is an end in himself not the means to the ends of others that mans life his freedom his happiness are his by inalienable right you whove lost the concept of a right you who swing in impotent evasiveness between the claim that rights are a gift of god a supernatural gift to be taken on faith or the claim that rights are a gift of society to be broken at its arbitrary whimthe source of mans rights is not divine law or congressional law but the law of identity a is aand man is man rights are conditions of existence required by mans nature for his proper survival if man is to live on earth it is right for him to use his mind it is right to act on his own free judgment it is right to work for his values and to keep the product of his work if life on earth is his purpose he has a right to live as a rational being nature forbids him the irrational any group any gang any nation that attempts to negate mans rights is wrong which means is evil which means is antilife rights are a moral conceptand morality is a matter of choice men are free not to choose mans survival as the standard of their morals and their laws but not free to escape from the fact that the alternative is a cannibal society which exists for a while by devouring its best and collapses like a cancerous body when the healthy have been eaten by the diseased when the rational have been consumed by the irrational such has been the fate of your societies in history but youve evaded the knowledge of the cause i am here to state it the agent of retribution was the law of identity which you cannot escape just as man cannot live by means of the irrational so two men cannot or two thousand or two billion just as man cant succeed by defying reality so a nation cant or a country or a globe a is a the rest is a matter of time provided by the generosity of victims just as man cant exist without his body so no rights can exist without the right to translate ones rights into realityto think to work and to keep the resultswhich means the right of property the modern mystics of muscle who offer you the fraudulent alternative of human rights versus property rights as if one could exist without the other are making a last grotesque attempt to revive the doctrine of soul versus body only a ghost can exist without material property only a slave can work with no right to the product of his effort the doctrine that human rights are superior to property rights simply means that some human beings have the right to make property out of others since the competent have nothing to gain from the incompetent it means the right of the incompetent to own their betters and to use them as productive cattle whoever regards this as human and right has no right to the title of human the source of property rights is the law of causality all property and all forms of wealth are produced by mans mind and labor as you cannot have effects without causes so you cannot have wealth without its source without intelligence you cannot force intelligence to work those whore able to think will not work under compulsion those who will wont produce much more than the price of the whip needed to keep them enslaved you cannot obtain the products of a mind except on the owners terms by trade and by volitional consent any other policy of men toward mans property is the policy of criminals no matter what their numbers criminals are savages who play it short range and starve when their prey runs outjust as youre starving today you who believed that crime could be practical if your government decreed that robbery was legal and resistance to robbery illegal the only proper purpose of a government is to protect mans rights which means to protect him from physical violence a proper government is only a policeman acting as an agent of mans selfdefense and as such may resort to force only against those who start the use of force the only proper functions of a government are the police to protect you from criminals the army to protect you from foreign invaders and the courts to protect your property and contracts from breach or fraud by others to settle disputes by rational rules according to objective law but a government that initiates the employment of force against men who had forced no one the employment of armed compulsion against disarmed victims is a nightmare infernal machine designed to annihilate morality such a government reverses its only moral purpose and switches from the role of protector to the role of mans deadliest enemy from the role of policeman to the role of a criminal vested with the right to the wielding of violence against victims deprived of the right of selfdefense such a government substitutes for morality the following rule of social conduct you may do whatever you please to your neighbor provided your gang is bigger than his only a brute a fool or an evader can agree to exist on such terms or agree to give his fellow men a blank check on his life and his mind to accept the belief that others have the right to dispose of his person at their whim that the will of the majority is omnipotent that the physical force of muscles and numbers is a substitute for justice reality and truth we the men of the mind we who are traders not masters or slaves do not deal in blank checks or grant them we do not live or work with any form of the nonobjective so long as men in the era of savagery had no concept of objective reality and believed that physical nature was ruled by the whim of unknowable demonsno thought no science no production were possible only when men discovered that nature was a firm predictable absolute were they able to rely on their knowledge to choose their course to plan their future and slowly to rise from the cave now you have placed modern industry with its immense complexity of scientific precision back into the power of unknowable demonsthe unpredictable power of the arbitrary whims of hidden ugly little bureaucrats a farmer will not invest the effort of one summer if hes unable to calculate his chances of a harvest but you expect industrial giantswho plan in terms of decades invest in terms of generations and undertake ninetynineyear contractsto continue to function and produce not knowing what random caprice in the skull of what random official will descend upon them at what moment to demolish the whole of their effort drifters and physical laborers live and plan by the range of a day the better the mind the longer the range a man whose vision extends to a shanty might continue to build on your quicksands to grab a fast profit and run a man who envisions skyscrapers will not nor will he give ten years of unswerving devotion to the task of inventing a new product when he knows that gangs of entrenched mediocrity are juggling the laws against him to tie him restrict him and force him to fail but should he fight them and struggle and succeed they will seize his rewards and his invention look past the range of the moment you who cry that you fear to compete with men of superior intelligence that their mind is a threat to your livelihood that the strong leave no chance to the weak in a market of voluntary trade what determines the material value of your work nothing but the productive effort of your mindif you lived on a desert island the less efficient the thinking of your brain the less your physical labor would bring youand you could spend your life on a single routine collecting a precarious harvest or hunting with bow and arrows unable to think any further but when you live in a rational society where men are free to trade you receive an incalculable bonus the material value of your work is determined not only by your effort but by the effort of the best productive minds who exist in the world around you when you work in a modern factory you are paid not only for your labor but for all the productive genius which has made that factory possible for the work of the industrialist who built it for the work of the investor who saved the money to risk on the untried and the new for the work of the engineer who designed the machines of which you are pushing the levers for the work of the inventor who created the product which you spend your time on making for the work of the scientist who discovered the laws that went into the making of that product for the work of the philosopher who taught men how to think and whom you spend your time denouncing the machine the frozen form of a living intelligence is the power that expands the potential of your life by raising the productivity of your time if you worked as a blacksmith in the mystics middle ages the whole of your earning capacity would consist of an iron bar produced by your hands in days and days of effort how many tons of rail do you produce per day if you work for hank rearden would you dare to claim that the size of your pay check was created solely by your physical labor and that those rails were the product of your muscles the standard of living of that blacksmith is all that your muscles are worth the rest is a gift from hank rearden every man is free to rise as far as hes able or willing but its only the degree to which he thinks that determines the degree to which hell rise physical labor as such can extend no further than the range of the moment the man who does no more than physical labor consumes the material valueequivalent of his own contribution to the process of production and leaves no further value neither for himself nor others but the man who produces an idea in any field of rational endeavorthe man who discovers new knowledgeis the permanent benefactor of humanity material products cant be shared they belong to some ultimate consumer it is only the value of an idea that can be shared with unlimited numbers of men making all sharers richer at no ones sacrifice or loss raising the productive capacity of whatever labor they perform it is the value of his own time that the strong of the intellect transfers to the weak letting them work on the jobs he discovered while devoting his time to further discoveries this is mutual trade to mutual advantage the interests of the mind are one no matter what the degree of intelligence among men who desire to work and dont seek or expect the unearned in proportion to the mental energy he spent the man who creates a new invention receives but a small percentage of his value in terms of material payment no matter what fortune he makes no matter what millions he earns but the man who works as a janitor in the factory producing that invention receives an enormous payment in proportion to the mental effort that his job requires of him and the same is true of all men between on all levels of ambition and ability the man at the top of the intellectual pyramid contributes the most to all those below him but gets nothing except his material payment receiving no intellectual bonus from others to add to the value of his time the man at the bottom who left to himself would starve in his hopeless ineptitude contributes nothing to those above him but receives the bonus of all of their brains such is the nature of the competition between the strong and the weak of the intellect such is the pattern of exploitation for which you have damned the strong such was the service we had given you and were glad and willing to give what did we ask in return nothing but freedom we required that you leave us free to functionfree to think and to work as we choosefree to take our own risks and to bear our own lossesfree to earn our own profits and to make our own fortunesfree to gamble on your rationality to submit our products to your judgment for the purpose of a voluntary trade to rely on the objective value of our work and on your minds ability to see itfree to count on your intelligence and honesty and to deal with nothing but your mind such was the price we asked which you chose to reject as too high you decided to call it unfair that we who had dragged you out of your hovels and provided you with modern apartments with radios movies and cars should own our palaces and yachtsyou decided that you had a right to your wages but we had no right to our profits that you did not want us to deal with your mind but to deal instead with your gun our answer to that was may you be damned our answer came true you are you did not care to compete in terms of intelligenceyou are now competing in terms of brutality you did not care to allow rewards to be won by successful productionyou are now running a race in which rewards are won by successful plunder you called it selfish and cruel that men should trade value for valueyou have now established an unselfish society where they trade extortion for extortion your system is a legal civil war where men gang up on one another and struggle for possession of the law which they use as a club over rivals till another gang wrests it from their clutch and clubs them with it in their turn all of them clamoring protestations of service to an unnamed publics unspecified good you had said that you saw no difference between economic and political power between the power of money and the power of gunsno difference between reward and punishment no difference between purchase and plunder no difference between pleasure and fear no difference between life and death you are learning the difference now some of you might plead the excuse of your ignorance of a limited mind and a limited range but the damned and the guiltiest among you are the men who had the capacity to know yet chose to blank out reality the men who were willing to sell their intelligence into cynical servitude to force the contemptible breed of those mystics of science who profess a devotion to some sort of pure knowledgethe purity consisting of their claim that such knowledge has no practical purpose on this earthwho reserve their logic for inanimate matter but believe that the subject of dealing with men requires and deserves no rationality who scorn money and sell their souls in exchange for a laboratory supplied by loot and since there is no such thing as nonpractical knowledge or any sort of disinterested action since they scorn the use of their science for the purpose and profit of life they deliver their science to the service of death to the only practical purpose it can ever have for looters to inventing weapons of coercion and destruction they the intellects who seek escape from moral values they are the damned on this earth theirs is the guilt beyond forgiveness do you hear me dr robert stadler but it is not to him that i wish to speak i am speaking to those among you who have retained some sovereign shred of their soul unsold and unstamped to the order of others if in the chaos of the motives that have made you listen to the radio tonight there was an honest rational desire to learn what is wrong with the world you are the man whom i wished to address by the rules and terms of my code one owes a rational statement to those whom it does concern and whore making an effort to know those whore making an effort to fail to understand me are not a concern of mine i am speaking to those who desire to live and to recapture the honor of their soul now that you know the truth about your world stop supporting your own destroyers the evil of the world is made possible by nothing but the sanction you give it withdraw your sanction withdraw your support do not try to live on your enemies terms or to win at a game where theyre setting the rules do not seek the favor of those who enslaved you do not beg for alms from those who have robbed you be it subsidies loans or jobs do not join their team to recoup what theyve taken by helping them rob your neighbors one cannot hope to maintain ones life by accepting bribes to condone ones destruction do not struggle for profit success or security at the price of a lien on your right to exist such a lien is not to be paid off the more you pay them the more they will demand the greater the values you seek or achieve the more vulnerably helpless you become theirs is a system of white blackmail devised to bleed you not by means of your sins but by means of your love for existence do not attempt to rise on the looters terms or to climb a ladder while theyre holding the ropes do not allow their hands to touch the only power that keeps them in power your living ambition go on strikein the manner i did use your mind and skill in private extend your knowledge develop your ability but do not share your achievements with others do not try to produce a fortune with a looter riding on your back stay on the lowest rung of their ladder earn no more than your barest survival do not make an extra penny to support the looters state since youre captive act as a captive do not help them pretend that youre free be the silent incorruptible enemy they dread when they force you obeybut do not volunteer never volunteer a step in their direction or a wish or a plea or a purpose do not help a holdup man to claim that he acts as your friend and benefactor do not help your jailers to pretend that their jail is your natural state of existence do not help them to fake reality that fake is the only dam holding off their secret terror the terror of knowing theyre unfit to exist remove it and let them drown your sanction is their only life belt if you find a chance to vanish into some wilderness out of their reach do so but not to exist as a bandit or to create a gang competing with their racket build a productive life of your own with those who accept your moral code and are willing to struggle for a human existence you have no chance to win on the morality of death or by the code of faith and force raise a standard to which the honest will repair the standard of life and reason act as a rational being and aim at becoming a rallying point for all those who are starved for a voice of integrityact on your rational values whether alone in the midst of your enemies or with a few of your chosen friends or as the founder of a modest community on the frontier of mankinds rebirth when the looters state collapses deprived of the best of its slaves when it falls to a level of impotent chaos like the mysticridden nations of the orient and dissolves into starving robber gangs fighting to rob one anotherwhen the advocates of the morality of sacrifice perish with their final idealthen and on that day we will return we will open the gates of our city to those who deserve to enter a city of smokestacks pipe lines orchards markets and inviolate homes we will act as the rallying center for such hidden outposts as youll build with the sign of the dollar as our symbolthe sign of free trade and free mindswe will move to reclaim this country once more from the impotent savages who never discovered its nature its meaning its splendor those who choose to join us will join us those who dont will not have the power to stop us hordes of savages have never been an obstacle to men who carried the banner of the mind then this country will once more become a sanctuary for a vanishing species the rational being the political system we will build is contained in a single moral premise no man may obtain any values from others by resorting to physical force every man will stand or fall live or die by his rational judgment if he fails to use it and falls he will be his only victim if he fears that his judgment is inadequate he will not be given a gun to improve it if he chooses to correct his errors in time he will have the unobstructed example of his betters for guidance in learning to think but an end will be put to the infamy of paying with one life for the errors of another in that world youll be able to rise in the morning with the spirit you had known in your childhood that spirit of eagerness adventure and certainty which comes from dealing with a rational universe no child is afraid of nature it is your fear of men that will vanish the fear that has stunted your soul the fear you acquired in your early encounters with the incomprehensible the unpredictable the contradictory the arbitrary the hidden the faked the irrational in men you will live in a world of responsible beings who will be as consistent and reliable as facts the guarantee of their character will be a system of existence where objective reality is the standard and the judge your virtues will be given protection your vices and weaknesses will not every chance will be open to your good none will be provided for your evil what youll receive from men will not be alms or pity or mercy or forgiveness of sins but a single value justice and when youll look at men or at yourself you will feel not disgust suspicion and guilt but a single constant respect such is the future you are capable of winning it requires a struggle so does any human value all life is a purposeful struggle and your only choice is the choice of a goal do you wish to continue the battle of your present or do you wish to fight for my world do you wish to continue a struggle that consists of clinging to precarious ledges in a sliding descent to the abyss a struggle where the hardships you endure are irreversible and the victories you win bring you closer to destruction or do you wish to undertake a struggle that consists of rising from ledge to ledge in a steady ascent to the top a struggle where the hardships are investments in your future and the victories bring you irreversibly closer to the world of your moral ideal and should you die without reaching full sunlight you will die on a level touched by its rays such is the choice before you let your mind and your love of existence decide the last of my words will be addressed to those heroes who might still be hidden in the world those who are held prisoner not by their evasions but by their virtues and their desperate courage my brothers in spirit check on your virtues and on the nature of the enemies youre serving your destroyers hold you by means of your endurance your generosity your innocence your lovethe endurance that carries their burdensthe generosity that responds to their cries of despairthe innocence that is unable to conceive of their evil and gives them the benefit of every doubt refusing to condemn them without understanding and incapable of understanding such motives as theirsthe love your love of life which makes you believe that they are men and that they love it too but the world of today is the world they wanted life is the object of their hatred leave them to the death they worship in the name of your magnificent devotion to this earth leave them dont exhaust the greatness of your soul on achieving the triumph of the evil of theirs do you hear me my love in the name of the best within you do not sacrifice this world to those who are its worst in the name of the values that keep you alive do not let your vision of man be distorted by the ugly the cowardly the mindless in those who have never achieved his title do not lose your knowledge that mans proper estate is an upright posture an intransigent mind and a step that travels unlimited roads do not let your fire go out spark by irreplaceable spark in the hopeless swamps of the approximate the notquite the notyet the notatall do not let the hero in your soul perish in lonely frustration for the life you deserved but have never been able to reach check your road and the nature of your battle the world you desired can be won it exists it is real it is possible its yours but to win it requires your total dedication and a total break with the world of your past with the doctrine that man is a sacrificial animal who exists for the pleasure of others fight for the value of your person fight for the virtue of your pride fight for the essence of that which is man for his sovereign rational mind fight with the radiant certainty and the absolute rectitude of knowing that yours is the morality of life and that yours is the battle for any achievement any value any grandeur any goodness any joy that has ever existed on this earth you will win when you are ready to pronounce the oath i have taken at the start of my battleand for those who wish to know the day of my return i shall now repeat it to the hearing of the world i swearby my life and my love of itthat i will never live for the sake of another man nor ask another man to live for mine chapter viii the egoist it wasnt real was it said mr thompson they stood in front of the radio as the last sound of galts voice had left them no one had moved through the span of silence they had stood looking at the radio as if waiting but the radio was now only a wooden box with some knobs and a circle of cloth stretched over an empty loudspeaker we seem to have heard it said tinky holloway we couldnt help it said chick morrison mr thompson was sitting on a crate the pale oblong smear at the level of his elbow was the face of wesley mouch who was seated on the floor far behind them like an island in the vast semidarkness of the studio space the drawing room prepared for their broadcast stood deserted and fully lighted a semicircle of empty armchairs under a cobweb of dead microphones in the glare of the floodlights which no one had taken the initiative to turn off mr thompsons eyes were darting over the faces around him as if in search of some special vibrations known only to him the rest of them were trying to do it surreptitiously each attempting to catch a glimpse of the others without letting them catch his own glance let me out of here screamed a young thirdrate assistant suddenly and to no one in particular stay put snapped mr thompson the sound of his own order and the hiccoughmoan of the figure immobilized somewhere in the darkness seemed to help him recapture a familiar version of reality his head emerged an inch higher from his shoulders who permitted it to hap he began in a rising voice but stopped the vibrations he caught were the dangerous panic of the cornered what do you make of it he asked instead there was no answer well he waited well say something somebody we dont have to believe it do we cried james taggart thrusting his face toward mr thompson in a manner that was almost a threat do we taggarts face was distorted his features seemed shapeless a mustache of small beads sparkled between his nose and mouth pipe down said mr thompson uncertainly drawing a little away from him we dont have to believe it taggarts voice had the flat insistent sound of an effort to maintain a trance nobodys ever said it before its just one man we dont have to believe it take it easy said mr thompson why is he so sure hes right who is he to go against the whole world against everything ever said for centuries and centuries who is he to know nobody can be sure nobody can know whats right there isnt any right shut up yelled mr thompson what are you trying to the blast that stopped him was a military march leaping suddenly forth from the radio receiverthe military march interrupted three hours ago played by the familiar screeches of a studio record it took them a few stunned seconds to grasp it while the cheerful thumping chords went goosestepping through the silence sounding grotesquely irrelevant like the mirth of a halfwit the stations program director was blindly obeying the absolute that no radio time was ever to be left blank tell them to cut it off screamed wesley mouch leaping to his feet it will make the public think that we authorized that speech you damn fool cried mr thompson would you rather have the public think that we didnt mouch stopped short and his eyes shot to mr thompson with the appreciative glance of an amateur at a master broadcasts as usual ordered mr thompson tell them to go on with whatever programs theyd scheduled for this hour no special announcements no explanations tell them to go on as if nothing had happened half a dozen of chick morrisons morale conditioners went scurrying off toward telephones muzzle the commentators dont allow them to comment send word to every station in the country let the public wonder dont let them think that were worried dont let them think that its important no screamed eugene lawson no no no we cant give people the impression that were endorsing that speech its horrible horrible horrible lawson was not in tears but his voice had the undignified sound of an adult sobbing with helpless rage whos said anything about endorsing it snapped mr thompson its horrible its immoral its selfish heartless ruthless its the most vicious speech ever made it it will make people demand to be happy its only a speech said mr thompson not too firmly it seems to me said chick morrison his voice tentatively helpful that people of nobler spiritual nature you know what i mean people of of well of mystical insighthe paused as if waiting to be slapped but no one moved so he repeated firmlyyes of mystical insight wont go for that speech logic isnt everything after all the workingmen wont go for it said tinky holloway a bit more helpfully he didnt sound like a friend of labor the women of the country wont go for it declared ma chalmers it is i believe an established fact that women dont go for that stuff about the mind women have finer feelings you can count on the women you can count on the scientists said dr simon pritchett they were all pressing forward suddenly eager to speak as if they had found a subject they could handle with assurance scientists know better than to believe in reason hes no friend of the scientists hes no friend of anybody said wesley mouch recapturing a shade of confidence at the sudden realization except maybe of big business no cried mr mowen in terror no dont accuse us dont say it i wont have you say it what that that that anybody is a friend of business dont lets make a fuss about that speech said dr floyd ferris it was too intellectual much too intellectual for the common man it will have no effect people are too dumb to understand it yeah said mouch hopefully thats so in the first place said dr ferris encouraged people cant think in the second place they dont want to in the third place said fred kinnan they dont want to starve and what do you propose to do about that it was as if he had pronounced the question which all of the preceding utterances had been intended to stave off no one answered him but heads drew faintly deeper into shoulders and figures drew faintly closer to one another like a small cluster under the weight of the studios empty space the military march boomed through the silence with the inflexible gaiety of a grinning skull turn it off yelled mr thompson waving at the radio turn that damn thing off someone obeyed him but the sudden silence was worse well said mr thompson at last raising his eyes reluctantly to fred kinnan what do you think we ought to do who me chuckled kinnan i dont run this show mr thompson slammed his fist down on his knee say something he ordered but seeing kinnan turn away added somebody there were no volunteers what are we to do he yelled knowing that the man who answered would thereafter be the man in power what are we to do cant somebody tell us what to do i can t it was a womans voice but it had the quality of the voice they had heard on the radio they whirled to dagny before she had time to step forward from the darkness beyond the group as she stepped forward her face frightened thembecause it was devoid of fear i can she said addressing mr thompson youre to give up give up he repeated blankly youre through dont you see that youre through what else do you need after what youve heard give up and get out of the way leave men free to exist he was looking at her neither objecting nor moving youre still alive youre using a human language youre asking for answers youre counting on reasonyoure still counting on reason god damn you youre able to understand it isnt possible that you havent understood theres nothing you can now pretend to hope to want or gain or grab or reach theres nothing but destruction ahead the worlds and your own give up and get out they were listening intently but as if they did not hear her words as if they were clinging blindly to a quality she was alone among them to possess the quality of being alive there was a sound of exultant laughter under the angry violence of her voice her face was lifted her eyes seemed to be greeting some spectacle at an incalculable distance so that the glowing patch on her forehead did not look like the reflection of a studio spotlight but of a sunrise you wish to live dont you get out of the way if you want a chance let those who can take over he knows what to do you dont he is able to create the means of human survival you arent dont listen to her it was so savage a cry of hatred that they drew away from dr robert stadler as if he had given voice to the unconfessed within them his face looked as they feared theirs would look in the privacy of darkness dont listen to her he cried his eyes avoiding hers while hers paused on him for a brief level glance that began as a shock of astonishment and ended as an obituary its your life or his keep quiet professor said mr thompson brushing him off with the jerk of one hand mr thompsons eyes were watching dagny as if some thought were struggling to take shape inside his skull you know the truth all of you she said and so do i and so does every man whos heard john galt what else are you waiting for for proof hes given it to you for facts theyre all around you how many corpses do you intend to pile up before you renounce ityour guns your power your controls and the whole of your miserable altruistic creed give it up if you want to live give it up if theres anything left in your mind thats still able to want human beings to remain alive on this earth but its treason cried eugene lawson shes talking pure treason now now said mr thompson you dont have to go to extremes huh asked tinky holloway but but surely its outrageous asked chick morrison youre not agreeing with her are you asked wesley mouch whos said anything about agreeing said mr thompson his tone surprisingly placid dont be premature just dont you be premature any of you theres no harm in listening to any argument is there that kind of argument asked wesley mouch his finger stabbing again and again in dagnys direction any kind said mr thompson placidly we mustnt be intolerant but its treason ruin disloyalty selfishness and bigbusiness propaganda oh i dont know said mr thompson weve got to keep an open mind weve got to give consideration to every ones viewpoint she might have something there he knows what to do weve got to be flexible do you mean that youre willing to quit gasped mouch now dont jump to conclusions snapped mr thompson angrily if theres one thing i cant stand its people who jump to conclusions and another thing is ivorytower intellectuals who stick to some pet theory and havent any sense of practical reality at a time like this weve got to be flexible above all he saw a look of bewilderment on all the faces around him on dagnys and on the others though not for the same reasons he smiled rose to his feet and turned to dagny thank you miss taggart he said thank you for speaking your mind thats what i want you to knowthat you can trust me and speak to me with full frankness were not your enemies miss taggart dont pay any attention to the boystheyre upset but theyll come down to earth were not your enemies nor the countrys sure weve made mistakes were only human but were trying to do our best for the peoplethat is i mean for everybodyin these difficult times we cant make snap judgments and reach momentous decisions on the spur of the moment can we weve got to consider it and mull it over and weigh it carefully i just want you to remember that were not anybodys enemiesyou realize that dont you ive said everything i had to say she answered turning away from him with no clue to the meaning of his words and no strength to attempt to find it she turned to eddie willers who had watched the men around them with a look of so great an indignation that he seemed paralyzed as if his brain were crying its evil and could not move to any further thought she jerked her head indicating the door he followed her obediently dr robert stadler waited until the door had closed after them then whirled on mr thompson you bloody fool do you know what youre playing with dont you understand that its life or death that its you or him the thin tremor that ran along mr thompsons lips was a smile of contempt its a funny way for a professor to behave i didnt think professors ever went to pieces dont you understand dont you see that its one or the other and what is it that you want me to do you must kill him it was the fact that dr stadler had not cried it but had said it in a flat cold suddenly and fully conscious voice that brought a chill moment of silence as the whole rooms answer you must find him said dr stadler his voice cracking and rising once more you must leave no stone unturned till you find him and destroy him if he lives hell destroy all of us if he lives we cant how am i to find him asked mr thompson speaking slowly and carefully i i can tell you i can give you a lead watch that taggart woman set your men to watch every move she makes shell lead you to him sooner or later how do you know that isnt it obvious isnt it sheer chance that she hasnt deserted you long ago dont you have the wits to see that shes one of his kind he did not state what kind yeah said mr thompson thoughtfully yeah thats true he jerked his head up with a smile of satisfaction the professors got something there put a tail on miss taggart he ordered snapping his fingers at mouch have her tailed day and night weve got to find him yes sir said mouch blankly and when you find him dr stadler asked tensely youll kill him kill him you damn fool we need him cried mr thompson mouch waited but no one ventured the question that was on everyones mind so he made the effort to utter stiffly i dont understand you mr thompson oh you theoretical intellectuals said mr thompson with exasperation what are you all gaping at its simple whoever he is hes a man of action besides hes got a pressure group hes cornered all the men of brains he knows what to do well find him and hell tell us hell tell us what to do hell make things work hell pull us out of the hole us mr thompson sure never mind your theories well make a deal with him with him sure oh well have to compromise well have to make a few concessions to big business and the welfare boys wont like it but what the helldo you know any other way out but his ideas who cares about ideas mr thompson said mouch choking i im afraid hes a man whos not open to a deal theres no such thing said mr thompson a cold wind rattled the broken signs over the windows of abandoned shops in the street outside the radio station the city seemed abnormally quiet the distant rumble of the traffic sounded lower than usual and made the wind sound louder empty sidewalks stretched off into the darkness a few lone figures stood in whispering clusters under the rare lights eddie willers did not speak until they were many blocks away from the station he stopped abruptly when they reached a deserted square where the public loudspeakers which no one had thought of turning off were now broadcasting a domestic comedythe shrill voices of a husband and wife quarreling over juniors datesto an empty stretch of pavement enclosed by unlighted house fronts beyond the square a few dots of light scattered vertically above the twenty fifthfloor limit of the city suggested a distant rising form which was the taggart building eddie stopped and pointed at the building his finger shaking dagny he cried then lowered his voice involuntarily dagny he whispered i know him he he works there there he kept pointing at the building with incredulous helplessness he works for taggart transcontinental i know she answered her voice was a lifeless monotone as a track laborer as the lowest of track laborers i know ive talked to him ive been talking to him for years in the terminal cafeteria he used to ask questions all sorts of questions about the railroad and igod dagny was i protecting the railroad or was i helping to destroy it both neither it doesnt matter now i could have staked my life that he loved the railroad he does but hes destroyed it yes she tightened the collar of her coat and walked on against a gust of wind i used to talk to him he said after a while his face dagny it didnt look like any of the others it it showed that he understood so much i was glad whenever i saw him there in the cafeteria i just talked i dont think i knew that he was asking questions but he was so many questions about the railroad and and about you did he ever ask you what i look like when im asleep yes yes he did id found you once asleep in the office and when i mentioned it he he stopped as a sudden connection crashed into place in his mind she turned to him in the ray of a street lamp raising and holding her face in full light for a silent deliberate moment as if in answer and confirmation of his thought he closed his eyes oh god dagny he whispered they walked on in silence hes gone by now isnt he he asked from the taggart terminal i mean eddie she said her voice suddenly grim if you value his life dont ever ask that question you dont want them to find him do you dont give them any leads dont ever breathe a word to anyone about having known him dont try to find out whether hes still working in the terminal you dont mean that hes still there i dont know i know only that he might be now yes still yes keep quiet about it if you dont want to destroy him i think hes gone he wont be back i havent seen him since since since when she asked sharply the end of may the night when you left for utah remember he paused as the memory of that nights encounter and the full understanding of its meaning struck him together he said with effort saw him that night not since ive waited for him in the cafeteria he never came back i dont think hell let you see him now hell keep out of your way bat dont look for him dont inquire its funny i dont even know what name he used it was johnny something or it was john galt she said with a faint mirthless chuckle dont look at the terminal payroll the name is still there just like that all these years for twelve years just like that and its still there now yes after a moment he said it proves nothing i know the personnel office hasnt taken a single name off the payroll list since directive if a man quits they give his name and job to a starving friend of their own rather than report it to the unification board dont question the personnel office or anyone dont call attention to his name if you or i make any inquiries about him somebody might begin to wonder dont look for him dont make any move in his direction and if you ever catch sight of him by chance act as if you didnt know him he nodded after a while he said his voice tense and low i wouldnt turn him over to them not even to save the railroad eddie yes if you ever catch sight of him tell me he nodded two blocks later he asked quietly youre going to quit one of these days and vanish arent you why do you say that it was almost a cry arent you she did not answer at once when she did the sound of despair was present in her voice only in the form of too tight a monotone eddie if i quit what would happen to the taggart trains there would be no taggart trains within a week maybe less there will be no looters government within ten days then men like cuffy meigs will devour the last of our rails and engines should i lose the battle by failing to wait one more moment how can i let it gotaggart transcontinental eddiego forever when one last effort can still keep it in existence if ive stood things this long i can stand them a little longer just a little longer im not helping the looters nothing can help them now what are they going to do i dont know what can they do theyre finished i suppose so didnt you see them theyre miserable panicstricken rats running for their lives does it mean anything to them what their lives theyre still struggling arent they but theyre through and they know it have they ever acted on what they know theyll have to theyll give up it wont be long and well be here to save whatevers left mr thompson wishes it to be known said official broadcasts on the morning of november that there is no cause for alarm he urges the public not to draw any hasty conclusions we must preserve our discipline our morale our unity and our sense of broadminded tolerance the unconventional speech which some of you might have heard on the radio last night was a thoughtprovoking contribution to our pool of ideas on world problems we must consider it soberly avoiding the extremes of total condemnation or of reckless agreement we must regard it as one viewpoint out of many in our democratic forum of public opinion which as last night has proved is open to all the truth says mr thompson has many facets we must remain impartial theyre silent wrote chick morrison as a summary of its content across the report from one of the field agents he had sent out on a mission entitled public pulse taking theyre silent he wrote across the next report then across another and another silence he wrote with a frown of uneasiness summing up his report to mr thompson people seem to be silent the flames that went up to the sky of a winter night and devoured a home in wyoming were not seen by the people of kansas who watched a trembling red glow on the prairie horizon made by the flames that went up to devour a farm and the glow was not reflected by the windows of a street in pennsylvania where the twisting red tongues were reflections of the flames that went up to devour a factory nobody mentioned next morning that those flames had not been set off by chance and that the owners of the three places had vanished neighbors observed it without commentand without astonishment a few homes were found abandoned in random corners across the nation some left locked shuttered and empty others open and gutted of all movable goodsbut people watched it in silence and through the snowdrifts of untended streets in the haze of premorning darkness went on trudging to their jobs a little slower than usual then on november a speaker at a political meeting in cleveland was beaten up and had to escape by scurrying down dark alleys his silent audience had come to sudden life when he had shouted that the cause of all their troubles was their selfish concern with their own troubles on the morning of november the workers of a shoe factory in massachusetts were astonished on entering their workshop to find that the foreman was late but they went to their usual posts and went on with their habitual routine pulling levers pressing buttons feeding leather into automatic cutters piling boxes on a moving belt wondering as the hours went by why they did not catch sight of the foreman or the superintendent or the general manager or the company president it was noon before they discovered that the front offices of the plant were empty you goddamn cannibals screamed a woman in the midst of a crowded movie theater breaking into sudden hysterical sobsand the audience showed no sign of astonishment as if she were screaming for them all there is no cause for alarm said official broadcasts on december mr thompson wishes it to be known that he is willing to negotiate with john galt for the purpose of devising ways and means to achieve a speedy solution of our problems mr thompson urges the people to be patient we must not worry we must not doubt we must not lose heart the attendants of a hospital in illinois showed no astonishment when a man was brought in beaten up by his elder brother who had supported him all his life the younger man had screamed at the elder accusing him of selfishness and greedjust as the attendants of a hospital in new york city showed no astonishment at the case of a woman who came in with a fractured jaw she had been slapped in the face by a total stranger who had heard her ordering her fiveyear old son to give his best toy to the children of neighbors chick morrison attempted a whistlestop tour to buttress the countrys morale by speeches on selfsacrifice for the general welfare he was stoned at the first of his stops and had to return to washington nobody had ever granted them the title of the better men or granting it had paused to grasp that titles meaning but everybody knew each in his own community neighborhood office or shop and hi his own unidentified terms who would be the men that would now fail to appear at their posts on some coming morning and would silently vanish in search of unknown frontiersthe men whose faces were tighter than the faces around them whose eyes were more direct whose energy was more conscientiously enduringthe men who were now slipping away one by one from every corner of the countryof the country which was now like the descendant of what had once been regal glory prostrated by the scourge of hemophilia losing the best of its blood from a wound not to be healed but were willing to negotiate yelled mr thompson to his assistants ordering the special announcement to be repeated by all radio stations three times a day were willing to negotiate hell hear it hell answer special listeners were ordered to keep watch day and night at radio receivers tuned to every known frequency of sound waiting for an answer from an unknown transmitter there was no answer empty hopeless unfocused faces were becoming more apparent in the streets of the cities but no one could read their meaning as some men were escaping with their bodies into the underground of uninhabited regions so others could only save their souls and were escaping into the underground of their mindsand no power on earth could tell whether their blankly indifferent eyes were shutters protecting hidden treasures at the bottom of shafts no longer to be mined or were merely gaping holes of the parasites emptiness never to be filled i dont know what to do said the assistant superintendent of an oil refinery refusing to accept the job of the superintendent who had vanishedand the agents of the unification board were unable to tell whether he lied or not it was only an edge of precision in the tone of his voice an absence of apology or shame that made them wonder whether he was a rebel or a fool it was dangerous to force the job on either give us men the plea began to hammer progressively louder upon the desk of the unification board from all parts of a country ravaged by unemployment and neither the pleaders nor the board dared to add the dangerous words which the cry was implying give us men of ability there were waiting lines years long for the jobs of janitors greasers porters and bus boys there was no one to apply for the jobs of executives managers superintendents engineers the explosions of oil refineries the crashes of defective airplanes the breakouts of blast furnaces the wrecks of colliding trains and the rumors of drunken orgies in the offices of newly created executives made the members of the board fear the kind of men who did apply for the positions of responsibility dont despair dont give up said official broadcasts on december and on every day thereafter we will reach an agreement with john galt we will get him to lead us he will solve all our problems he will make things work dont give up we will get john galt rewards and honors were offered to applicants for managerial jobs then to forementhen to skilled mechanicsthen to any man who would make an effort to deserve a promotion in rank wage raises bonuses tax exemptions and a medal devised by wesley mouch to be known as the order of public benefactors it brought no results ragged people listened to the offers of material comforts and turned away with lethargic indifference as if they had lost the concept of value these thought the publicpulsetakers with terror were men who did not care to liveor men who did not care to live on present terms dont despair dont give up john galt will solve our problems said the radio voices of official broadcasts traveling through the silence of falling snow into the silence of unheated homes dont tell them that we havent got him cried mr thompson to his assistants but for gods sake tell them to find him squads of chick morrisons boys were assigned to the task of manufacturing rumors half of them went spreading the story that john galt was in washington and in conference with government officialswhile the other half went spreading the story that the government would give five hundred thousand dollars as reward for information that would help to find john galt no not a clue said wesley mouch to mr thompson summing up the reports of the special agents who had been sent to check on every man by the name of john galt throughout the country theyre a shabby lot theres a john galt whos a professor of ornithology eighty years old theres a retired greengrocer with a wife and nine childrentheres an unskilled railroad laborer whos held the same job for twelve yearsand other such trash dont despair we will get john galt said official broadcasts in the daytimebut at night every hour on the hour by a secret official order an appeal was sent from shortwave transmitters into the empty reaches of space calling john galt calling john galt are you listening john galt we wish to negotiate we wish to confer with you give us word on where you can be reached do you hear us john galt there was no answer the wads of worthless paper money were growing heavier in the pockets of the nation but there was less and less for that money to buy in september a bushel of wheat had cost eleven dollars it had cost thirty dollars in november it had cost one hundred in december it was now approaching the price of two hundredwhile the printing presses of the government treasury were running a race with starvation and losing when the workers of a factory beat up their foreman and wrecked the machinery in a fit of despair no action could be taken against them arrests were futile the jails were full the arresting officers winked at their prisoners and let them escape on then way to prisonmen were going through the motions prescribed for the moment with no thought of the moment to follow no action could be taken when mobs of starving people attacked warehouses on the outskirts of cities no action could be taken when punitive squadrons joined the people they had been sent to punish are you listening john galt we wish to negotiate we might meet your terms are you listening there were whispered rumors of covered wagons traveling by night through abandoned trails and of secret settlements armed to resist the attacks of those whom they called the indiansthe attacks of any looting savages be they homeless mobs or government agents lights were seen once in a while on the distant horizon of a prairie in the hills on the ledges of mountains where no buildings had been known to exist but no soldiers could be persuaded to investigate the sources of those lights on the doors of abandoned houses on the gates of crumbling factories on the walls of government buildings there appeared once in a while traced in chalk in paint in blood the curving mark which was the sign of the dollar can you hear us john galt send us word name your terms we will meet any terms you set can you hear us there was no answer the shaft of red smoke that shot to the sky on the night of january and stood abnormally still for a while like a solemn memorial obelisk then wavered and swept back and forth across the sky like a searchlight sending some undecipherable message then went out as abruptly as it had come marked the end of rearden steelbut the inhabitants of the area did not know it they learned it only on subsequent nights when theywho had cursed the mills for the smoke the fumes the soot and the noiselooked out and instead of the glow pulsating with life on their familiar horizon they saw a black void the mills had been nationalized as the property of a deserter the first bearer of the title of peoples manager appointed to run the mills had been a man of the orren boyle faction a pudgy hangeron of the metallurgical industry who had wanted nothing but to follow his employees while going through the motions of leading but at the end of a month after too many clashes with the workers too many occasions when his only answer had been that he couldnt help it too many undelivered orders too many telephonic pressures from his buddies he had begged to be transferred to some other position the orren boyle faction had been falling apart since mr boyle had been confined to a rest home where his doctor had forbidden him any contact with business and had put him to the job of weaving baskets as a means of occupational therapy the second peoples manager sent to rearden steel had belonged to the faction of cuffy meigs he had worn leather leggings and perfumed hair lotions he had come to work with a gun on his hip he had kept snapping that discipline was his primary goal and that by god hed get it or else the only discernible rule of the discipline had been his order forbidding all questions after weeks of frantic activity on the part of insurance companies of firemen of ambulances and of firstaid units attending to a series of inexplicable accidentsthe peoples manager had vanished one morning having sold and shipped to sundry racketeers of europe and latin america most of the cranes the automatic conveyors the supplies of refractory brick the emergency power generator and the carpet from what had once been reardens office no one had been able to untangle the issues in the violent chaos of the next few daysthe issues had never been named the sides had remained unacknowledged but everyone had known that the bloody encounters between the older workers and the newer had not been driven to such ferocious intensity by the trivial causes that kept setting them offneither guards nor policemen nor state troopers had been able to keep order for the length of a daynor could any faction muster a candidate willing to accept the post of peoples manager on january the operations of rearden steel had been ordered temporarily suspended the shaft of red smoke that night had been caused by a sixtyyear old worker who had set fire to one of the structures and had been caught in the act laughing dazedly and staring at the flames to avenge hank rearden he had cried defiantly tears running down his furnacetanned face dont let it hurt you like thisthought dagny slumped across her desk over the page of the newspaper where a single brief paragraph announced the temporary end of rearden steeldont let it hurt you so much she kept seeing the face of hank rearden as he had stood at the window of his office watching a crane move against the sky with a load of greenblue rail dont let it hurt him like this was the plea in her mind addressed to no onedont let him hear of it dont let him know then she saw another face a face with unflinching green eyes saying to her in a voice made implacable by the quality of respect for facts youll have to hear about it youll hear about every wreck youll hear about every discontinued train nobody stays in this valley by faking reality in any manner whatever then she sat still with no sight and no sound in her mind with nothing but that enormous presence which was pain until she heard the familiar cry that had become a drug killing all sensations except the capacity to act miss taggart we dont know what to doand she shot to her feet to answer the peoples state of guatemala said the newspapers on january declines the request of the united states for the loan of a thousand tons of steel on the night of february a young pilot was flying his usual route a weeklyflight from dallas to new york city when he reached the empty darkness beyond philadelphiain the place where the flames of rearden steel had for years been his favorite landmark his greeting in the loneliness of night the beacon of a living earthhe saw a snowcovered spread deadwhite and phosphorescent in the starlight a spread of peaks and craters that looked like the surface of the moon he quit his job next morning through the frozen nights over dying cities knocking in vain at unanswering windows beating on unechoing walls rising above the roofs of lightless buildings and the skeletal girders of ruins the plea went on crying through space crying to the stationary motion of the stars to the heatless fire of their twinkling can you hear us john galt can you hear us miss taggart we dont know what to do said mr thompson he had summoned her to a personal conference on one of his scurrying trips to new york were ready to give in to meet his terms to let him take overbut where is he for the third time she said her face and voice shut tight against any fissure of emotion i do not know where he is what made you think i did well i didnt know i had to try i thought just in case i thought maybe if you had a way to reach him i havent you see we cant announce not even by shortwave radio that were willing to surrender altogether people might hear it but if you had some way to reach him to let him know that were ready to give in to scrap our policies to do anything he tells us to i said i havent if hed only agree to a conference just a conference it wouldnt commit him to anything would it were willing to turn the whole economy over to himif hed only tell us when where how if hed give us some word or sign if hed answer us why doesnt he answer youve heard his speech but what are we to do we cant just quit and leave the country without any government at all i shudder to think what would happen with the kind of social elements now on the loosewhy miss taggart its all i can do to keep them in line or wed have plunder and bloody murder in broad daylight i dont know whats got into people but they just dont seem to be civilized any more we cant quit at a time like this we can neither quit nor run things any longer what are we to do miss taggart start decontrolling huh start lifting taxes and removing controls oh no no no thats out of the question out of whose question i mean not at this time miss taggart not at this time the country isnt ready for it personally id agree with you im a freedom loving man miss taggart im not after powerbut this is an emergency people arent ready for freedom weve got to keep a strong hand we cant adopt an idealistic theory which then dont ask me what to do she said and rose to her feet but miss taggart i didnt come here to argue she was at the door when he sighed and said i hope hes still alive she stopped i hope they havent done anything rash a moment passed before she was able to ask who and to make it a word not a scream he shrugged spreading his arms and letting them drop helplessly i cant hold my own boys in line any longer i cant tell what they might attempt to do theres one cliquethe ferrislawsonmeigs factionthats been after me for over a year to adopt stronger measures a tougher policy they mean frankly what they mean is to resort to terror introduce the death penalty for civilian crimes for critics dissenters and the like their argument is that since people wont cooperate wont act for the public interest voluntarily weve got to force them to nothing will make our system work they say but terror and they may be right from the look of things nowadays but wesley wont go for strongarm methods wesley is a peaceful man a liberal and so am t were trying to keep the ferris boys in check but you see theyre set against any surrender to john galt they dont want us to deal with him they dont want us to find him i wouldnt put anything past them if they found him first theydtheres no telling what they might do thats what worries me why doesnt he answer why hasnt he answered us at all what if theyve found him and killed him i wouldnt know so i hoped that perhaps you had some way some means of knowing that hes still alive his voice trailed off into a question mark the whole of her resistance against a rush of liquefying terror went into the effort to keep her voice as stiff as her knees long enough to say i do not know and her knees stiff enough to carry her out of the room from behind the rotted posts of what had once been a corner vegetable stand dagny glanced furtively back at the street the rare lamp posts broke the street into separate islands she could see a pawnshop in the first patch of light a saloon in the next a church in the farthest and black gaps between them the sidewalks were deserted it was hard to tell but the street seemed empty she turned the corner with deliberately resonant steps then stopped abruptly to listen it was hard to tell whether the abnormal tightness inside her chest was the sound of her own heartbeats and hard to distinguish it from the sound of distant wheels and from the glassy rustle which was the east river somewhere close by but she heard no sound of human steps behind her she jerked her shoulders it was partshrug partshudder and she walked faster a rusty clock in some unlighted cavern coughed out the hour of four am the fear of being followed did not seem fully real as no fear could be real to her now she wondered whether the unnatural lightness of her body was a state of tension or relaxation her body seemed drawn so tightly that she felt as if it were reduced to a single attribute to the power of motion her mind seemed inaccessibly relaxed like a motor set to the automatic control of an absolute no longer to be questioned if a naked bullet could feel in midflight this is what it would feel she thought just the motion and the goal nothing else she thought it vaguely distantly as if her own person were unreal only the word naked seemed to reach her naked stripped of all concern but for the target for the number the number of a house on the east river which her mind kept repeating the number it had so long been forbidden to consider threesixtysevenshe thought looking for an invisible shape ahead among the angular forms of tenementsthreesixtyseven that is where he lives if he lives at all her calm her detachment and the confidence of her steps came from the certainty that this was an if with which she could not exist any longer she had existed with it for ten daysand the nights behind her were a single progression that had brought her to this night as if the momentum now driving her steps were the sound of her own steps still ringing unanswered in the tunnels of the terminal she had searched for him through the tunnels she had walked for hours night after nightthe hours of the shift he had once workedthrough the underground passages and platforms and shops and every twist of abandoned tracks asking no questions of anyone offering no explanations of her presence she had walked with no sense of fear or hope moved by a feeling of desperate loyalty that was almost a feeling of pride the root of that feeling was the moments when she had stopped in sudden astonishment in some dark subterranean corner and had heard the words halfstated in her mind this is my railroadas she looked at a vault vibrating to the sound of distant wheels this is my lifeas she felt the clot of tension which was the stopped and the suspended within herself this is my loveas she thought of the man who perhaps was somewhere in those tunnels there can be no conflict among these three what am i doubting what can keep us apart here where only he and i belong then recapturing the context of the present she had walked steadily on with the sense of the same unbroken loyalty but the sound of different words you have forbidden me to look for you you may damn me you may choose to discard me but by the right of the fact that i am alive i must know that you are i must see you this once not to stop not to speak not to touch you only to see she had not seen him she had abandoned her search when she had noticed the curious wondering glances of the underground workers following her steps she had called a meeting of the terminal track laborers for the alleged purpose of boosting their morale she had held the meeting twice to face all the men in turnshe had repeated the same unintelligible speech feeling a stab of shame at the empty generalities she uttered and together a stab of pride that it did not matter to her any longershe had looked at the exhausted brutalized faces of men who did not care whether they were ordered to work or to listen to meaningless sounds she had not seen his face among them was everyone present she had asked the foreman yeah i guess so he had answered indifferently she had loitered at the terminal entrances watching the men as they came to work but there were too many entrances to cover and no place where she could watch while remaining unseenshe had stood in the soggy twilight on a sidewalk glittering with rain pressed to the wall of a warehouse her coat collar raised to her cheekbones raindrops falling off the brim of her hatshe had stood exposed to the sight of the street knowing that the glances of the men who passed her were glances of recognition and astonishment knowing that her vigil was too dangerously obvious if there was a john galt among them someone could guess the nature of her quest if there was no john galt among them if there was no john galt in the world she thought then no danger existedand no world no danger and no world she thoughtas she walked through the streets of the slums toward a house with the number which was or was not his home she wondered whether this was what one felt while awaiting a verdict of death no fear no anger no concern nothing but the icy detachment of light without heat or of cognition without values a tin can clattered from under her toes and the sound went beating too loudly and too long as if against the walls of an abandoned city the streets seemed razed by exhaustion not by rest as if the men inside the walls were not asleep but had collapsed he would be home from work at this hour she thought if he worked if he still had a home she looked at the shapes of the slums at the crumbling plaster the peeling paint the fading signboards of failing shops with unwanted goods in unwashed windows the sagging steps unsafe to climb the clotheslines of garments unfit to wear the undone the unattended the given up the incomplete all the twisted monuments of a losing race against two enemies no time and no strengthand she thought that this was the place where he had lived for twelve years he who possessed such extravagant power to lighten the job of human existence some memory kept struggling to reach her then came back its name was starnesville she felt the sensation of a shudder but this is new york cityshe cried to herself in defense of the greatness she had loved then she faced with unmoving austerity the verdict pronounced by her mind a city that had left him in these slums for twelve years was damned and doomed to the future of starnesville then abruptly it ceased to matter she felt a peculiar shock like the shock of sudden silence a sense of stillness within her which she took for a sense of calm she saw the number above the door of an ancient tenement she was calm she thought it was only time that had suddenly lost its continuity and had broken her perception into separate snatches she knew the moment when she saw the numberthen the moment when she looked at a list on a board in the moldy halflight of a doorway and saw the words john galt th rear scrawled in pencil by some illiterate handthen the moment when she stopped at the foot of a stairway glanced up at the vanishing angles of the railing and suddenly leaned against the wall trembling with terror preferring not to knowthen the moment when she felt the movement of her foot coming to rest on the first of the stepsthen a single unbroken progression of lightness of rising without effort or doubt or fear of feeling the twisting installments of stairway dropping down beneath her unhesitant feet as if the momentum of her irresistible rise were coming from the straightness of her body the poise of her shoulders the lift of her head and the solemnly exultant certainty that in the moment of ultimate decision it was not disaster she expected of her life at the end of a rising stairway she had needed thirtyseven years to climb at the top she saw a narrow hallway its walls converging to an unlighted door she heard the floorboards creaking in the silence under her steps she felt the pressure of her finger on a doorbell and heard the sound of ringing in the unknown space beyond she waited she heard the brief crack of a board but it came from the floor below she heard the sliding wail of a tugboat somewhere on the river then she knew that she had missed some span of time because her next awareness was not like a moment of awakening but like a moment of birth as if two sounds were pulling her out of a void the sound of a step behind the door and the sound of a lock being turnedbut she was not present until the moment when suddenly there was no door before her and the figure standing on the threshold was john galt standing casually in his own doorway dressed in slacks and shirt the angle of his waistline slanting faintly against the light behind him she knew that his eyes were grasping this moment then sweeping over its past and its future that a lightning process of calculation was bringing it into his conscious controland by the time a fold of his shirt moved with the motion of his breath he knew the sumand the sum was a smile of radiant greeting she was now unable to move he seized her arm he jerked her inside the room she felt the clinging pressure of his mouth she felt the slenderness of his body through the suddenly alien stiffness of her coat she saw the laughter in his eyes she felt the touch of his mouth again and again she was sagging in his arms she was breathing in gasps as if she had not breathed for five flights of stairs her face was pressed to the angle between his neck and shoulder to hold him to hold him with her arms her hands and the skin of her cheek john youre alive was all she could say he nodded as if he knew what the words were intended to explain then he picked up her hat that had fallen to the floor he took off her coat and put it aside he looked at her slender trembling figure a sparkle of approval in his eyes his hand moving over the tight high collared dark blue sweater that gave to her body the fragility of a schoolgirl and the tension of a fighter the next time i see you he said wear a white one it will look wonderful too she realized that she was dressed as she never appeared in public as she had been dressed at home through the sleepless hours of that night she laughed rediscovering the ability to laugh she had expected his first words to be anything but that if there is a next time he added calmly what do you mean he went to the door and locked it sit down he said she remained standing but she took the time to glance at the room she had not noticed a long bare garret with a bed in one corner and a gas stove in another a few pieces of wooden furniture naked boards stressing the length of the floor a single lamp burning on a desk a closed door in the shadows beyond the lamps circleand new york city beyond an enormous window the spread of angular structures and scattered lights and the shaft of the taggart building far in the distance now listen carefully he said we have about half an hour i think i know why you came here i told you that it would be hard to stand and that you would be likely to break dont regret it you seei cant regret it either but now we have to know how to act from here on in about half an hour the looters agents who followed you will be here to arrest me oh no she gasped dagny whoever among them had any remnant of human perceptiveness would know that youre not one of them that youre their last link to me and would not let you out of his sightor the sight of his spies i wasnt followed i watched i you wouldnt know how to notice it sneaking is one art theyre expert at whoever followed you is reporting to his bosses right now your presence in this district at this hour my name on the board downstairs the fact that i work for your railroadits enough even for them to connect then lets get out of here he shook his head theyve surrounded the block by now your follower would have every policeman in the district at his immediate call now i want you to know what youll have to do when they come here dagny you have only one chance to save me if you did not quite understand what i said on the radio about the man in the middle youll understand it now there is no middle for you to take and you cannot take my side not so long as were in their hands now you must take their side what you must take their side as fully consistently and loudly as your capacity for deception will permit you must act as one of them you must act as my worst enemy if you do ill have a chance to come out of it alive they need me too much theyll go to any extreme before they bring themselves to kill me whatever they extort from people they can extort it only through their victims values and they have no value of mine to hold over my head nothing to threaten me with but if they get the slightest suspicion of what we are to each other they will have you on a torture rack i mean physical torture before my eyes in less than a week i am not going to wait for that at the first mention of a threat to you i will kill myself and stop them right there he said it without emphasis in the same impersonal tone of practical calculation as the rest she knew that he meant it and that he was right to mean it she saw in what manner she alone had the power to succeed at destroying him where all the power of his enemies would fail he saw the look of stillness in her eyes a look of understanding and of horror he nodded with a faint smile i dont have to tell you he said that if i do it it wont be an act of selfsacrifice i do not care to live on their terms i do not care to obey them and i do not care to see you enduring a drawnout murder there will be no values for me to seek after that and i do not care to exist without values i dont have to tell you that we owe no morality to those who hold us under a gun so use every power of deceit you can command but convince them that you hate me then well have a chance to remain alive and to escape i dont know when or how but ill know that im free to act is this understood she forced herself to lift her head to look straight at him and to nod when they come he said tell them that you had been trying to find me for them that you became suspicious when you saw my name on your payroll list and that you came here to investigate she nodded i will stall about admitting my identity they might recognize my voice but ill attempt to deny it so that it will be you wholl tell them that i am the john galt theyre seeking it took her a few seconds longer but she nodded afterwards youll claim and accept that fivehundredthousand dollar reward theyve offered for my capture she closed her eyes then nodded dagny he said slowly there is no way to serve your own values under their system sooner or later whether you intended it or not they had to bring you to the point where the only thing you can do for me is to turn against me gather your strength and do it then well earn this one halfhour and perhaps the future ill do it she said firmly and added if that is what happens if it will happen dont regret it i wont you havent seen the nature of our enemies youll see it now if i have to be the pawn in the demonstration that will convince you im willing to beand to win you from them once and for all you didnt want to wait any longer oh dagny dagny neither did i it was the way he held her the way he kissed her mouth that made her feel as if every step she had taken every danger every doubt even her treason against him if it was treason all of it were giving her an exultant right to this moment he saw the struggle in her face the tension of an incredulous protest against herselfand she heard the sound of his voice through the strands of her hair pressed to his lips dont think of them now never think of pain or danger or enemies a moment longer than is necessary to fight them youre here its our time and our life not theirs dont struggle not to be happy you are at the risk of destroying you she whispered you wont butyes even that you dont think its indifference do you was it indifference that broke you and brought you here i and then the violence of the truth made her pull his mouth down to hers then throw the words at his face i didnt care whether either one of us lived afterwards just to see you this once i would have been disappointed if you hadnt come do you know what it was like waiting fighting it delaying it one more day then one more then he chuckled do i he said softly her hand dropped in a helpless gesture she thought of his ten years when i heard your voice on the radio she said when i heard the greatest statement i ever no i have no right to tell you what i thought of it why not you think that i havent accepted it you will were you speaking from here no from the valley and then you returned to new york the next morning and youve been here ever since yes have you heard the kind of appeals theyre sending out to you every night sure she glanced slowly about the room her eyes moving from the towers of the city in the window to the wooden rafters of his ceiling to the cracked plaster of his walls to the iron posts of his bed youve been here all that time she said youve lived here for twelve years here like this like this he said throwing open the door at the end of the room she gasped the long lightflooded windowless space beyond the threshold enclosed in a shell of softly lustrous metal like a small ballroom aboard a submarine was the most efficiently modern laboratory she had ever seen come in he said grinning i dont have to keep secrets from you any longer it was like crossing the border into a different universe she looked at the complex equipment sparkling in a bright diffused glow at the mesh of glittering wires at the blackboard chalked with mathematical formulas at the long counters of objects shaped by the ruthless discipline of a purposethen at the sagging boards and crumbling plaster of the garret eitheror she thought this was the choice confronting the world a human soul in the image of one or of the other you wanted to know where i worked for eleven months out of the year he said all this she asked pointing at the laboratory on the salary ofshe pointed at the garretof an unskilled laborer oh no on the royalties midas mulligan pays me for his powerhouse for the ray screen for the radio transmitter and a few other jobs of that kind then then why did you have to work as a track laborer because no money earned in the valley is ever to be spent outside where did you get this equipment i designed it andrew stocktons foundry made it he pointed to an unobtrusive object the size of a radio cabinet in a corner of the room theres the motor you wanted and chuckled at her gasp at the involuntary jolt that threw her forward dont bother studying it you wont give it away to them now she was staring at the shining metal cylinders and the glistening coils of wire that suggested the rusted shape resting like a sacred relic in a glass coffin in a vault of the taggart terminal it supplies my own electric power for the laboratory he said no one has had to wonder why a track laborer is using such exorbitant amounts of electricity but if they ever found this place he gave an odd brief chuckle they wont how long have you been she stopped this time she did not gasp the sight confronting her could not be greeted by anything except a moment of total inner stillness on the wall behind a row of machinery she saw a picture cut out of a newspapera picture of her in slacks and shirt standing by the side of the engine at the opening of the john galt line her head lifted her smile holding the context the meaning and the sunlight of that day a moan was her only answer as she turned to him but the look on his face matched hers in the picture i was the symbol of what you wanted to destroy in the world he said but you were my symbol of what i wanted to achieve he pointed at the picture this is how men expect to feel about their life once or twice as an exception in the course of their lifetime but ithis is what i chose as the constant and normal the look on his face the serene intensity of his eyes and of his mind made it real to her now in this moment in this moments full context in this city when he kissed her she knew that their arms holding each other were holding their greatest triumph that this was the reality untouched by pain or fear the reality of halleys fifth concerto this was the reward they had wanted fought for and won the doorbell rang her first reaction was to draw back histo hold her closer and longer when he raised his head he was smiling he said only now is the time not to be afraid she followed him back to the garret she heard the door of the laboratory clicking locked behind them he held her coat for her silently he waited until she had tied its belt and had put on her hatthen he walked to the entrance door and opened it three of the four men who entered were muscular figures in military uniforms each with two guns on his hips with broad faces devoid of shape and eyes untouched by perception the fourth their leader was a frail civilian with an expensive overcoat a neat mustache pale blue eyes and the manner of an intellectual of the publicrelations species he blinked at galt at the room made a step forward stopped made another step and stopped yes said galt are are you john galt he asked too loudly thats my name are you the john galt which one did you speak on the radio when dont let him fool you the metallic voice was dagnys and it was addressed to the leader heisjohngalt i shall report the proof to headquarters you may proceed galt turned to her as to a stranger will you tell me now just who you are and what it was that you wanted here her face was as blank as the faces of the soldiers my name is dagny taggart i wanted to convince myself that you are the man whom the country is seeking he turned to the leader all right he said i am john galtbut if you want me to answer you at all keep your stool pigeonhe pointed at dagnyaway from me mr galt cried the leader with the sound of an enormous joviality it is an honor to meet you an honor and a privilege please mr galt dont misunderstand uswere ready to grant you your wishesno of course you dont have to deal with miss taggart if you prefer not to miss taggart was only trying to do her patriotic duty but i said keep her away from me were not your enemies mr galt i assure you were not your enemies he turned to dagny miss taggart you have performed an invaluable service to the people you have earned the highest form of public gratitude permit us to take over from here on the soothing motions of his hands were urging her to stand back to keep out of galts sight now what do you want asked galt the nation is waiting for you mr galt all we want is a chance to dispel misapprehensions just a chance to cooperate with you his gloved hand was waving a signal to his three men the floorboards creaked as the men proceeded silently to the task of opening drawers and closets they were searching the room the spirit of the nation will revive tomorrow morning mr galt when they hear that you have been found what do you want just to greet you in the name of the people am i under arrest why think in such oldfashioned terms our job is only to escort you safely to the top councils of the national leadership where your presence is urgently needed he paused but got no answer the countrys top leaders desire to confer with youjust to confer and to reach a friendly understanding the soldiers were finding nothing but garments and kitchen utensils there were no letters no books not even a newspaper as if the room were the habitation of an illiterate our objective is only to assist you to assume your rightful place in society mr galt you do not seem to realize your own public value i do we are here only to protect you locked declared a soldier banging his fist against the laboratory door the leader assumed an ingratiating smile what is behind that door mr galt private property would you open it please no the leader spread his hands out in a gesture of pained helplessness unfortunately my hands are tied orders you know we have to enter that room enter it its only a formality a mere formality theres no reason why things should not be handled amicably wont you please cooperate i said no im sure you wouldnt want us to resort to any unnecessary means he got no answer we have the authority to break that door down you knowbut of course we wouldnt want to do it he waited but got no answer force that lock he snapped to the soldier dagny glanced at galts face he stood impassively his head held level she saw the undisturbed lines of his profile his eyes directed at the door the lock was a small square plate of polished copper without keyhole or fixtures the silence and the sudden immobility of the three brutes were involuntary while the burglars tools in the hands of the fourth went grating cautiously against the wood of the door the wood gave way easily and small chips fell down their thuds magnified by the silence into the rattle of a distant gun when the burglars jimmy attacked the copper plate they heard a faint rustle behind the door no louder than the sigh of a weary mind in another minute the lock fell out and the door shuddered forward the width of an inch the soldier jumped back the leader approached his steps irregular like hiccoughs and threw the door open they faced a black hole of unknown content and unrelieved darkness they glanced at one another and at galt he did not move he stood looking at the darkness dagny followed them when they stepped over the threshold preceded by the beams of their flashlights the space beyond was a long shell of metal empty but for heavy drifts of dust on the floor an odd grayishwhite dust that seemed to belong among ruins undisturbed for centuries the room looked dead like an empty skull she turned away not to let them see in her face the scream of the knowledge of what that dust had been a few minutes ago dont try to open that door he had said to her at the entrance to the powerhouse of atlantis if you tried to break it down the machinery inside would collapse into rubble long before the door would give way dont try to open that doorshe was thinking but knew that what she was now seeing was the visual form of the statement dont try to force a mind the men backed out in silence and went on backing toward the exit door then stopped uncertainly one after another at random points of the garret as if abandoned by a receding tide well said galt reaching for his overcoat and turning to the leader lets go three floors of the waynefalkland hotel had been evacuated and transformed into an armed camp guards with machine guns stood at every turn of the long velvetcarpeted corridors sentinels with bayonets stood on the landings of the firestairways the elevator doors of the fiftyninth sixtieth and sixtyfirst floors were padlocked a single door and one elevator were left as sole means of access guarded by soldiers in full battle regalia peculiarlooking men loitered in the lobbies restaurants and shops of the ground floor their clothes were too new and too expensive in unsuccessful imitation of the hotels usual patrons a camouflage impaired by the fact that the clothes were badly fitted to their wearers husky figures and were further distorted by bulges in places where the garments of businessmen have no cause to bulge but the garments of gunmen have groups of guards with tommy guns were posted at every entrance and exit of the hotel as well as at strategic windows of the adjoining streets in the center of this camp on the sixtieth floor in what was known as the royal suite of the waynefalkland hotel amidst satin drapes crystal candelabra and sculptured garlands of sowers john galt dressed in slacks and shirt sat in a brocaded armchair one leg stretched out on a velvet hassock his hands crossed behind his head looking at the ceiling this was the posture in which mr thompson found him when the four guards who had stood outside the door of the royal suite since five am opened it at eleven am to admit mr thompson and locked it again mr thompson experienced a brief flash of uneasiness when the click of the lock cut off his escape and left him alone with the prisoner but he remembered the newspaper headlines and the radio voices which had been announcing to the country since dawn john galt is foundjohn galt is in new yorkjohn galt has joined the peoples causejohn galt is in conference with the countrys leaders working for a speedy solution of all our problemsand he made himself feel that he believed it well well well he said brightly marching up to the armchair so youre the young fellow whos started all the troubleoh he said suddenly as he got a closer look at the dark green eyes watching him well i im tickled pink to meet you mr galt just tickled pink he added im mr thompson you know how do you do said galt mr thompson thudded down on a chair the brusqueness of the movement suggesting a cheerily businesslike attitude now dont go imagining that youre under arrest or some such nonsense he pointed at the room this is no jail as you can see you can see that well treat you right youre a big person a very big personand we know it just make yourself at home ask for anything you please fire any flunky that doesnt obey you and if you take a dislike to any of the army boys outside just breathe the wordand well send another one to replace him he paused expectantly he received no answer the only reason we brought you here is just that we wanted to talk to you we wouldnt have done it this way but you left us no choice you kept hiding and all we wanted was a chance to tell you that you got us all wrong he spread his hands out palms up with a disarming smile galts eyes were watching him without answer that was some speech you made boy are you an orator youve done something to the countryi dont know what or why but you have people seem to want something youve got but you thought wed be dead set against it thats where youre wrong were not personally i think there was plenty in that speech that made sense yes sir i do of

mind im open to any argument he leaned forward invitingly he obtained no answer the world is in a hell of a mess just as you said there i agree with you we have a point in common we can start from that somethings got to be done about it all i wanted waslook he cried suddenly why dont you let me talk to you you are talking to me i well that is well you know what i mean fully well well what have

after im offering you a deal im always open to a deal i knew it cried mr thompson triumphantly slamming his fist down on his own knee i told them soall those fool intellectual theorizers like wesley im always open to a dealwith anyone who has a value to offer me mr thompson could not tell what made him miss a beat before he answered well write your own ticket brother write your own ticket what have you got to offer me whyanything such as anything you name have you heard our shortwave broadcasts to you yes we said well meet your terms any terms we meant it have you heard me say on the radio that i have no terms to bargain about i meant it oh but look you misunderstood us you thought wed fight you but we wont were not that rigid were willing to consider any idea why didnt you answer our calls and come to a conference why should i because because we wanted to speak to you in the name of the country i dont recognize your right to speak in the name of the country now look here im not

impossible thats fantastic thats out of the question you see i told you we had nothing to discuss now wait wait dont go to extremes theres always a middle ground you cant have everything we arent

youll have the organized power of the state at your command to enforce your decisions well stand ready to obey you all of us from me on down in the field of production well do whatever you say youll beyoull be the economic dictator of the nation galt burst out laughing it was the simple amusement of the laughter that shocked mr thompson whats the matter with you so thats your idea of a compromise is it whats the dont sit there grinning like that i dont think you understood me im offering you wesley mouchs joband theres nothing bigger that anyone could offer you youll be free to do anything you

brains lead us to a peaceful scientific industrial age and to prosperity at the point of a gun now look i now whats so damn funny about it will you tell me just one thing if youre able to pretend that you havent heard a word i said on the radio what makes you think id be willing to pretend that i havent said it i dont know what you mean i skip it it was just a rhetorical question the first part of it answers the second huh i dont play your kind of games brotherif you want a translation do you mean that youre refusing my offer i am but why it took me three hours on the radio to tell you why oh thats just theory im talking business im offering you the greatest job in the world will you tell me whats wrong with it what i told you in three hours was that it wont work you can make it work how mr thompson spread his hands out i dont know if i did i wouldnt come to you its for you to figure out youre the industrial genius you can solve anything i said it cant be done you could do it how somehow he heard galts chuckle and added why not just tell me why not okay ill tell you you want me to be the economic dictator yes and youd obey any order i give implicitly then start by abolishing all income taxes oh no screamed mr thompson leaping to his feet we couldnt do that thats thats not the field of production thats the field of distribution how would we pay government employees fire your government employees oh no thats politics thats not economics you cant interfere with politics you cant have everything galt crossed his legs on the hassock stretching himself more comfortably in the brocaded armchair want to continue the discussion or do you get the point i only he stopped are you satisfied that i got the point look said mr thompson placatingly resuming the edge of his seat i dont want to argue im no good at debates im a man of action time is short all i know is that youve got a mind just the sort of mind we need you can do anything you could make things work if you wanted to all right put it your own way i dont want to i dont want to be an economic dictator not even long enough to issue that order for people to be freewhich any rational human being would throw back in my face because hed know that his rights are not to be held given or received by your permission or mine tell me said mr thompson looking at him reflectively what is it youre after i told you on the radio i dont get it you said that youre out for your own selfish interest and that i can understand but what can you possibly want in the future that you couldnt get right now from us handed down to you on a platter i thought you were an egoistand a practical man i offer you a blank check on anything you wishand you tell me that you dont want it why because there are no funds behind your blank check what because you have no value to offer me i can offer you anything you can ask just name it you name it well you talked a lot about wealth if its money that you wantyou couldnt make in three lifetimes what i can hand over to you in a minute this minute cash on the barrel want a billion dollarsa cool neat billion dollars which ill have to produce for you to give me no i mean straight out of the public treasury in fresh new bills or or even in gold if you prefer what will it buy me oh look when the country gets back on its feet when i put it back on its feet well if what you want is to run things your own way if its power that youre after ill guarantee you that every man woman and child in this country will obey your orders and do whatever you wish after i teach them to do it if you want anything for your own gangfor all those men whove disappearedjobs positions authority tax exemptions any special favor at alljust name it and theyll get it after i bring them back well what on earth do you want what on earth do i need you for huh what have you got to offer me that i couldnt get without you there was a different look in mr thompsons eyes when he drew back as if cornered yet looked straight at galt for the first time and said slowly without me you couldnt get out of this room right now galt smiled true you wouldnt be able to produce anything you could be left here to starve true well dont you see the loudness of homey joviality came back into mr thompsons voice as if the hint given and received were now to be safely evaded by means of humor what ive got to offer you is your life its not yours to offer mr thompson said galt softly something about his voice made mr thompson jerk to glance at him then jerk faster to look away galts smile seemed almost gentle now said galt do you see what i meant when i said that a zero cant hold a mortgage over life its i whod have to grant you that kind of mortgageand i dont the removal of a threat is not a payment the negation of a negative is not a reward the withdrawal of your armed hoodlums is not an incentive the offer not to murder me is not a value who whos said anything about murdering you whos said anything about anything else if you werent holding me here at the point of a gun under threat of death you wouldnt have a chance to speak to me at all and that is as much as your guns can accomplish i dont pay for the removal of threats i dont buy my life from anyone thats not true said mr thompson brightly if you had a broken leg youd pay a doctor to set it not if he was the one who broke it he smiled at mr thompsons silence im a practical man mr thompson i dont think its practical to establish a person whose sole means of livelihood is the breaking of my bones i dont think its practical to support a protection racket mr thompson looked thoughtful then shook his head i dont think youre practical he said a practical man doesnt ignore the facts of reality he doesnt waste his time wishing things to be different or trying to change them he takes things as they are were holding you its a fact whether you like it or not its a fact you should act accordingly i am what i mean is you should cooperate you should recognize an existing situation accept it and adjust to it if you had blood poisoning would you adjust to it or act to change it oh thats different thats physical you mean physical facts are open to correction but your whims are not huh you mean physical nature can be adjusted to men but your whims are above the laws of nature and men must adjust to you i mean that i hold the upper hand with a gun in it oh forget about guns i i cant forget a fact of reality mr thompson that would be impractical all right then i hold a gun what are you going to do about it ill act accordingly ill obey you what ill do whatever you tell me to do you mean it i mean it literally he saw the eagerness of mr thompsons face ebb slowly under a look of bewilderment i will perform any motion you order me to perform if you order me to move into the office of an economic dictator ill move into it if you order me to sit at a desk i will sit at it if you order me to issue a directive i will issue the directive you order me to issue oh but i dont know what directives to issue i dont either there was a long pause well said galt what are your orders i want you to save the economy of the country i dont know how to save it i want you to find a way i dont know how to find it i want you to think how will your gun make me do that mr thompson mr thompson looked at him silentlyand galt saw in the tightened lips in the jutting chin in the narrowed eyes the look of an adolescent bully about to utter that philosophical argument which is expressed by the sentence ill bash your teeth in galt smiled looking straight at him as if hearing the unspoken sentence and underscoring it mr thompson looked away no said galt you dont want me to think when you force a man to act against his own choice and judgment its his thinking that you want him to suspend you want him to become a robot i shall comply mr thompson sighed i dont get it he said in a tone of genuine helplessness somethings off and i cant figure it out why should you ask for trouble with a brain like yoursyou can beat anybody im no match for you and you know it why dont you pretend to join us then gain control and outsmart me for the same reason that makes you offer it because youd win huh because its the attempt of your betters to beat you on your terms that has allowed your kind to get away with it for centuries which one of us would succeed if i were to compete with you for control over your musclemen sure i could pretendand i wouldnt save your economy or your system nothing will save them nowbut id perish and what youd win would be what youve always won in the past a postponement one more stay of execution for another yearor monthbought at the price of whatever hope and effort might still be squeezed out of the best of the human remnants left around you including me thats all youre after and that is the length of your range a month youd settle for a weekon the unchallenged absolute that there will always be another victim to find but youve found your last victimthe one who refuses to play his historical part the game is up brother oh thats just theory snapped mr thompson a little too sharply his eyes were roving about the room in the manner of a substitute for pacing he glanced at the door as if longing to escape you say that if we dont give up the system well perish he asked yes then since were holding you you will perish with us possibly dont you want to live passionately he saw the snap of a spark in mr thompsons eyes and smiled ill tell you more i know that i want to live much more intensely than you do i know that thats what youre counting on i know that you in fact do not want to live at all i want it and because i want it so much i will accept no substitute mr thompson jumped to his feet thats not true he cried my not wanting to liveits not true why do you talk like that he stood his limbs drawn faintly together as if against a sudden chill why do you say such things i dont know what you mean he backed a few steps away and its not true that im a gunman im not i dont intend to harm you i never intended to harm anybody i want people to like me i want to be your friend i want to be your friend he cried to the space at large galts eyes were watching him without expression giving him no clue to what they were seeing except that they were seeing it mr thompson jerked suddenly into bustling unnecessary motions as if he were in a hurry ive got to run along he said i have so many appointments well talk about it some more think it over take your time im not trying to highpressure you just relax take it easy and make yourself at home ask for anything you likefood drinks cigarettes the best of anything he waved his hand at galts garments im going to order the most expensive tailor in the city to make some decent clothes for you i want you to get used to the best i want you to be comfortable and say he asked a little too casually have you got any family any relatives youd like to see no any friends no have you got a sweetheart no its just that i wouldnt want you to get lonesome we can let you have visitors any visitor you name if theres anyone you care for there isnt mr thompson paused at the door turned to look at galt for a moment and shook his head i cant figure you out he said i just cant figure you out galt smiled shrugged and answered who is john galt a whirling mesh of sleet hung over the entrance of the waynefalkland hotel and the armed guards looked oddly desolately helpless in the circle of light they stood hunched heads down hugging their guns for warmthas if were they to release all the spitting violence of their bullets at the storm it would not bring comfort to their bodies from across the street chick morrison the morale conditioneron his way to a conference on the fiftyninth floornoted that the rare lethargic passersby were not taking the trouble to glance at the guards as they did not take the trouble to glance at the soggy headlines of a pile of unsold newspapers on the stand of a ragged shivering vendor john galt promises prosperity chick morrison shook his head uneasily six days of frontpage storiesabout the united efforts of the countrys leaders working with john galt to shape new policieshad brought no results people were moving he observed as if they did not care to see anything around them no one took any notice of his existence except a ragged old woman who stretched out her hand to him silently as he approached the lights of the entrance he hurried past and only drops of sleet fell on the gnarled naked palm it was his memory of the streets that gave a jagged sound to chick morrisons voice when he spoke to a circle of faces in mr thompsons room on the fiftyninth floor the look of the faces matched the sound of his voice it doesnt seem to work he said pointing to a pile of reports from his publicpulsetakers all the press releases about our collaborating with john galt dont seem to make any difference people dont care they dont believe a word of it some of them say that hell never collaborate with us most of them dont even believe that weve got him i dont know whats happened to people they dont believe anything any more he sighed three factories went out of business in cleveland day before yesterday five factories closed in chicago yesterday in san francisco i know i know snapped mr thompson tightening the muffler around his throat the buildings furnace had gone out of order theres no choice about it hes got to give in and take over hes got to wesley mouch glanced at the ceiling dont ask me to talk to him again he said and shuddered ive tried one cant talk to that man i i cant mr thompson cried chick morrison in answer to the stop of mr thompsons roving glance ill resign if you want me to i cant talk to him again dont make me nobody can talk to him said dr floyd ferris its a waste of time he doesnt hear a word you say fred kinnan chuckled you mean he hears too much dont you and whats worse he answers it well why dont you try it again snapped mouch you seem to have enjoyed it why dont you try to persuade him i know better said kinnan dont fool yourself brother nobodys going to persuade him i wont try it twice enjoyed it he added with a look of astonishment yeah yeah i guess i did whats the matter with you are you falling for him are you letting him win you over me kinnan chuckled mirthlessly what use would he have for me ill be the first one to go down the drain when he wins its onlyhe glanced wistfully up at the ceilingits only that hes a man who talks straight he wont win snapped mr thompson its out of the question there was a long pause there are hunger riots in west virginia said wesley mouch and the farmers in texas have mr thompson said chick morrison desperately maybe maybe we could let the public see him at a mass rally or maybe on tv just see him just so theyd believe that weve really got him it would give people hope for a while it would give us a little time too dangerous snapped dr ferris dont let him come anywhere near the public theres no limit to what hell permit himself to do hes got to give in said mr thompson stubbornly hes got to join us one of you must no screamed eugene lawson not me i dont want to see him at all not once i dont want to have to believe it what asked james taggart his voice had a note of dangerously reckless mockery lawson did not answer what are you scared of the contempt in taggarts voice sounded abnormally stressed as if the sight of someones greater fear were tempting him to defy his own what is it youre scared to believe gene i wont believe it i wont lawsons voice was halfsnarl half whimper you cant make me lose my faith in humanity you shouldnt permit such a man to be possible a ruthless egoist who youre a fine bunch of intellectuals you are said mr thompson scornfully i thought you could talk to him in his own lingobut hes scared the lot of you ideas where are your ideas now do something make him join us win him over trouble is he doesnt want anything said mouch what can we offer a man who doesnt want anything you mean said kinnan what can we offer a man who wants to live shut up screamed james taggart why did you say that what made you say it what made you scream asked kinnan keep quiet all of you ordered mr thompson youre fine at fighting one another but when it comes to fighting a real man so hes got you too yelled lawson aw pipe down said mr thompson wearily hes the toughest bastard ive ever been up against you wouldnt understand that hes as hard as they come the faintest tinge of admiration crept into his voice as hard as they come there are ways to persuade tough bastards drawled dr ferris casually as ive explained to you no cried mr thompson no shut up i wont listen to you i wont hear of it his hands moved frantically as if struggling to dispel something he would not name i told him that thats not true that were not that im not a he shook his head violently as if his own words were some unprecedented form of danger no look boys what i mean is weve got to be practical and cautious damn cautious weve got to handle it peacefully we cant afford to antagonize him or or harm him we dont dare take any chances on anything happening to him because because if he goes we go hes our last hope make no mistake about it if he goes we perish you all know it his eyes swept over the faces around him they knew it the sleet of the following morning fell down on frontpage stories announcing that a constructive harmonious conference between john galt and the countrys leaders on the previous afternoon had produced the john galt plan soon to be announced the snowflakes of the evening fell down upon the furniture of an apartment house whose front wall had collapsedand upon a crowd of men waiting silently at the closed cashiers window of a plant whose owner had vanished the farmers of south dakota wesley mouch reported to mr thompson next morning are marching on the state capital burning every government building on their way and every home worth more than ten thousand dollars californias blown to pieces he reported in the evening theres a civil war going on thereif thats what it is which nobody seems to be sure of theyve declared that theyre seceding from the union but nobody knows whos now in power theres armed fighting all over the state between a peoples party led by ma chalmers and her soybean cult of orientadmirersand something called back to god led by some former oilfield owners miss taggart moaned mr thompson when she entered his hotel room next morning in answer to his summons what are we going to do he wondered why he had once felt that she possessed some reassuring kind of energy he was looking at a blank face that seemed composed but the composure became disquieting when one noticed that it lasted for minute after minute with no change of expression no sign of feeling her face had the same look as all the others he thought except for something in the set of the mouth that suggested endurance i trust you miss taggart youve got more brains than all my boys he pleaded youve done more for the country than any of themits you who found him for us what are we to do with everything falling to pieces hes the only one who can lead us out of this messbut he wont he refuses he simply refuses to lead ive never seen anything like it a man who has no desire to command we beg him to give ordersand he answers that he wants to obey them its preposterous it is what do you make of it can you figure him out hes an arrogant egoist she said hes an ambitious adventurer hes a man of unlimited audacity whos playing for the biggest stakes in the world it was easy she thought it would have been difficult in that distant time when she had regarded language as a tool of honor always to be used as if one were under oathan oath of allegiance to reality and to respect for human beings now it was only a matter of making sounds inarticulate sounds addressed to inanimate objects unrelated to such concepts as reality human or honor it had been easy that first morning to report to mr thompson how she had traced john galt to his home it had been easy to watch mr thompsons gulping smiles and his repeated cries of thats my girl uttered with glances of triumph at his assistants the triumph of a man whose judgment in trusting her had been vindicated it had been easy to express an angry hatred for galti used to agree with his ideas but i wont let him destroy my railroadand to hear mr thompson say dont you worry miss taggart well protect you from him it had been easy to assume a look of cold shrewdness and to remind mr thompson of the fivehundredthousanddollar reward her voice clear and cutting like the sound of an adding machine punching out the sum of a bill she had seen an instants pause in mr thompsons facial muscles then a brighter broader smilelike a silent speech declaring that he had not expected it but was delighted to know what made her tick and that it was the kind of ticking he understood of course miss taggart certainly that reward is yoursall yours the check will be sent to you in full it had been easy because she had felt as if she were in some dreary nonworld where her words and actions were not facts any longernot reflections of reality but only distorted postures in one of those sideshow mirrors that project deformity for the perception of beings whose consciousness is not to be treated as consciousness thin single and hot like the burning pressure of a wire within her like a needle selecting her course was her only concern the thought of his safety the rest was a blur of shapeless dissolution halfacid half fog but thisshe thought with a shudderwas the state in which they lived all those people whom she had never understood this was the state they desired this rubber reality this task of pretending distorting deceiving with the credulous stare of some mr thompsons panicbleary eyes as ones only purpose and reward those who desired this stateshe wondereddid they want to live the biggest stakes in the world miss taggart mr thompson was asking her anxiously what is it what does he want reality this earth i dont know quite what you mean but look miss taggart if you think you can understand him would you would you try to speak to him once more she felt as if she heard her own voice many lightyears away crying that she would give her life to see himbut in this room she heard the voice of a meaningless stranger saying coldly no mr thompson i wouldnt i hope ill never have to see him again i know that you cant stand him and i cant say i blame you but couldnt you just try to i tried to reason with him the night i found him i heard nothing but insults in return i think he resents me more than hed resent anyone else he wont forgive me the fact that it was i who trapped him id be the last person to whom he would surrender yeah yeah thats true do you think he will ever surrender the needle within her wavered for a moment burning its oscillating way between two courses should she say that he would not and see them kill himshould she say that he would and see them hold onto their power till they destroyed the world he will she said firmly hell give in if you treat him right hes too ambitious to refuse power dont let him escape but dont threaten himor harm him fear wont work hes impervious to fear but what if i mean with the way things are collapsing what if he holds out too long he wont hes too practical for that by the way are you letting him hear any news about the state of the country why no i would suggest that you let him have copies of your confidential reports hell see that it wont be long now thats a good idea a very good idea you know miss taggart he said suddenly with the sound of some desperate clinging hi his voice i feel better whenever i talk to you its because i trust you i dont trust anybody around me but youyoure different youre solid she was looking unflinchingly straight at him thank you mr thompson she said it had been easy she thoughtuntil she walked out into the street and noticed that under her coat her blouse was sticking damply to her shoulder blades were she able to feelshe thought as she walked through the concourse of the terminalshe would know that the heavy indifference she now felt for her railroad was hatred she could not get rid of the feeling that she was running nothing but freight trains the passengers to her were not living or human it seemed senseless to waste such enormous effort on preventing catastrophes on protecting the mi safety of trains carrying nothing but inanimate objects she looked at the faces in the terminal if he were to die she thought to be murdered by the rulers of their system that these might continue to eat sleep and travelwould she work to provide them with trains if she were to scream for their help would one of them rise to his defense did they want him to live they who had heard him the check for five hundred thousand dollars was delivered to her office that afternoon it was delivered with a bouquet of flowers from mr thompson she looked at the check and let it flutter down to her desk it meant nothing and made her feel nothing not even a suggestion of guilt it was a scrap of paper of no greater significance than the ones in the office wastebasket whether it could buy a diamond necklace or the city dump or the last of her food made no difference it would never be spent it was not a token of value and nothing it purchased could be a value but thisshe thoughtthis inanimate indifference was the permanent state of the people around her of men who had no purpose and no passion this was the state of a nonvaluing soul those who chose itshe wondereddid they want to live the lights were out of order in the hall of the apartment house when she came home that evening numb with exhaustionand she did not notice the envelope at her feet until she switched on the light in her foyer it was a blank sealed envelope that had been slipped under her door she picked it upand then within a moment she was laughing soundlessly halfkneeling halfsitting on the floor not to move off that spot not to do anything but stare at the note written by a hand she knew the hand that had written its last message on the calendar above the city the note said dagny sit tight watch them when hell need our help call me at or f the newspapers of the following morning admonished the public not to believe the rumors that there was any trouble in the southern states the confidential reports sent to mr thompson stated that armed fighting had broken out between georgia and alabama for the possession of a factory manufacturing electrical equipmenta factory cut off by the fighting and by blasted railroad tracks from any source of raw materials have you read the confidential reports i sent you moaned mr thompson that evening facing galt once more he was accompanied by james taggart who had volunteered to meet the prisoner for the first time galt sat on a straightbacked chair his legs crossed smoking a cigarette he seemed erect and relaxed together they could not decipher the expression on his face except that it showed no sign of apprehension i have he answered theres not much time left said mr thompson there isnt are you going to let such things go on are you how can you be so sure youre right cried james taggart his voice was not loud but it had the intensity of a cry how can you take it upon yourself at a terrible time like this to stick to your own ideas at the risk of destroying the whole world whose ideas should i consider safer to follow how can you be sure youre right how can you know nobody can be sure of his knowledge nobody youre no better than anyone else then why do you want me how can you gamble with other peoples lives how can you permit yourself such a selfish luxury as to hold out when people need you you mean when they need my ideas nobody is fully right or wrong there isnt any black or white you dont have a monopoly on truth there was something wrong in taggarts mannerthought mr thompson frowningsome odd too personal resentment as if it were not a political issue that he had come here to solve if you had any sense of responsibility taggart was saying you wouldnt dare take such a chance on nothing but your own judgment you would join us and consider some ideas other than your own and admit that we might be right too you would help us with our plans you would taggart went on speaking with feverish insistence but mr thompson could not tell whether galt was listening galt had risen and was pacing the room not in a manner of restlessness but in the casual manner of a man enjoying the motion of his own body mr thompson noted the lightness of the steps the straight spine the flat stomach the relaxed shoulders galt walked as if he were both unconscious of his body and tremendously conscious of his pride in it mr thompson glanced at james taggart at the sloppy posture of a tall figure slumped in ungainly selfdistortion and caught him watching galts movements with such hatred that mr thompson sat up fearing it would become audible in the room but galt was not looking at taggart your conscience taggart was saying i came here to appeal to your conscience how can you value your mind above thousands of human lives people are perishing andoh for christs sake he snapped stop pacing galt stopped is this an order no no said mr thompson hastily its not an order we dont want to give you orders take it easy jim galt resumed his pacing the world is collapsing said taggart his eyes following galt irresistibly people are perishingand its you who could save them does it matter whos right or wrong you should join us even if you think were wrong you should sacrifice your mind to save them by what means will i then save them who do you think you are cried taggart galt stopped you know it youre an egoist i am do you realize what sort of egoist you are do you asked galt looking straight at him it was the slow withdrawal of taggarts body into the depth of his armchair while his eyes were holding galts that made mr thompson unaccountably afraid of the next moment say mr thompson interrupted in a brightly casual voice what sort of cigarette are you smoking galt turned to him and smiled i dont know where did you get it one of your guards brought me a package of them he said some man asked him to give it to me as a present dont worry he added your boys have put it through every kind of test there were no hidden messages it was just a present from an anonymous admirer the cigarette between galts fingers bore the sign of the dollar james taggart was no good at the job of persuasion mr thompson concluded but chick morrison whom he brought the next day did no better i ill just throw myself on your mercy mr galt said chick morrison with a frantic smile youre right ill concede that youre rightand all i can appeal to is your pity deep down in my heart i cant believe that youre a total egoist who feels no pity for the people he pointed to a pile of papers he had spread on a table heres a plea signed by ten thousand schoolchildren begging you to join us and save them heres a plea from a home for the crippled heres a petition sent by the ministers of two hundred different faithsheres an appeal from the mothers of the country read them is this an order no cried mr thompson its not an order galt remained motionless not extending his hand for the papers these are just plain ordinary people mr galt said chick morrison in a tone intended to project their abject humility they cant tell you what to do they wouldnt know theyre merely begging you they may be weak helpless blind ignorant but you who are so intelligent and strong cant you take pity on them cant you help them by dropping my intelligence and following their blindness they may be wrong but they dont know any better but i who do should obey them i cant argue mr galt im just begging for your pity theyre suffering im begging you to pity those who suffer im mr galt he asked noticing that galt was looking off at the distance beyond the window and that his eyes were suddenly implacable whats the matter what are you thinking of hank rearden uh why did they feel any pity for hank rearden oh but thats different he shut up said galt evenly i only shut up snapped mr thompson dont mind him mr galt he hasnt slept for two nights hes scared out of his wits dr floyd ferris next day did not seem to be scaredbut it was worse thought mr thompson he observed that galt remained silent and would not answer ferris at all its the question of moral responsibility that you might not have studied sufficiently mr galt dr ferris was drawling in too airy too forced a tone of casual informality you seem to have talked on the radio about nothing but sins of commission but there are also the sins of omission to consider to fail to save a me is as immoral as to murder the consequences are the sameand since we must judge actions by their consequences the moral responsibility is the same for instance in view of the desperate shortage of food it has been suggested that it might become necessary to issue a directive ordering that every third one of all children under the age of ten and of all adults over the age of sixty be put to death to secure the survival of the rest you wouldnt want this to happen would you you can prevent it one word from you would prevent it if you refuse and all those people are executedit will be your fault and your moral responsibility youre crazy screamed mr thompson recovering from shock and leaping to his feet nobodys ever suggested any such thing nobodys ever considered it please mr galt dont believe him he doesnt mean it oh yes he does said galt tell the bastard to look at me then look in the mirror then ask himself whether i would ever think that my moral stature is at the mercy of his actions get out of here cried mr thompson yanking ferris to his feet get out dont let me hear another squeak out of you he flung the door open and pushed ferris at the startled face of a guard outside turning to galt he spread his arms and let them drop with a gesture of drained helplessness galts face was expressionless look said mr thompson pleadingly isnt there anybody who can talk to you theres nothing to talk about weve got to weve got to convince you is there anyone youd want to talk to no i thought maybe its because she talksused to talklike you at times maybe if i sent miss dagny taggart to tell you that one sure she used to talk like me shes my only failure i thought she was the kind who belonged on my side but she double crossed me to keep her railroad shed sell her soul for her railroad send her in if you want me to slap her face no no no you dont have to see her if thats how you feel i dont want to waste more time on people who rub you the wrong way only only if its not miss taggart i dont know whom to pick if if i could find somebody youd be willing to consider or ive changed my mind said galt there is somebody id like to speak to who cried mr thompson eagerly dr robert stadler mr thompson emitted a long whistle and shook his head apprehensively that one is no friend of yours he said in a tone of honest warning hes the one i want to see okay if you wish if you say so anything you wish ill have him here tomorrow morning that evening dining with wesley mouch in his own suite mr thompson glared angrily at a glass of tomato juice placed before him what no grapefruit juice he snapped his doctor had prescribed grapefruit juice as protection against an epidemic of colds no grapefruit juice said the waiter with an odd kind of emphasis fact is said mouch bleakly that a gang of raiders attacked a train at the taggart bridge on the mississippi they blew up the track and damaged the bridge nothing serious its being repairedbut all traffic is held up and the trains from arizona cant get through thats ridiculous arent there any other mr thompson stopped he knew that there were no other railroad bridges across the mississippi after a moment he spoke up in a staccato voice order army detachments to guard the bridge day and night tell them to pick their best men for it if anything happened to that bridge he did not finish he sat hunched staring down at the costly china plates and the delicate hors doeuvres before him the absence of so prosaic a commodity as grapefruit juice had suddenly made real to him for the first time what it was that would happen to the city of new york if anything happened to the taggart bridge dagny said eddie willers that evening the bridge is not the only problem he snapped on her desk lamp which in forced concentration on her work she had neglected to turn on at the approach of dusk no transcontinental trains can leave san francisco one of the fighting factions out therei dont know which onehas seized our terminal and imposed a departure tax on trains meaning that theyre holding trains for ransom our terminal manager has quit nobody knows what to do there now i cant leave new york she answered stonily i know he said softly thats why its wholl go there to straighten things out at least to find a man to put in charge no i dont want you to its too dangerous and what for it doesnt matter now theres nothing to save its still taggart transcontinental ill stand by it dagny wherever you go youll always be able to build a railroad i couldnt i dont even want to make a new start not any more not after what ive seen you should i cant let me do what i can eddie dont you want she stopped knowing that it was useless all right eddie if you wish im flying to california tonight ive arranged for space on an army plane i know that you will quit as soon as as soon as you can leave new york you might be gone by the time i return when youre ready just go dont worry about me dont wait to tell me go as fast as you can i ill say goodbye to you now she rose to her feet they stood facing each other in the dim half light of the office the picture of nathaniel taggart hung on the wall between them they were both seeing the years since that distant day when they had first learned to walk down the track of a railroad he inclined his head and held it lowered for a long moment she extended her hand goodbye eddie he clasped her hand firmly not looking down at his fingers he was looking at her face he started to go but stopped turned to her and asked his voice low but steady neither as plea nor as despair but as a last gesture of conscientious clarity to close a long ledger dagny did you know how i felt about you yes she said softly realizing in this moment that she had known it wordlessly for years i knew it goodbye dagny the faint rumble of an underground train went through the walls of the building and swallowed the sound of the door closing after him it was snowing next morning and melting drops were like an icy cutting touch on the temples of dr robert stadler as he walked down the long corridor of the waynefalkland hotel toward the door of the royal suite two husky men walked by his sides they were from the department of morale conditioning but did not trouble to hide what method of conditioning they would welcome a chance to employ just remember mr thompsons orders one of them told him contemptuously one wrong squawk out of youand youll regret it brother it was not the snow on his templesthought dr stadlerit was a burning pressure it had been there since that scene last night when he had screamed to mr thompson that he could not see john galt he had screamed in blind terror begging a circle of impassive faces not to make him do it sobbing that he would do anything but that the faces had not condescended to argue or even to threaten him they had merely given him orders he had spent a sleepless night telling himself that he would not obey but he was walking toward that door the burning pressure on his temples and the faint dizzying nausea of unreality came from the fact that he could not recapture the sense of being dr robert stadler he noticed the metallic gleam of the bayonets held by the guards at the door and the sound of a key being turned in a lock he found himself walking forward and heard the door being locked behind him across the long room he saw john galt sitting on the window sill a tall slender figure in slacks and shirt one leg slanting down to the floor the other bent his hands clasping his knee his head of sunstreaked hair raised against a spread of gray skyand suddenly dr stadler saw the figure of a young boy sitting on the porchrailing of his home near the campus of the patrick henry university with the sun on the chestnut hair of a head lifted against a spread of summer blue and he heard the passionate intensity of his own voice saying twentytwo years ago the only sacred value in the world john is the human mind the inviolate human mind and he cried to that boys figure across the room and across the years i couldnt help it john i couldnt help it he gripped the edge of a table between them for support and as a protective barrier even though the figure on the window sill had not moved i didnt bring you to this he cried i didnt mean to i couldnt help it its not what i intended john im not to blame for it im not i never had a chance against them they own the world they left me no place in it whats reason to them whats science you dont know how deadly they are you dont understand them they dont think theyre mindless animals moved by irrational feelingsby their greedy grasping blind unaccountable feelings they seize whatever they want thats all they know that they want it regardless of cause effect or logicthey want it the bloody grubbing pigs the mind dont you know how futile it is the mind against those mindless hordes our weapons are so helplessly laughably childish truth knowledge reason values rights force is all they know force fraud and plunder john dont look at me like that what could i do against their fists i had to live didnt i it wasnt for myselfit was for the future of science i had to be left alone i had to be protected i had to make terms with themtheres no way to live except on their termsthere isntdo you hear methere isnt what did you want me to do spend my life begging for jobs begging my inferiors for funds and endowments did you want my work to depend on the mercy of the ruffians who have a knack for making money i had no time to compete with them for money or markets or any of their miserable material pursuit was that your idea of justicethat they should spend their money on liquor yachts and women while the priceless hours of my life were wasted for lack of scientific equipment persuasion how could i persuade them what language could i speak to men who dont think you dont know how lonely i was how starved for some spark of intelligence how lonely and tired and helpless why should a mind like mine have to bargain with ignorant fools theyd never contribute a penny to science why shouldnt they be forced it wasnt you that i wanted to force that gun was not aimed at the intellect it wasnt aimed at men like you and me only at mindless materialists why do you look at me that way i had no choice there isnt any choice except to beat them at their own game oh yes it is their game they set the rules what do we count the few who can think we can only hope to get by unnoticedand to trick them into serving our aims dont you know how noble a purpose it wasmy vision of the future of science human knowledge set free of material bonds an unlimited end unrestricted by means i am not a traitor john im not i was serving the cause of the mind what i saw ahead what i wanted what i felt was not to be measured in their miserable dollars i wanted a laboratory i needed it what do i care where it came from or how i could do so much i could reach such heights dont you have any pity i wanted it what if they had to be forced who are they to think anyway why did you teach them to rebel it would have worked if you hadnt withdrawn them it would have worked i tell you it wouldnt belike this dont accuse me we cant be guilty all of us for centuries we cant be so totally wrong were not to be damned we had no choice there is no other way to live on earth why dont you answer me what are you seeing are you thinking of that speech you made i dont want to think of it it was only logic one cant live by logic do you hear me dont look at me youre asking the impossible men cant exist your way you permit no moments of weakness you dont allow for human frailties or human feelings what do you want of us rationality twentyfour hours a day with no loophole no rest no escape dont look at me god damn you im not afraid of you any longer do you hear me i am not afraid who are you to blame me you miserable failure heres where your road has brought you here you are caught helpless under guard to be killed by those brutes at any momentand you dare to accuse me of being impractical oh yes youre going to be killed you wont win you cant be allowed to win you are the man who has to be destroyed dr stadlers gasp was a muffled scream as if the immobility of the figure on the window sill had served as a silent reflector and had suddenly made him see the full meaning of his own words no moaned dr stadler moving his head from side to side to escape the unmoving green eyes no no no galts voice had the same unbending austerity as his eyes you have said everything i wanted to say to you dr stadler banged his fists against the door when it was opened he ran out of the room for three days no one entered galts suite except the guards who brought his meals early on the evening of the fourth day the door opened to admit chick morrison with two companions chick morrison was dressed in dinner clothes and his smile was nervous but a shade more confident than usual one of his companions was a valet the other was a muscular man whose face seemed to clash with his tuxedo it was a stony face with sleepy eyelids pale darting eyes and a prizefighters broken nose his skull was shaved except for a patch of faded blond curls on top he kept his right hand in the pocket of his trousers you will please dress mr galt said chick morrison persuasively pointing to the door of the bedroom where a closet had been filled with expensive garments which galt had not chosen to wear you will please put on your dinner clothes he added this is an order mr galt galt walked silently into the bedroom the three men followed chick morrison sat on the edge of a chair starting and discarding one cigarette after another the valet went through too many too courteous motions helping galt to dress handing him his shirt studs holding his coat the muscular man stood in a corner his hand in his pocket no one said a word you will please cooperate mr galt said chick morrison when galt was ready and indicated the door with a courtly gesture of invitation to proceed so swiftly that no one could catch the motion of his hand the muscular man was holding galts arm and pressing an invisible gun against his ribs dont make any false moves he said in an expressionless voice i never do said galt chick morrison opened the door the valet stayed behind the three figures in dinner clothes walked silently down the hall to the elevator they remained silent in the elevator the clicks of the flashing numbers above the door marking their downward progress the elevator stopped on the mezzanine floor two armed soldiers preceded them and two others followed as they walked through the long dim corridors the corridors were deserted except for armed sentinels posted at the turns the muscular mans right arm was linked to galts left the gun remained invisible to any possible observer galt felt the small pressure of the muzzle against his side the pressure was expertly maintained not to be felt as an impediment and not to be forgotten for a moment the corridor led to a wide closed doorway the soldiers seemed to melt away into the shadows when chick morrisons hand touched the doorknob it was his hand that opened the door but the sudden contrast of light and sound made it seem as if the door were flung open by an explosion the light came from three hundred bulbs in the blazing chandeliers of the grand ballroom of the waynefalkland hotel the sound was the applause of five hundred people chick morrison led the way to the speakers table raised on a platform above the tables filling the room the people seemed to know without announcement that of the two figures following him it was the tall slender man with the goldcopper hair that they were applauding his face had the same quality as the voice they had heard on the radio calm confidentand out of reach the seat reserved for galt was the place of honor in the center of the long table with mr thompson waiting for him at his right and the muscular man slipping skillfully into the seat at his left not relinquishing his arm or the pressure of the muzzle the jewels on the naked shoulders of women carried the glitter of the chandeliers to the shadows of the tables crowded against the distant walls the severe blackand white of the mens figures rescued the rooms style of solemnly regal luxury from the discordant slashes made by news cameras microphones and a dormant array of television equipment the crowd was on its feet applauding mr thompson was smiling and watching galts face with the eager anxious look of an adult waiting for a childs reaction to a spectacularly generous gift galt sat facing the ovation neither ignoring it nor responding the applause you are hearing a radio announcer was yelling into a microphone in a corner of the room is in greeting to john galt who has just taken his place at the speakers table yes my friends john galt in personas those of you who can find a television set will have a chance to see for yourself in a short while i must remember where i amthought dagny clenching her fists under the tablecloth in the obscurity of a side table it was hard to maintain a sense of double reality in the presence of galt thirty feet away from her she felt that no danger or pain could exist in the world so long as she could see his faceand simultaneously an icy terror when she looked at those who held him in their power when she remembered the blind irrationality of the event they were staging she fought to keep her facial muscles rigid not to betray herself by a smile of happiness or by a scream of panic she wondered how his eyes had been able to find her in that crowd she had seen the brief pause of his glance which no one else could notice the glance had been more than a kiss it had been a handshake of approval and support he did not glance again in her direction she could not force herself to look away it was startling to see him in evening clothes and more startling still that he wore them so naturally he made them look like a work uniform of honor his figure suggested the kind of banquet in the days of a distant past where he would have been receiving an industrial award celebrationsshe remembered her own words with a stab of longingshould be only for those who have something to celebrate she turned away she struggled not to look at him too often not to attract the attention of her companions she had been placed at a table prominent enough to display her to the assembly but obscure enough to keep her out of the line of galts sight along with those who had incurred galts disfavor with dr ferris and eugene lawson her brother jim she noted had been placed closer to the platform she could see his sullen face among the nervous figures of tinky holloway fred kinnan dr simon pritchett the tortured faces strung out above the speakers table were not succeeding in their efforts to hide that they looked like men enduring an ordeal the calm of galts face seemed radiant among them she wondered who was prisoner here and who was master her glance moved slowly down the lineup of his table mr thompson wesley mouch chick morrison some generals some members of the legislature and preposterously mr mowen chosen as a bribe to galt as a symbol of big business she glanced about the room looking for the face of dr stadler he was not present the voices filling the room were like a fever chart she thought they kept darting too high and collapsing into patches of silence the occasional spurts of someones laughter broke off incompleted and attracted the shuddering turn of the heads at the neighboring tables the faces were drawn and twisted by the most obvious and least dignified form of tension by forced smiles these peopleshe thoughtknew not by means of their reason but by means of their panic that this banquet was the ultimate climax and the naked essence of their world they knew that neither their god nor their guns could make this celebration mean what they were struggling to pretend it meant she could not swallow the food that was placed before her her throat seemed closed by a rigid convulsion she noticed that the others at her table were also merely pretending to eat dr ferris was the only one whose appetite seemed unaffected when she saw a slush of ice cream in a crystal bowl before her she noticed the sudden silence of the room and heard the screeching of the television machinery being dragged forward for action nowshe thought with a sinking sense of expectation and knew that the same question mark was on every mind in the room they were all staring at galt his face did not move or change no one had to call for silence when mr thompson waved to an announcer the room did not seem to breathe fellow citizens the announcer cried into a microphone of this country and of any other thats able to listenfrom the grand ballroom of the waynefalkland hotel in new york city we are bringing you the inauguration of the john galt plan a rectangle of tensely bluish light appeared on the wall behind the speakers tablea television screen to project for the guests the images which the country was now to see the john galt plan for peace prosperity and profit cried the announcer while a shivering picture of the ballroom sprang into view on the screen the dawn of a new age the product of a harmonious collaboration between the humanitarian spirit of our leaders and the scientific genius of john galt if your faith in the future has been undermined by vicious rumors you may now see for yourself our happily united family of leadership ladies and gentlemenas the television camera swooped down to the speakers table and the stupefied face of mr mowen filled the screenmr horace bussby mowen the american industrialist the camera moved to an aged collection of facial muscles shaped in imitation of a smile general of the array whittington s thorpe the camera like an eye at a police lineup moved from face to scarred facescarred by the ravages of fear of evasion of despair of uncertainty of selfloathing of guilt majority leader of the national legislature mr lucian phelps mr wesley mouch mr thompson the camera paused on mr thompson he gave a big grin to the nation then turned and looked off screen to his left with an air of triumphant expectancy ladies and gentlemen the announcer said solemnly john galt good godthought dagnywhat are they doing from the screen the face of john galt was looking at the nation the face without pain or fear or guilt implacable by virtue of serenity invulnerable by virtue of selfesteem this faceshe thoughtamong those others whatever it is that theyre planning she thought its undonenothing more can or has to be saidtheres the product of one code and of the other theres the choice and whoever is human will know it mr galts personal secretary said the announcer while the camera blurred hastily past the next face and went on mr clarence chick morrison admiral homer dawley mr she looked at the faces around her wondering did they see the contrast did they know it did they see him did they want him to be real this banquet said chick morrison who had taken over as master of ceremonies is in honor of the greatest figure of our time the ablest producer the man of the knowhow the new leader of our economyjohn galt if you have heard his extraordinary radio speech you can have no doubt that he can make things work now he is here to tell you that he will make them work for you if you have been misled by those oldfashioned extremists who claimed that he would never join us that no merger is possible between his way of life and ours that its either one or the othertonights event will prove to you that anything can be reconciled and united once they have seen himthought dagnycan they wish to look at anybody else once they know that he is possible that this is what man can be what else can they want to seek can they now feel any desire except to achieve in their souls what he has achieved in his or are they going to be stopped by the fact that the mouches the morrisons the thompsons of the world had not chosen to achieve it are they going to regard the mouches as the human and him as the impossible the camera was roving over the ballroom flashing to the screen and to the country the faces of the prominent guests the faces of the tensely watchful leaders andonce in a whilethe face of john galt he looked as if his perceptive eyes were studying the men outside this room the men who were seeing him across the country one could not tell whether he was listening no reaction altered the composure of his face i am proud to pay tribute tonight said the leader of the legislature the next speaker to the greatest economic organizer the world has ever discovered the most gifted administrator the most brilliant plannerjohn galt the man who will save us i am here to thank him in the name of the people thisthought dagny with a sickened amusementwas the spectacle of the sincerity of the dishonest the most fraudulent part of the fraud was that they meant it they were offering galt the best that their view of existence could offer they were trying to tempt him with that which was their dream of lifes highest fulfillment this spread of mindless adulation the unreality of this enormous pretenseapproval without standards tribute without content honor without causes admiration without reasons love without a code of values we have discarded all our petty differences wesley mouch was now saying into the microphone all partisan opinions all personal interests and selfish viewsin order to serve under the selfless leadership of john galt why are they listeningthought dagny dont they see the hallmark of death in those faces and the hallmark of life in his which state do they wish to choose which state do they seek for mankind she looked at the faces in the ballroom they were nervously blank they showed nothing but the sagging weight of lethargy and the staleness of a chronic fear they were looking at galt and at mouch as if unable to perceive any difference between them or to feel concern if a difference existed their empty uncritical unvaluing stare declaring who am i to know she shuddered remembering his sentence the man who declares who am i to know is declaring who am i to live did they care to liveshe thought they did not seem to care even for the effort of raising that question she saw a few faces who seemed to care they were looking at galt with a desperate plea with a wistfully tragic admirationand with hands lying limply on the tables before them these were the men who saw what he was who lived in frustrated longing for his worldbut tomorrow if they saw him being murdered before them their hands would hang as limply and their eyes would look away saying who am i to act unity of action and purpose said mouch will bring us to a happier world mr thompson leaned toward galt and whispered with an amiable smile youll have to say a few words to the country later on after me no no not a long speech just a sentence or two no more just hello folks or something like that so theyll recognize your voice the faintly stressed pressure of the secretarys muzzle against galts side added a silent paragraph galt did not answer the john galt plan wesley mouch was saying will reconcile all conflicts it will protect the property of the rich and give a greater share to the poor it will cut down the burden of your taxes and provide you with more government benefits it will lower prices and raise wages it will give more freedom to the individual and strengthen the bonds of collective obligations it will combine the efficiency of free enterprise with the generosity of a planned economy dagny observed some facesit took her an effort fully to believe itwho were looking at galt with hatred jim was one of them she noted when the image of mouch held the screen these faces were relaxed in bored contentment which was not pleasure but the comfort of license of knowing that nothing was demanded of them and nothing was firm or certain when the camera flashed the image of galt their lips grew tight and their features were sharpened by a look of peculiar caution she felt with sudden certainty that they feared the precision of his face the unyielding clarity of his features the look of being an entity a look of asserting existence they hate him for being himselfshe thought feeling a touch of cold horror as the nature of their souls became real to herthey hate him for his capacity to live do they want to liveshe thought in selfmockery through the stunned numbness of her mind she remembered the sound of his sentence the desire not to be anything is the desire not to be it was now mr thompson who was yelling into the microphone in his briskest and folksiest manner and i say to you kick them in the teeth all those doubters whore spreading disunity and fear they told you that john galt would never join us didnt they well here he is in person of his own free choice at this table and at the head of our state ready willing and able to serve the peoples cause dont you ever again any of you start doubting or running or giving up tomorrow is here todayand what a tomorrow with three meals a day for everyone on earth with a car in every garage and with electric power given free produced by some sort of a motor the like of which weve never seen and all you have to do is just be patient a little while longer patience faith and unitythats the recipe for progress we must stand united among ourselves and united with the rest of the world as a great big happy family all working for the good of all we have found a leader who will beat the record of our richest and busiest past its his love for mankind that has made him come hereto serve you protect you and take care of you he has heard your pleas and has answered the call of our common human duty every man is his brothers keeper no man is an island unto himself and now you will hear his voicenow you will hear his own message ladies and gentlemen he said solemnly john galtto the collective family of mankind the camera moved to galt he remained still for a moment then with so swift and expert a movement that his secretarys hand was unable to match it he rose to his feet leaning sidewise leaving the pointed gun momentarily exposed to the sight of the worldthen standing straight facing the cameras looking at all his invisible viewers he said get the hell out of my way chapter ix the generator get the hell out of my way dr robert stadler heard it on the radio in his car he did not know whether the next sound partgasp partscream partlaughter started rising from him or from the radiobut he heard the click that cut them both off the radio went dead no further sounds came from the waynefalkland hotel he jerked his hand from knob to knob under the lighted dial nothing came through no explanations no pleas of technical trouble no silencehiding music all stations were off the air he shuddered he gripped the wheel leaning forward across it like a jockey at the close of a race and his foot pressed down on the accelerator the small stretch of highway before him bounced with the leaping of his headlights there was nothing beyond the lighted strip but the emptiness of the prairies of iowa he did not know why he had been listening to the broadcast he did not know what made him tremble now he chuckled abruptlyit sounded like a malevolent growleither at the radio or at those in the city or at the sky he was watching the rare posts of highway numbers he did not need to consult a map for four days that map had been printed on his brain like a net of lines traced in acid they could not take it away from him he thought they could not stop him he felt as if he were being pursued but there was nothing for miles behind him except the two red lights on the rear of his carlike two small signals of danger fleeing through the darkness of the iowa plains the motive directing his hands and feet was four days behind him it was the face of the man on the window sill and the faces he had confronted when he had escaped from that room he had cried to them that he could not deal with galt and neither could they that galt would destroy them all unless they destroyed him first dont get smart professor mr thompson had answered coldly youve done an awful lot of yelling about hating his guts but when it comes to action you havent helped us at all i dont know which side youre on if he doesnt give in to us peaceably we might have to resort to pressuresuch as hostages whom he wouldnt want to see hurtand youre first on the list professor i he had screamed shaking with terror and with bitterly desperate laughter i but he damns me more than anyone on earth how do i know mr thompson had answered i hear that you used to be his teacher arid dont forget youre the only one he asked for his mind liquid with terror he had felt as if he were about to be crushed between two walls advancing upon him he had no chance if galt refused to surrenderand less chance if galt joined these men it was then that a distant shape had come swimming forward in his mind the image of a mushroomdomed structure in the middle of an iowa plain all images had begun to fuse in his mind thereafter project xhe had thought not knowing whether it was the vision of that structure or of a feudal castle commanding the countryside that gave him the sense of an age and a world to which he belonged im robert stadler he had thoughtits my property it came from my discoveries they said it was i who invented it ill show themhe had thought not knowing whether he meant the man on the window sill or the others or the whole of mankind his thoughts had become like chips floating in a liquid without connections to seize control ill show them to seize control to rule there is no other way to live on earth these had been the only words that named the plan in his mind he had felt that the rest was clear to himclear in the form of a savage emotion crying defiantly that he did not have to make it clear he would seize control of project x and he would rule a part of the country as his private feudal domain the means his emotion had answered somehow the motive his mind had repeated insistently that his motive was terror of mr thompsons gang that he was not safe among them any longer that his plan was a practical necessity in the depth of his liquid brain his emotion had held another kind of terror drowned along with the connections between his broken chips of words these chips had been the only compass directing his course through four days and nightswhile he drove down deserted highways across a country collapsing into chaos while he developed a monomaniacs cunning for obtaining illegal purchases of gas while he snatched random hours of restless sleep in obscure motels under assumed names im robert stadlerhe had thought his mind repeating it as a formula of omnipotence to seize controlhe had thought speeding against the futile traffic lights of halfabandoned townsspeeding on the vibrating steel of the taggart bridge across the mississippispeeding past the occasional ruins of farms in the empty stretches of iowa ill show themhe had thoughtlet them pursue they wont stop me this time he had thought it even though no one had pursued himas no one was pursuing him now but the taillights of his own car and the motive drowned in his mind he looked at his silent radio and chuckled the chuckle had the emotional quality of a fist being shaken at space its i who am practicalhe thoughti have no choice i have no other way ill show all those insolent gangsters who forget that i am robert stadler they will all collapse but i wont ill survive ill win ill show them the words were like chunks of solid ground in his mind in the midst of a fiercely silent swamp the connections lay submerged at the bottom if connected his words would have formed the sentence ill show him that there is no other way to live on earth the scattered lights in the distance ahead were the barracks erected on the site of project x now known as harmony city he observed as he came closer that something out of the ordinary was going on at project x the barbedwire fence was broken and no sentinels met him at the gate but some sort of abnormal activity was churning in the patches of darkness and in the glare of some wavering spotlights there were armored trucks and running figures and shouted orders and the gleam of bayonets no one stopped his car at the corner of a shanty he saw the motionless body of a soldier sprawled on the ground drunkhe thought preferring to think it wondering why he felt unsure of it the mushroom structure crouched on a knoll before him there were lights in the narrow slits of its windowsand the shapeless funnels protruded from under its dome aimed at the darkness of the country a soldier barred his way when he alighted from his car at the entrance the soldier was properly armed but hatless and his uniform seemed too sloppy where are you going bud he asked let me in dr stadler ordered contemptuously whats your business here im dr robert stadler im joe blow i said whats your business are you one of the new or one of the old let me in you idiot im dr robert stadler it was not the name but the tone of voice and the form of address that seemed to convince the soldier one of the new he said and opening the door shouted to somebody inside hey mac take care of grandpaw here see what he wants in the bare dim hall of reinforced concrete he was met by a man who might have been an officer except that his tunic was open at the throat and a cigarette hung insolently in the corner of his mouth who are you he snapped his hand jerking too swiftly to the holster on his hip im dr robert stadler the name had no effect who gave you permission to come here i need no permission this seemed to have an effect the man removed the cigarette from his mouth who sent for you he asked a shade uncertainly will you please let me speak to the commandant dr stadler demanded impatiently the commandant youre too late brother the chief engineer then the chiefwho oh willie willies okay hes one of us but hes out on an errand just now there were other figures in the hall listening with an apprehensive curiosity the officers hand summoned one of them to approachan unshaved civilian with a shabby overcoat thrown over his shoulders what do you want he snapped at stadler would someone please tell me where are the gentlemen of the scientific staff dr stadler asked in the courteously peremptory tone of an order the two men glanced at each other as if such a question were irrelevant in this place do you come from washington the civilian asked suspiciously i do not i will have you understand that im through with that washington gang oh the man seemed pleased are you a friend of the people then i would say that im the best friend the people ever had im the man who gave them all this he pointed around him you did said the man impressed are you one of those who made a deal with the boss im the boss here from now on the men looked at each other retreating a few steps the officer asked did you say the name was stadler robert stadler and if you dont know what that means youll find out will you please follow me sir said the officer with shaky politeness what happened next was not clear to dr stadler because his mind refused to admit the reality of the things he was seeing there were shifting figures in halflighted disordered offices there were too many firearms on everybodys hips there were senseless questions asked of him by jerky voices that alternated between impertinence and fear he did not know whether any of them tried to give him an explanation he would not listen he could not permit this to be true he kept stating in the tone of a feudal sovereign im the boss here from now on i give the orders i came to take over i own this place i am dr robert stadlerand if you dont know that name in this place you have no business being here you infernal idiots youll blow yourselves to pieces if thats the state of your knowledge have you had a highschool course in physics you dont look to me as if youve ever been allowed inside a high school any of you what are you doing here who are you it took him a long time to graspwhen his mind could not block it any longerthat somebody had beaten him to his plan somebody had held the same view of existence as his own and had set out to achieve the same future he grasped that these men who called themselves the friends of the people had seized possession of project x tonight a few hours ago intending to establish a reign of their own he laughed in their faces with bitterly incredulous contempt you dont know what youre doing you miserable juvenile delinquents do you think that youyoucan handle a highprecision instrument of science who is your leader i demand to see your leader it was his tone of overbearing authority his contempt and their own panicthe blind panic of men of unbridled violence who have no standards of safety or dangerthat made them waver and wonder whether he was perhaps some secret toplevel member of their leadership they were equally ready to defy or to obey any authority after being shunted from one jittery commander to another he found himself at last being led down iron stairways and down long echoing underground corridors of reinforced concrete to an audience with the boss in person the boss had taken refuge in the underground control room among the complex spirals of the delicate scientific machinery that produced the sound ray against the wall panel of glittering levers dials and gauges known as the xylophone robert stadler faced the new ruler of project x it was cuffy meigs he wore a tight semimilitary tunic and leather leggings the flesh of his neck bulged over the edge of his collar his black curls were matted with sweat he was pacing restlessly unsteadily in front of the xylophone shouting orders to men who kept rushing in and out of the room send couriers to every county seat within our reach tell em that the friends of the people have won tell em theyre not to take orders from washington any longer the new capital of the peoples commonwealth is harmony city henceforth to be known as meigsville tell em that ill expect five hundred thousand dollars per every five thousand heads of population by tomorrow morningor else it took some time before cuffy meigs attention and bleary brown eyes could be drawn to focus on the person of dr stadler well what is it what is it he snapped i am dr robert stadler huh oh yeah yeah youre the big guy from outer spaces arent you youre the fellow who catches atoms or something well what on earth are you doing here it is i who should ask you that question huh look professor im in no mood for jokes i have come here to take control control of what of this equipment of this place of the countryside within its radius of operation meigs stared at him blankly for a moment then asked softly how did you get here by car i mean whom did you bring with you nobody what weapons did you bring none my name is sufficient you came here alone with your name and your car i did cuffy meigs burst out laughing in his face do you think asked dr stadler that you can operate an installation of this kind run along professor run along beat it before i have you shot weve got no use for intellectuals around here how much do you know about this dr stadler pointed at the xylophone who cares technicians are a dime a dozen these days beat it this aint washington im through with those impractical dreamers in washington they wont get anywhere bargaining with that radio ghost and making speeches actionthats whats needed direct action beat it doc your day is over he was weaving unsteadily back and forth catching at a lever of the xylophone once in a while dr stadler realized that meigs was drunk dont touch those levers you fool meigs jerked his hand back involuntarily then waved it defiantly at the panel ill touch anything i please dont you tellme what to do get away from that panel get out of here this is mine do you understand its my property property huh meigs gave a brief bark that was a chuckle i invented it i created it i made it possible you did well many thanks doc many thanks but we dont need you any longer weve got our own mechanics have you any idea what i had to know in order to make it possible you couldnt think of a single tube of it not a single bolt meigs shrugged maybe not then how dare you think that you can own it how dare you come here what claim do you have to it meigs patted his holster this listen you drunken lout cried dr stadler do you know what youre playing with dont you talk to me like that you old fool who are you to talk to me like that i can break your neck with my bare hands dont you know who i am youre a scared thug way out of his depth oh i am am i im the boss im the boss and im not going to be stopped by an old scarecrow like you get out of here they stood staring at each other for a moment by the panel of the xylophone both cornered by terror the unadmitted root of dr stadlers terror was his frantic struggle not to acknowledge that he was looking at his final product that this was his spiritual son cuffy meigs terror had wider roots it embraced all of existence he had lived in chronic terror all his life but now he was struggling not to acknowledge what it was that he had dreaded in the moment of his triumph when he expected to be safe that mysterious occult breedthe intellectual was refusing to fear him and defying his power get out of here snarled cuffy meigs ill call my men ill have you shot get out of here you lousy brainless swaggering moron snarled dr stadler do you think ill let you cash in on my life do you think its for you that i that i sold he did not finish stop touching those levers god damn you dont you give me orders i dont need you to tell me what to do youre not going to scare me with your classy mumbojumbo ill do as i please what did i fight for if i cant do as i please he chuckled and reached for a lever hey cuffy take it easy yelled some figure in the back of the room darting forward stand back roared cuffy meigs stand back all of you scared am i ill show you whos boss dr stadler leaped to stop himbut meigs shoved him aside with one arm gave a gulp of laughter at the sight of stadler falling to the floor and with the other arm yanked a lever of the xylophone the crash of soundthe screeching crash of ripped metal and of pressures colliding on conflicting circuits the sound of a monster turn ing upon itselfwas heard only inside the structure no sound was heard outside outside the structure merely rose into the air suddenly and silently cracked open into a few large pieces shot some hissing streaks of blue light to the sky and came down as a pile of rubble within the circle of a radius of a hundred miles enclosing parts of four states telegraph poles fell like matchsticks farmhouses collapsed into chips city buildings went down as if slashed and minced by a single seconds blow with no time for a sound to be heard by the twisted bodies of the victimsand on the circles periphery halfway across the mississippi the engine and the first six cars of a passenger train flew as a shower of metal into the water of the river along with the western spans of the taggart bridge cut in half on the site of what had once been project x nothing remained alive among the ruinsexcept for some endless minutes longer a huddle of torn flesh and screaming pain that had once been a great mind there was a sense of weightless freedomthought dagnyin the feeling that a telephone booth was her only immediate absolute goal with no concern for any of the goals of the passersby in the streets around her it did not make her feel estranged from the city it made her feel for the first time that she owned the city and that she loved it that she had never loved it before as she did in this moment with so personal solemn and confident a sense of possession the night was still and clear she looked at the sky as her feeling was more solemn than joyous but held the sense of a future joyso the air was more windless than warm but held the hint of a distant spring get the hell out of my wayshe thought not with resentment but almost with amusement with a sense of detachment and deliverance addressing it to the passersby to the traffic when it impeded her hurried progress and to any fear she had known in the past it was less than an hour ago that she had heard him utter that sentence and his voice still seemed to ring in the air of the streets merging into a distant hint of laughter she had laughed exultantly in the ballroom of the waynefalkland when she had heard him say it she had laughed her hand pressed to her mouth so that the laughter was only in her eyesand in his when he had looked straight at her and she had known that he heard it they had looked at each other for the span of a second above the heads of the gasping screaming crowdabove the crash of the microphones being shattered though all stations had been instantly cut offabove the bursts of breaking glass on falling tables as some people went stampeding to the doors then she had heard mr thompson cry waving his arm at galt take him back to his room but guard him with your livesand the crowd had parted as three men led him out mr thompson seemed to collapse for a moment dropping his forehead on his arm but he rallied jumped to his feet waved vaguely at his henchmen to follow and rushed out through a private side exit no one addressed or instructed the guests some were running blindly to escape others sat still not daring to move the ballroom was like a ship without captain she cut through the crowd and followed the clique no one tried to stop her she found them huddled in a small private study mr thompson was slumped in an armchair clutching his head with both hands wesley mouch was moaning eugene lawson was sobbing with the sound of a nasty childs rage jim was watching the others with an oddly expectant intensity i told you so dr ferris was shouting i told you so didnt i thats where you get with your peaceful persuasion she remained standing by the door they seemed to notice her presence but they did not seem to care i resign yelled chick morrison i resign im through i dont know what to say to the country i cant think i wont try its no use i couldnt help it youre not going to blame me ive resigned he waved his arms in some shapeless gesture of futility or farewell and ran out of the room he has a hideout all stocked for himself in tennessee said tinky holloway reflectively as if he too had taken a similar precaution and were now wondering whether the time had come he wont keep it for long if he gets there at all said mouch with the gangs of raiders and the state of transportation he spread his hands and did not finish she knew what thoughts were filling the pause she knew that no matter what private escapes these men had once provided for themselves they were now grasping the fact that all of them were trapped she observed that there was no terror in their faces she saw hints of it but it looked like a perfunctory terror their expressions ranged from blank apathy to the relieved look of cheats who had believed that the game could end no other way and were making no effort to contest it or regret itto the petulant blindness of lawson who refused to be conscious of anythingto the peculiar intensity of jim whose face suggested a secret smile well well dr ferris was asking impatiently with the crackling energy of a man who feels at home in a world of hysteria what are you now going to do with him argue debate make speeches no one answered he has to save us said mouch slowly as if straining the last of his mind into blankness and delivering an ultimatum to reality he has to take over and save the system why dont you write him a love letter about it said ferris weve got to make him take over weve got to force him to rule said mouch in the tone of a sleepwalker now said ferris suddenly dropping his voice do you see what a valuable establishment the state science institute really is mouch did not answer him but she observed that they all seemed to know what he meant you objected to that private research project of mine as impractical said ferris softly but what did i tell you mouch did not answer he was cracking his knuckles this is no time for squeamishness james taggart spoke up with unexpected vigor but his voice too was oddly low we dont have to be sissies about it it seems to me said mouch dully that that the end justifies the means its too late for any scruples or any principles said ferris only direct action can work now no one answered they were acting as if they wished that their pauses not their words would state what they were discussing it wont work said tinky holloway he wont give in thats what you think said ferris and chuckled you havent seen our experimental model in action last month we got three confessions in three unsolved murder cases if started mr thompson and his voice cracked suddenly into a moan if he dies we all perish dont worry said ferris he wont the ferris persuader is safely calculated against that possibility mr thompson did not answer it seems to me that we have no other choice said mouch it was almost a whisper they remained silent mr thompson was struggling not to see that they were all looking at him then he cried suddenly oh do anything you want i couldnt help it do anything you want dr ferris turned to lawson gene he said tensely still whispering run to the radiocontrol office order all stations to stand by tell them that ill have mr galt on the air within three hours lawson leaped to his feet with a sudden mirthful grin and ran out of the room she knew she knew what they intended doing and what it was within them that made it possible they did not think that this would succeed they did not think that galt would give in they did not want him to give in they did not think that anything could save them now they did not want to be saved moved by the panic of their nameless emotions they had fought against reality all their livesand now they had reached a moment when at last they felt at home they did not have to know why they felt it they who had chosen never to know what they feltthey merely experienced a sense of recognition since this was what they had been seeking this was die kind of reality that had been implied in all of their feelings their actions their dsires their choices their dreams this was the nature and the method of the rebellion against existence and of the undefined quest for an unnamed nirvana they did not want to live they wanted him to die the horror she felt was only a brief stab like the wrench of a switching perspective she grasped that the objects she had thought to be human were not she was left with a sense of clarity of a final answer and of the need to act he was in danger there was no time and no room in her consciousness to waste emotion on the actions of the subhuman we must make sure wesley mouch was whispering that nobody ever learns about it nobody will said ferris their voices had the cautious drone of conspirators its a secret separate unit on the institute grounds soundproofed and safely distant from the rest only a very few of our staff have ever entered it if we were to fly said mouch and stopped abruptly as if he had caught some warning in ferris face she saw ferris eyes move to her as if he had suddenly remembered her presence she held his glance letting him see the untroubled indifference of hers as if she had neither cared nor understood then as if merely grasping the signal of a private discussion she turned slowly with the suggestion of a shrug and left the room she knew that they were now past the stage of worrying about her she walked with the same unhurried indifference through the halls and through the exit of the hotel but a block away when she had turned a corner her head flew up and the folds of her evening gown slammed like a sail against her legs with the sudden violence of the speed of her steps and now as she rushed through the darkness thinking only of finding a telephone booth she felt a new sensation rising irresistibly within her past the immediate tension of danger and concern it was the sense of freedom of a world that had never had to be obstructed she saw the wedge of light on the sidewalk that came from the window of a bar no one gave her a second glance as she crossed the half deserted room the few customers were still waiting and whispering tensely in front of the crackling blue void of an empty television screen standing in the tight space of the telephone booth as in the cabin of a ship about to take off for a different planet she dialed the number or the voice that answered at once was franciscos hello francisco hello dagny i was expecting you to call did you hear the broadcast i did they are now planning to force him to give in she kept her voice to the tone of a factual report they intend to torture him they have some machine called the ferris persuader in an isolated unit on the grounds of the state science institute its in new hampshire they mentioned flying they mentioned that they would have him on the radio within three hours i see are you calling from a public phone booth yes youre still in evening clothes arent you yes now listen carefully go home change your clothes pack a few things youll need take your jewelry and any valuables that you can carry take some warm clothing we wont have time to do it later meet me in forty minutes on the northwest corner two blocks east of the main entrance of the taggart terminal right so long slug so long frisco she was in the bedroom of her apartment in less than five minutes tearing off her evening gown she left it lying in the middle of the floor like the discarded uniform of an army she was not serving any longer she put on a dark blue suit andremembering galts wordsa white highcollared sweater she packed a suitcase and a bag with a strap that she could carry swung over her shoulder she put her jewelry in a corner of the bag including the bracelet of rearden metal she had earned in the outside world and the fivedollar gold piece she had earned in the valley it was easy to leave the apartment and to lock the door even though she knew she would probably never open it again it seemed harder for a moment when she came to her office no one had seen her come in the anteroom of her office was empty the great taggart building seemed unusually quiet she stood looking for a moment at this room and at all the years it had contained then she smiledno it was not too hard she thought she opened her safe and took the documents she had come here to get there was nothing else that she wanted to take from her officeexcept the picture of nathaniel taggart and the map of taggart transcontinental she broke the two frames folded the picture and the map and slipped them into her suitcase she was locking the suitcase when she heard the sound of hurrying steps the door flew open and the chief engineer rushed in he was shaking his face was distorted miss taggart he cried oh thank god miss taggart youre here weve been calling for you all over she did not answer she looked at him inquiringly miss taggart have you heard what then you havent oh god miss taggart its i cant believe it i still cant believe it but oh god what are we going to do the the taggart bridge is gone she stared at him unable to move its gone blown up blown up apparently in one second nobody knows for certain what happenedbut it looks like they think that something went wrong at project x and it looks like those sound rays miss taggart we cant get through to any point within a radius of a hundred miles its not possible it cant be possible but it looks as if everything in that circle has been wiped out we cant get any answers nobody can get an answerthe newspapers the radio stations the police were still checking but the stories that are coming from the rim of that circle are he shuddered only one thing is certain the bridge is gone miss taggart we dont know what to do she leaped to her desk and seized the telephone receiver her hand stopped in midair then slowly twistedly with the greatest effort ever demanded of her she began to move her arm down to place the receiver back it seemed to her that it took a long time as if her arm had to move against some atmospheric pressure that no human body could combatand in the span of these few brief moments in the stillness of a blinding pain she knew what francisco had felt that night twelve years agoand what a boy of twentysix had felt when he had looked at his motor for the last time miss taggart cried the chief engineer we dont know what to do the receiver clicked softly back into its cradle i dont either she answered in a moment she knew it was over she heard her voice telling the man to check further and report to her laterand she waited for the sound of his steps to vanish in the echoing silence of the hall crossing the concourse of the terminal for the last time she glanced at the statue of nathaniel taggartand remembered a promise she had made it would be only a symbol now she thought but it would be the kind of farewell that nathaniel taggart deserved she had no other writing instrument so she took the lipstick from her bag and smiling up at the marble face of the man who would have understood she drew a large sign of the dollar on the pedestal under his feet she was first to reach the corner two blocks east of the terminal entrance as she waited she observed the first trickles of the panic that was soon to engulf the city there were automobiles driving too fast some of them loaded with household effects there were too many police cars speeding by and too many sirens bursting in the distance the news of the destruction of the bridge was apparently spreading through the city they would know that the city was doomed and they would start a stampede to escapebut they had no place to go and it was not her concern any longer she saw franciscos figure approaching from some distance away she recognized the swiftness of his walk before she could distinguish the face under the cap pulled low over his eyes she caught the moment when he saw her as he came closer he waved his arm with a smile of greeting some conscious stress in the sweep of his arm made it the gesture of a danconia welcoming the arrival of a longawaited traveler at the gates of his own domain when he approached she stood solemnly straight and looking at his face and at the buildings of the greatest city in the world as at the kind of witnesses she wanted she said slowly her voice confident and steady i swearby my life and my love of itthat i will never live for the sake of another man nor ask another man to live for mine he inclined his head as if in sign of admittance his smile was now a salute then he took her suitcase with one hand her arm with the other and said come on the unit known as project fin honor of its originator dr fernswas a small structure of reinforced concrete low on the slope of the hill that supported the state science institute on a higher more public level only the small gray patch of the units roof could be seen from the institutes windows hidden in a jungle of ancient trees it looked no bigger than the cover of a manhole the unit consisted of two stories in the shape of a small cube placed asymmetrically on top of a larger one the first story had no windows only a door studded with iron spikes the second story had but one window as if in reluctant concession to daylight like a face with a single eye the men on the staff of the institute felt no curiosity about that structure and avoided the paths that led down to its door nobody had ever suggested it but they had the impression that the structure housed a project devoted to experiments with the germs of deadly diseases the two floors were occupied by laboratories that contained a great many cages with guinea pigs dogs and rats but the heart and meaning of the structure was a room in its cellar deep under the ground the room had been incompetently lined with the porous sheets of soundproofing material the sheets had begun to crack and the naked rock of a cave showed through the unit was always protected by a squad of four special guards tonight the squad had been augmented to sixteen summoned for emergency duty by a longdistance telephone call from new york the guards as well as all other employees of project f had been carefully chosen on the basis of a single qualification an unlimited capacity for obedience the sixteen were stationed for the night outside the structure and in the deserted laboratories above the ground where they remained uncritically on duty with no curiosity about anything that might be taking place below in the cellar room under the ground dr ferris wesley mouch and james taggart sat in armchairs lined up against one wall a machine that looked like a small cabinet of irregular shape stood in a corner across from them its face bore rows of glass dials each dial marked by a segment of red a square screen that looked like an amplifier rows of numbers rows of wooden knobs and plastic buttons a single lever controlling a switch at one side and a single red glass button at the other the face of the machine seemed to have more expression than the face of the mechanic in charge of it he was a husky young man in a sweatstained shirt with sleeves rolled above the elbows his pale blue eyes were glazed by an enormously conscientious concentration on his task he moved his lips once in a while as if reciting a memorized lesson a short wire led from the machine to an electric storage battery behind it long coils of wire like the twisted arms of an octopus stretched forward across the stone floor from the machine to a leather mattress spread under a cone of violent light john galt lay strapped to the mattress he was naked the small metal disks of electrodes at the ends of the wires were attached to his wrists his shoulders his hips and his ankles a device resembling a stethoscope was attached to his chest and connected to the amplifier get this straight said dr ferris addressing him for the first time we want you to take full power over the economy of the country we want you to become a dictator we want you to rule understand we want you to give orders and to figure out the right orders to give what we want we mean to get speeches logic arguments or passive obedience wont save you now we want ideasor else we wont let you out of here until you tell us the exact measures youll take to save our system then well have you tell it to the country over the radio he raised his wrist displaying a stopwatch ill give you thirty seconds to decide whether you want to start talking right now if not then well start do you understand galt was looking straight at them his face expressionless as if he understood too much he did not answer they heard the sound of the stopwatch in the silence counting off the seconds and the sound of mouchs choked irregular breathing as he gripped the arms of his chair ferris waved a signal to the mechanic at the machine the mechanic threw the switch it lighted the red glass button and set off two sounds one was the low humming drone of an electric generator the other was a peculiar beat as regular as the ticking of a clock but with an oddly muffled resonance it took them a moment to realize that it came from the amplifier and that they were hearing the beat of galts heart number three said ferris raising a finger in signal the mechanic pressed a button under one of the dials a long shudder ran through galts body his left arm shook in jerking spasms convulsed by the electric current that circled between his wrist and shoulder his head fell back his eyes closed his lips drawn tight he made no sound when the mechanic lifted his finger off the button galts arm stopped shaking he did not move the three men glanced about them with an instants look of groping ferris eyes were blank mouchs terrified taggarts disappointed the sound of the thumping beat went on through the silence number two said ferris it was galts right leg that twisted in convulsions with the current now circling between his hip and ankle his hands gripped the edges of the mattress his head jerked once from side to side then lay still the beating of the heart grew faintly faster mouch was drawing away pressing against the back of his armchair taggart was sitting on the edge of ms leaning forward number one gradual said ferris galts torso jerked upward and fell back and twisted in long shudders straining against his strapped wristsas the current was now running from his one wrist to the other across his lungs the mechanic was slowly turning a knob increasing the voltage of the current the needle on the dial was moving toward the red segment that marked danger galts breath was coming in broken panting sounds out of convulsed lungs had enough snarled ferris when the current went off galt did not answer his lips moved faintly opening for air the beat from the stethoscope was racing but his breath was falling to an even rhythm by a controlled effort at relaxation youre too easy on him yelled taggart staring at the naked body on the mattress galt opened his eyes and glanced at them for a moment they could tell nothing except that his glance was steady and fully conscious then he dropped his head again and lay still as if he had forgotten them his naked body looked strangely out of place in this cellar they knew it though none of them would identify that knowledge the long lines of his body running from his ankles to the flat hips to the angle of the waist to the straight shoulders looked like a statue of ancient greece sharing that statues meaning but stylized to a longer lighter more active form and a gaunter strength suggesting more restless an energythe body not of a chariot driver but of a builder of airplanes and as the meaning of a statue of ancient greecethe statue of man as a godclashed with the spirit of this centurys halls so his body clashed with a cellar devoted to prehistorical activities the clash was the greater because he seemed to belong with electric wires with stainless steel with precision instruments with the levers of a control board perhapsthis was the thought most fiercely resisted and most deeply buried at the bottom of his watchers sensations the thought they knew only as a diffused hatred and an unfocused terrorperhaps it was the absence of such statues from the modern world that had transformed a generator into an octopus and brought a body such as his into its tentacles i understand youre some sort of electrical expert said ferris and chuckled so are wedont you think so two sounds answered him in the silence the drone of the generator and the beating of galts heart the mixed series ordered ferris waving one finger at the mechanic the shocks now came at irregular unpredictable intervals one after another or minutes apart only the shuddering convulsions of galts legs arms torso or entire body showed whether the current was racing between two particular electrodes or through all of them at once the needles on the dials kept coming close to the red marks then receding the machine was calculated to inflict the maximum intensity of pain without damaging the body of the victim it was the watchers who found it unbearable to wait through the minutes of the pauses filled with the sound of the heartbeat the heart was now racing in an irregular rhythm the pauses were calculated to let that beat slow down but allow no relief to the victim who had to wait for a shock at any moment galt lay relaxed as if not attempting to fight the pain but surrendering to it not attempting to negate it but to bear it when his lips parted for breath and a sudden jolt slammed them tight again he did not resist the shaking rigidity of his body but he let it vanish the instant the current left him only the skin of his face was pulled tight and the sealed line of his lips twisted sidewise once in a while when a shock raced through his chest the goldcopper strands of his hair flew with the jerking of his head as if waving in a gust of wind beating against his face across his eyes the watchers wondered why his hair seemed to be growing darker until they realized that it was drenched in sweat the terror of hearing ones own heart struggling as if about to burst at any moment had been intended to be felt by the victim it was the torturers who were trembling with terror as they listened to the jagged broken rhythm and missed a breath with every missing beat it sounded now as if the heart were leaping beating frantically against its cage of ribs in agony and in a desperate anger the heart was protesting the man would not he lay still his eyes closed his hands relaxed hearing his heart as it fought for his life wesley mouch was first to break oh god floyd he screamed dont kill him dont dare kill him if he dies we die he wont snarled ferris hell wish he did but he wont the machine wont let him its mathematically computed its safe oh isnt it enough hell obey us now im sure hell obey no its not enough i dont want him to obey i want him to believe to accept to want to accept weve got to have him work for us voluntarily go ahead cried taggart what are you waiting for cant you make the current stronger he hasnt even screamed yet whats the matter with you gasped mouch catching a glimpse of taggarts face while a current was twisting galts body taggart was staring at it intently yet his eyes seemed glazed and dead but around that inanimate stare the muscles of his face were pulled into an obscene caricature of enjoyment had enough ferris kept yelling to galt are you ready to want what we want they heard no answer galt raised his head once in a while and looked at them there were dark rings under his eyes but the eyes were clear and conscious in mounting panic the watchers lost their sense of context and languageand their three voices blended into a progression of indiscriminate shrieks we want you to take over we want you to rule we order you to give orders we demand that you dictate we order you to save us we order you to think they heard no answer but the beating of the heart on which their own lives depended the current was shooting through galts chest and the beating was coming in irregular spurts as if it were racing and stumblingwhen suddenly his body fell still relaxing the beating had stopped the silence was like a stunning blow and before they had time to scream their horror was topped by another by the fact that galt opened his eyes and raised his head then they realized that the drone of the motor had ceased too and that the red light had gone out on the control panel the current had stopped the generator was dead the mechanic was jabbing his ringer at the button to no avail he yanked the lever of the switch again and again he kicked the side of the machine the red light would not go on the sound did not return well snapped ferris well whats the matter the generators on the blink said the mechanic helplessly whats the matter with it i dont know well find out and fix it the man was not a trained electrician he had been chosen not for his knowledge but for his uncritical capacity for pushing any buttons the effort he needed to learn his task was such that his consciousness could be relied upon to have no room for anything else he opened the rear panel of the machine and stared in bewilderment at the intricate coils he could find nothing visibly out of order he put on his rubber gloves picked up a pair of pliers tightened a few bolts at random and scratched his head i dont know he said his voice had a sound of helpless docility who am i to know the three men were on their feet crowding behind the machine to stare at its recalcitrant organs they were acting merely by reflex they knew that they did not know but youve got to fix it yelled ferris its got to work weve got to have electricity we must continue cried taggart he was shaking its ridiculous i wont have it i wont be interrupted i wont let him off he pointed in the direction of the mattress do something ferris was crying to the mechanic dont just stand there do something fix it i order you to fix it but i dont know whats wrong with it said the man blinking then find out how am i to find out i order you to fix it do you hear me make it workor ill fire you and throw you in jail but i dont know whats wrong with it the man sighed bewildered i dont know what to do its the vibrator thats out of order said a voice behind them they whirled around galt was struggling for breath but he was speaking in the brusque competent tone of an engineer take it out and pry off the aluminum cover youll find a pair of contacts fused together force them apart take a small file and clean up the pitted surfaces then replace the cover plug it back into the machineand your generator will work there was a long moment of total silence the mechanic was staring at galt he was holding galts glanceand even he was able to recognize the nature of the sparkle in the dark green eyes it was a sparkle of contemptuous mockery he made a step back in the incoherent dimness of his consciousness in some wordless shapeless unintelligible manner even he suddenly grasped the meaning of what was occurring in that cellar he looked at galthe looked at the three menhe looked at the machine he shuddered he dropped his pliers and ran out of the room galt burst out laughing the three men were backing slowly away from the machine they were struggling not to allow themselves to understand what the mechanic had understood no cried taggart suddenly glancing at galt and leaping forward no i wont let him get away with it he fell down on his knees groping frantically to find the aluminum cylinder of the vibrator ill fix it ill work it myself weve got to go on weve got to break him take it easy jim said ferris uneasily jerking him up to his feet hadnt we hadnt we better lay off for the night said mouch pleadingly he was looking at the door through which the mechanic had escaped his glance partenvy partterror no cried taggart jim hasnt he had enough dont forget we have to be careful no he hasnt had enough he hasnt even screamed yet jim cried mouch suddenly terrified by something in taggarts face we cant afford to kill him you know it i dont care i want to break him i want to hear mm scream i want and then it was taggart who screamed it was a long sudden piercing scream as if at some sudden sight though his eyes were staring at space and seemed blankly sightless the sight he was confronting was within him the protective walls of emotion of evasion of pretense of semithinking and pseudowords built up by him through all of his years had crashed in the span of one momentthe moment when he knew that he wanted galt to die knowing fully that his own death would follow he was suddenly seeing the motive that had directed all the actions of his life it was not his incommunicable soul or his love for others or his social duty or any of the fraudulent sounds by which he had maintained his selfesteem it was the lust to destroy whatever was living for the sake of whatever was not it was the urge to defy reality by the destruction of every living value for the sake of proving to himself that he could exist in defiance of reality and would never have to be bound by any solid immutable facts a moment ago he had been able to feel that he hated galt above all men that the hatred was woof of galts evil which he need define no further that he wanted galt to be destroyed for the sake of his own survival now he knew that he had wanted galts destruction at the price of his own destruction to follow he knew that he had never wanted to survive he knew that it was galts greatness he had wanted to torture and destroyhe was seeing it as greatness by his own admission greatness by the only standard that existed whether anyone chose to admit it or not the greatness of a man who was master of reality in a manner no other had equaled in the moment when he lames taggart had found himself facing the ultimatum to accept reality or die it was death his emotions had chosen death rather than surrender to that realm of which galt was so radiant a son in the person of galthe knewhe had sought the destruction of all existence it was not by means of words that this knowledge confronted his consciousness as all his knowledge had consisted of emotions so now he was held by an emotion and a vision that he had no power to dispel he was no longer able to summon the fog to conceal the sight of all those blind alleys he had struggled never to be forced to see now at the end of every alley he was seeing his hatred of existencehe was seeing the face of cherryl taggart with her joyous eagerness to live and that it was this particular eagerness he had always wanted to defeathe was seeing his face as the face of a killer whom all men should rightfully loathe who destroyed values for being values who killed in order not to discover his own irredeemable evil no he moaned staring at that vision shaking his head to escape it no no yes said galt he saw galts eyes looking straight at his as if galt were seeing the things he was seeing told you that on the radio didnt i said galt this was the stamp james taggart had dreaded from which there was no escape the stamp and proof of objectivity no he said feebly once more but it was no longer the voice of a living consciousness he stood for a moment staring blindly at space then his legs gave way folding limply and he sat on the floor still staring unaware of his action or surroundings jim called mouch there was no answer mouch and ferris did not ask themselves or wonder what it was that had happened to taggart they knew that they must never attempt to discover it under peril of sharing his fate they knew who it was that had been broken tonight they knew that this was the end of james taggart whether his physical body survived or not lets lets get jim out of here said ferris shakily lets get him to a doctor or somewhere they pulled taggart to his feet he did not resist he obeyed lethargically and he moved his feet when pushed it was he who had reached the state to which he had wanted galt to be reduced holding his arms at both sides his two friends led him out of the room he saved them from the necessity of admitting to themselves that they wanted to escape galts eyes galt was watching them his glance was too austerely perceptive well be back snapped ferris to the chief of the guards stay here and dont let anyone in understand no one they pushed taggart into their car parked by the trees at the entrance well be back said ferris to no one in particular to the trees and the darkness of the sky for the moment their only certainty was that they had to escape from that cellarthe cellar where the living generator was left tied by the side of the dead one chapter x in the name of the best among us dagny walked straight toward the guard who stood at the door of project f her steps sounded pourposeful even and open rining in the silence of the path among the trees she raised her head to a ra of moonlight to let him recognize her face let me in she said no admittance he answered in the voice of a robot by order or dr ferris i am here by order of mr thompson huh i i dont know anything about that i do i mean dr ferris hasnt told me maam i am telling you but im not supposed to take any orders from anyone excepting dr ferris do you wish to disobey mr thompson oh no maam but but if dr ferris said to let nobody in that means nobody he added uncertainly and pleadingly doesnt it do you know that my name is dagny taggart and that youve seen my pictures in the papers with mr thompson and all the top leaders of the country yes maam then decide whether you wish to disobey their orders oh no maam i dont then let me in but i cant disobey dr ferris either then choose but i cant choose maam who am i to choose youll have to look he said hastily pulling a key from his pocket and turning to the door ill ask the chief he no she said some quality in the tone of her voice made him whirl back to her she was holding a gun pointed levelly at his heart listen carefully she said either you let me in or i shoot you you may try to shoot me first if you can you have that choiceand no other now decide his mouth fell open and the key dropped from his hand get out of my way she said he shook his head frantically pressing his back against the door oh christ maam he gulped in the whine of a desperate plea i cant shoot at you seeing as you come from mr thompson and i cant let you in against the word of dr ferris what am i to do im only a little fellow im only obeying orders its not up to me its your life she said if you let me ask the chief hell tell me hell i wont let you ask anyone but how do i know that you really have an order from mr thompson you dont maybe i havent maybe im acting on my ownand youll be punished for obeying me maybe i haveand youll be thrown in jail for disobeying maybe dr ferris and mr thompson agree about this maybe they dontand you have to defy one or the other these are the things you have to decide there is no one to ask no one to call no one to tell you you will have to decide them yourself but i cant decide why me because its your body thats barring my way but i cant decide im not supposed to decide ill count to three she said then ill shoot wait wait i havent said yes or no he cried cringing tighter against the door as if immobility of mind and body were his best protection one she counted she could see his eyes staring at her in terror two she could see that the gun held less terror for him than the alternative she offeredthree calmly and impersonally she who would have hesitated to fire at an animal pulled the trigger and fired straight at the heart of a man who had wanted to exist without the responsibility of consciousness her gun was equipped with a silencer there was no sound to attract anyones attention only the thud of a body falling at her feet she picked up the key from the groundthen waited for a few brief moments as had been agreed upon francisco was first to join her coming from behind a corner of the building then hank rearden then ragnar danneskjold there had been four guards posted at intervals among the trees around the building they were now disposed of one was dead three were left in the brush bound and gagged she handed the key to francisco without a word he unlocked the door and went in alone leaving the door open to the width of an inch the three others waited outside by that opening the hall was lighted by a single naked bulb stuck in the middle of the ceiling a guard stood at the foot of the stairs leading to the second floor who are you he cried at the sight of francisco entering as if he owned the place nobodys supposed to come in here tonight i did said francisco why did rusty let you in he must have had his reasons he wasnt supposed to somebody has changed your suppositions franciscos eyes were taking a lightning inventory of the place a second guard stood on the landing at the turn of the stairs looking down at them and listening whats your business coppermining huh i mean who are you the names too long to tell you ill tell it to your chief where is he im asking the questions but he backed a step away dont dont you act like a big shot or ill hey pete he is cried the second guard paralyzed by franciscos manner the first one was struggling to ignore it his voice grew louder with the growth of his fear as he snapped at francisco what are you after i said ih tell it to your chief where is he im asking the questions im not answering them oh youre not are you snarled pete who had but one recourse when in doubt his hand jerked to the gun on his hip franciscos hand was too fast for the two men to see its motion and his gun was too silent what they saw and heard next was the gun flying out of petes hand along with a splatter of blood from his shattered fingers and his muffled howl of pain he collapsed groaning in the instant when the second guard grasped it he saw that franciscos gun was aimed at him dont shoot mister he cried come down here with your hands up ordered francisco holding his gun aimed with one hand and waving a signal to the crack of the door with the other by the time the guard descended the stairs rearden was there to disarm him and danneskjold to tie his hands and feet the sight of dagny seemed to frighten him more than the rest he could not understand it the three men wore caps and windbreakers and but for their manner could be taken for a gang of highwaymen the presence of a lady was inexplicable now said francisco where is your chief the guard jerked his head in the direction of the stairs up there how many guards are there in the building nine where are they ones on the cellar stairs the others are all up there where in the big laboratory the one with the window all of them yes what are these rooms he pointed at the doors leading off the hall theyre labs too theyre locked for the night whos got the key him he jerked his head at pete rearden and danneskjold took the key from petes pocket and hurried soundlessly to check the rooms while francisco continued are there any other men in the building no isnt there a prisoner here oh yeah i guess so there must be or they wouldntve kept us all on duty is he still here that i dont know theyd never tell us is dr ferris here no he left tenfifteen minutes ago now that laboratory upstairsdoes it open right on the stair landing yes how many doors are there three its the one in the middle what are the other rooms theres the small laboratory on one side and dr ferris office on the other are there connecting doors between them yes francisco was turning to his companions when the guard said pleadingly mister can i ask you a question go ahead who are you he answered in the solemn tone of a drawingroom introduction francisco domingo carlos andres sebastian danconia he left the guard gaping at him and turned to a brief whispered consultation with his companions in a moment it was rearden who went up the stairsswiftly soundlessly and alone cages containing rats and guinea pigs were stacked against the walls of the laboratory they had been put there by the guards who were playing poker on the long laboratory table in the center six of them were playing two were standing in opposite corners watching the entrance door guns in hand it was reardens face that saved him from being shot on sight when he entered his face was too well known to them and too unexpected he saw eight heads staring at him with recognition and with inability to believe what they were recognizing he stood at the door his hands in the pockets of his trousers with the casual confident manner of a business executive who is in charge here he asked in the politely abrupt voice of a man who does not waste time you youre not stammered a lanky surly individual at the card table im hank rearden are you the chief yeah but where in blazes do you come from from new york what are you doing here then i take it you have not been notified should i have i mean about what the swift touchy resentful suspicion that his superiors had slighted his authority was obvious in the chiefs voice he was a tall emaciated man with jerky movements a sallow face and the restless unfocused eyes of a drug addict about my business here you you cant have any business here he snapped torn between the fear of a bluff and the fear of having been left out of some important toplevel decision arent you a traitor and a deserter and a i see that youre behind the times my good man the seven others in the room were staring at rearden with an awed superstitious uncertainty the two who held guns still held them aimed at him in the impassive manner of automatons he did not seem to take notice of them what is it you say is your business here snapped the chief i am here to take charge of the prisoner whom you are to deliver to me if you came from headquarters youd know that im not supposed to know anything about any prisonerand that nobody is to touch him except me the chief leaped to his feet darted to a telephone and seized the receiver he had not raised it halfway to his ear when he dropped it abruptly with a gesture that sent a vibration of panic through the room he had had time to hear that the telephone was dead and to know that the wires were cut his look of accusation as he whirled to rearden broke against the faintly contemptuous reproof of reardens voice thats no way to guard a buildingif this is what you allowed to happen better let me have the prisoner before anything happens to himif you dont want me to report you for negligence as well as insubordination the chief dropped heavily back on his chair slumped forward across the table and looked up at rearden with a glance that made his emaciated face resemble the animals that were beginning to stir in the cages who is the prisoner he asked my good man said rearden if your immediate superiors did not see fit to tell you i certainly will not they didnt see fit to tell me about your coming here either yelled the chief his voice confessing the helplessness of anger and broadcasting the vibrations of impotence to his men how do i know youre on the level with the phone out of order whos going to tell me how am i to know what to do thats your problem not mine i dont believe you his cry was too shrill to project conviction i dont believe that the government would send you on a mission when youre one of those vanishing traitors and friends of john galt who but havent you heard what john galt has made a deal with the government and has brought us all back oh thank god cried one of the guards the youngest shut your mouth youre not to have any political opinions snapped the chief and jerked back to rearden why hasnt it been announced on the radio do you presume to hold opinions on when and how the government should choose to announce its policies in the long moment of silence they could hear the rustle of the animals clawing at the bars of their cages i think i should remind you said rearden that your job is not to question orders but to obey them that you are not to know or understand the policies of your superiors that you are not to judge to choose or to doubt but i dont know whether im supposed to obey you if you refuse youll take the consequences crouching against the table the chief moved his glance slowly appraisingly from reardens face to the two gunmen in the corners the gunmen steadied their aim by an almost imperceptible movement a nervous rustle went through the room an animal squeaked shrilly in one of the cages i think i should also tell you said rearden his voice faintly harder that i am not alone my friends are waiting outside where all around this room how many youll find outone way or the other say chief moaned a shaky voice from among the guards we dont want to tangle with those people theyre shut up roared the chief leaping to his feet and brandishing his gun in the direction of the speaker youre not going to turn yellow on me any of you bastards he was screaming to ward off the knowledge that they had he was swaying on the edge of panic fighting against the realization that something somehow had disarmed his men theres nothing to be scared of he was screaming it to himself struggling to recapture the safety of his only sphere the sphere of violence nothing and nobody ill show you he whirled around his hand shaking at the end of his sweeping arm and fired at rearden some of them saw rearden sway his right hand gripping his left shoulder others in the same instant saw the gun drop out of the chiefs hand and hit the floor in time with his scream and with the spurt of blood from his wrist then all of them saw francisco danconia standing at the door on the left his soundless gun still aimed at the chief all of them were on their feet and had drawn their guns but they lost that first moment not daring to fire i wouldnt if i were you said francisco jesus gasped one of the guards struggling for the memory of a name he could not recapture thats thats the guy who blew up all the copper mines in the world it is said rearden they had been backing involuntarily away from franciscoand turned to see that rearden still stood at the entrance door with a pointed gun in his right hand and a dark stain spreading on his left shoulder shoot you bastards screamed the chief to the wavering men what are you waiting for shoot them down he was leaning with one arm against the table blood running out of the other ill report any man who doesnt fight ill have him sentenced to death for it drop your guns said rearden the seven guards stood frozen for an instant obeying neither let me out of here screamed the youngest dashing for the door on the right he threw the door open and sprang back dagny taggart stood on the threshold gun in hand the guards were drawing slowly to the center of the room righting an invisible battle in the fog of their minds disarmed by a sense of unreality in the presence of the legendary figures they had never expected to see feeling almost as if they were ordered to fire at ghosts drop your guns said rearden you dont know why youre here we do you dont know who your prisoner is we do you dont know why your bosses want you to guard him we know why we want to get him out you dont know the purpose of your fight we know the purpose of ours if you die you wont know what youre dying for if we do we will dont dont listen to him snarled the chief shoot i order you to shoot one of the guards looked at the chief dropped his gun and raising his arms backed away from the group toward rearden god damn you yelled the chief seized a gun with his left hand and fired at the deserter in time with the fall of the mans body the window burst into a shower of glassand from the limb of a tree as from a catapult the tall slender figure of a man flew into the room landed on its feet and fired at the first guard in reach who are you screamed some terrorblinded voice ragnar danneskjold three sounds answered him a long swelling moan of panicthe clatter of four guns dropped to the floorand the bark of the fifth fired by a guard at the forehead of the chief by the time the four survivors of the garrison began to reassemble the pieces of their consciousness their figures were stretched on the floor bound and gagged the fifth one was left standing his hands tied behind his back where is the prisoner francisco asked him in the cellar i guess who has the key dr ferris where are the stairs to the cellar behind a door in dr ferris office lead the way as they started francisco turned to rearden are you all right hank sure need to rest hell no from the threshold of a door in ferris office they looked down a steep flight of stone stairs and saw a guard on the landing below come here with your hands up ordered francisco the guard saw the silhouette of a resolute stranger and the glint of a gun it was enough he obeyed immediately he seemed relieved to escape from the damp stone crypt he was left tied on the floor of the office along with the guard who had led them then the four rescuers were free to fly down the stairs to the locked steel door at the bottom they had acted and moved with the precision of a controlled discipline now it was as if their inner reins had broken danneskjold had the tools to smash the lock francisco was first to enter the cellar and his arm barred dagnys way for the fraction of a secondfor the length of a look to make certain that the sight was bearablethen he let her rush past him beyond the tangle of electric wires he had seen galts lifted head and glance of greeting she fell down on her knees by the side of the mattress galt looked up at her as he had looked on their first morning in the valley his smile was like the sound of a laughter that had never been touched by pain his voice was soft and low we never had to take any of it seriously did we tears running down her face but her smile declaring a full confident radiant certainty she answered no we never had to rearden and danneskjold were cutting his bonds francisco held a flask of brandy to galts lips galt drank and raised himself to lean on an elbow when his arms were free give me a cigarette he said francisco produced a package of dollarsign cigarettes galts hand shook a little as he held a cigarette to the flame of a lighter but franciscos hand shook much more glancing at his eyes over the flame galt smiled and said in the tone of an answer to the questions francisco was not asking yes it was pretty bad but bearableand the kind of voltage they used leaves no damage ill find them some day whoever they were said francisco the tone of his voice flat dead and barely audible said the rest if you do youll find that theres nothing left of them to kill galt glanced at the faces around him he saw the intensity of the relief in their eyes and the violence of the anger in the grimness of their features he knew in what manner they were now reliving his torture its over he said dont make it worse for yourself than it was for me francisco turned his face away its only that it was you he whispered you if it were anyone but you but it had to be me if they were to try their last and theyve tried andhe moved his hand sweeping the roomand the meaning of those who had made itinto the wastelands of the pastand thats that francisco nodded his face still turned away the violent grip of his fingers clutching galts wrist for a moment was his answer galt lifted himself to a sitting posture slowly regaining control of his muscles he glanced up at dagnys face as her arm shot forward to help him he saw the struggle of her smile against the tension of her resisted tears it was the struggle of her knowledge that nothing could matter beside the sight of his naked body and that this body was living against her knowledge of what it had endured holding her glance he raised his hand and touched the collar of her white sweater with his fingertips in acknowledgment and in reminder of the only things that were to matter from now on the faint tremor of her lips relaxing into a smile told him that she understood danneskjold found galts shirt slacks and the rest of his clothing which had been thrown on the floor in a corner of the room do you think you can walk john he asked sure while francisco and rearden were helping galt to dress danneskjold proceeded calmly systematically with no visible emotion to demolish the torture machine into splinters galt was not fully steady on his feet but he could stand leaning on franciscos shoulder the first few steps were hard but by the time they reached the door he was able to resume the motions of walking his one arm encircled franciscos shoulders for support his other arm held dagnys shoulders both to gain support and to give it they did not speak as they walked down the hill with the darkness of the trees closing in about them for protection cutting off the dead glow of the moon and the deader glow in the distance behind them in the windows of the state science institute franciscos airplane was hidden in the brush on the edge of a meadow beyond the next hill there were no human habitations for miles around them there were no eyes to notice or to question the sudden streaks of the airplanes headlights shooting across the desolation of dead weeds and the violent burst of the motor brought to life by danneskjold who took the wheel with the sound of the door slamming shut behind them and the forward thrust of the wheels under their feet francisco smiled for the first time this is my one and only chance to give you orders he said helping galt to stretch out in a reclining chair now lie still relax and take it easy you too he added turning to dagny and pointing at the seat by galts side the wheels were running faster as if gaining speed and purpose and lightness ignoring the impotent obstacles of small jolts from the ruts of the ground when the motion turned to a long smooth streak when they saw the dark shapes of the trees sweeping down and dropping past their windows galt leaned silently over and pressed his lips to dagnys hand he was leaving the outer world with the one value he had wanted to win from it francisco had produced a firstaid kit and was removing reardens shirt to bandage his wound galt saw the thin red trickle running from reardens shoulder down his chest thank you hank he said rearden smiled i will repeat what you said when i thanked you on our first meeting if you understand that i acted for my own sake you know that no gratitude is required i will repeat said galt the answer you gave me that is why i thank you dagny noticed that they looked at each other as if their glance were the handshake of a bond too firm to require any statement rearden saw her watching themand the faintest contraction of his eyes was like a smile of sanction as if his glance were repeating to her the message he had sent her from the valley they heard the sudden sound of danneskjolds voice raised cheerfully in conversation with empty space and they realized that he was speaking over the planes radio yes safe and sound all of us yes hes unhurt just shaken a little and resting no no permanent injury yes were all here hank rearden got a flesh wound buthe glanced over his shoulderbut hes grinning at me right now losses i think we lost our temper for a few minutes back there but were recovering dont try to beat me to galts gulch ill land firstand ill help kay in the restaurant to fix your breakfast can any outsiders hear him asked dagny no said francisco its a frequency theyre not equipped to get whom is he talking to asked galt to about half the male population of the valley said francisco or as many as we had space for on every plane available they are flying behind us right now did you think any of them would stay home and leave you in the hands of the looters we were prepared to get you by open armed assault on that institute or on the waynefalkland if necessary but we knew that in such case we would run the risk of their killing you when they saw that they were beaten thats why we decided that the four of us would first try it alone had we failed the others would have proceeded with an open attack they were waiting half a mile away we had men posted among the trees on the hill who saw us get out and relayed the word to the others ellis wyatt was in charge incidentally hes flying your plane the reason we couldnt get to new hampshire as fast as dr ferris is that we had to get our planes from distant hidden landing places while he had the advantage of open airports which incidentally he wont have much longer no said galt not much longer that was our only obstacle the rest was easy ill tell you the whole story later anyway the four of us were all that was necessary to beat their garrison one of these centuries said danneskjold turning to them for a moment the brutes private or public who believe that they can rule their betters by force will learn the lesson of what happens when brute force encounters mind and force theyve learned it said galt isnt that the particular lesson you have been teaching them for twelve years i yes but the semester is over tonight was the last act of violence that ill ever have to perform it was my reward for the twelve years my men have now started to build their homes in the valley my ship is hidden where no one will find her until im able to sell her for a much more civilized use shell be converted into a transatlantic passenger lineran excellent one even if of modest size as for me i will start getting ready to give a different course of lessons i think iii have to brush up on the works of our teachers first teacher rearden chuckled id like to be present at your first lecture on philosophy in a university classroom he said id like to see how your students will be able to keep their mind on the subject and how youll answer the sort of irrelevant questions i wont blame them for wanting to ask you i will tell them that theyll find the answers in the subject there were not many lights on the earth below the countryside was an empty black sheet with a few occasional flickers in the windows of some government structures and the trembling glow of candles in the windows of thriftless homes most of the rural population had long since been reduced to the life of those ages when artificial light was an exorbitant luxury and a sunset put an end to human activity the towns were like scattered puddles left behind by a receding tide still holding some precious drops of electricity but drying out in a desert of rations quotas controls and powerconservation rules but when the place that had once been the source of the tidenew york cityrose in the distance before them it was still extending its lights to the sky still defying the primordial darkness almost as if in an ultimate effort in a final appeal for help it were now stretching its arms to the plane that was crossing its sky involuntarily they sat up as if at respectful attention at the deathbed of what had been greatness looking down they could see the last convulsions the lights of the cars were darting through the streets like animals trapped in a maze frantically seeking an exit the bridges were jammed with cars the approaches to the bridges were veins of massed headlights glittering bottlenecks stopping all motion and the desperate screaming of sirens reached faintly to the height of the plane the news of the continents severed artery had now engulfed the city men were deserting their posts trying in panic to abandon new york seeking escape where all roads were cut off and escape was no longer possible the plane was above the peaks of the skyscrapers when suddenly with the abruptness of a shudder as if the ground had parted to engulf it the city disappeared from the face of the earth it took them a moment to realize that the panic had reached the power stationsand that the lights of new york had gone out dagny gasped dont look down galt ordered sharply she raised her eyes to his face his face had that look of austerity with which she had always seen him meet facts she remembered the story francisco had told her he had quit the twentieth century he was living in a garret in a slum neighborhood he stepped to the window and pointed at the skyscrapers of the city he said that we had to extinguish the lights of the world and when we would see the lights of new york go out we would know that our job was done she thought of it when she saw the three of themjohn galt francisco danconia ragnar danneskjoldlook silently at one another for a moment she glanced at rearden he was not looking down he was looking ahead as she had seen him look at an untouched countryside with a glance appraising the possibilities of action when she looked at the darkness ahead another memory rose in her mindthe moment when circling above the afton airport she had seen the silver body of a plane rise like a phoenix from the darkness of the earth she knew that now at this hour their plane was carrying all that was left of new york city she looked ahead the earth would be as empty as the space where thir propeller was cutting an unobstructed pathas empty and as free she knew what nat taggart had felt at his start and why now for the first time she was following him in full loyalty the confident sense of facing a void and of knowing that one has a continent to build she felt the whole struggle of her past rising before her and dropping away leaving her here on the height of this moment she smiledand the words in her mind appraising and sealing the past were the words of courage pride and dedication which most men had never understood the words of a businessmans language price no object she did not gasp and she felt no tremor when in the darkness below she saw a small string of lighted dots struggling slowly westward through the void with the long bright dash of a headlight groping to protect the safety of its way she felt nothing even though it was a train and she knew that it had no destination but the void she turned to galt he was watching her face as if he had been following her thoughts she saw the reflection of her smile in his its the end she said its the beginning he answered then they lay still leaning back in their chairs silently looking at each other then their persons filled each others awareness as the sum and meaning of the futurebut the sum included the knowledge of all that had had to be earned before the person of another being could come to embody the value of ones existence new york was far behind them when they heard danneskjold answer a call from the radio yes hes awake i dont think hell sleep tonight yes i think he can he turned to glance over his shoulder john dr akston would like to speak to you what is he on one of those planes behind us certainly galt leaped forward to seize the microphone hello dr akston he said the quiet low tone of his voice was the audible image of a smile transmitted through space hello john the tooconscious steadiness of hugh akstons voice confessed at what cost he had waited to learn whether he would ever pronounce these two words again i just wanted to hear your voice just to know that youre all right galt chuckled andin the tone of a student proudly presenting a completed task of homework as proof of a lesson well learnedhe answered of course i am all right professor i had to be a is a the locomotive of the eastbound comet broke down in the middle of a desert in arizona it stopped abruptly for no visible reason like a man who had not permitted himself to know that he was bearing too much some overstrained connection snapped for good when eddie willers called for the conductor he waited a long time before the man came in and he sensed the answer to his question by the look of resignation on the mans face the engineer is trying to find out whats wrong mr willers he answered softly in a tone implying that it was his duty to hope but that he had held no hope for years he doesnt know hes working on it the conductor waited for a polite halfminute and turned to go but stopped to volunteer an explanation as if some dim rational habit told him that any attempt to explain made any unadmitted terror easier to bear those diesels of ours arent fit to be sent out on the road mr willers they werent worth repairing long ago i know said eddie willers quietly the conductor sensed that his explanation was worse than none it led to questions that men did not ask these days he shook his head and went out eddie willers sat looking at the empty darkness beyond the window this was the first eastbound cornet out of san francisco in many days she was the child of his tortured effort to reestablish transcontinental service he could not tell what the past few days had cost him or what he had done to save the san francisco terminal from the blind chaos of a civil war that men were fighting with no concept of their goals there was no way to remember the deals he had made on the basis of the range of every shifting moment he knew only that he had obtained immunity for the terminal from the leaders of three different warring factions that he had found a man for the post of terminal manager who did not seem to have given up altogether that he had started one more taggart comet on her eastward run with the best diesel engine and the best crew available and that he had boarded her for his return journey to new york with no knowledge of how long his achievement would last he had never had to work so hard he had done his job as conscientiously well as he had always done any assignment but it was as if he had worked in a vacuum as if his energy had found no transmitters and had run into the sands of of some such desert as the one beyond the window of the comet he shuddered he felt a moments kinship with the stalled engine of the train after a while he summoned the conductor once more how is it going he asked the conductor shrugged and shook his head send the fireman to a track phone have him tell the division headquarters to send us the best mechanic available yes sir there was nothing to see beyond the window turning off the light eddie willers could distinguish a gray spread dotted by the black spots of cacti with no start to it and no end he wondered how men had ever ventured to cross it and at what price in the days when there were no trains he jerked his head away and snapped on the light it was only the fact that the comet was in exile he thought mat gave him this sense of pressing anxiety she was stalled on an alien railon the borrowed track of the atlantic southern that ran through arizona the track they were using without payment he had to get her out of here he thought he would not feel like this once they returned to their own rail but the junction suddenly seemed an insurmountable distance away on the shore of the mississippi at the taggart bridge no he thought that was not all he had to admit to himself what images were nagging him with a sense of uneasiness he could neither grasp nor dispel they were too meaningless to define and too inexplicable to dismiss one was the image of a way station they had passed without stopping more than two hours ago he had noticed the empty platform and the brightly lighted windows of the small station building the lights came from empty rooms he had seen no single human figure neither in the building nor on the tracks outside the other image was of the next way station they had passed its platform was jammed with an agitated mob now they were far beyond the reach of the light or sound of any station he had to get the comet out of here he thought he wondered why he felt it with such urgency and why it had seemed so crucially important to reestablish the comets run a mere handful of passengers was rattling in her empty cars men had no place to go and no goals to reach it was not for their sake that he had struggled he could not say for whose two phrases stood as the answer in his mind driving him with the vagueness of a prayer and the scalding force of an absolute one was from ocean to ocean foreverthe other was dont let it go the conductor returned an hour later with the fireman whose face looked oddly grim mr willers said the fireman slowly division headquarters does not answer eddie willers sat up his mind refusing to believe it yet knowing suddenly that for some inexplicable reason this was what he had expected its impossible he said his voice low the fireman was looking at him not moving the track phone must have been out of order no mr willers it was not out of order the line was alive all right the division headquarters wasnt i mean there was no one there to answer or else no one who cared to but you know that thats impossible the fireman shrugged men did not consider any disaster impossible these days eddie willers leaped to his feet go down the length of the train he ordered the conductor knock on all the doorsthe occupied ones that isand see whether theres an electrical engineer aboard yes sir eddie knew that they felt as he felt it that they would find no such man not among the lethargic extinguished faces of the passengers they had seen come on he ordered turning to the fireman they climbed together aboard the locomotive the grayhaired engineer was sitting in his chair staring out at the cacti the engines headlight had stayed on and it stretched out into the night motionless and straight reaching nothing but the dissolving blur of crossties lets try to find whats wrong said eddie removing his coat his voice halforder halfplea lets try some more yes sir said the engineer without resentment or hope the engineer had exhausted his meager store of knowledge he had checked every source of trouble he could think of he went crawling over and under the machinery unscrewing its parts and screwing them back again taking out pieces and replacing them dismembering the motors at random like a child taking a clock apart but without the childs conviction that knowledge is possible the fireman kept leaning out of the cabs window glancing at the black stillness and shivering as if from the night air that was growing colder dont worry said eddie willers assuming a tone of confidence weve got to do our best but if we fail theyll send us help sooner or later they dont abandon trains in the middle of nowhere they didnt used to said the fireman once in a while the engineer raised his greasesmeared face to look at the greasesmeared face and shirt of eddie willers whats the use mr willers he asked we cant let it go eddie answered fiercely he knew dimly that what he meant was more than the comet and more than the railroad moving from the cab through the three motor units and back to the cab again his hands bleeding his shirt sticking to his back eddie willers was struggling to remember everything he had ever known about engines anything he had learned in college and earlier anything he had picked up in those days when the station agents at rockdale station used to chase him off the rungs of their lumbering switch engines the pieces connected to nothing his brain seemed jammed and tight he knew that motors were not his profession he knew that he did not know and that it was now a matter of life or death for him to discover the knowledge he was looking at the cylinders the blades the wires the control panels still winking with lights he was struggling not to allow into his mind the thought that was pressing against its periphery what were the chances and how long would it takeaccording to the mathematical theory of probabilityfor primitive men working by ruleofthumb to hit the right combination of parts and recreate the motor of this engine whats the use mr willers moaned the engineer we cant let it go he cried he did not know how many hours had passed when he heard the fireman shout suddenly mr willers look the fireman was leaning out the window pointing into the darkness behind them eddie willers looked an odd little light was swinging jerkily far in the distance it seemed to be advancing at an imperceptible rate it did not look like any sort of light he could identify after a while it seemed to him that he distinguished some large black shapes advancing slowly they were moving in a line parallel with the track the spot of light hung low over the ground swinging he strained his ears but heard nothing then he caught a feeble muffled beat that sounded like the hoofs of horses the two men beside him were watching the black shapes with a look of growing terror as if some supernatural apparition were advancing upon them out of the desert night in the moment when they chuckled suddenly joyously recognizing the shapes it was eddies face that froze into a look of terror at the sight of a ghost more frightening than any they could have expected it was a train of covered wagons the swinging lantern jerked to a stop by the side of the engine hey bud can i give you a lift called a man who seemed to be the leader he was chuckling stuck arent you the passengers of the comet were peering out of the windows some were descending the steps and approaching womens faces peeked from the wagons from among the piles of household goods a baby wailed somewhere at the rear of the caravan are you crazy asked eddie willers no i mean it brother we got plenty of room well give you folks a liftfor a priceif you want to get out of here he was a lanky nervous man with loose gestures and an insolent voice who looked like a sideshow barker this is the taggart comet said eddie willers choking the comet eh looks more like a dead caterpillar to me whats the matter brother youre not going anywhereand you cant get there any more even if you tried what do you mean you dont think youre going to new york do you we are going to new york then then you havent heard what say when was the last time you spoke to any of your stations i dont know heard what that your taggart bridge is gone gone blasted to bits soundray explosion or something nobody knows exactly only there aint any bridge any more to cross the mississippi there aint any new york any moreleastways not for folks like you and me to reach eddie willers did not know what happened next he had fallen back against the side of the engineers chair staring at the open door of the motor unit he did not know how long he stayed there but when at last he turned his head he saw that he was alone the engineer and the fireman had left the cab there was a scramble of voices outside screams sobs shouted questions and the sound of the sideshow barkers laughter eddie pulled himself to the window of the cab the comets passengers and crew were crowding around the leader of the caravan and his semiragged companions he was waving his loose arms in gestures of command some of the betterdressed ladies from the cometwhose husbands had apparently been first to make a dealwere climbing aboard the covered wagons sobbing and clutching their delicate makeup cases step right up folks step right up the barker was yelling cheerfully well make room for everybody a bit crowded but movingbetter than being left here for coyote fodder the day of the iron horse is past all we got is plain oldfashioned horse slow but sure eddie willers climbed halfway down the ladder on the side of the engine to see the crowd and to be heard he waved one arm hanging onto the rungs with the other youre not going are you he cried to his passengers youre not abandoning the comet they drew a little away from him as if they did not want to look at him or answer they did not want to hear questions their minds were incapable of weighing he saw the blind faces of panic whats the matter with the greasemonkey asked the barker pointing at eddie mr willers said the conductor softly its no use dont abandon the comet cried eddie willers dont let it go oh god dont let it go are you crazy cried the barker youve no idea whats going on at your railroad stations and headquarters theyre running around like a pack of chickens with their heads cut off i dont think theres going to be a railroad left in business this side of the mississippi by tomorrow morning better come along mr willers said the conductor no cried eddie clutching the metal rung as if he wanted his hand to grow fast to it the barker shrugged well its your funeral which way are you going asked the engineer not looking at eddie just going brother just looking for some place to stop somewhere were from imperial valley california the peoples party crowd grabbed the crops and any food we had in the cellars hoarding they called it so we just picked up and went got to travel by night on account of the washington crowd were just looking for some place to live youre welcome to come along buddy if youve got no homeor else we can drop you off closer to some town or another the men of that caravanthought eddie indifferentlylooked too meanminded to become the founders of a secret free settlement and not meanminded enough to become a gang of raiders they had no more destination to find than the motionless beam of the headlight and like that beam they would dissolve somewhere in the empty stretches of the country he stayed on the ladder looking up at the beam he did not watch while the last men ever to ride the taggart comet were transferred to the covered wagons the conductor went last mr willers he called desperately come along no said eddie the sideshow barker waved his arm in an upward sweep at eddies figure on the side of the engine above their heads i hope you know what youre doing he cried his voice halfthreat halfplea maybe somebody will come this way to pick you upnext week or next month maybe whos going to these days get away from here said eddie willers he climbed back into the cabwhen the wagons jerked forward and went swaying and creaking off into the night he sat in the engineers chair of a motionless engine his forehead pressed to the useless throttle he felt like the captain of an ocean liner in distress who preferred to go down with his ship rather than be saved by the canoe of savages taunting him with the superiority of their craft then suddenly he felt the blinding surge of a desperate righteous anger he leaped to his feet seizing the throttle he had to start this train in the name of some victory that he could not name he had to start the engine moving past the stage of thinking calculation or fear moved by some righteous defiance he was pulling levers at random he was jerking the throttle back and forth he was stepping on the dead mans pedal which was dead he was groping to distinguish the form of some vision that seemed both distant and close knowing only that his desperate battle was fed by that vision and was fought for its sake dont let it go his mind was cryingwhile he was seeing the streets of new yorkdont let it gowhile he was seeing the lights of railroad signalsdont let it gowhile he was seeing the smoke rising proudly from factory chimneys while he was struggling to cut through the smoke and reach the vision at the root of these visions he was pulling at coils of wire he was linking them and tearing them apartwhile the sudden sense of sunrays and pine trees kept pulling at the corners of his mind dagnyhe heard himself crying soundlesslydagny in the name of the best within us he was jerking at futile levers and at a throttle that had nothing to move dagnyhe was crying to a twelveyearold girl in a sunlit clearing of the woodsin the name of the best within us i must now start this train dagny that is what it was and you knew it then but i didnt you knew it when you turned to look at the rails i said not business or earning a living but dagny business and earning a living and that in man which makes it possiblethat is the best within us that was the thing to defend in the name of saving it dagny i must now start this train when he found that he had collapsed on the floor of the cab and knew that there was nothing he could do here any longer he rose and he climbed down the ladder thinking dimly of the engines wheels even though he knew that the engineer had checked them he felt the crunch of the desert dust under his feet when he let himself drop to the ground he stood still and in the enormous silence he heard the rustle of tumbleweeds stirring in the darkness like the chuckle of an invisible army made free to move when the comet was not he heard a sharper rustle close byand he saw the small gray shape of a rabbit rise on its haunches to sniff at the steps of a car of the taggart comet with a jolt of murderous fury he lunged in the direction of the rabbit as if he could defeat the advance of the enemy in the person of that tiny gray form the rabbit darted off into the darknessbut he knew that the advance was not to be defeated he stepped to the front of the engine and looked up at the letters tt then he collapsed across the rail and lay sobbing at the foot of the engine with the beam of a motionless headlight above him going off into a limitless night the music of richard halleys fifth concerto streamed from his keyboard past the glass of the window and spread through the air over the lights of the valley it was a symphony of triumph the notes flowed up they spoke of rising and they were the rising itself they were the essence and the form of upward motion they seemed to embody every human act and thought that had ascent as its motive it was a sunburst of sound breaking out of hiding and spreading open it had the freedom of release and the tension of purpose it swept space clean and left nothing but the joy of an unobstructed effort only a faint echo within the sounds spoke of that from which the music had escaped but spoke in laughing astonishment at the discovery that there was no ugliness or pain and there never had had to be it was the song of an immense deliverance the lights of the valley fell in glowing patches on the snow still covering the ground there were shelves of snow on the granite ledges and on the heavy limbs of the pines but the naked branches of the birch trees had a faintly upward thrust as if in confident promise of the coming leaves of spring the rectangle of light on the side of a mountain was the window of mulligans study midas mulligan sat at his desk with a map and a column of figures before him he was listing the assets of his bank and working on a plan of projected investments he was noting down the locations he was choosing new yorkclevelandchicago new yorkphiladelphia new york new york new york the rectangle of light at the bottom of the valley was the window of danneskjolds home kay ludlow sat before a mirror thoughtfully studying the shades of film makeup spread open in a battered case ragnar danneskjold lay stretched on a couch reading a volume of the works of aristotle for these truths hold good for everything that is and not for some special genus apart from others and all men use them because they are true of being qua being for a principle which every one must have who understands anything that is is not a hypothesis evidently then such a principle is the most certain of all which principle this is let us proceed to say it is that the same attribute cannot at the same time belong and not belong to the same subject in the same respect the rectangle of light in the acres of a farm was the window of the library of judge narragansett he sat at a table and the light of his lamp fell on the copy of an ancient document he had marked and crossed out the contradictions in its statements that had once been the cause of its destruction he was now adding a new clause to its pages congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of production and trade the rectangle of light in the midst of a forest was the window of the cabin of francisco danconia francisco lay stretched on the floor by the dancing tongues of a fire bent over sheets of paper completing the drawing of his smelter hank rearden and ellis wyatt sat by the fireplace john will design the new locomotives rearden was saying and dagny will run the first railroad between new york and philadelphia she and suddenly on hearing the next sentence francisco threw his head up and burst out laughing a laughter of greeting triumph and release they could not hear the music of halleys fifth concerto now flowing somewhere high above the roof but franciscos laughter matched its sounds contained in the sentence he had heard francisco was seeing the sunlight of spring on the open lawns of homes across the country he was seeing the sparkle of motors he was seeing the glow of the steel in the rising frames of new skyscrapers he was seeing the eyes of youth looking at the future with no uncertainty or fear the sentence rearden had uttered was she will probably try to take the shirt off my back with the freight rates shes going to charge but ill be able to meet them the faint glitter of light weaving slowly through space on the highest accessible ledge of a mountain was the starlight on the strands of galts hair he stood looking not at the valley below but at the darkness of the world beyond its walls dagnys hand rested on his shoulder and the wind blew her hair to blend with his she knew why he had wanted to walk through the mountains tonight and what he had stopped to consider she knew what words were his to speak and that she would be first to hear them they could not see the world beyond the mountains there was only a void of darkness and rock but the darkness was hiding the ruins of a continent the roofless homes the rusting tractors the lightless streets the abandoned rail but far in the distance on the edge of the earth a small flame was waving in the wind the defiantly stubborn flame of wyatts torch twisting being torn and regaining its hold not to be uprooted or extinguished it seemed to be calling and waiting for the words john galt was now to pronounce the road is cleared said galt we are going back to the world he raised his hand and over the desolate earth he traced in space the sign of the dollar the end about the author my personal life says ayn rand is a postscript to my novels it consists of the sentence and i mean it i have always lived by the philosophy i present in my books and it has worked for me as it works for my characters the concretes differ the abstractions are the same i decided to be a writer at the age of nine and everything i have done was integrated to that purpose i am an american by choice and conviction i was born in europe but i came to america because this was the country based on my moral premises and the only country where one could be fully free to write i came here alone after graduating from a european college i had a difficult struggle earning my living at odd jobs until i could make a financial success of my writing no one helped me nor did i think at any time that it was anyones duty to help me in college i had taken history as my major subject and philosophy as my special interest the firstin order to have a factual knowledge of mens past for my future writing the secondin order to achieve an objective definition of my values i found that the first could be learned but the second had to be done by me i have held the same philosophy i now hold for as far back as i can remember i have learned a great deal through the years and expanded my knowledge of details of specific issues of definitions of applicationsand i intend to continue expanding itbut i have never had to change any of my fundamentals my philosophy in essence is the concept of man as a heroic being with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life with productive achievement as his noblest activity and reason as his only absolute the only philosophical debt i can acknowledge is to aristotle i most emphatically disagree with a great many parts of his philosophybut his definition of the laws of logic and of the means of human knowledge is so great an achievement that his errors are irrelevant by comparison you will find my tribute to him in the titles of the three parts of atlas shrugged my other acknowledgment is on the dedication page of this novel i knew what values of character i wanted to find in a man i met such a manand we have been married for twentyeight years his name is frank oconnor to all the readers who discovered the fountainhead and asked me many questions about the wider application of its ideas i want to say that i am answering these questions in the present novel and that the fountainhead was only an overture to atlas shrugged i trust that no one will tell me that men such as i write about dont exist that this book has been writtenand publishedis my proof that they do
