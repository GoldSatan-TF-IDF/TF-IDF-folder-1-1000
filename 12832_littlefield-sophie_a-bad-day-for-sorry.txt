sophie littlefield a bad day for sorry a crime novel for the blob who always knew i could do it prologue whuppin ass wasnt so hard stella hardesty thought as she took aim with the little raven she took off a cheating sonofabitch in kansas city last month what was hard was making sure it stayed whupped especially on a day when it hit a hundred degrees before noon and you were having hot flashes and todays quote on your calendar for women who do too much read find serenity in unexpected places fuck serenity stella said and she shot the trailer one stella knew from experience that roy dean shaw wasnt a particularly brave young buck but then the ones who smacked their women around rarely were hunting him down was going to consume a sizable chunk of her day off and stella was plenty annoyed she only took sundays and tuesdays off from the sewing machine shop and lately her sideline business was eating into her free time today for instance shed had to cancel an appointment down at hair linescut and colorfor the second time and she hadnt done laundry all week it didnt help stellas mood any that menopause had kicked into high gear now that her fiftieth birthday had come and gone if widowhood had given stella license to explore her authentic self menopause stood under the window yelling at the bitch to come out and rumble she felt like biting the heads off kittensthough that might actually be an asset today given the talk she needed to have with roy dean a month ago shortly after their first meeting roy dean had called to give her his new address it was one of the rules all of her parolees were required to inform her of any change in their personal information besides address and phone number they were required to report all their income sources and what they did in their leisure time and most important any new relationships with the fairer sex reporting back to stella was not optional but her parolees were usually anxious to comply first meetings with stella tended to have that effect second meetingsif a parolee was dimwitted enough to require oneput any lingering doubts to rest stella wasnt bound by all the bureaucratic red tape that real parole officers had to wade through she didnt have to fill out paperwork she didnt report to a boss she didnt have to appear in court and she could make the parolees tell her any damn thing she wanted to know she couldnt however always make them tell the truth stella had no doubt that the address roy dean had given her on cedar street in harrisonville existed shed even lay odds that roy dean or one of his relatives had lived there at some point but a punk like roy dean would never give her a fact if he could spin her some fiction instead it was in his blood after a late breakfast of poptarts slathered with peanut butter stella made a halfhearted effort to get the laundry started and paid a few bills from the bottom of the stack then she set out to track down roy dean she found a lead an hour later in a dank and yeasty booth in the back of the high timer the place was little more than a squat shed at the intersection of a couple of farm roads five miles out of town but it was popular with local bikers and jelloman nunn was exactly where she thought hed be enjoying a lunch of polish sausages sizzled in the deep fryer and a mug of busch jelloman was happy to see her folding her into a hug that mashed her face against his greasy leather vest and tickled her forehead with his long scratchy gray beard he was even happier to tell her what he knew jelloman it turned out had been to roy deans new place to extract payment for some weed and roy dean had been sufficiently reluctant to pay up that jelloman was irritated so he made sure to give stella fine detailed directions there were a lot of turns at landmarks like the bustedup esso station and a refrigerator somebody dumped stella copied these carefully into her case notebook which she then accidentally set down into a pool of spilled beer and had to dry off with a borrowed bar rag her notebook was in sorry shape already with a big coffee stain on the current page and tomato sauce gluing several of the previous pages together the tendency of her working papers to meet with misfortune dictated that every new case got its own notebook stella liked to pick them up in the school supplies aisle at the walmart when they went on sale this particular one had a happy bunny logo and its all about me deal with it written on the front todd groffe the thirteenyearold boy who lived two doors down and spent most of his free time finding new ways to be a pain in the butt had informed stella that happy bunny was over a dead trend probably why the notebook was in the halfoff bin at walmart luckily stella didnt spend a lot of time worrying about trends its all about me that tickled her plentymaybe she ought to tattoo it on her arm or something stella tossed some money on the bar to cover jellomans lunch and endured another boozy squeeze and a loud kiss on her ear back in her jeep stella laid the notebook out on the passenger seat to dry and tore out of the bars dirt parking lot fast enough to spin gravel nothing like a drive in the country to settle a persons spirits stellas jeep a sweet little green liberty with chrome aluminum wheels and a sunroof had been her husband ollies pride and joy he bought it new less than four months before he died and never let stella drive it once ollie said she didnt know how to handle a car that sat up off the road like that so she kept driving the crappy little old neon that ollie himself had creased along a guardrail after a few too many beers coming home from a fishing trip once ollie was gone stella sold the neon to a neighbors teenage daughter for a few hundred bucks and drove that jeep like it had fire in the wheel wells it never failed to light her up to take it out on the highway with her favorite music cranked rural missouri flying by outside the windows love is like a cloud holds a lot of rain emmy lou sang as stella drove and she hummed along there was just nothing in the world like old emmy lous drankmesomerazorbladesalongwithmywhiskey voice to smooth out stellas own rough edges and ruffled feathers and today was turning out to be that kind of day it wasnt just the hot flashes and the mood swings either stella wasnt anybodys poster child for the serenity prayer on her best day but thinking about roy deans pretty wife chrissy sitting in her living room trying not to cry wearing long sleeves on a hot day to cover up the evidence of her husbands displeasurewell that just made stellas heart hurt emmy lou launched into sweet old world stella sang along squeaking on the high notes emmy lou had no trouble taking her alto voice up into soprano territory but stellas own voice hunkered somewhere south not much of a range was how her junior high choir teacher put it before making stella a prompter her only job to stand in the wings holding up cards during the performances well screw mrs goshenstella figured shed sing any old damn time she wanted now somebody so warm cradled in your arm didnt you think you were worth anything stella drove past fields bright with latespring corn the plants not much more than ankle high and tried to get her thoughts in order worrying about things that were out of your control was a waste of time on a good day but when you were on your way to meet the kind of trouble that was probably armed and definitely dumb it was an especially bad idea clear thinking thats what was called for stella eventually found the road a mile of cracked asphalt and weeds gave over to gravel and finally to a pair of uneven ruts that caused the jeep to bump and lurch roy deans trailer hideout was down at the end of the rutted dirt road close enough to a buggy brackish little cove of the lake to smell the water if not see it not exactly prime real estate on the other hand not a bad spot to hang your hat if you were hoping to avoid encounters with folks youd rather not see like the law for instance or that crazy bitch from hell your wife sicced on you for kicks stella gave the jeep a little extra gas and held on tight flying over the hillocks and shallows of the road until she landed on the patch of cleared earth she hit the brakes and spun in the dirt as she pulled up in front of the trailer and turned off the ignition it was worse than shed expected the trailer seemed to be leaning on its foundations the wood lattice that someone had nailed around the bottom had come loose and pieces of it lay in the weeds the siding had once been white but that was a distant memory rusty streaks leaked down from all the seams one of the windows had been boarded with a sheet of plywood but that too had separated from its moorings and hung by a single nail parked next to the trailer was a truck stella recognized having recently followed roy dean so they could have their first conversation last time she saw the truck it had been parked in front of a liquor store at eleven thirty on a monday night like roy dean the truck was hard on the eyes and didnt look very reliable with its dented tailgate and rust spots and lowhanging tailpipe stella didnt plan on needing it but she got a gun out of the locked steel box bolted to the floor of the jeep just in case there were currently two weapons in the box her dads old ruger flattop and a cheap little raven semiauto that shed picked up on a trip to kansas city six months back when shed tracked down a missing high school principal the asshole had cleaned out his bank accounts and left his wife to face eviction while he moved into his waitress girlfriends apartment in blue hills the gun was a little bonus that stella had taken off the guy along with a tall stack of cash hed kept in the kitchen cabinets and his wifes good jewelry stella felt sorry enough for the girlfriend to give her back some of the cash before breaking a couple of the mans fingers and working out a payment plan the exprincipal now a best buy salesman sent his ex a tidy little sum every month stella made sure for todays visit with roy dean she chose the raven she checked the magazine and chambered an extra round then slid back the safety the gun was a little short on firepowerit wouldnt drop someone the size of jelloman for instance barring one hell of a lucky shotbut stella liked it for little jobs where the power of suggestion was her main weapon as she stepped out of the jeeps lovely air conditioning heat and humidity hit her like a warm wet washcloth full of buckshot stella took a minute to stretch and peeled her shorts away from her thighs before crossing the dirt yard she rapped her knuckles on the door and waited there was something about the front doors on trailers they never seemed to fit snug in their frames so you always got a rattle when you knocked that alone would keep stella from ever living in one that and the old twister problemone tornado out for a joyride and you were history stella heard movement inside the trailer banging around and cursing mostly after a few minutes of that the door popped open an inch a bloodshot eye peered out and then the door promptly slammed shut again stella sighed and put her weight on the hip that didnt cause her trouble and settled in for a wait this wasnt the first time shed had to roust someone from a trailer and there wasnt a whole lot to it once you took a moment to assess the particulars of the situation shed already seen that the rear of the trailer backed up against a brambly thicket of bush honeysuckle so if roy dean hauled his skinny ass out of a window or door on the back side hed have to make his way along the side of the trailer battling the shrubs the whole way and come out one side or the other if he picked a window on the front side hed be stuck wrassling his way out for a few moments either way shooting into the dirt at his feet ought to do the trick minutes ticked by and still roy dean didnt appear stella heard the sound of heavy objects being pushed around incredulous she demanded roy dean you arent trying to barricade yourself in there are you there was a pause a few moments of silence stella could almost picture roy dean knitting those scraggly eyebrows together pursing his lips and thinking hardas hard as he could at any rate well what if i am he finally said his voice muffled and echoey inside the trailer what are you gonna do about it stella couldnt believe itthe little asswipe was still mouthing off to her after all the effort shed put in after laying it all out for himwith extra care given his evident slowwittednessand explaining both what hed done to get her attention and what the consequences would be of any further mischief it was bad enough that shed got the call about him yesterdayone of her sources said she had spotted a fella that looked an awful lot like roy dean at the concession stand of the latham county speedway pulling on the long blond ponytail of his companion hard enough that she was crying and trying to get away while he just laughedbut to give stella lip when shed driven all this way on her day off stella sighed again and leveled the little raven about two feet to the right of where she figured roy dean to be she thought about the calendar sitting on her kitchen counter with its pastel flower borders and its encouraging sayings and she realized that she was no longer a member of its target audience fuck serenity she said and shot the trailer she wasnt sure whether the bullet would make it throughno telling whatall they used to line the walls of these thingsbut judging by roy deans startled yelp and the string of cursing that ensued the shot had apparently made an impression im shooting out the windows next she called just to speed things along sounds of the heavy objects being pushed out of the way were followed by the door being flung open and there stood roy dean in all his glory sweating and panting hard grimy boxer shorts hanging off his bony hips a filthy white tank top leaving most of his pale chest exposed shit miz hardesty cut it out okay look im invitin you into my home you dont need to go shootin no more stella lowered her gun hand to her side and let the raven hang there casually she could go from full dangle to aimed and ready to shoot in about a tenth of a second that was a trick shed worked on most of last winter when business was slow at the shopsitting on her stool behind the cash register and practicing her draw tucking the gun into the drawer when the bell at the door signaled a customers arrival shed also taught herself to spin the thing on her finger just like gary cooper in high noon but that trick was strictly for her own enjoyment she didnt mind having a little flair but she wasnt an idiot guns after all were serious business you got any coffee on she asked as she shouldered her way past roy dean inside it didnt smell any too fresh and the dining table and chairs were all bunched together to the side presumably they had been part of the barricade that roy dean had been erecting to keep her out roy dean snorted but as he circled the tiny kitchen he kept to the edges his eye on her gun hand good she liked them scared its almost one he said who the hell drinks coffee in the afternoon me as a matter of fact but i guess id settle for a coke alls i got is beer coors or coors light coors light huh you wouldnt be entertaining any ladies now would you roy dean what no i uh i aint gone anywhere near chrissy can it lover boy make no mistake if you so much as look at chrissy crosswise ill know before you have time to scratch your balls and then ill you know probably come around and shoot em off or something roy deans face darkened like a fourth of july thunderstorm and he leaned back against the formica counter the boys knees were probably feeling a little wobbly if stella had to guess she suppressed a smile im through with her he snapped i tol you that yeah you did but if i recall we were kind of far along the convincing path before you managed to choke that promise out stella had been surprised that roy dean had lasted as long as he had on the day she taught him a lesson some guys folded before she even got startedespecially the ones who had heard the rumors about stella being an insane dominatrix when she started unpacking her bag of toys some men turned into blubbering masses of terror ready to talk sense without much exertion on stellas part early in her justicedelivering career the thought of being suspected of favoring kinky sexual practices was intensely embarrassing especially since the source of the rumors came about for only the most practical reasons being five feet six overweight and out of shape stella had managed to pull a muscle in her lower back the first time she tied up a recalcitrant jerk at gunpoint she almost shot him by accident as she staggered around yelping in pain there was also the fact that the knottying skills she learned in girl scouts werent up to the task the same guy as stella waved the gun around wildly managed to get his wrists free it was only slightly reassuring that he immediately fell over as he tried to run away having forgotten that his ankles were still bound stella realized she had to make some changes she started a fitness program but she knew she also needed to find a more reliable way to subdue a man she had a vague notion of learning some paramilitary restraint techniques that might rely more on finesse than brute force but google searches for words like restraint and shackle kept popping up bondage sites stella had never seen anything like the photos featured on those sites the gear was fascinating in a creepy kind of way in the photos lovely young ladies looked quite pleased to be trussed up like roasts ready to go in the oven thats when she had an inspiration why not try the same thing on her targets and see if it got them under control stellas first purchase was a spreader bar and a yoke which worked out better than she could have hoped the solid metal bar had restraint cuffs at either end once fastened they kept the legs in a spreadeagle position stella didnt skimp she went for the most expensive model she could find and made arrangements with the vendor to bulk up the padded cuffs with an extrasturdy locking mechanism the yoke worked in a similar fashion the bar had padding at the neck and wrist restraints stella had to fasten these herself but generally by the time the object of her attentions had maneuvered himself into the spreader bar a lot of the fight had gone out of him for a while stella had her eye on a custommade saint andrews cross an arrangement of twobysixes that could be bolted onto the wall with rings for restraining purposes in a variety of positions it was well made finished in a choice of mahogany or natural stains by a very nice man in ohio who offered to drive over and install it himself at that point however stella figured she was going a little overboard all she really needed after all was to get these guys settled down enough to have a rational discussion sometimes the discussion was a little onesided stella did not care to be yelled at or called namesshed had enough of that with ollieso she bought a selection of gags with balls or bits or rings that fitted into the mouth and kept the wearer nice and silent efforts to talk usually just resulted in drooling so stella bought a stack of cheap burp cloths at the babiesrus and added them to her kit roy dean had required the full treatment hed shut up briefly when stella rose up off the floor of the passenger side of his truck in the darkened liquor store parking lot aimed a gun at his temple and told him they were going for a drive stella kept the gun on him all the way out to an abandoned barn she sometimes used but roy dean kept up a string of ugliness as he drove he kept hollering right up to the moment when stella strapped the gag behind his head and then he glared at her malevolently and fought against the bars and restraints it took some work with a length of rubber hose and a hammer handle and a brief poke with the electric shock baton until she finally judged roy dean rehabilitated when she finished up with these guys she had a little speech she delivered while packing up her supplies in it she reminded the man she was about to send back into society that if anything bad were to happen to her there was an evergrowing army of women who owed her and who were willing to pursue vengeance on her behalf women who like her had once had very little to lose and therefore viewed the whole riskandreturn equation somewhat differently than the average person some righteous scary bitches in other words roy dean seemed like he got the message but not even a month later here he was making a new woman cry stella was pretty sure it hadnt gone any further but she was worried that roy dean was the sort of womansmacker who truly believed down in his bones that it was his godgiven right to settle every disagreement with force that it was a womans job to absorb a mans disappointments and frustrations in the form of taunts and putdowns and thrown punches sadly this was the type who was most likely to pick up again where he left off with some other poor woman which was why stella was here today without proof of the incident at the speedway shed limit todays visit to a warning but it would be roy deans last before she dialed up their next encounter to a whole new level you want a beer or not he demanded after starting half a dozen protestations and finally giving up i dont think so tell you what lets sit down and have this chat so i can get back on my way and you can get back to your knitting or whatever it was you were doing when i interrupted roy dean didnt look too happy about it but he lowered himself into one of the dinette chairs never taking his eyes off stella she propped open the trailers front door so as not to miss any small breeze that might happen to wander by roy dean had the blinds down in the trailer no doubt trying to keep the place cool but without an air conditioner it was a losing proposition stella almostfor a fraction of a secondfelt a little bit sorry for him the moment passed she sat down on the chair across from him and leaned her elbows on the table resting her gun hand casually on the sticky surface so you got you a new girl she said conversationally whats her name she isnti dont got aw sugar dont try to keep secrets from auntie stella she said you know ill find out roy dean stared at a nailbitten thumb there aint anyone mmmhmm stella said slowly she let the silence stretch out in front of them letting him cook in his own juices nervous wasnt a bad way to keep these boys well thats real good she finally said keeping her voice friendly i always say its good to let a little time go by after a tough breakup you know youve got to give your heart a chance to recover who needs a rebound relationship all that drama nothing but trouble am i right roy dean or am i right roy dean shrugged and mumbled something that might have been assent hey roy dean stella said like shed just thought of something interesting i ever tell you about my returning customer special roy dean froze for a moment then slowly shook his head still not looking at her well it works like this first time around i look at a guy and i say to myself stella what are the odds we can make a decent citizen out of this moron whos been beating up on his woman i look him over good and i try to find it in my heart to give him another chance i believe in second chances i really do after staring at his thumb miserably the temptation evidently became too much for roy dean because he stuck the thing into his mouth and started gnawing at the nail stella tried to suppress a wave of nausea at the sight but if that same manthe one i gave a chance to the one i didnt nail when i had his dick in a viseif that man gets a little full of himself and decides to pick up on his old tricks with a new lady well then i tend to lose all my patience she leaned across the table and waited until roy dean flicked an increasingly terrified glance in her direction to continue roy dean you know that tire pile out back of vetts body shop roy dean took his thumb away from his mouth long enough to moisten his lips with his tongue and choke out a yeah well a couple years ago a mana preacher if you can believe itcame back for my returning customer special he was smart enough not to bother his exwife she and i made sure of that but get this he wasnt smart enough to stay away from the lady who played the organ at the noon service moved her right in with him and everything now im not saying she was any kind of smart to hook up with him but still stupid aint a crime oh im sorry here i am babbling on taking up all your valuable time what i mean to tell you is she leaned even farther across the table keeping her finger nice and easy on the trigger though she was pretty sure she wouldnt be needing it today and whispered that preachers in about six pieces buried under that tire pile she lowered herself slowly back onto the chair gauging the effect her news had on roy dean there was a fair amount of truth to the storyall of it in fact right up to the tire pile stella didnt kill the man though she had only one death on her hands and she meant to keep it that way killing ollie had been a case of special circumstancesshe was pretty sure that when judgment day arrived and she was called for her audience with the big guy he would understand still there were other ways to skin even the most stubborn tomcat when the preacher took up his old ways on a new lady stella merely switched tactics whenever a gardenvariety restraintandreckoning first visit didnt do the trick stella got creative in this case the preachers hypocrisy reminded her of a story shed read in her english class at prosper high school and she slowly and carefully burned a scarlet a on the preachers chest with her electric prod if she remembered her lessons properly poor hester prynne lettered in adultery the preacher stella figured earned his for assholism but at least now he was a retired asshole taking his shirt off was probably all a lady needed to see before she took off running roy dean left off his thumb midgnaw the color drained from his face and he blinked rapidly a few times nom he said pure sincerity im off women and if i ever take them up again you can bet you wont have no trouble from me she wont have no trouble from you stella clarified thats what you meant right roy dean nodded and gulped air okay good well now im glad we got that out of the way but since im here i thought id ask about something a friend of mine saw down at the speedway stella watched carefully especially roy deans eyes tracking to see which way his glance darted but he didnt look up well i been there sames about a million other folks but i aint taken no woman there stella leaned back in the dinette chair disappointed the online criminology course she was taking from a college based in idaho had offered up a bunch of theories about how to tell when somebody was lying apparently liars looked down and to the left when they spoke they also tended to touch their faces and turned their bodies away and showed emotions only in their mouth not their eyes what a bunch of crap dang roy dean stella said i wish i could believe you but i dont i just dont i mean youre all twitchy like you got a damn gun pointed at me yes i guess thats right thing is if i put it away in the truck and come back in here all nice and friendly its not going to be much of an incentive for you to say any different is it roy dean started to say something then apparently realized the futility of the argument and just shrugged well how about this stella said pushing back her chair and standing giving her bum hip a shake you know im a friendly kind of person right roy dean i got a lot of friends all over the place and not just in prosper either theyre all over missouri and i got a few in kansas and arkansas i even got one gal all the way over in ohio and these nice friends of mine if i ask them to keep a special watch out for you maybe let me know how youre doing since i cant really spend all my time babysittingwell im sure theyll be glad to keep me posted roy deans chin hung lower his lower lip jutting out you can run stella telegraphed with her expression but you cant hide she stood and pushed her chair back in under the beatup old table roy dean you ever figure on getting a real job you know one with a paycheck benefits roy deans spiky eyebrows rose up in surprise i done that already stella thats what got me in this whole mess with you in the first place really stella paused at the door of the trailer interested howd you figure well when i was on at the home depot i got this promotion see thirtyfive cents an hour and chrissy thinks suddenly were all moneybags took herself over to fashion gal and bought her that leather jacket and this is a problem how in truth stella figured she knew where this was headed and felt her fingers tighten on the frame of the screen door i tol her we couldnt afford that bitch wouldnt listen started in on me about a few times i went out after work while she just keeps spending my money one fucking thing after the next the raven as stella raised it up and pointed at him got his attention stella could feel just a faint tremor along her arm down to her trigger finger it would be a real shame to shoot roy dean by accident and thats what it would be if she was provoked like that an accident but bad things happened every day you listen to me real clear she hissed i know about that jacket thats the one chrissy had on when she came to me the first time cept she couldnt get the sleeve over her sling roy dean you know what irony is roy dean eyes fixed on the gun shook his head and swallowed hard well its when the outcome of events isnt what youd guess from what all leads up to it like chrissy see she told me she had been saving for that jacket since last fall she said on double coupon day shed take whatever shed saved and put it in a jar and finally she had enough to buy the jacket only the same day she buys it she gets her arm broke and she cant even wear it proper see irony roy dean fixed his gaze on the floor and refused to look at her or another example might be us talking here stella continued getting everything all worked out me spending my valuable time shaping you into a productive member of society and all and then you say one stupid little thing and i have to shoot you dead that would be ironic she slowly lowered her gun arm gave roy dean a final glare and left she was still shaking a little as she bounced along the rutted track pushing the jeep harder than it cared to go taking the turns fast enough that the wheels threatened to lift up off the road that jacket that damn jacket shed listened to chrissys tearful story with sympathetic fury but only later did stella figure out that it reminded her of something that had happened a week before she finally took care of ollie once and for all it was an unremarkable tuesday afternoon three years ago shed come home from the grocery with a bunch of daffodils jonquils her mother had called them pat collier used to grow them in every bare spot in her yard under trees along the fence between rocks her mother was never happier than when the flower bulbs pushed their shoots up through the last of the snow when the tightrolled buds flung themselves open on a sunny earlyspring day they had freshcut bunches for two bucks sitting in buckets of water outside the freshway and stella brought one home thinking of her mother the entire time pat had been gone two years by thenpancreatic cancer mercifully quick as stella was reaching up to the top shelf for her mothers old white scallopedged pitcher ollie came stomping into the kitchen scratching his wide ass he took one look at her flowers lying there on the counter and demanded where the hell do you get off spending my money on shit like this shed started to tell him it was only two lousy dollars started to say shed been thinking about her mother that day missing her but before she could get any of those thoughts out hed taken a whack at her that sent her toppling off the step stool and left the pitcher lying in a dozen pieces on the floor by the time she got back to the highway stella had herself almost under control she slowed as she approached the cluster of gas stations and fastfood joints before the entrance ramp and after a split seconds consideration eased into the drivethrough lane of the wendys not on her diet but she hadnt missed a workout for weeks so that had to be a few thousand calories shed worked off as the line of cars made its slow trek around the parking lot stella got her gun locked back up in the box by the time she got up to the order screen her fury had simmered back down to its usual bubbling simmer number three she said and a chocolate frosty better make it a large stella visited the bottle of johnnie walker black before her date just to make sure there was enough left for a powerful belt before bed she unscrewed the top and inhaledheld itthen replaced the cap with a mild sense of regret she was running lowand that was an errand she couldnt put off johnnie was a staple item in stellas pantry but she never drank before her standing sunday night date with todd groffe it would be bad form since he couldnt join her being thirteen and all todd let himself in the front door without knocking at a little after seven damn them damn girls he said by way of greeting whatd they do this time stella asked getting a couple of cans of red bull out of the fridge and tearing open a bag of flamin hot cheetos got in my dresser and got my damn boxers and theyre wearin em around the house over their clothes and shit and mom thinks its cute so she wont make them take em off shes all like taking their pictures and stuff todds twin sisters were six stella like everyone else in the world besides todd thought they were adorable todds father wasnt in the picture anymore and his mother sherilee worked long hours during the week and brought work home on the weekend they lived in a little house a few doors down from stella and sherilee had a hard time with the upkeep on the place not to mention paying the mortgage but on saturdays sherilee got the girls a sitter and took todd out on the town stella admired her for that sherilee took her son to burger king to action movies to play paintball they went to walmart and played laser tag and mini golf sunday night it was the girls turn and todd came over to stellas they shared a secret passion they were both americas next top model junkies stella tivoed the show and she and todd ate junk food and critiqued the outfits and the judging and tried to figure out who was really nice and who was just pretending to get along with the other girls meanwhile sherilee took the girls to disney movies and pizza hut and fantastic sams and sears tonight though stella had a hard time concentrating on tyra and her crew as they shuttled the models through a photo shoot in what looked like a muddy jungle her thoughts kept going back to roy dean and his insolent stupid expression as he denied that he was seeing a new girl she had a bad feeling about this one he might turn out to be one of the ones who required creative thinking a step up to an intensified program of discouragement stella didnt relish this aspect of the jobthe turning of the screw the dialing up of the pressure the creation of new varieties and levels of pain she understood that there were people in the worldplenty of themwho got their kicks from hurting others who experienced a rush of pleasure to see other human beings contorted in agony heck if she were to advertise for an assistantsomeone to wield the whip or rubber hose or cattle prod or pliers or lit cigarette so she could keep her hands cleanshed probably have applicants lined up out the door but her business didnt work that way stella knew too much about painthe kind inflicted on the innocent the defenseless those whose worst sins were bad judgment and displaced loyalty and shed pledged to stop it not every abuser everywherethere were simply too many but if it was in her power to help a woman in sawyer county she did so and gradually word reached sisters and cousins and best friends and acquaintances further afield down through the ozarks and up to kansas city and over to saint louis andas the months grew to years and stella learned how to turn vicious and consciencedeficient men into cowering repentersacross state lines stella picked off the sonsofbitches one by one leaving their women free to breathe easy to live without dread as their constant companion and now this sideline threatened to overtake her real job the shop shed inherited from ollie supplying the women of prosper with sewing notions and keeping their sewing machines in good working order every time she thought shed earned some time off a new woman would show up terrified or battered or both but finally ready to make it stop and stella knew what kind of courage that tookand she never turned a client away though she did daydream about the day when the world straightened itself out when the last abuser met his doom and she could go back to selling sewing machines and thread and needles fulltime keep her highlights fresh and her nails done work in the garden bake banana bread go on an occasional date with a real man todd yawned and zapped the tv off with the clicker he grabbed a last handful of cheetos and jammed them all in his mouth at once while he was chewing stella collected the red bull cans and folded the crocheted afghans and brushed a few crumbs off the couch see ya todd said wiping his orange fingers on his baggy shorts thank you very much for inviting me miz hardesty stella said yeah whatever bye stella stella waited a few moments after todd left then eased the front door open and watched him skateboard down the street to his house holding his helmet loosely by the strap pushing off with his foot and leaping up onto the curb and back down with grace she waited until he slipped into his own front door using the key he wore on a shoelace around his neck before she went back inside just two doors down but the world was a dangerous place anything could happen good folks had to look out for one another one of the biggest ripoffs in the universe had to be when the pleasant buzz you took to bed with you at midnight turned itself into queasy cantsleep at am where the hell did all that lovely sparkle go stella had drained the johnnie she hadnt really intended to but some nights were like that some nights were for thinkin and drinkin when it seemed like you couldnt do one without the other stella rarely drank in the days before ollie died shed figured that someone in the house ought to stay sober and ollie frequently wasnt up to the job the johnnie thingshed discovered johnnie walker black a few weeks into her new life as a widow and was so grateful for the way it took the edge off that she started spending more and more time with the bottle there was a stretch there four or five months that didnt bear recallingeven if she could remember anything through the whiskey haze but these days her relationship with johnnie was more measured once stella took up exercise jogging around the neighborhood and dragging ollies barely used bowflex out of storage she didnt need the alcoholinduced numbing as much just the nightly drink or occasionally two except for the rare night when two didnt do the trick when she needed an extra layer of fuzzy loveliness if only she could skip the earlymorning sleeplessness that always followed in those predawn hours stella sometimes amused herself by imagining how she would do in the joint it was luck more than anything that had kept the law from investigating her sideline business but her luck couldnt hold forever eventually one of her parolees would decide to roll the dice and turn her in or the long arm of the law would somehow get wise enough to catch her in the act of rehabilitating a subject either way questions would be asked leads would be followed and when that happened odds were good that stella would be headed for jail stella wasnt sure she much cared life with ollie had been worse than anything the prison system could dish out life without ollie was better but it was still lonely becoming a stonecold enforcer had changed her taking away any desire shed ever had to play nice just to fit in she called it like she saw it now cussed when she felt like it didnt back down jail didnt scare stella with an assault conviction or two she figured her reputation would precede her her nickname would be some variation on hardesty probably hardass of course you didnt get a handle like that for free shed probably have to shank somebody on the first day or something but then there was the matter of all the pairingoff that happened in womens prison shed seen a tv documentary on the subject diane sawyer stellas favorite journalist spent the night in jail wearing a prisonissue jumpsuit to interview the inmates stella couldnt believe how matteroffact the women were about their sex lives and how creative too making sex toys out of bits of junk stolen here and there unfortunately stella was pretty sure she didnt have any latent lesbian tendencies so all that prison action wouldnt do her much good it was a shame too because the documentary made it clear that even the homelier ladies had opportunities for love stella was no beauty queen despite the hours she spent on the bowflex her muscles were still protected by a generous larding of extra pounds then there were the gray roots the facial hair in odd places the breasts heading to the equator but on tv shed seen it with her own eyes gals who didnt have anything on herhell downright old ugly gals with no access to a blowdryerenthusiastically reporting all the lovin they were getting diane didnt back down either she listened with polite interest she didnt judge stella admired her for keeping her cool diane who made even prison duds look elegant hadnt seen fifty in a while herself but she had a sort of mature sensuality that implied shed done more in the sack than most people even dream about she probably had mindblowing sex five days a week stella figured she might miss sex more if it had been any good when she had it fucking ollie that thought never far from her mind and in a thousand different contexts brought unexpected tears to stellas eyes as she lay there in the bed shed once shared with him this time it was simply because hed been such an incredibly worthless lay all those years all that bad sex that wasnt even in the top five reasons why hed deserved what he got but still stella found herself immensely sad to think of how many times shed lain in this bed with ollie laboring over her like a man stuffing fiberglass insulation between roof joists on a sweltering day of course it wasnt like he had an overabundance of insulation to work with that wayward thought cracked stella up a little so that when she did finally manage to fall back into a brief but deep sleep she did so with a smile on her face and tears dried to salty tracks on her cheeks two monday went by slowly stella roamed the shop floor restlessly her head throbbing and her mouth cottony she ordered a pizza for lunch and after promising herself shed eat only half and take the rest home for leftovers nibbled it down to a few crusts over the course of the afternoon hardesty sewing machine sales repair did the same languid business it always had there had been a steady trickle of customers when ollie ran the place and there was a steady trickle now the only difference was that ollie used to fix the machines himself now a man came in and picked them up once a week and returned them a few days later running better than ollie had ever managed stella made small talk while she handled the days few sales and tried to keep herself awake by dusting and polishing and straightening the stock until it was finally time to close up and go home after a dinner of an apple and half a bag of carrotspenance for the pizzastella fell asleep watching cnn woke up after eight dreamless hours and switched to good morning america for a while she was content to watch diane sawyer sideways checking the tourists holding signs as she always did for anyone from missouri on the rare occasion when one of her fellow missourians made it all the way to rockefeller center stella felt both proud and wistful the farthest east shed ever been was a high school trip to philadelphia back when they still had the liberty bell out where you could see it closeup diane had on a fungus green jacket today and a section of her hair the part that was supposed to fall coquettishly above one eye was doing something a little strange winging out at an angle not your best look stella murmured at the television but kindly she could relate stella decided it would be a day of hard work she had a banana for breakfast and got to work in earnest she put the laundry in the dryer and collected all the dirty sheets and towels and the remaining dirty clothes and sorted them the sight of the colorcoded piles made her feel pleasantly efficient shed been a competent homemaker as a young mother shed kept a spotless house dressed her daughter noelle in clean pressed little outfits with her hair in ribbons to match shed baked elaborate cakes for church fundraisers slipcovered all the furniture herself vacuumed the drapes regularly and dusted twice a week now with two businesses to run shed let the place slide usually it didnt bother her in fact it still felt decadent and rebellious occasionally though stella spent a whole day cleaning the place from top to bottom today would have been such a day except that around ten thirty the doorbell rang stella peeled off her yellow rubber gloves and set down the bucket of soapy water and the brush shed been using to scrub the kitchen floor and answered the door chrissy shaw stood on her front porch wearing a strappy purple top that showed off her pillowy breasts as well as the fading bruises along her shoulders and upper arms she crossed her arms over her chest and shifted from one high platform sandal to the other her face swollen from crying stellas heart sank she hadnt expected to see the girl for a while usually her clients stayed away after a job she didnt take it personallythey usually just needed to distance themselves not everyone was as comfortable dishing out stellas brand of justice as she was no matter how relieved they were with the results it could be a messy business when a client came back this quick it usually meant something had gone wrong is roy dean bothering you stella demanded holding the door wide for chrissy to enter nom chrissy mumbled she had on tight denim shorts that barely covered her jiggly rear and she tugged at the fringed hems as she clopped past stella she trailed some kind of perfume that smelled like it came out of one of those peelandrub ads in cosmopolitan magazinea little musky a little papery could be the girl had just spritzed on a little overmuch to cover up skipping todays shower stella employed that technique herself from time to time chrissy walked into stellas living room and lost her momentum she turned to the couch the love seat ollies old lazboy and considered each one but couldnt seem to make up her mind she pressed the back of her hand to her forehead and managed a pathetic little whimper chrissy was in her middle twenties but if you didnt know better you might guess she was eighteen hell sugar dont matter where you plant your butt well still be having the same conversation stella said tell you what while youre deciding why dont i get us some iced tea when she came back with the tray a few minutes later chrissy had slumped low in the love seat and was leaking tears down her plump cheeks pale blond hair sticking to her sweatdamp skin her wide blue eyes were ringed with smudgy mascara oh dear stella said i know it seems bad now but whatever roy deans done its nowhere near the worst problem someones come here to talk about nothing i cant help you fix anyway chrissy wiped her nose along her knuckles and sniffled yeah well guess what i think this time i might a brung you a problem you aint had before stella sat down on the couch and picked up a long silver spoon off the tray and gave her glass of tea a swirl oh these girls every one of them sure they had a new story to tell honestly it tried her patience sometimes until she remembered what it felt like to be in their shoes when you were the one getting smacked around trashtalked cheated on and generally treated worse than any man would treat a tickinfested hound dog then yeah your story seemed like the most singular piece of news on earth is that right dolly stella screwed down the lid on her impatience and settled in to hear the whole story well you tell me all about it and then well figure out what to do but here wet your whistle before you get rolling chrissy accepted a glass of tea but set it down on the table without sipping roy deans gone and run off now honey he isnt gone hes just been staying out at a trailer down close to shooters cove stella said wondering if the girl had been foolish enough to go looking for him sometimes even after suffering all manner of abuse her clients had second thoughts but theres no need to go stirring things up aint roy dean i care about stellaonly just hes taken tucker came and took him yesterday morning told me he wanted his hibachi back and when i went around back to get it i guess thats when he got tucker cause when i came back inside they was both gone chrissy snuffled and dabbed at her eyes smearing her makeup further oh no stella said setting her own glass down and jerking to attention that does change things shit yeah chrissy said and her glum expression slipped further and a shadow of terrible worry flashed across her doughy features thats about the size of it stella excused herself making sure that the plate of oreos was in chrissys easy reach and called sheriff goat jones from the kitchen she was one of only a handful of people with direct access to the sheriffs mobile number and that was a result of her only case that had gone terribly wrong a failure from which stella would never entirely recover two years back lorelle cavenaugh went missing less than a week after she came to stella for help stella spent forty straight hours searching for lorelle on her own before calling the sheriff she invented a story about them being third cousins and lorelle leaving a terrified message on her machine which she had just happened to erase and which oddly didnt show up in the phone company records by the time they found lorelle stuffed headdown into a rain barrel at jack cavenaughs fishing cabin stella had promised herself that shed never again let anything get in the way of a womans safety not even if it meant danger to herself or exposure or bringing in the entire sheriffs department goat jones told her she had more stick than a cocklebur after she hounded him to widen the search and ignored every order he gave her to stay away from him and his men while they scoured the county he called her a few other things toothe words bulldog and nosense and damn stubborn fool came to mind goat said hed be right over grousing only a little that she wouldnt give him any details on the phone stella peeked in at chrissy who was nibbling morosely at a cookie and hightailed it to her bathroom where she got out the modest arsenal of beauty products that she kept in an empty jif peanut butter jar and went to work it wasnt that she was fixing up for the sheriff exactly because that would be ridiculous for one thing their work generally put them on opposite sides of the law that alone made the man if not exactly an enemy certainly not a person she should be fraternizing with and anyway they didnt run in the same social circles goat was a regular at the friday night poker game at the firehousethe same game ollie had played in for years the game all of ollies old friends still belonged to not that it was fair to paint them with the same brush as her dead husband but they had become a little standoffish since she nearly stood trial for killing ollie goat got himself invited to the game as a sort of law enforcement courtesy his deputies ian sloat and mike kutzler had been playing for years and it wouldnt have looked right to exclude goat even though he was still a newcomer to the area he had lived in prosper for only a couple of years having been hired in to replace old sheriff burt knoll after he died of a heart attack while cheering on his grandson at a gokart race most of the poker players had lived in prosper for decades if not their entire lives they were courteous to goat but maybe friend was too strong a word outside the poker game she knew they didnt barbecue together or bowl in the same league or even jaw too long if they ran into each other at the home depot still at the rate of four hours a week for two years that was oh hell a few hundred hours anyway that goat and her late husbands drinking buddies shared each others company and in stellas book that made goat guilty of poor taste in the company he kept if nothing else stella splashed cold water on her face and slapped her cheeks a few times in an effort to get a little color into them she leaned in close to the mirror and didnt like what she saw it had been a while since shed taken a pair of tweezers to her eyebrows and they seemed to have made expansion plans on their own the battle she was waging on her wrinkles armed with the jumbo tub of avon anew clinical deep crease concentrate that her sister had sent her last christmas didnt seem like it was trending in her favor the wrinkles were still there and if she wasnt mistaken the ones around her eyes had hatched a plan to reach down and shake hands with her laugh lines stella scrambled through the jif jar tossing aside shampoo sample packets and emery boards and a dozen lipsticks in unflattering shadesshe was a sucker for those clinique giftwithpurchase dealsuntil she found the tube of avon radiant lifting foundation another gift from gracellen praying it hadnt passed its sellby date she squeezed a little onto her finger and dabbed at the worst spots on her face her hair had escaped its barrette and sprang out in an unruly mass that was entirely stellas fault for most of her life shed been vain about her thick wavy light brown hair keeping it trimmed and conditioned and blown dry shed just gotten in a few bad habits in the last couple of years thats all missing yesterdays appointment with jane over at hair lines hadnt helped any she grabbed her hairbrush and yanked it forcibly through ignoring the pain unfortunately taking out the tangles also served to play up the line of demarcation between her gray roots and the shade that jane had mixed up at her last visit stella was overdue for a goodly amount of maintenance work she gave up and put down the brush she made a face at the mirror figuring shed done all she could on short notice at the door to her bedroom she had a thought and dashed back to the bathroom she dumped the jif jar out in the sink and found what she was looking for at the bottom of the pile a small bottle of white diamonds she sprayed behind her ears and on her wrists sniffed deeply and added one last spritz down her bra in the living room chrissy had made a sizable dent in the oreos good girl stella murmured helping herself to one got to keep your strength up naturally goat knocked on the door just as soon as she had the whole cookie in her mouth stella backhanded the crumbs off her lips and swallowed hard as she went to open the door managing to get the thing stuck in her throat she had to cough out a greeting goat she gasped holding the door wide and gesturing him in good of you to come a bit of cookie lodged stubbornly and she hacked some more you okay there dusty goat asked but damn the man he didnt look so much concerned as amused light streaming through the picture window bounced off his shiny bald head and sparkled up his bluerthanblue eyes and he gave her one of his sideways grins want me to whack you on the back a time or two dont you dare stella said with as much dignity as she could manage please sit she reclaimed her own spot on the couch and sipped primly at her tea once shed cleared her air passage so that she could talk without spraying crumbs she gestured at chrissy who had managed to get herself more or less into a situpstraight position in the chair to greet the sheriff chrissy you know sheriff jones dont you dear and sheriff this is chrissy shaw shes one of the lardner girls out road twelve the soybean lardners there were two strains of lardners in town the soybean lardners were the wrong ones to hail from if you had any choice in the matter ralph lardner was a lazy mountain of flesh who did more sitting on his ass and ordering his boys around the farm than he did actual labor and the family skill set lent itself more to quickanddirty methods rather than true craftsmanship so the lardner sons were constantly patching the siding on the barns and resetting leaning fence posts and attacking lateseason weeds with industrialstrength fungicide in watering cans killing off their mothers flower garden at least once a year the other lardner in town was named gray ralph and gray were distant cousins but it would take degrees in both history and math to trace out the exact nature of their blood relationship the lineage had split long enough back that grays side had managed to build a modest fortune buying up rich land along sugar creek on the south end of town while ralphs crew mined stony hardpacked dirt for a bedraggled crop every year gray had to just look at his land sideways and it seemed happy to send up burgeoning fields of corn alfalfa prizewinning squashwhatever he had a mind to grow ralphs boys seemed bent on following in their fathers sorry footsteps his girls on the other hand tended to marry the first boy who asked just to get off that unlucky land pleased to make your acquaintance the sheriff said shaking chrissys limp hand with exaggerated care before settling his lanky frame into ollies old lazboy damn but the man was tall stella couldnt help thinking for the thousandth time had to be six foot four with acres of muscle running along his broad shoulders visible even under that homely tan uniform shirt in his spare time goat had what was generally viewed as a strange hobby he liked to lash his kayak to the top of his pickup truck and drive to any of the hundreds of putin spots along the northern shore of the lake of the ozarks as close as twenty miles away as the crow flies then hed spend the day paddling around the inlets and channels and bights along the jagged shore all that paddling clearly built up a mans physique nice to meet you sheriff sir chrissy said a rosy blush stealing across her pale full cheeks and she looked at the carpet rather than at goat stella might have thought the girl was shy but she knew better stammering uncertainty was the blooddictated response that all the ralph lardner kin had to the law she guessed that the idea was that if your pa or brothers werent guilty of something at this particular juncture odds were good that they had just come from or were plotting to soon commit some sort of lawskirting activity chrissys a good girl stella said hoping to head off any conclusions goat might be tempted to draw oh im sure she is im sure you are he repeated giving chrissy a reassuring smile i suppose youre wondering why i asked you over stella said well yes dusty i am but im also wondering if youre planning to offer me a glass of that tea oh stella felt the blood flow to her cheeks as she hauled herself up out of the couch i meant to im sorry i just ah she retreated to the kitchen to fetch another glass cursing under her breath damn damn damn she had the hardest time keeping her wits about her when goat was around and that annoyed her plenty she possessed after all a slick and hardened criminal mind shed committed any number of misdemeanors and felonies she generally stayed icy cool in sticky situations so why was she such a stuttering mess around the man it wasnt like she was afraid old goat was going to put two and two together anytime soon those who knew her business werent talking those who suspected well they werent talking much either and stella figured they all had their reasons some didnt want to end up on her bad side others figured the world was a sight better place if she was left in peace to do her job of course there was the small and niggling problem that goat she suspected was far smarter than he let on and eventually someone was going to break the timehonored rule of smalltown living and engage in a little conjecturing with himoutsider or not when that day came it would be the sort of reckoning that would make all of her previous brushes with the law look like playground entertainment yet another reason to spend as little time with the man as possible here she said accusingly thrusting the glass at him well i suppose ill just pour myself goat said accepting the glass he reached for the pitcher raising his pinkie in an exaggerated fancyschmancy pose dont you exert yourself none dusty am i allowed to have a cookie or are those just for the ladies stella picked up the plate and smacked it down in front of him there were only three or four cookies left poor chrissy had eaten most of themwho could blame her and stop calling me dusty whys he call you that anyway chrissy stagewhispered in a perfectly audible voice still keeping her eyes cast down cause he hasnt got any manners i guess stella said goat laughed thats not right its just cause shes a bad old hardesty get itdesty dusty shes not like a regular gal miss why she frequents disreputable taverns cusses a blue streak probably chews tobacco when nobodys looking cant exactly call her rosebud so thats enough stella said sharply and she must of put a little extra meanit in her voice because suddenly everyone was very quiet and goat slowly lowered his iced tea glass to the coffee table and gave her a long studied look what i mean to say is i think im a little old for some juvenile nickname so if you dont mind you can just start calling me stella like every other person in this town goat maybe it wasnt necessary to add that last bit but stella was steamed enough to go for it well why dyou call him that chrissy asked the carpet clearly she was no student of conversational subtext stella sighed now hon why dont we just lay this whole names business to rest we got plenty else to talk about here no miss i dont mind answering goat said but he kept his gaze trained steady on stella and by the wicked sparkle in his eyes stella could tell shed managed to get his ire up smart she chided herself way to provoke the law when she needed him most see when i got divorced my first wife saw fit to tell everyone that the problem was that im as randy as a stop right there stella snapped chrissy might be one of the dimmer bulbs in a family that wasnt lit up bright with smarts to start with but stella didnt think it was right to take advantage of her gullible nature with any sort of teasing not to mention the terrible day the poor girl was having its just that the sheriff has been stubborn from the day he was born it was his own mama who gave him that nickname what kind of stubborn chrissy asked darting shy little glances in the mans direction her mama had obviously not gotten around to teaching her that it wasnt polite to talk about people right in front of them as though they werent there well the wrong kind of course like a goat you ever try to lead one around wherever you try to drag it the goat figures it wants to be headed the other way oh i see chrissy nodded well sheriff i imagine ill just call you sheriff jones if its all the same to you thatd be just fine miss after that there was a brief silence while stellas two guests stole polite glances at each other chrissys husband roy dean has run off stella said time to get down to business hes been gone since yesterday morning and he took little tucker with him whos tucker goat asked at that chrissys features which had been schooled into her best approximation of mindful interest melted into a blubbery puddle stella handed her the box of kleenex she kept at the ready on the side table next to the couch smackedaround wives often found it came in handy tuckers my little baby boy she wailed hes not even two years old yet oh well im sorry to hear that but its only been one day and tucker aint even his chrissy continued to sniffle roy dean never paid that child any mind before i dont know why hed want to go and run off with him goat looked at stella eyebrows raised chrissy was married before she explained to pitt akers from the akers over up south of sedalia but he wasnt the father either chrissy cut in dabbing at her eyes with a tissue she was getting herself under control a little no goat asked politely i think i might ought to start noting some of this down he pulled out a little notebook and flipped to a fresh page now whose boy is your tucker well im not entirely sure see because that was right about when i broke up with the fella id been seeing after pitt and i split up and there was this one night out at my cousins goat held up a palm to stop her i guess i dont need to know that he said what tucker is is a child from a previous relationship stella clarified hoping to save chrissy a little embarrassment thats right chrissy said nodding thats exactly what he is now had your husband been talking about taking any trips going to visit kin anything like that oh no sir roy deans not one for a lot of visiting and his folks are all around here that was an understatement shaws were firmly rooted in prosper some of them probably hadnt left sawyer county in years roy deans daddy had a painting business hed got from his own daddy and now roy dean and his brother arthur were on the books tucker if roy deand taken more of a shine to the boy could have looked forward to a painting career himself was there anybody he had a beef with chrissy shot stella a wideeyed glance no doubt wondering if she herself counted stella gave her a tiny little shake of the head hoping the girl would have the sense not to talk about the problems between her and roy dean assuming roy dean turned up and chrissy had the need to take care of him in some manner or other down the road it wouldnt do for the sheriff to know too much about their relationship um no chrissy said i mean yes he got into a fight now and then hes kind of quicktempered i guess youd say whos he fight with well just whoevers there when the mood comes on i guess i mean its usually somebody says something roy dean dont like when hes been drinkin too much aint that usually how it goes can you give me a forinstance goat sat with his pen poised and ready to go but he hadnt written much yet so far this wasnt a terribly unique tale that chrissy was telling despite its name prosper was not a place where people lived extravagant lives times had gotten hard in the eighties and not improved much since besides farming there was the porkprocessing plant and a sad little office park that had never been fully occupied the businesses ran along the shabby side of legitimate there was a usedofficefurniture dealer the headquarters of a regional friedchicken chain an outfit that installed prefab sheds in peoples backyards so they had somewhere to put all the junk that didnt fit in the garage prosper had developed an undercurrent of dissatisfaction of cynicism that stella didnt remember from her own childhood there fifty years ago when she was born rural missouri still strove to live up to the wholesome ideals generated by the postwar era men like her father worked hard to buy a house to get ahead the american legion hall and a few of the local churches had been built by volunteers during that era of civic responsibility as stella and her sister attended prosper elementary and played in the streets and parks and back yards of town the world seemed like a safe and orderly place sure prosper had its town drunk its neerdowells its hard cases but they routinely got their clocks fixed by sheriff knoll after a lecture and a couple nights in the lockup sheepish spells of better behavior nearly always followed nowadays the distinction between the good guys and the bad guys was a lot blurrier and it wasnt clear to stella who was winning she was almost tempted to feel sorry for goat and his crew she knew that they spent most of their time on patrol and traffic stops and trying to keep a lid on all the problems at the high school a job that stella figured parents ought to be helping out with sawyer county didnt extend down to the lake so they were spared the job of patrolling the shore but they got the traffic heading home often drunk frequently rowdy and sometimes belligerent and with the mountains of procedural requirements in place these days goat and ian and mike didnt have the freedom to police the town the way they saw fit as burt knoll had once done hell they probably spent half their time doing paperwork it was a wonder goat had never been tempted to go freelance himself like she had well roy dean likes go to bjs after work some days chrissy said him and arthur and them all sometimes things get a little out of hand goat wrote a few words down bar fights then he said anything lately chrissy shifted uncomfortably in her chair a pale band of flesh muffined up over her shorts her lively top not quite up to the task of covering it and chrissy tugged at the fabric ineffectively well maybe she said a couple weeks ago he came home scraped up some how so well a little worsen some not as bad as other times i mean what was the nature of roy deans injuries oh one of his eyes was swoll up so he could hardly see out of it and he got hit in the other one too but not as badit didnt bruise up until the next day he did something to his arm where he couldnt lift it up past his shoulder for a while he was favoring it said it hurt to lift anything oh and he thought he was gonna lose one of his teeth it went kind of loose on him but you know that seemed to take care of itself and of course he was cut up here and there not bad enough for stitches or anything so a pretty good dustup then the sheriff said well not the worst ever but bad enough i guess and you dont have any idea who it was he got into it with no sir roy dean dont like to talk about that kind of thing much he just makes light of it i put bactine on im gauze and bandages put some steak on his eyes raw you know have him lay down and that helps what a fool waste of meat stella thought but at least chrissy was answering the sheriffs questions without mumbling too muchand without giving too much away about her marital problems but if goat had any sense hed be on his way to figuring out that part you know men she interjected joining the conversation in an effort to distract him they dont have much to say when theyre on the receiving end of a beating oops stella clamped her mouth shut but the unfortunate remark had slipped out goat turned to her and gave her a long searching look she had to work hard not to fidget it was like those blue eyes sent out some sort of lowlevel laser beam that burned right through her skin is that right he said mildly stella had a thought that shed had before and not a very comfortable one at times it seemed as if goat suspected a little too much about her sideline business the sewing machine shop provided as much cover as she ought to need stella was there every monday and wednesday through saturday nine to six sunday and tuesday were her days off and then she made sure that folks saw her doing errands around town her other business was the sort of thing that could be conducted in the evenings late evenings if need be which was often the case besides it was word of mouth onlyand her clients were very very discreet they passed her name along only to their most trustedand desperatefriends after all they had as much reason to keep things quiet as she did more most of them so i hear she said cool as she could she felt little prickles of sweat pop along her hairline but resisted the urge to wipe them away fussing like that was a good way to signal you were thinking something you didnt want to let onstella had learned that from the online course what about when men are the ones dishing it out goat asked same steady gaze stella shrugged wouldnt know she looked straight at him and carefully blinked twice while she told this whopper of a lie that same criminology course had advised that people who didnt blink at all might be lying concentrating a little too hard at looking you in the face although this might be a pointless lie it wasnt exactly an ironclad secret that ollie had taken out his frustrations on her for the better part of her marriage neighbors heard sounds coming from the house friends noticed the bruises and even the most taciturn talked eventually of course lots of folks had talked when stella went up in front of the judge back when goat was still just a deputy sheriff all the way over in sedalia and it was burt knoll who had answered a call from the neighbors and found stella sitting in this very living room next to the body of her husband wrench still in her hand every person in town knew that ollie was a wife beater and plenty of them were prepared to say that hed always been a cowardly bully as well the judge finally had to turn away the flood of wouldbe character witnesses whod swear theyd seen ollie kick a dog or backhand stella in the car as they pulled out of the church lot after sunday services the judge did allow several to testify theyd clearly heard ollie threaten to kill his wife but stella was willing to bet that goat didnt know everything one of the holy commandments of smalltown living was that newcomers werent privy to local gossip even if it was acknowledged truth so he probably had to do a little guesswork to fill in the gaps for all stella knew he was still wondering why old judge ligett had dismissed the case and sent her home in time for jeopardy all right then goat turned back to chrissy can you give me the exact date of this fight chrissy thought about it for a few moments no i cant she said apologetically it was probably a friday cause roy dean does his more serious drinking on fridays and i guess it was probably in april but i dont know beyond that well now easter was lets see i believe it was on april twelfth was it before easter or after you remember that chrissy put on a look of tremendous concentration pinching her bottom lip between her thumb and forefinger well we went to easter dinner at roy deans folks place and i dont remember him being busted up in the face then so i guess it must have been after so that leaves uh friday the twentyfourth and then youre into may may firsts a friday you think it was the twentyfourth more thinking chrissys brow wrinkled with intense concentration oh sheriff i just dont know im sorry sir goat reached over and patted her knee awkwardly thats all right hon he said gently stella noticed the gesture with surprise goat was hardly a warm and fuzzy creature she had never heard him use any form of endearment before but maybe chrissys pathetic expression had swayed the stubborn man a point for their team and youre sure you dont know who he might have seen that night no do you think his brother arthur would have been there well maybe sometimes theyd go together sometimes not you know how brothers are sometimes roy deand get mad at him for some silly little thing and not talk to him for a day or two goat scribbled in his pad a little more how about since then any more fights did you overhear any arguments maybe on the phone no nothing like that chrissy said a little too quickly stella guessed she knew what that meant usually women came to her when there had been an uptick in the abuse heaped on them by their men sometimes there was a huge confrontation but more often it was just that the abuse became more and more frequent until the women never had time to recover in between to convince themselves that it was worth sticking around that theyd imagined how bad it was that things would change in the end one last straw usually not so different from those that came before would be the one that broke the camels back and sent them to stellas doorstep she peeked at goat and saw hed knit his eyebrows together in a look of consternation chrissys quick denial hadnt got past the man stella also noticed before she had a chance to stop herself that goat had some finelooking eyebrows for a man who was out of the hair business on the top of his head hed got him some nice thick allbusiness brows with a rakish slant to them that made him look like the close cousin of a handsome devil goat caught her looking winked at her winked just when stella figured she had a handle on the man hed go and do something like that shake her foundations maybe that was his goal to get her flummoxed enough that shed let her guard down as stella blushed he turned back to chrissy any change in his work habits well i dont think so i mean him and arthur junior been helping their dad on a job at parkade elementary school over in colfax its a big job so hes been gone regular and he doesnt call me during he day less he needs something arthur junior still on that job i guess you havent talked to him since roy dean left no me and arthur junior we dont get along so good i cant ever think what to say around him i dont guess he much likes me stella narrowed her eyes that was news to her news she would have preferred chrissy save for later she coughed lightly trying to signal to chrissy to put a sock in it goat didnt seem to notice ill talk to him what about their folks mr and mrs shaw have you talked to them no sir i just usually wait until i see them we go over for sunday dinner once a month or so and his mom and i catch up then roy dean sees his dad on the job most days but didnt his dad call around looking for roy dean yesterday when he didnt show up for work well this time chrissy glanced at stella before answering see its not all that unusual if roy dean or arthur junior take a day off here and there they cover for each other you know if one of them is feeling poorly or something like that stella couldnt help itshe rolled her eyes heavenward feeling poorlyyeah she could guess what that was about she had plenty of her own mornings when she was feeling that brand of poorly she however went and opened up the shop hangover or no she didnt give herself a day off as a reward for misbehaving the night before goat evidently got the drift he gave those eyebrows a bit of a workout and cleared his throat i see okay why dont you tell me a little bit about your boy tucker was it oh yes here i got pictures chrissy sat up straight in her chair and grabbed her purse off the table she dug in it and found a cheap little plastic flip book and handed it to goat he paged through the book taking a few moments over each photo well if he isnt a little dickens goat said smiling and chrissy brightened he handed the book to stella tucker was adorable a big chubbyhanded baby who was laughing in nearly every picture he had his mothers wide blue eyes and silky pale hair stella glanced over at the fireplace mantel where she still kept one of noelles baby pictures her daughter had been a big happy baby too a good sleeper and nearly always contented funny how they turned out stella turned back to the conversation and noticed that goat was watching her that your daughter in that picture he asked stella nodded she didnt plan to say anything more on the subject but to her surprise she suddenly couldnt say any more because her throat closed up and her eyes stung well it was no wonder was it what with all this talk about missing kids of course noelle was twentyeight now and she wasnt exactly missing she just wasnt speaking to her mother tuckers eighteen months and thirteen days old chrissy said i got his fingerprints done at the home depot on safe kids day you want me to go home and get the card goat snapped his notebook shut and slid his pen into the ring binding well i dont see any need for that just now chrissy i dont want you to worry too much about roy dean and tucker just yet theres all kinds of reasons why he might be gone hear and youve given me lots of ideas for where to look for him youre going to start right now the longing in chrissys voice tugged at stellas heart the girl was desperate enough to get her baby back that she was eager to launch a hunt for her nogood husband might as well ill be in touch soons i find out anything you think of something or hear from him you call me he stood unfolding his lanky legs like a carpenters rule and took a card from his pocket and laid it on the coffee table in front of chrissy after a moments hesitation he laid a second one in front of stella i suppose you might as well have one too he gave her that same long studied knowtoomuch look before he threw in a grin nodded to chrissy and made his way to the door stella stood and watched him warily thanks for coming so quick she said anytime he shut the front door with care holding the handle so it wouldnt slam through the screen stella and chrissy listened to him start up his departmentissue charger and drive off well stella said uncertainly i guess that went about as well as it could have he sure is tall chrissy said for a sheriff why you known any short ones short what sheriffs hon stellas opinion of chrissy was taking a turn for the dumber and she was sorry to see it dumb wasnt going to help find roy dean any quicker still it could just be the stress of the situation poor girl had a lot on her mind and besides talking to goat did weird things to stellas own brain so she supposed she shouldnt judge chrissy too harshly oh no well there was sheriff knoll of course and he was about medium i guess chrissy stella sat back down scooted a little closer to chrissy and leaned in close this is important what you told the sheriff was that all true chrissy nodded yes maam did you leave anything out you mean like what he done to me lately yes i guess i did chrissy lifted up her shirt showed the shadow of a wide blackandblue bruise that stretched across her rib cage hes got more careful about hitting me on the arms cause sometimes it showed done this one with his fist though and got me right above the butt too here all since that fight in the bar chrissy sighed yes these ones theyre taking their time fading i never do heal up very quick but before that it kind of seemed like things might be looking up a bit you know stella didnt say it but she remembered well how youd go a week or two a month sometimes maybe three with nothing start thinking things had changed that your man wasnt really so different from other guys that hed just come through a bad patch that was all that if you were just a little extra careful a little more attentive it would be different this time until one day he saw fit to remind you okay well now look i want you to go on home and try not to worry just like the sheriff says if he calls you you tell him whatever he wants to know but then you call me up and tell me about it hear chrissy nodded only a little wobbly i just want tucker back ill do anything to get tucker me too sweetheart and im going to work hard to make that happen well get your boy but if roy dean comes back too then were going to be right back where we started and we need to make sure that youre still ready to do what needs done do you follow what im saying yes maam were gonna whup roy deans ass for the first time that day stella managed a smile thats right she said thats the spirit three by the time stella pulled into the parkade elementary parking lot the day had moved into asphaltmelting breezeless midafternoon the place looked to be locked down tight as a drum but there were a few cars in the lot and stella figured the handful of teachers and administrators still hanging around during summer vacation had themselves barricaded in with the airconditioning over at the far end of the parking lot was a white pickup with shaw painting spelled out in a mostly straight line in black stickon lettering it wasnt a badlooking truck maybe six or eight years old with a recentenough wash a nice dee zee aluminum toolbox was bolted in the bed and a utility rack had a variety of tools and ladders lashed to it neat and orderly stellas dad always said you could tell a lot about a mans character by looking at his workshop if he didnt respect his tools according to buster collier then he likely didnt respect himself either and you could forget about him respecting anyone else well this sure as hell wasnt roy deans truck then stella got out lugging her water bottleshe was trying to be mindful of staying hydrated in this heat and she figured the iced tea had worn off by nowand leaving the gun behind in the box she took a discreet sniff under her arm not too bad considering that this was one of those days when youre sweating two minutes after you get out of the shower this meeting wasnt any beauty contest of course but the mornings encounter with the mirror had stella in a selfconscious frame of mind stella ignored the visitors please check in at the main office sign and started across the campus in addition to the main building there were several others a twostory gymnasium and a science lab and a long low shed labeled funbears afterschool care it was around the far side of this last one that stella found arthur senior up on a ladder painting the trim a creamy color a few shades warmer than white in contrast the old paint looked dingy that looks nice stella said amazing what a fresh coat of paint can do arthur set his paintbrush carefully down on the pan that was attached to the ladder and backed his way down once his feet were on the ground he squinted at her and wiped his hands on a rag he kept attached to his belt then offered it to shake stella hardesty isnt it he said yes sir good memory well youve had your face in the paper in the last year or two if im not mistaken oh that stella could feel a flush rise to her face that had been a close call shed been hailed a hero for dragging phil rivka out of his burning house in truth shed intended only to torch the garage and phils treasured camaro the one he bought the day after he sent his wife irma to the hospital with series of injuries requiring overnight observation luckily even sawyer countys crack fire investigation squad hadnt figured out how stella got the blaze started in the first place which was a good thing stella had refined her technique since then and there was no longer much risk of her killing herself or anyone else with a botched attempt despite stellas protests photos of her and a very dejectedlooking phil had appeared not only in the local papers but all the way up in the kansas city star goat himself had called to congratulate her on her heroics and to apologize for having been out on another call during the rescue if id been there hed said in that inscrutable voice of his maybe wed have figured what got that fire started in the first place guess youre a bit of a hero arthur continued but he sounded more wary than admiring no no not me hey i was wondering if roy dean or arthur junior were working with you today arthur didnt answer right away he took a tin of skoal out of his pocket and slowly opened it then just stared at the brownblack shreds of tobacco inside stella stared right along with him nowadays you couldnt find many fans of chew every doctors office in the county had warnings postedmouth cancer throat cancer and lord knows the spitting and the chawing were nasty vile habits the black bits stuck between the teeth didnt do much for a guys appeal but stella had a soft spot for the stuff her dad used to treat himself to a chew now and then out on the back steps where her mother wouldnt have to watch and stellas own first sweetheart kept a tin in the glove box of his truck hidden from his parents hed have a chew sometimes after football practice when he and stella went for drives in the country er do you mind arthur said no no go ahead arthur took a healthy pinch between his forefinger and thumb and tucked it expertly in the pocket between his cheek and gum for a moment he closed his eyes and concentrated on the tobacco then he opened his eyes and breathed a sigh that conveyed a worldweariness far beyond his fifty or so years neither of my boys is working here today he said they take the day off well now we dont really do like that wish i could say different but the boys got themselves all involved in these side businesses of theirs and im lucky to have them along more than a day or two a week side businesses how do you mean oh this and that arthur junior he got on parttime at the walmart tire center and hes been doing a program up at itt on the weekends you know all the electronics they got in the cars these days you practically have to have a degree in computer science to work on them what about roy dean arthur didnt look at her but gazed out across the parking lot to the fields beyond alfalfa lush and lowgrowing poked its purpleflowered stems toward the blistering sun well you know roy dean hes always got some idea or other last year he got himself hooked up with this multilevel marketing outfit nothing but a pyramid scheme really that didnt end up all that well and we had words now he dont much tell me what he has going on stella noted the sad note in arthurs voice recognized it all too well i understand she said my daughter noelle and me we dont talk much either we had a fallingout i guess youd say after her dad passed and now she just lives thirty miles away in coffey but sometimes i feel like it might as well be the moon arthur pursed his lips together and nodded slightly and the two of them stood there in a silence that was plenty melancholy but not uncomfortable just two parents wondering where theyd gone wrong i guess they just have to go their own way arthur finally said how olds your girl she just turned twentyeight in july arthur juniors thirty roy deans twentyseven you know when we were that age we were settled down raising kids i think gemmas about given up on having any grandkids oh now stella said soothingly dont lets give up yet you know the kids nowadays they like to wait before they have children besides what about little tucker chrissys boy a smile flashed across arthurs ruddy features crinkling all the wrinkles around his eyes and his mouth and making him look ten years younger aint he a pistol aw gemma and i took such a shine to him eighteen months old i think chrissy told me yeah the smile slipped and the light flickered out of arthurs gaze thing is those two roy dean and chrissy they dont get on so well i think gemmas trying not to get attached you know if chrissy goes back to her ex why shes not likely to bring the little guy around anymore see her ex you know that akers boy from up around sedalia but theyve been divorced for years uh well the way i hear it he didnt want the divorce hes been after her all this time they say he cleared his throat but didnt look at her directly they say he used to get a little rough with her stella wasnt sure what to say to that i dont mean to speak out of turn arthur said quickly and i know my boys not easy to live with why if chrissys been visiting with the akers boy on account of roy dean being away from the home so much it wouldnt be my place to blame her arthur stella began then stopped not sure how to say what needed to be said i wonder if youve noticed that is when chrissy comes to visit you might have seen well all manner of bruises and such i have arthur said his voice going sharp and if it turns out that akers boy put em on her why id like to reckon with him myself this time he did look at stella but it was only a quick glance with those troubled eyes it was possible the man really believed what he was saying it was also possible he suffered from the same disease that afflicted so many of the people stella encountered denial stella had battled denial herself long enough that she knew the pathology well how it could really take a toll on a person as they struggled to keep believing the unbelievable if arthur shaw had convinced himself to ignore the facts in front of him stella wouldnt judge him for it they say most violent men follow paths that get set early in their own lives that theyd been abused themselves and knew little else well stellad bet a hundred bucks that arthur shaw had never raised a hand to his boys in anger sometimes it just worked out that way sometimes you did your level best with a child gave them all the love and direction you knew how and things still didnt work out the way you wanted stella tried again cautiously but you dont think roy dean oh roy deans a trial arthur interrupted turning away from stella and picking up his paintbrush again but he wouldnt hurt a fly oh stella said huh she thought about mentioning some of the convincing details chrissy had shared about roy dean then decided arthur had punished himself enough for one day ah well arthur said making his way up the ladder again sorry i couldnt help you more no you wereyou helped plenty stella said just one thing it aint arthur junior causing anybody trouble arthur said without looking at her picking up his brush and dipping it carefully in the creamy paint hes a good boy just gets a little distracted sometimes ill remember that you have a good day now as stella made her way back to the car her heart felt like it had got weighed down and rode a little lower in her chest she hoped arthur junior at least would not give the quiet man on the ladder any more cause to live by the lies he told himself when stella pulled up in front of her house the sun was casting long shadows across the lawn and todd was doing skateboard tricks in her driveway hey stella park out on the street he called i want to use your driveway he did some sort of flip that involved him leaping into the air with his skinny legs out at a comic angle while the skateboard flipped both over and around in a circle when he landed with a crash so loud it was miraculous the deck didnt split in half todd teetered for a moment and then fell on his behind ow shit watch your mouth stella said but she did as he asked and left the car in the street better to have him flopping around on her driveway leaving patches of his skin on the concrete than in the street getting run over she walked over and glared at the boy not bothering to offer to help him up todd examined his palm which was scraped red and crusted with old scabs i reckon you ought to put some neosporin on that stella said you got any i might but am i your personal nurse i dont think so aw come on i dont want to have to go all the way back todd you live two doors down stella said pointing todd shrugged and got to his feet as graceful and light as a dancer and jumped back on the board he wore his hair down around his shoulders but it looked as if hed cut it himself and maybe he had his mother had more than enough on her plate well you got anything to eat he asked wiping his bloody hand on his baggy shorts stella rolled her eyes i guess come on in theres a lady in your house todd said he toed the end of his skateboard and it flipped up into his hand not a bad trick really yeah leave that filthy thing outside and wipe your feet what kind of lady kind of fat but not too fat blond hair giant boobs chrissy inside stella called out a hellono sense spooking the poor girl found her in the same chair from the morning but shed fallen asleep startled awake chrissy pushed at the strands of cornsilk hair that had matted themselves to her face with sweat howd you manage the lock sweetheart stella asked oh i showed her your key todd said you know under the pot on the porch todd stella said sternly shed shown todd the key last winter when she hired him to water her plants during a visit to see her sister gracellen in california you do not give strangers my key you dont let strangers into my house hear yeah well i she could be anyone you know an axe murderer or something todd looked dubious her stella bit down her unease it was true that chrissy looked about as dangerous as a toy poodle it was also true that stella had always managed to keep the unseemlier aspects of her work away from her home but the day might come when some disgruntled asshole came around looking for trouble she grabbed todds arm hard and gave it a yank he had already passed her up in height but she had the advantage of mass and bulk hey listen up cupcake or no snack you dont ever let anyone in here without me saying so and if you ever see anyone hanging around you go straight home and lock your doors and dont be coming over here until you see me back here in person christ okay okay todd said when she released his arm he rubbed at it and glared at her isnt it almost dinnertime anyway maybe we should skip the snack and have pizza or something stella stared at the boy shaking her head slowly your mom get hung up late again yeah she called shes got to pick up the twins at day care so she wont be back for another hour at least whats for dinner chrissy said her voice sleepy and did you find anything out yet stella looked at the pair of them back and forth and wondered why the big guy had seen fit to deliver these pathetic hungry souls to her house when all she wanted was to put her feet up and fix herself a giant johnnie walker black on ice well there was no rest for the weary was there papa martinos she said you call em todd coupons on the fridge get a large half combo and half whatever you want oh get a dozen wings too extra spicy fuckin a and watch your damn mouth while they waited for the pizza todd went back out on the driveway to flip his lanky awkward body over the skateboard some more i believe ill go watch him some chrissy said rolling forward off the couch hes something to see aint he hold up there just a sec hon stella said settling down on the ottoman ive got something to ask you something of a personal nature sure chrissy said bobbing her chin it has to do with your ex stella said carefully pitt oh chrissy said her face going a little pale its that damned internet aint it the internet i tol pitt dont be takin them dirty pictures seein as they always end up on the internet pitt took pictures of you yeah dirty ones chrissy sighed i didnt mention it cause i didnt figure it was you know important and it aint neitherif i get tucker back i guess i dont even care whatall anyone wants to put on the internet about me um were these ah recent pictures chrissy shrugged well yeah i guess i mean it was like i dont know march probably youve been seeing pitt chrissy shrugged not regular or anything just you know sometimes stella heaved a sigh you know back when you first came to talk to me i told you that i had to know everything remember dont leave anything out i told you because every detail counts even the ones that might not seem important at the time well i surely wish i wasnt only finding out about pitt now im sorry chrissy said staring down at her hands its just i didnt want you to think i was she swallowed and stella could see her eyelashes fluttering a slut she finished in a whisper stellas annoyance shrank up to see the girl so remorseful oh wait im not trying to judge here i dont think that i really dont only its been suggested that uh pitt was the one who hurt you pitt the tremulous note in chrissys voice gave way to a snort of disbelief pitt aint but five foot three on a good day and a hunnert twenty sides he wouldnt never hurt me hes crazy about me wed probly still be married if i hadnt taken up with his boss stella nodded trying to assimilate all these new details howd pitt feel about roy dean and tucker well he pretty much hated roy dean chrissy said always threatening to come to the house one day and blow him away and tuckerwell he thinks tucker might be his even though ive told him a million times i was seeing someone else and besides anyone can see tuckers going to grow up twice as big as pitt aint no way theyre kin stella felt a chill along her neck enraged boyfriend denied not only his woman but the child he believes is his men had certainly committed crimes for far less people see what they want to see sometimes she said chrissys expression sharpened up stella she said dubiously you aint actually thinking it was pitt stole tucker are you well you said he went missing right after roy dean was at your house so but pitt was there too i mean im really sorry i didnt tell you about it but pitt was over visiting that morning and when tucker fell asleep in his playpen pitt n me went back to my room for a spell and when roy dean came to the door pitt hightailed it to the guest bedroom to hide out stella bit back another scolding honestly the girl tried her patience is that it or is there anything else you need to tell me beside the fact that there was a whole other person present when tucker disappeared i said i was sorry chrissy said yeah okay just but whyd pitt need to hide considering that you and roy dean were split up youre free to live your life any way you want now stella said its just what we did a couple times back when roy dean was still living at the house and he came home unexpected i guess pitt was still in the habit chrissy laid a hand over her heart pitts just a little sweetie but he aint the most ballsy man he dont like confrontation stella didnt bother to point out that desperation occasionally moved even unballsy men to act was his car gone when you went outside looking for tucker and roy dean he didnt have no car he had a buddy drop im and he was going to just walk back home hes in those apartments over by the office park dont you think its strange stella mused that he didnt call you later that day well i aint got a cell phone or stop by just to make sure you were okay it wasnt like that stella chrissy said crossly it was just casual it sounded to stella like pitt might not have considered it nearly as casual as chrissy did ill go talk to pitt stella said suit yourself chrissy said her mood was darkening by the moment but its a waste of time you ask me its roy dean we got to find maybe we ought to see what the sheriff thinks get up a search party or something thats something to think about stella said trying to hide her exasperation but stella about them pictures can you do something well are they in digital format did pitt put them on his pc does either of you have an internet connection aint neither of us even got a computer stella and they was polaroidspitt likes watchin em develop well then i wouldnt worry too much about them getting online listen the pizzas going to be here in a minute why dont we eatitll help us think clearly as if on cue todd came bursting through the door trailing a young man in a papa martinos tshirt who was carrying a suspiciously large thermal bag hope you dont mind todd said i ordered an extra pizza i was hungry you need to pay him dont forget the tip okay by the time she got the kitchen cleaned up and todd sent home and chrissy settled into the guest room stella could sense the prickles of a second wind starting along her spine part of it was the whole bar thing of course stella couldnt help it she loved bars loved the way folks came in and shed the first threequarters of their day and settled into the final stretch some of them weary some of them desperate some on the make someoccasionallyeven happy stella loved to sit on the sidelines and watch the squabbling and the mating rituals and the jealousy and the preening the lively bubbling of humanitys stew shed missed so much ollie never wanted her to go out at night with his crazy jealous streak he didnt even like to let her wait on the very occasional male customer who came into the sewing machine shop since he died stella had decided she had some catching up to do and she took herself out a couple times a month tonight was a work outing of course but that didnt mean she couldnt have a little fun shed told chrissy she was going to stop by lovie lees divorce party just to be polite lovie wasnt a client she and larry lee had just grown tired of each other larryd been living in the garage which hed fixed up with a waterbed and a couple of weight machines for a few years they were only making it official because lovie had got tired of parking on the driveway she wanted her garage back the party probably would have been fun but duty came first chrissy hadnt questioned stellas liewhich stella had told only because she didnt want to have to explain why her hunt for tucker was starting out in a bar she was afraid chrissy might bring up the search party idea again but deep in her melancholy funk the girl just nodded and said shed be fine that stella should go ahead and have a nice time stella pushed the hangers back and forth in her closet finally settling on a jazzy little teal number a tank top with straps wide enough to cover her bra which was a serious piece of equipment with a big job to do the top had beads sewn along the neckline a little sparkle to set off her earrings which were a dangly crystal pair shed got out of the avon catalog gracellen sent her she squeezed into her favorite jeans which had a squiggly row of stitching on the butt pockets and molded everything into a tightlooking if generous package she added slipon black sandals with just a bit of a heel sprayed herself with white diamonds and she was ready to go stella peeked in on chrissy who was reading a copy of redbook with the sheet pulled up to her neck the fan in the window cranked along on high cooling the bedroom down to a tolerable temperature you gonna be all right sugar yeah i guess but every time i think about tucker chrissys lips wobbled and stella was afraid she was going to bust out crying again earlier it had taken half an hour to get her calmed down and stella needed to get on the road look here honey she said sitting down on the edge of the bed and patting chrissys arm im doing everything i know to figure out where theyve got to and even if roy deans a son of a bitch you know he wont do nothing bad to tucker chrissy nodded and stella prayed hard she had just spoken the truth sheriff jones is good at his job she continued hell be looking in the places i cant and tomorrow were going to keep you busy at the shop so now youve just got to put it out of your mind and get some rest right putting chrissy to work had been one of stellas better ideas not only would it give the girl something to do but it would free stella up to work on tracking down roy dean and pitt akers she didnt want to admit it even to herself but as the hours ticked by she was getting more and more worried about tucker get a bunch of stupid assholes together and the first things they were liable to let slide was the women and children at least women had a fighting chance thank you chrissy snuffled i just couldnt go back home stella understood having to go back to the empty house with all of tuckers toys on the floor his crib would just make her crazy chrissy worked parttime at an inhome day care in her neighborhood and she didnt want to go to work either and stella guessed she could understand that too she wouldnt be much good to the other kids frantic with worry a quick call to chrissys employer had straightened that out stella headed first for the apartments across the street from the prosper industrial park a sad lshaped complex of prefab buildings that had never been fully occupied in its tenyear history the apartments had been there even before the industrial park was built and hence had time to accumulate a nearly full complement of divorcées and downontheirluck entrepreneurial types and drifters and general underachieversanyone who found the idea of a cheap boxlike onebedroom apartment with drafty aluminum windows appealing she found pitts place easily enough in the last of the evening twilight he had a groundfloor apartment on the back side which enjoyed a fair amount of privacy on account of a bank of dumpsters after knocking and trying the door stella set down the tupperware spaghetti tote she used to store her lock tools and shone her mini maglite in the crack between the door and the frame where indifferent construction had left a hairsbreadth gap oh didnt your mama teach you nothing she breathedpitt hadnt used the deadbolt stella was a little disappointed at the lack of a challenge shed spent a few recent slow afternoons at the shop making herself a set of shims using tin snips and some rinsedout bud cans and she was eager to try them out still there were advantages to keeping it simple stella slipped her old macys cardlong since canceled but kept for occasions like this oneinto the door jamb then she slid a pair of quartsize ziplocs over her hands and let herself in she stood for a moment in the living room listening for sounds and glancing around the door to the bedroom was open and the cramped kitchen was visible through a passthrough a shape darted past her nearly giving her a heart attack but as it bolted under the couch stella realized it was just a cat she snapped on the lights illumination did little to improve the surroundingsscuffed white walls dingy gray carpet tired plaid sofasbut at least pitt kept the place clean there was no cat smell stella even detected a faint scent of clorox might oughtta have kept this one chrissy stella murmured as she started looking around knows how to clean if shed planned on any serious digging she would have splurged and used a pair of disposable latex gloves from the box she kept under her bathroom sink but they were so danged expensive compared to the ziplocs worrying about fingerprints was probably ridiculous anyway stella highly doubted whether the crime scene techs would be coming down from the county seat in fayette anytime soon to go looking for tucker still anything worth doing as her dad used to say was worth doing right there was little to see pitt it appeared had been leading a monklike existence since divorcing chrissy aside from his polaroid collection which stella found in an envelope on his bureau one glimpse convinced her she didnt need to see any more of that but she slipped the packet into her pocket anywayone less thing for chrissy to worry about other than the racy photos scouring pitts place was about as exciting as watching paint dry a couple of costco uniform shirts hung in the closet tightie whities and vneck tshirts and overthecalf athletic socks were neatly folded in the drawers pitt owned an impressive collection of household cleaners and windex among other thingsbut nothing seemed out of place as she turned to leave the cat appeared one cautious paw at a time from under the living room sofa and stalked imperiously into the kitchen where it lapped at a full water bowl watching the cat stella noticed something shed missed earlier there was not one but two very full bowls of cat food set out on a vinyl place mat on the floor one had a small dent a few of the little orange triangular nuggets having spilled to the floor but the other was mounded high and undisturbed looks like your master wanted to make sure you had plenty to eat stella said while he was away whered he go anyway no response typical stella left without saying goodbye having confirmed that she was still a dog person she wanted a pet that interacted a little so it looked like pitt had left town for a while interesting stella returned her spaghetti box to the back of the jeep and hit the road thinking that in the morning shed have to try to find out where pitt had gone she made the drive to bjs bar with the window rolled down despite the damage it did to her wellsprayed hairdo sometimes you just had to feel the wind on your face on her way from the parking lot to the front door she patted her hair back into place and hitched up her bra straps getting everything settled where it was supposed to go bjs wasnt a place stella visited unless it was in the line of duty it was a little rough even for her it wasnt that she was afraid get the meanest cuss drunk and his reflexes would go to hell and hed be no match for her especially with the raven in her purse it was just that it wasnt all that much fun to hang out in a place where optimism was in as short supply as overtime pay tempers were thin and old grievances lay thick on the ground things went quiet when stella walked in she ignored the pool tables at the far end of the long narrow room the few square wooden tables where customers sat in twos and threes and headed for an empty stool at the end of the bar near the bathrooms bjs wasnt much to look at you could tell before you put a hand on the bar or a table that it would come away sticky some of the wooden chairs didnt match and the bar stools were popping their brass studs and losing the padding on their vinyl seats the walls were decorated with an assortment of titty posters and neon beer signs some lit some busted a single framed softball photo gave evidence that at some point big johnson had gotten it into his head to sponsor a team an event that must have caused the league a fair amount of consternation big johnson himself wandered down the bar to greet stella there was a waitress on duty as well but she was on the floor with a tray plonking down pitchers and trying to avoid having her rear end pinched any more than was necessary stella big johnson said leaning his muscular hairy forearms on the bar in front of him big johnson had moved to town and bought this place after serving in the first iraq dustup and he already had his nickname then naturally there was some talk of whether it just referred to the fact that he was a solid on a sixthree frame or whether there were further reasons but if hed shed any light on the question stella hadnt heard about it she might not have minded finding out for herself actually but there was that delicate issue of dating people in the workplaceand as long as big johnson kept attracting the kind of clientele that was hanging around the joint now the bar was likely to continue to be on stellas professional rounds bj good to see you been a while yeah last time you were in here lessee you dragged out one of my best customers and he dont come around no more stella felt herself blushing but she doubted he could tell in the dim light yes welli just wanted to give him his christmas card forgot to mail it and id been carrying it around in my purse you know how that goes far as him coming around here well i hear hes not partying much these days big johnson gave her a ghost of a smile and a twitch that might have been a wink aw we aint missed him much whatre you drinking tonight lets see stella pretended to think it over tapping her nose with her forefinger and glancing along the shelves behind the bar well now i guess you better make it johnnie black with a bud back big johnson went off to get the drinks and stella glanced down the row of drinkers at the bar there he was and she didnt even have to go chasing him down arthur junior was keeping company with a brassy redhead the two of them giggling over something their noses almost touching interesting last stella heard arthur junior had hooked up with a gal from ogden county but she hadnt been a redhead oh well he was known to have quite a few smooth moves probably the reason gemma shaw despaired of having any grandchildren off him anytime soon any legitimate grandchildren that is big johnson came back with the drinks and set them down in front of stella you know he said clearing his throat and looking somewhere over her shoulder i dont believe i ever got your christmas card either now that you mention it stella raised an eyebrow could it be was big johnson actually flirting with her her stomach did a little backandforth slide and she felt heat rise to her face the light was mercifully low one of lifes funny truths is that the worse the lighting in a bar the better a lady tends to look oh niceidiot she scolded herself but couldnt for the life of her think of what else to say yeahcourse i didnt send any myself this year you know the holidays snuck up on me and whatall had my brothers family come stay big johnson trailed off and cleared his throat again backed off the bar and still didnt look her in the face what i mean to say though he said grabbing a rag off the sink and taking a wild swipe at the stretch of bar in front of him was that if i did send cards i woulda sent you one then he was off practically jogging down the bar to where customers were hollering for him well dang now that was interesting stella took a biggish sip of her whiskey and then a nice long cool drink of her beer the foam tickling her upper lip there was something going on with bj that was for sure it was nice but it wasnt quite exactly the mmmhmmmyeah that generally signaled powerful attraction to stella she thought about it some more waited a few minutes to see if a reaction was just sneaking up on her but no big johnson sweet as he was didnt light any roaring fires under her which was just too darn bad because there wasnt exactly an abundance of suitors lining up at her door truth was ever since ollie died stella had been pretty reluctant even to think about menexcept for the ones whose skulls she was knocking together of course those thirty years of paying for a single grievous mistake in the man department had put her off her feed a bit but it had been three years long enough for even stellas rusty illused parts to start clamoring to get put to use again hell she was a grown woman there shouldnt be any shame to admitting at least to herself that shed started thinking about sex again checking out butts at the home depot spotting an appealingly crooked smile or a snazzy goatee or a nice tan harmless right unfortunately there was only one man in a hundred miles in any direction that really got her engines purring and that wasdamn itthe one man who was absolutely positively offlimits the one who could send her world upside down and not in a good waythe kind of way that would have her serving time at the sawyer county jail up in fayette hey mrs hardesty stella jerked out of her reverie and turned to face the man who had spoken to her well well hello arthur junior dad said he saw you out on the job yesyes i did bump into him there stella turned to arthur juniors companion who was standing behind him looking bored and teetering on her spikeheeled sandals it appeared that arthur juniors date was accustomed to deficits in his manners but stella believed in starting every relationship off on the right foot hello dear im stella hardesty my you have lovely hair that got the gals attention she lifted her chin and flashed a smile had a darling little gap between her front teeth nice skin a smattering of freckles hello maam im silver mason pleased to meet you ouchthat goddamn maam when was that word going to ease on out of the language mason would that be the masons out route i went to school with a couple of the girls no sorry im from saint louis i came out here for work im an intensive care nurse over at lutheran arthur junior frowned impatiently i just figured i should find out what your interest in the family was mrs hardesty well now arthur junior i wouldnt say its the whole family exactly just your brother roy dean he seems to have gone missing and i was wondering if there was any chance he mightve taken something along with him that doesnt belong to him the cast of arthur juniors expression shifted and stella could see plain as day that a variety of emotions were doing battle on his face a twitchy little tic appeared at the edge of his jaw and his eyes narrowed to slits after a few moments he turned to silver darlin im afraid this is going to take a few minutes just some boring business shit would you mind if i talked to mrs hardesty alone for a bit silver gave him a sunny smile oh thats fine ill go watch the darts for a bit they watched her walk away silver had a nice little figure a narrow waist and ample curves for a fleeting moment stella felt wistful remembering the longago time when she could still sashay her way to a mans attention you might think about hanging on to this one she said looks nice talks nice gainfully employed yeah so listen i dont know what my dumbfuck brothers gone and done now hear ive got no part of his dealings he stopped showing up on dads job about a month ago wont answer my calls or nothing hell he hasnt even been out for sunday dinner and moms about to hit the roof to be honest mrs hardesty i aint seen him for two three weeks now stella evaluated arthur junior she was inclined to believe him the criminology course said she should look for facial tics perspiration and fidgetingall things that were tough to see in a dark bar now arthur junior theres a chance you could be lying to me sweetie and id have no way of knowing it i wonder if i mentioned that the thing roy dean took off with is needed in the worst way by a friend of mine no now im not saying you know anything about this messand im not saying you dont you may have heard when it comes to my friends i take their needs pretty seriously the faint little flicker in arthur juniors eyes clued stella in hed heard she didnt know how much he knew but it looked like it was enough there were days when it paid to have rumors floating around about how youd ruined a numbskulls day with a bit of oldfashioned violent reckoning i hear you mrs hardesty arthur junior bit his lip but didnt take his eyes off her face what is it you think roy dean took stella considered her options she generally had a policy against revealing any of the facts of a case unless absolutely necessary and given her new information about pitt akers along with roy deans general lack of affection for tucker it almost didnt seem worth stirring up a fuss over such a long shot still time was critical and she couldnt see any reason not to get as many eyes looking out for tucker as possible a little boy she said chrissys boy tucker arthur junior said nothing for a moment it clearly wasnt the answer he expected to hear he frowned the lines appearing on his forehead making him look a lot like his father why would he go and do that i really dont know im just trying to connect with anyone who was with tucker right before he disappeared and your brother was there at chrissys picking up some belongings hed left arthur junior took a deep breath and let it out real slow he stared off at silver who was chatting with a couple of local gals over by the dartboard then turned and looked back down the bar at the assembly of drinkers look here maybe we better go somewhere else to talk let me just get rid of silver if i give her my keys can you run me home after the evening was shaping up to be full of surprises that would be no problem arthur junior stella said while he left to make his arrangements she sucked down the rest of the whiskey and beer didnt make any sense to waste it anywhere particular you got in mind to go stella asked once they pulled out of big johnsons parking lot in the jeep yeah head out old state road nine you gonna clue me in where were headed in a bit stella nodded to herself and drove along well within the speed limit she was drivesafe her bac adequately low due to her sizable frame and the big dinner shed had and a tolerance maintained with a healthy daily dose of johnnie black but there was still no sense calling attention to herself a bright slice of moon lit up the road with a soft glow im older than roy dean by two years arthur junior said after a while bigger too taller at any rate but do you know by the time i was ten roy dean would sneak up on me and take me down when i wasnt lookin stella nodded now the boy had decided to talk it was best to let him unroll his story at his own pace now thats the kind of thing you just hate when youre a kid specially if your friends know about it getting your ass kicked by your kid brother so i made it a project to beat the crap out of him and you know what i never did see here stella glanced over arthur junior had pushed up his short sleeve to reveal his shoulder but stella couldnt make much out in the dim light in the jeep hmm she said anyway fucking bite marks i got him down got his arm pulled behind him one day had half a mind to break it i was so mad and he bit me mom wanted to take me to the hospital but dad said i was just going to have to learn to fight back now that was plenty humiliating let me tell you and roy dean just standing there grinning at me the whole time your folks didnt punish him well sure they did but the thing was wasnt much you could do to roy dean that would make any kind of difference i think they took him off tv for a month but he didnt carehe just invented new kinds of trouble to stir up when he got bored roy dean used to sit out back on this splitrail fence dad built behind the vegetable garden and when a rabbit or something would come by hed shoot it with his slingshot he wasnt much of a shot but he just kep at it and kep at it and now and then hed get lucky and hit one thingd drag itself off and roy dean would follow and if he caught up hed stomp the thing dead with his boots ill say one thing for my brotherhe aint got a lot of quit in him stella thought of little tucker and got a very bad feeling in her gut on the off chance that roy dean had taken him she prayed he was keeping his temper under control arthur junior i gotta tell you youre not painting a very pretty picture of your brother but what would he want with a little boy that isnt even his i have no idea he said and thats the truth you could have told me that back at bjs stella pointed out not to sound ungrateful but if you dont know where roy dean is theres other holes i could be digging in why exactly did you want to go for this here drive because i believe i know where roy dean has been spending his time lately and it aint no kindygarden see what im sayin its bad news serious bad newsno place to be haulin kids into if chrissys kid is with roy dean then somebody needs to do something jeez just what is this place anyway some kind of strip joint i believe ill just show you turn off on methaney there stella glanced at arthur junior his arms were folded across his chest and he had an angry set to his jaw she did as she was told she hadnt driven methaney in years a couple of decades ago someone still farmed soybeans out here but the soil didnt give up much and the fields lay mostly unworked and fallow sowthistle and carpetweed taking over drive slow arthur junior said his voice a near whisper and dont stop after a half mile or so they drove by a handpainted wood sign that hung by chains from a couple of posts driven into the ground next to a gravel turnoff in big block letters it read benning salvage five yards into the turnoff a tall set of steel gates was locked tight with a heavy padlock oh stella said the junkyard thats what you wanted to show me aint just a junkyard arthur junior said his voice low drive on by and when you get down to the t down there turn around and come back but dont stop hear dont be lingerin the boy was spooked that was for sure wasnt any way anyone could hear them out here but stella didnt bother to point that out driving past the property she spotted lights on in a little prefab house up on a berm shaded by a couple of twisty scrub oaks a few pickups and sedans were parked out front further back on the property sodium vapor lights on blocky steel poles illuminated other buildings and sheds and beyond that carsacres of cars in various states of body condition and decomposition skeletons of wrecks and rusting carcasses whose innards were being stripped a little at a time to patch up other cars all along the edges of the property ran a chainlink fence topped by razor wire nasty to look at especially since some of the barbs caught the moonlight just right and glinted shiny and menacing she figured there was a mean dog or two not far off it wasnt just junkyards that had themin stellas experience every family compound out in the sticks had a few fleabitten curs bred to meanness with stick beatings and fights over scraps of garbage when one got hit by a car or lost a fight or mangled a leg on a trap or fence and had to be put down there was always some scrawny mutt bitch around ready to deliver a new generation of hardscrabble pups she turned back to arthur junior i knew a benning or two one of em was just a few years behind me in school that woulda been earl hes probably about fortyfivehes owned the place since his dad passed but he has a partner you knowan associate dont know his full name but he goes by funzi comes down from kansas city with some of his guys and stays for a few days now and then i think he has a place down on the lake funzi what is that italian or some such arthur drilled her with that gaze again and this time stella did turn and look at him in the moonlight his face looked pale as milk his eyes deep sockets and the boy looked scared shitless uhhuh italian like alphonse mrs hardesty you know what italian means up in kansas city dont you stella made the turn a gentle curve on the scruffy remains of a farm road and started back the junkyard was on the drivers side of the jeep now and she watched carefully as it rolled by no signs of life anywhere but the light in the windows of bennings house showed sheer curtains pulled shut a blue flicker from one window probably meant a tv big one no doubtseemed like the humbler the dwelling the fancier the tv these days what are you trying to say arthur junior bennings mixed up with some sort of cosa nostra shit the family comin down here to the ozarks for a little r and r it aint funny arthur juniors voice was suddenly sharp you dont mess with those boys i didnt say it was funny but you got to admiti mean ive never seen any godfather types around town you know havent been any horse heads turning up in folks beds or anything like that she could feel arthur juniors gaze fixed solid on her face if you get to tangling with these guys youd damn well better be as good as they say you are he said coldly you have no notion what theyre capable of i told roy dean i begged him not to get mixed up with these guys but he just cant say no to a quick buck not ever stella didnt say anything until the junkyard was in her rearview mirror and then she put a little steel in her voice just like she used to when noelle was a teenager sassing her about one thing or another now listen here arthur junior unless roy dean took tucker theres no reason for me to do so much as give benning and his pals a crosseyed glance im real sorry your brother aint got a lick of sense but hes not the one that hired me so im not going to go rattling any cages just for kicks i didnt say so if you know anything about tucker you arent telling me any reason i should worry about him and roy dean then you need to come clean and tell me exactly whats going on wont do anybody any good for you to keep giving me these little pieces of the picture hear otherwise your brothers a big boyhes on his own i dont know anything about tucker like i said arthur junior said his voice flat and resigned only maybe you could just listen to me and i dont know give roy dean some advice or or like convince him maybe stella glanced at the dashboard clock after eleven already there was no way she was hiring on to talk sense into a blockhead like roy deanshe knew firsthand how futile such an effort would be still she was a little bit moved by arthur juniors fraternal loyalty sticking up for a sibling like thatwell that showed character and character was rare enough that it might merit a few more minutes of her time heading back to a bar to finish this conversation didnt make much sense though and that only left one place she could think of she turned back on old state road toward town if arthur junior was surprised to end up at dennys he didnt show it stella had the hostess seat them in a corner booth away from the handful of other customers when the waitress came stella waved the menus away and ordered them both a grand slam and coffee any remnants of her earlier buzz were long gone and she meant to ensure that she and arthur junior were alert for the rest of the conversation and not fainting from hunger she dug out the fresh notebook shed tucked into her purse before leaving the house this one had a hannah montana cover with silvery foil and sparkles on the gals picture hard to believe that billy ray cyrus was old enough to have a teenage daughter seemed like just yesterday stella was dancing around the living room to that tune of his laughing at noelle as she shook her littlegirl booty once the waitress set their coffee down stella wrote the date and arthur shaw jr and dennys at the top of the page and said i get that youre worried about your brother now shoot arthur junior took a deep breath its cars see mrs hardesty roy dean jacked a car way back in high school and he got caught and did some juvie time for it but i guess the bug bit him good hes always been wanting a better ride than hes got even though hes not willing to work regular to get it long about last january he comes to me and says some pal of his says they can make good money stealing cars from up in independence and kansas city and taking em to salvage yards to sell for parts so i guess roy dean and him do this for a while and then roy dean comes to me and says why dont he and i team up takes two see because you drive up there together and then one guy watches out while the other one gets the thing started then you got to drive your own car back along with the one you stole i thought you boys dont get along stella said why would he want you to go in on this thing with him nom we dont generally but the way i figure it is roy dean knew he could trust me id never rat him out or anything that aint the way were raised plus i think his friend was wanting to always take the bigger half of the haul it being his contacts and all what do you mean contacts well theres four five salvage shops in the county more if youre willing to drive a ways but not all of em will take a car without title you know and those that will you gotta kind of build up a relationship with them just like any other business and if you really want to make some good money you got to know what theyre looking for see theres makes and models they need parts for moren others sounds like you know quite a bit about this arthur junior for a guy who didnt want to get tangled up in it arthur junior hung his head looking sheepish well thing is roy dean he just wouldnt let it drop and you shouldve seen mom roy dean dumbass that he is tells her were going to start a fucking body shop together fix up cars and resell em excuse my language sorry and mom was so happy you shouldve seen her all she ever wanted was for roy dean to stay out of trouble and here hes got her thinking hes gonna go straight and that ill be there making sure he keeps his nose clean stella remembered the weary look in arthur seniors eyes when he talked about his boys what did your dad think of all this arthur junior stirred his coffee with a spoon eyes downcast dad well i think he quit believing anything roy dean said back when we were kids but you know he just wants mom to be happy thats a female affliction for you stella said with feeling trying to believe one thing when all the evidence points in the other direction if women werent so darn bent on fooling themselves well i guess thats another subject go ahead tell me the rest did you join up with roy dean or didnt you i well i hate to admit it to you mrs hardesty but i rode up to independence with roy dean a couple times i dont know what i was thinking maybe that i could talk him out of it or something buti mean it was just so damn simple people leave their cars right out in the open without even locking the doors and do you know how easy it is to hotwire them especially preninetyfive ninetysix all you have to do is go under the steering column and get at the wires and touch them together its not hardly rocket science and roy dean always was good with that stuff and the thing is these arent new cars these are like old camrys and whatever its almost like a victimless crime because with a car that age people are done paying it off and the insurance company writes a check and you know they just go and get another car stella didnt have much to say to that especially because breakfast arrived grand slam the waitress said cheerfully sliding it under stellas nose and grand slam arthur junior stared at his plate with little interest anything else i can do for you right now the waitress asked no sweetie but thanksi think were set stella smiled despite herself there was nothing in the world better than eggs cooked in pools of butter bacon finished off in the deep fryer and pancakes swimming in puddles of syrup even late at nightespecially late at nightbreakfast was stellas absolute favorite meal if i ever end up on death row this is what im ordering for my last meal she said and dug in energetically arthur junior stared at her with a look bordering on horror what stella mumbled around a mouthful of eggs nothing its justi meanwhat i hear and all i cant believe you can talk that way if they can ever pin half the stuff on you that people say you done stella swallowed and set down her fork this was a bit delicate she knew what people saidthat there were bodies buried all over the state men whod met their bloody end at stellas hands the truth was that despite beating interrogating threatening and torturing her parolees despite leaving them with scars broken bones burns posttraumatic stress disorder even the occasional missing limbdespite all of this she hadnt killed a single parolee no matter how blackhearted and irredeemable he was other than ollie but she figured shed earned that one but there was no percentage in quelling the rumors they were after all largely responsible for her effectiveness a man who believed her next visit would bring a bullet to the forehead was far more likely to behave you shouldnt go listening to everything you hear she said carefully i really lead a pretty laidback life you know what with the shop andand my garden and all well if youre going to tangle with benning and them i hope at least some of its true stella nodded all right lets just say that maybe some of the asskicking parts true and look if you do talk to them you canti mean you really cant bring me into this okay noted so we got you and roy dean making a little extra cash at the chop shops how often were you doing this i only went a couple times back in march and then i told roy dean i was done im getting my certification i dont want to mess that up he got all pissed off and then he tells me we dont have to take the whole car anymore that bennings given him a list of what he wants shit like gpss and dvd players speakers xenon headlights says we can do two or three or more at a time but we might have to go up to kansas city man i didnt like that i hate the fucking city but roy dean kept on me until he talked me into going around and meeting benning told me if i didnt like it once we talked to him i could leave off and hed quit too even told me hed go back to helping dad out like hes any help to dad anyway like some kind of dumbass i went stella wrote a few notes with one hand and forked up hash browns with the other okay so you went with roy dean out to the salvage yard when was that i dont know maybe end of march start of april somewhere in there so he wants to go over there late at night and i ask roy dean why we cant go during the day and hes like no we got to go when bennings associates are there how do you like that associates my brother the damn fancy talker shouldve told me something so anyway we get there and honest to fuckin god they got this guy down at the gate waitin for us comes out with a flashlight and shines it in our faces and talks to roy dean before hell open the gate and he calls someone on his cell phone and tells us to go park up by the shed and im like what shed and roy dean tells me to shut up and so thats when i realize hes been here before because he drives up past the main area back to this prefab storage building but im telling you it aint really any kind of shed i mean you could park a couple of tractortrailer trucks in there but its pretty much empty except this one area they got done up kind of like a living roomthey got a carpet scrap on the floor some recliners and whatnot a table and some computer stuff couple of pcs and printers and faxes and all that mini fridge anyway i dont know what to think of this whole thing but roy dean walks right up to earl benning and highfives him and already im getting scared cause the other guys sitting around there man its like the godfather or something what do you mean these guys they were italian they were armed they were wearing tuxedos stella was fascinated despite herself no justwell im pretty sure they all had guns some in plain sight and i figure some hid roy dean n me all we gots my in the rack in the truck and we didnt bring it this guy standing with his hand on the table i figure him for in charge and sure enough later i find out its funzi even though none of em ever talked direct to me or roy dean how long were you there not long i was trying to signal roy dean you know like lets get outta here but hes acting like some kind of hotshot wont even look at me so bennings all youve done some good work for us and roy deans just pleased as shit to hear it like hes a fuckin big dog you know and he starts saying thats nothing he and me can do double triple that kind of turnaround and im starting to sweat but i dont want to say anything because like you argue with these guys you end up regretting it right yeah swimming with the fishes in the east river stella said she was dubious huh whatever roy dean says he feels like hes ready for more responsibility and isnt there some sort of work for us says hes willing to relocate i mean beat that so then im like come on roy dean we need to get going and bennings like you got some sort of curfew and roy dean laughs like its the funniest thing hes ever heard but when were back out in the car out through the gates with that guard guy locking the whole thing up behind us he nearly rips me a new one tells me i just blew our chance to get somewhere in the organization and i tell him hes full of shit and to make a long story short he dumped me out a mile from home and i had to walk and thats the secondtolast time i seen him since so you told him you didnt want anything to do with his activities yeah i mean i got this itt course and once i get my certificate ill be making good money anyway and i dont have to go to the city or break any laws to do it straight and narrow stella agreed spreading jelly on her toast which had gone cold not the worst idea in the world when you get down to it so what do you think roy dean went back with these mafia goons or whatever they are and got busy doing their errandboy work or what arthur junior shrugged i dont know i mean i was freaked out enough i asked around you know a couple guys i know that are into some shit and bennings name came up a few times guess hes got his fingers in drugs least thats the rumor except its hard to know because hes thewhat do you call itthe middleman he isnt selling at the street level or anything what kind of stuff stella asked her apprehension growing pot prescription mostly pot arthur junior said i guess theres a bunch of vietnamese down south ozarks as are growing it indoors them vietnamese know the hydroponics and all that shit but far as i can tell its not getting resold around here somehow it goes up through benning and disappears up to the city or who knows where i mean if funzi and them really are mob it could be saint louis or chicago or who the hell knowstheyre all connected hmm stella said as little as she knew about organized crime she had trouble believing that arthur junior knew much more but the thought that the mob could have its tentacles here in rural missouriit was a possibility shed never considered what else well i dont know about this one but this guy i know works on one of the riverboats he says theyre running a skim operation on a lot of the momandpop slots you know you got your lowend casino hotels like that not a lot of oversight supposedly these guys not benning but some of funzis guys they come around and take a regular payout and i guess that goes up through the organization too so youre telling me that bennings place is what like some kind of mob playhouse arthur junior frowned hed barely touched his food the eggs were congealing and the bacon grease had solidified mrs hardesty all due respect i think youre not taking this serious enough i think bennings place is kind of like the conduit for all their local operations you know out all over the countymaybe up along the river where the gambling isthrough funzi up to kansas city and then who knows stella thought that through conduitnow there was a tendollar word much as she hesitated to admit it arthur junior was a shinier penny than shed expected which made his anxiety that much more striking a dumbass gets scared you can chalk it up to cowardice or sheer stupidity but a guy like this tell me arthur junior she said voice low and serious what do you think has happened to your brother i mean leave off for a minute whether he took tucker or not arthur junior shook his head i think he figured he could outsmart benning roy deans played both sides of everything since we were in grade school hell he doubledealt me out of my allowance more timesn i can remember so i guess he probably talked them into giving him some sort of job running packages by which you mean drugs stella interrupted drugs sure or maybe those stolen car parts load em into a truck or something drive them to some central location or moneyits not like they deposit all that cash down at sawyer county bank you know roy dean can be convincing so if he started that in april thats a couple of months he could have been trying to work his way up until one day he figures hell just keep a little for himself or hold back some of the load to resell or something i mean if theres an angle roy deand find it butwhat then what are you thinking mrs hardesty arthur junior said miserably pushing his coffee cup in a circle on the table im thinking its possible he got himself killed the dumb shit stella sat with that a minute considered the angles sure shed read lots of crime novels they were her favorite but that was the kind of thing that happened in la or new yorkif it really ever happened at all would anyone bother to kill a local loser over a few hundred bucks worth of swag seems kind of ruthless you know overkill arthur junior was silent a moment but then he looked stella in the eye and said some might say the same about your methods mrs hardesty i guess its all a matter of perspective well now that was saying a mouthful stella resisted the urge to protest and wondered was it really possible the mob had taken up residence here not ten miles from where she was born and raised without her knowing she had to talk to goat if anyone knew anything about it he would but how was she going to pull that off without tipping him off to everything else go back to the tucker thing for a second she said you cant think of any reasonany at allhe might have had for taking him getting back at chrissy maybe no thats just crazy arthur junior said its not like he was all that fond of the kid i never saw roy dean give him a second look anytime they were over at mom and dads i just dont think hed go in for the inconvenience diapers and feeding him and all when theres other ways he couldve messed up chrissys life easier im inclined to agree with you but chrissy thinks roy dean mightve took tucker with him he came over to the house on saturday morning and there was a call it a short discussion and then chrissy got called away for a bit and when she got back they were both gone and roy deans car too and the diaper bag stella didnt mention the fact that another equally viable suspect had hidden naked on the premises during this exchange before making a stealthy and unexplained exit no need to cloud the issue well i dont know maybe roy dean figured if he was in trouble they wouldnt off him in front of the kid or something damn it all stella said with conviction look arthur junior this has been a lovely meal but im afraid we got to hit the road here tomorrows gonna start early and at my age it takes a while to get my beauty sleep in she threw some money down on the table and stood up yeah arthur junior said giving his untouched meal a forlorn glance as he followed her only i dont think beauty sleeps gonna help this time four you sure you got all that stella asked watching chrissys stubby fingers with their sparkly lavender nails move over the keys of the old cash register it was nearly nine oclock hardesty sewing machine sales repairs official opening hour though the street outside wasnt exactly overrun with eager customers umhum unit price then that dept shift key then dept number and um plu she tapped the keys slowly and deliberately until the drawer popped open and personal checks okay if i know the person not if you know the person chrissy if you trust the person theres a difference remember chrissy knit her eyebrows together i still dont get how im supposed to know if somebodys going to try and write a bad check i mean theres been times ive wrote one and never even knew it cause i just didnt tote up how bad off we were in the account well think sugar like you wouldnt take a check from crandall jakes now would you chrissys eyes widened oh no i wouldnt that man lets his dogs get knocked up and then drowns the puppies i know it for fact dont even try to find em homes well yeah but stella considered trying to explain that it was crandalls two stints at county for tax evasion and social security fraud that were more to the point what do you suppose hed want to buy here anyway chrissy continued looking around the shop at the walls hung with racks of sewing notions the quilting and embroidery machines set up with sample scraps of fabric under the presser feet the racks of books and patterns forget him he was a bad example oh chrissy just use your judgment i wont be gone all that long anyway okay chrissy hitched her feet up on the rungs of the stool and patted the stack of magazines stella bought her at the eleven ill just read and maybe dust a little and be fine here i know you will darlin wouldnt it be just great if they got tucker up in the trailer out there chrissy asked with a little smile like if maybe roy dean asked em to babysit while he did some errands for mr benning and them all heck you know how men are theyre probly feedin him those little powder sugar doughnuts and lettin him watch pro wrestling uh yeah that would be nice stella said slinging her big old brown leather purse over her shoulder it was a little heavier than usual today since shed taken the precaution of adding the ruger shed picked it more for luck than anythingit reminded her of her dad though shed never seen him fire it shed cleaned and oiled it when she got home from dropping arthur junior off listening to the radio and thinking but dont go getting your hopes up hear we got to be ready for the possibility were in for a bit of a haul here remember like we talked about chrissy nodded but refused to look at stella she used a long lavender nail to scratch at the sales tax chart taped to the counter and pursed her sticky pinkglossed lips i know i just said it would be nice you know on the drive to bennings stella wondered if shed done the right thing softpedaling the information shed wrung out of arthur junior last night shed told chrissy that shed run into someone at the divorce party who told her roy dean was just helping out some friends of mr benning with some business that might include trips up to the city which could explain why he was away stella allowed as to how bennings business might not be on the proper side of legal but that didnt faze chrissy in the least seeing as how her brothers and cousins and uncles had already done a fair job of setting her expectations for the conducting of business firmly in gray territory stella hadnt mentioned arthur juniors fears that roy dean might already be dead chrissy convinced as she was that roy dean had her son would no doubt make the intuitive leap straight to real frightening danger for tucker and stella needed the girl to stay calm if only so she didnt have to stay home and babysit her she also didnt tell chrissy about the visit to pitt akerss apartment stella was more than a little concerned about the empty rooms the cat food stockpiled with what looked like several weeks supply shed snuck a look at the national center for missing exploited children web site while chrissy was busying herself at the cash register and she didnt like what she saw not one bit all those sweet facesall those big trusting eyesand the terrible facts last seen with her mothers livein boyfriend last seen with his noncustodial mother if pitt truly believed the boy was his who could say what lengths he might go to it was better not to give chrissy any more to worry about than necessary by leaving the girl at the shop stella hoped chrissy would pour all her attention into selling a few packages of elastic or fetching fixedup machines for the ladies who came to collect them and if she messed up the days receipts or rang up a package of straw needles as a box of silk pins well that was just part of the cost of doing business when you were breaking in new staff that particular thought was still on stellas mind as she pulled into bennings no guard today the big metal gates had been folded back leaving the dirt entrance clear and a couple more cars were pulled in the area between bennings trailer and the start of the rows of ruined and wrecked cars and parts she eased chrissys celica into a space between a dusty latemodel pickup and a fencedoff dog run chrissys car with its rustspotted panels and rear bumper attached with a length of steel cable was stellas ostensible reason for the visit though stella didnt intend to need one she meant to see if she could just deal straight with benning especially since it wasnt too likely that his friends from up north would be hanging around the yard on a wednesday morning when very little was stirring including the drooping black walnut trees lining the fenced edge of the property their branches looking like they were ready to give up from the heat as she turned off the ignition the radio guy announced it would get up to a hundred again stella wasnt too excited about that but as she walked around the front of the car the fevered braying that went up in the pen next to her indicated that the dogs at least didnt intend to let a little heat and humidity keep them from their duties stella considered herself a dog person years ago shed brought home a stray a little dog that was at least part beagle with some mystery elements mixed in shed named the dog buttons for the spots that ran along her soft belly but when ollie took to kicking buttons for no reason at all stella gave the dog to a family on the other end of town crying all the way home and swore shed never put a pet in harms way again besides there was noelle to think about even if ollie never hit the child and mostly ignored her it wasnt good for a child to see acts of violence carried out right in front of her while ollie did most of his wifebeating when noelle was asleep or out of the house he kicked buttons any old time he felt like it no matter who saw him stella had been meaning to get a dog ever since ollie died but shed been waiting for things to calm down a bit so shed have time to raise a pup up right unfortunately her side business had remained strong with a new client showing up every time she thought shed finally hit a dry spell and it was beginning to look as if stella would just have to bite the bullet and get herself a brokein dog not the worst thing in the world of course stella had a fair amount of hard miles on herself and she wouldnt hold that against any potential canine pet but the huge angry beasts throwing themselves against the fencing just inches from her hip were another story with the boxy snouts and barrel chests that indicated pit bull blood they had their doglips bared and their snapping teeth exposed and the ruckus they were sending up had an edge of crazed fury to it that stella knew only too well came from a particular dograising philosophy it took mean to breed mean always had when it came to dogs unlike men whod produce a bad apple now and then even in the best environmentlike roy dean for instanceit was near impossible to raise up a mean dog if you just gave the thing a little attention and didnt take to abusing it the pair in the cage though with their quivering muscled bodies and drooling vicious grins appeared to have developed appetites that were downright terrifying stella could imagine the huge jaws clamping down on unprotected flesh the forearms scrabbling for purchase as they went in for the kill and she backed away from the fencing aw now they wouldnt hurt nothin an amused voice said behind her stella turned and found herself facetoface with earl benning what can i do for you today young lady he continued and then a curious thing happened his eyes which had been all squinty in the bright sun opened a little wider and the smarmy grin snapped off his face as though someone had knocked it down with a plank youre stella hardesty aint you so much for the whole just looking ruse oh well stella wasnt one for subterfuge down and direct that did the trick more often than not i am and youre earl benning am i right she jutted a hand out but after earl just kept staring at her face making no move to shake she finally withdrew it you used to be a brunette i think i remember he said had a tight little figure too stella hadnt been planning on a tea party but earls manners were a little much even for the circumstances im still a brunette she said touching a hank of her hair i paid good money for this and as for my figure i seem to remember there was a little less of you a decade back too nah im talkin about back when you first married ollie course i was still a kid then butmmm man you sure used to fill out your blouse stella who was almost never at a loss for words gulped air what the hell if it was just a matter of filling out her shirt well she could probably manage two for the price of one these days shed been a c when she walked down the aisle now she was a dd but she doubted that was exactly what earl benning had on his mind thanks i guess stella said course i dont recall ever checking out your package so even if i wanted to now which i dont i wouldnt be able to do any comparin look this is real fun and all but if youre fixin to ask me out im not interested and besides i got some other stuff to talk over with you the expression on bennings face darkened from amusement to something a sight more cruel aint it just my bad luck he said here i was wondering if you were free for the prom all right what is it that i can do for you today stella hardesty the way he enunciated each syllable of her last name gave stella a chill that started around the bottom of her spine and snaked its way up her back shivering along her nerve endings she was glad to have extra insurance in her big purse how about if we take a little walk she asked that okay i suppose thatd be all right benning said gimme just a sec here he pulled a walkietalkietype device off the worn belt that hung low beneath his drooping gut and muttered into it for a minute why dont we take this way he suggested replacing the walkietalkie and giving his pants an upward tug stella followed without a word they walked down a gravel lane through rows of automotive refuse that were arranged in rough rectangles most of the cars either had the front or back end caved in or had taken a tbone to the side some had apparently died of a series of unfortunate encounters damage extending all the way around a few looked as if theyd succumbed to old age in the distance a yellow front loader was moving scrap toward a towering pile of crushed cars let me get right to it stella said im looking for tucker lardner little boy eighteen months old just a baby really benning glanced quickly at stella his eyes narrowed something flickered within their flinty depths no babies around here he said quickly just hold on stella said watching him carefully i aint saying there was what i know is tucker disappeared last saturday with roy dean shaw now i dont have any business with roy dean dont even care where he ended up though i wouldnt mind knowing just sos i could you know cross all the ts and dot the is on this cross the ts huh benning echoed muscling his expression back into indifference i aint seen roy dean since since ages and i definitely aint seen no kid well okay like i say im really just looking to find the boy now theres some talk that roy dean was doing a little work for you and some of your ah business associates thats none of my concern either hell looks like a nice place you got here all this stock and whatnot you like my place do you benning laughed a short percussive sound that was almost a bark well now thats a nice compliment coming from a businesswoman such as yourself stella kept walking keeping her eyes on the gravel and clumps of weeds on the ground in front of her but her heart did a little speedup you mean my shop she said the sewing machine shop i did some nice business last year but that aint what i mean stella hardesty benning said his voice going low he leaned closer conspiratorially so that their shoulders brushed as they ambled along and stella had the weird thought that they must look like lovers strolling together i mean your other business course i dont know what sort of numbers you got on that you know expense ratios and receivables and all that yeah surprising right he added giving her a little poke in the ribs my daddy didnt raise no dummy didnt get to be the biggest salvage outfit around by letting it run itself clearly youre no dummy stella agreed though im not sure what youre talking about with can it stella lets just get this said i know whatall you do and if i wanted i could get a lot more information pretty quick you know in the form that might be useful for law types see where im going i run a nice tight shop here but i dont like the idea of anyone coming around snooping into my business any moren you probably like someone coming around doing it to you so heres what i propose i dont have any idea where roy dean is yeah hes brought a few cars around and we buy now and then but i run a clean shop and if he cant provide title i take a pass so i havent seen him in what two three weeks i can check the books if you want to know what we last bought off him though seems like it was an odyssey frontend collision if im not mistaken as far as that boy i didnt even know roy dean had a kid it never came up he doesnt tuckers his wifes chrissys benning shrugged and nodded well there you go no reason for him to be hauling the kid around anyway then wish i could help you but looks like were just a dead end for you benning took a left and led her down a rough section of road that veered back toward the main lot stella glanced behind her shoulder and could just make out the edges of a shed big enough to fit arthur juniors description past the fields of cars and several structures holding various parts suspended from metal gridwork reluctantly she followed benning you say we stella said who all you got working here anyways benning shrugged impatiently i got a parttimer most days chuck keltner you probably know his mom and a guy moved up here from morrisville not fulltime you know no benefits or nothing mostly its me for the big stuff yeah see way i hear it you got some outoftown interest too benning said nothing but stella could sense him tense up next to her some friends of yours maybe bringing you in on some other avenues stella continued look like i said its no concern to me you want to grow a little pot patch on your back forty whatever just trying to keep this a twoway flow of information hear what im saying if i knew anything id tell you benning said his voice soft but youre way off the mark with that last comment yeah i got some friends come down from the city from time to time we go out on the lake fish a little play cards hunt or whatever i dont know whos been giving you your information but let me tell you the biggest thing around here is maybe a little weekend party from time to time and if someone stuck their nosy face in and saw something that wasnt there well that would be their problem see where im going i think i see stella said keeping her own voice low anytime you had a bunch of visitors after hours maybe taking the party over to some of your other facilities on the site why youre just eating pretzels and playing crazy eights that about the size of it yeah id say so benning said nodding now youre getting it roy deans not exactly on my alist and we sure dont have no little kids around when we party so i guess thats about all i can do for you today unless you want to see if we can find something to fix up that rust bucket they had arrived back at chrissys car the sun had climbed higher in the sky and the heat shimmered inches above the opaque faded paint on the cars roof and hood i appreciate the offer stella said as the dogs hurtled across their pen braying and crashing into the fence but i think ive changed my mind about it since talking to you yeah hows that well this little ride dont look like much on the outside stella said lots of miles just like i got but under the hood thats a scrappy little engine gave me plenty more getupandgo than i was expecting that so yeah stella got in the car and rolled down the window she gave benning her sweetest smile as she stuck the key in the ignition and fired up the little celica sometimes you just cant tell from looking how much trouble your rides going to give you hardesty sewing machine sales repair shared a parking lot with china paradise a generally decent restaurant run by the eternally grumpy roseann lu when stella pulled into the lot at eleven thirty she figured the three cars already parked there were roseanns customers getting an early start on the lunch special in her shop though she was surprised to find chrissy with not one but two customers lila snopes and a second woman in her sixties both of them talking at once chrissys wide pale blue eyes darted from one to the other and when she saw stella she blurted oh im so glad youre back we got us a situation here lila turned away from the counter and at the sight of stella pursed her features into a frown that caused the many wrinkles around her smokers mouth to focus in like arrows not a situation just a case of the customer is always right she said primly hello lila stella said she noted a heavy resemblance in the womans companion same steely severe bob haircut same pronounced chin and flaccid cheeks and this must be your sister im delores the woman said nodding i called delores to tell her you were running the binding twoforone lila said i love the wide stuff for quilts im stocking up she pointed to the counter where packages of binding were piled up high her sister had her own pile there were probably thirty packages between the two of them stella took a deep breath and said sorry ladies but im not running any specials i think theres been some misunderstanding thats what ive been trying to tell them chrissy stagewhispered in a singsongy voice no misunderstanding i can figure lila said i was in here at ten and i bought two packs of the inch and a half kelly green and your girl here charged me for one so i says you charged me for one deary and she says no thats no mistake thats what you told her to do i said no such thing chrissy said i said i was just doing what miz hardesty told me and it wasnt my fault the cash register wasnt ringing up the numbers right well you took my money didnt you lila said the jut of her chin taking on an even more stubborn set way i see it that means you agreed on the twoforone lilas sister nodded along to everything her sister said and chrissys face was getting blotchy and red now lets just slow down a minute ladies stella said this is chrissys first day on the job and shes still getting used to our system i dont think i did drive up from quail valley delores said primly seein as you had the special stella tapped her foot on the floor did the math in her head okay she said after a minute hows this twentyfive percent off thats the best i can do well how about you throw in one of those serger books i know you aint sold in two years lila sniffed and maybe you ought to consider getting some more qualified help chrissy went very still for a moment and stella was trying to figure out how to diffuse the old bitchs comments when she noticed something interesting a deep purple flush was creeping upward from chrissys collarbones and her eyes had narrowed to slits she slowly drew herself up to her full height and drew in a breath and then she made her hands into tight fists before extending her fingers out like a boxer getting taped for a fight excuse me lady what did you just say she demanded her voice very soft lila put her hands on her hips and glared back just that seein as youre not even able to run a simple cash register or add up a purchase maybe stella here ought to chrissys hand shot out so fast that stella jumped chrissy made a crisscross motion in front of lilas face snapping her fingers twice lookie here she said voice full of menace i have had a very bad couple of days i have sat back and took what assholes like you have been dishing out for way too long and im about sick of it i am not dumb i am not helpless and im not taking any more shit im done and im about to get very very pissed off and im tellin you now i dont think you want to be around when that happens hear lilas eyes went wide and she gripped the handle of her handbag hard her sister shifted slightly so she was standing behind lila um now stella began but realized she didnt really feel like scolding chrissy this anger of hers might not be such a bad thing in fact it just might be something they could use she grabbed the book lila wanted from the rack and slipped it into a plastic merchandise bag along with the binding tape you got a deal she said and gently pushing chrissy out of the way rang up the sale and quickly counted out the ladies change lila snopes took the bag and the change without comment she shoved the money in her purse and the two old ladies scuttled out of the store without a backward glance when they were gone there was a long silence chrissy stared at the shop door and took a few deep breaths after a few moments she turned to stella with a nearly placid expression and handed her a postit note i took a message for you she said stella squinted at the note in curvy lettering was written call me on my cell thats great she said thanks call who chrissy looked at her in surprise well the sheriff of course stellas heart did a little rollover but she kept her expression neutral oh cause see on the note it just says she pointed to the postit never mind when did he call he didnt call he stopped by after that lady was here the first time maybe an hour ago what did he say i mean besides to call well mostly he told me not to worry but you know what stella ive been thinking i think yall ought to stop trying to make me feel better i mean im tuckers mama i need to know what alls going on so i can help find him stella hesitated she admired the girls guts and was relieved to see chrissy provoked out of her listless funk but her instinct was to tell chrissy to stay out of it it wasnt just that shed always worked alonethere was also the promise she had made to herself after lorelle cavenaugh died that she would never do anything to endanger a client again chrissy was still a client letting chrissy anywhere near benning and the rest of themor letting her tag along on the hunt for pitt akerswas insanity anything else she asked carefully sheriff jones asked where you were oh you know i guess i could have given him your cell phone number i didnt even think of that thats okay hes got it stella said did you tell him tell him what where i was you know out at bennings oh no i didnt cause you remember you said i remember but when its the sheriff whos askingno scratch that she had been about to tell chrissy that despite her earlier warning to keep stellas errand a secret the sheriff was an exception but that wasnt really true as much as stella was sort of wishing shed been back in time for his visit she wasnt ready yet to fill him in on her search she needed to find out a little more about bennings side dealings after her visit she was more inclined to worry about that angle there was something about the way arthur junior had reacted when she mentioned tucker earl benning was shiftier and meanerlooking than she remembered that was true and yet when he kept insisting he didnt know anything about tucker there was an element of something resembling fear in his eyes a nervous quality to his voice enough to make stella think twice just because she couldnt figure out why roy dean might have taken tucker to the salvage yard didnt mean it hadnt happened some men she had learned didnt always need good reasons to do bad things earlier as she left bennings stella had taken a good look at his house a recentmodel silver camaro was parked in front of a glossy black ford f and around the side a pair of seadoos were loaded on a trailer on the other side of the house on a larger trailer a sweet blue and white closedhull ski nautique was pulled up under a carport on the porch a longlegged bleachedblond gal in a bikini top and a pair of cutoffs lounged in a deck chair cars boats toys and women none of those came for free at least not for a man like benning stella needed to find out where the money was coming from that would lead her to the business earl and his friends were conducting and that information with any luck would lead her to roy dean and from there just maybe to tucker but if she went to goat now with nothing but a hunch he was bound to go in and ask a bunch of questions and give earl plenty of time to cover his tracks while goat was going through channels talking to judges getting search warrants their chances of getting tucker back would be slipping away it was times like these that reminded stella how convenient it was to be on the more casual side of law enforcing luckily she had a few contacts who would help her get the information she needed without having to involve goat on the other hand if pitt akers had tucker waiting was exactly the wrong thing to do in the case of family abductionsnot that pitt was family but the man evidently imagined himself to beearly days were critical and they needed to get on his trail before he had a chance to take the boy so far away that no one could find him stella felt her veins go icy at the thought and the images of lost children from the internet flashed through her mind shed never forgive herself if she waited too long if pitt was even now driving out west to california or down to mexico or up to canada tucker sitting in a wet diaper and wailing for his mother stella you okay chrissy asked peering at her carefully you look like youre about to faint there stella forced a smile she crumpled up the postit note and made a rim shot on the wastebasket across the room tomorrowif she was no closer to finding tucker by tomorrow shed tell goat everything im good come on princess lets eat after a noworsethanusual lunch of lemon chicken and greasy chow mein served with a bare minimum of chat by roseann lu which chrissy consumed with gusto befitting a far tastier meal they returned to the shop and chrissy set to pacing back and forth stella had an inspiration from the back room where she kept spare inventory and cleaning supplies and costcosized containers of pretzels and beef jerky she brought out a large cardboard box fran colvin started this back when we had that teacher in here doing the quilts she said poor fran she died before she could finish it got that chicken bone in her throat didnt she chrissy said coming to take a look yup anyway how about i teach you how to do this chrissy hesitated aint there something i can do thats you know for tucker but thats just it stella said well make him a quilt and when he gets home youll be able to tuck him in under it oh chrissy said for a long moment stella wasnt sure she was going to go for it the girl had a faroff look to her part longing and part grief and a fastgrowing part nailspitting fury the thunderclouds building in chrissys pale eyes worried stella the last thing she needed at this point was a loose cannon all right chrissy finally agreed lets do it stella explained the basics then started working the phone dialing trusted friendsmany of them former clientsall over the county and out to the far edges of the state to let them know about the missing little towheaded boy last seen wearing denim overalls with a baseball embroidered on the bib if pittor roy dean for that matterstopped for a burger or a bathroom break or to pick up a pack of diapers there would be a lot of women on the lookout women whose lives had taught them to be observant and resourceful it wasnt an amber alert but it was a start she also called a few people who had access to officialtype information the type of information that wasnt generally available to the average citizen between calls stella showed chrissy how to cut the fabric using a ruler and rotary cutter the rotary cutter looked like a pinkhandled pizza wheel but its blade was razor sharp and easily sliced through several layers of fabric at a time when the patches were cut stella taught chrissy to join them into blocks lining up seams and trimming the thread tails then pressing the finished blocks at the ironing board when chrissy held up her first ninepatch a homely uneven affair of blue and brown fabric she smiled faintly i made that she said damn stella rested a hand on chrissys shoulder tell you what she said sewings good therapy there were plenty of times when i didnt feel much like dealing with my life you know and id sit there at my machineprobably sewed a million miles in seams just thinking about things chrissy looked doubtful this is okay and all but id still rather be doing something she said not just sittin stella thought how chrissy had looked just yesterday puddled in the chair in her living room eating her way through her worries she was amazed at the girls transformation shed got some fight back in her telling off the dreadful sisters seemed to be just what she needed chrissy reminded stella of herself in a way on the day when shed finally had enough of ollies abuse and made the transformation from passive victim to hellforleather avenger nobody had told her that day to sit down and relax nobody had offered to help her set things right either maybe it was a mistake to try to settle chrissy down to keep a lid on her newfound anger but at the same time stella couldnt figure out any way to include her without putting her into danger and that was something she simply wasnt willing to do she wasnt going to let another woman get hurtor killedon her watch she had to do the job alone i hear you she said not meeting chrissys gaze but really theres not a lot we can do today until we start hearing back from these folks we just got to be patient who alld you call anyway oh just friends here and there stella there was reproof in chrissys voice i know you think i couldnt hear you fishin around for stuff you aint supposed to know but i am sittin right here not ten feet from you and i got young hearing now who was it well the dmv for one stella said giving in she supposed there was no harm in letting chrissy in on some of her strategy i wrote down some plate numbers out at bennings i want to see if theyre all registered to him direct they just gonna tell you that chrissy asked well not exactly but i got a friend uhhuh from her expression stella could tell shed made the leap friends that owe me favors actually thats good with me chrissy said who else well i got some law enforcement contacts i guess youd call em up in kansas city thought id see if they have any ideas about what kind of side business benning and his friends might be running down here she didnt like the way chrissys eyes narrowed the girls wheels were spinning stella didnt want to mention the mob or organized crime she saw no point in scaring her chrissy lowered her pinned patches of fabric to the table and what kind of business are they running stella stella bit her lip well i dont know if i knew i wouldnt be trying to find out now would i after a few more seconds of frank and suspicious gazing chrissy picked up the quilt block again and went back to work but youre going to tell me soons you learn something right she said mmmhmm stella said feeling worse than she usually did about lying unfortunately she didnt have a lot of success with the rest of her calls between the customers who straggled in helping chrissy with the sewing and not finding people at their desks or answering their cell phones stella hadnt made much progress at all when closing time rolled around she and chrissy stopped by the freshway to pick up dinner fixings when they got home todd was doing skateboard tricks across the street in old rolf bayers driveway stella was surprised since bayer had always been hostile to everyone in the neighborhood and seemed to reserve a special hatred for kids hed yelled at noelle years ago for making chalk drawings on the sidewalk in front of his house hey she called walking into the street as chrissy took the groceries into the house you tryin to get bayer to call the cops on you todd shot out into the street leaping over the curb and landing hard then skidded to a stop next to her as usual he hadnt bothered to tie his shoes it was a wonder that the puffy enormous things stayed on his feet he told my mom he was going to sic the city on us he said in a tone of outrage called us trash so i told him i was gonna skate on his driveway until i broke something and then wed sue his ass to hell stella figured she knew what had bayers dander upthe groffes lawn had been neither watered nor cut in a long time and the girls usually left their big wheels and cozy coupes in the front yard well lemme ask you something she said you ever thought about cutting that grass of yours mowers busted todd muttered toeing the ground ah stella said poor sherilee in her line of business stella occasionally forgot that getting rid of a bad man was only the first step to getting ones life back and with sherilees schedule she could see how lawn care might have fallen down on the priority list well look here mines working fine you go and get it out of the garage its got gas in it put the clippings in the garden bin okay i dont want to see them left out on the lawn aw stella shut up punk and listen when youre done with that come on back here and ill loan you some sprinklers hoses if you need em too that lawn is officially your job now hear todd crossed his arms and glowered at her why the fuck would i want to do any of that it had been a long day and stellas patience was stretched thin without thinking she reached out for the collar of todds grimy tshirt and twisted until she was practically choking him look here she said you want to grow up like the dirtbag who walked out on your mom or you want to maybe be someone she can be halfway proud of huh it wasnt until todd made a strained gasping sound that stella realized she might be squeezing a little too hard and relaxed her grip todd rubbed at his throat and glared at her besides she said softening theres twenty bucks in it for you mom wont let me take no money todd muttered well thats right she shouldnt but im going to give it to you anyway that can be our secret todd stared at her a moment longer finally he nodded ill do it for ten he said and as he trudged into her garage to get the mower skateboard tucked under his arm stella felt an odd little tug at her heart maybe there was a chance for the kid inside she put a pot of ricearoni on and tossed some pork chops with bread crumbs and lipton french onion soup mix drizzled them with butter and stuck them in the oven chrissy was slicing veggies for a salad and setting the table so stella took her cell phone out to the screen porch at the back of the house and dialed noelles number hi youve reached noelle gerald and i arent here right now stellas throat tightened at the sound of her daughters voice she called a few times a week always when she knew noelle would be at work which wasnt hard to do because noelle worked long hours at the beauty shop this gerald thing on the machine was new but it wasnt a surprise stella knew a fair amount about gerald already an old client who lived in coffey emailed stella to let her know when gerald and noelle started keeping company within two weeks of their first date stella had his priors memorized could draw his family chart from memory the whole unremarkable clan over in arkansas knew the details of the warrant he was avoiding across the state line for putting his old fiancée in the hospital stella still didnt understand what it was that made a girl who grew up in a house filled with anger and violence seek out the same even if ollie never smacked noelle she was barely six the first time she saw him punch her motherand ollie doled out a steady stream of verbal abuse to both of them why hadnt noelle arrived at adulthood looked around and said to herself oh goody look at all these perfectly nice ordinary mentheyre not one bit like dad but gerald wasnt the first man her daughter had dated who treated her badly he was the second unfortunately stella had dealt with the first one so decisively that he lived in alaska now not daring to show his face in the continental us stella didnt regret itnot even when noelle called her up sobbing and cursing and promising never to speak to her again for the rest of her life no she only began to regret it when noelle went out and found herself someone worse stella dialed her daughters number again and listened to noelles voice that sweet voice that had called her mama had shrieked with laughter during tickle fights had sung in every concert the prosper high school chorus put on oh sugar why do you want to do this to yourself stella whispered then hung up when the phone beeped she slipped the phone back into her pocket and rocked back and forth on the glider she was keeping a close watch if things got to where she needed to intercede with gerald she would but shed learned a lesson and the fact that it broke her heart didnt make it any less important that she stay a little further out of her daughters life than she wanted next time there was nothing to stop noelle from moving even further away and though stella doubted there was anyone better at finding people who wanted not to be found she was terrified of pushing noelle further out of her life than she already was after the dinner was done and the dishes washed chrissy settled in to watch talladega nights on payperview and stella went to check her email she planned to make an early night of it tomorrow when she had a little more information shed put together a plan head up to kansas city if thats what it took when the phone rang she picked it up right away no sense taking chrissy away from her movie lots of folks used tv as an electronic babysitter for their kids stella was finding it convenient for keeping chrissys mind off trying to get involved in the case hello you lookin for roy dean a voice said on the other end a weird voice tinny and deep as if its owner was speaking through layers of reynolds wrap might be stella said slowly trying to place the voice and having no luck i got some information could help you find him is that right what sort of information there was a pause and stella could hear breathing i dont want to say over the phone whyever the hell not line might not be secure stella sighed heavily what you think the fbi came in while i was at work and bugged my place waitfine fine whatever you want to meet somewhere yeah and i was thinkin you could make it worth my trouble you know stella was mystified could it be a friend of roy deans someone hed blabbed to at a bar one of bennings employees benning himself what did you have in mind she asked trying to sound puzzled a hundred ought to do it a hundred thats what i said thatsoh whatever fine where bench on the southeast corner of the pond next to the county golf course be there in an hour stella could picture the muddy little pond a ballcatcher at the bottom of a hill she didnt remember a bench but the county was messing around with the community park and golf course these days ripping out the landscaping theyd installed in the sixties and seventies and updating it bright tubular plastic equipment replaced the swings shed pushed noelle in a mulched plot of azalea bushes grew near the park entrance where there had been an overgrown bank of arborvitae worst of all exercise stations had sprouted along the brick walk that used to be a simple muddy track around the pond ill find it stella grumbled hanging up she changed into some stretchy black yoga pants and fastened on her holster a quickdraw abdomen model made of black nylon with velcro in the back and tucked the raven into it she shrugged on a tank top and slipped a light jacket over it it was too hot by half to be dressing like that but stella didnt intend to meet up with unknown wouldbe conspirators without some sort of insurance hidden on her as she was corralling her hair into a big plastic barrette the phone in her bedroom rang she picked it up pretending not to notice the goshwonderifitcouldbegoat thrill that zipped around her insides hello there was only the sound of breathingrather labored breathingbefore a young womans voice finally said is this chrissy or the other one uh this is stella hardesty whos this it dont matter who i am kin i please speak with chrissy stella considered it wasnt likely to be one of the other lardner girlspresumably they knew their sisters voice ditto any close friends which meant that a stranger was calling for her client a stranger who somehow knew that chrissy was staying at stellas place chrissys occupied at the moment stella said briskly may i take a message a bit more silence then how about if i wait is she in the bathroom or something actually im taking all of ms lardners messages at the moment can you tell me the nature of your call please itsimsee here i need to talk to roy dean that caught stella by surprise but she answered carefully roy dean isnt here im afraid well yall gonna be seein him soon we may be yes stella said thinking fast whoever the mystery caller was she clearly didnt know roy dean had disappeared it was possible she might unwittingly spill information that would lead to him well look i need him to to come over and get this uh this thing that he left here at my place stellas heart sped up the way the girl said thing it was as if she had a secret to keep what sort of thing are you talking about she asked carefully another pause this gal required a fair amount of thinking time stella decided something of his i dont want around here no more thats what kind of thing look here i didnt know he was married not when we first hooked up okay um okay sure can you at least tell me when he dropped the thing off a few days ago but look he said hed be back for it and he aint been i cant keep it around here you know i dont want to be responsible tuckerit had to be tucker roy dean had dropped the baby off with this girlhis girlfriend from the sounds of itmaybe even the one hed been pestering at the speedway and then for whatever reasonsreasons having to do with benning and the kansas city mafia maybe or more likely something a lot more simple like he got drunk or high or otherwise distractedhe hadnt been back for the boy look here stella said in as kind a voice as she could muster is this thing being well looked after huh yeah yeah its fine look tell roy dean to come get it tomorrow at noon ill come home on my lunch hour and he better be there sure just give me the address he has the address the girl spat with a full measure of disdain hes been here plenty oh well could i at least have a name hell know okay hell know damn well who it isjust tell him darla said he better be here click stella slowly lowered the receiver back to the cradle on her nightstand she finished with her hair and went out to the living room hesitating in front of the tv and wondering what to tell chrissy on screen will ferrell was saying the baby jesus prayer somehow it seemed fitting chrissy sweet pea you happen to know a gal named darla might have been keeping company with roy dean chrissy shook her head glancing away from the television no but i feel sorry for her if she has been yeah its just stella considered describing the conversation shed just had but without knowing who and where the girl was there was nothing they could do for now other than get chrissy completely riled upjust when stella had finally gotten her all settled down well nothing that wont keep until tomorrow at least until noon somehow between now and then stella had to find darla which shouldnt be too impossible in a town the size of prosper though if roy dean had taken his lovin out of town she could quickly have a monster search on her hands stella sighed one damn problem at a time right now she had a date with a park bench hey darlin i got to run out for a bit she said you meeting up with the sheriff chrissy asked sitting up straight she had changed into what stella figured passed for pajamas a pink tshirt with a kitten screenprinted on the front and the words sweet pussy why would you think that well just cause of him calling earlier i figured maybe you called him back and he talked you into a date oh stella was about to dismiss chrissys guess but the truth was she didnt have any better excuses going out for pringles would work but it might not give her enough time yes you got me girl she said ought to make you into a detective or something that got her a wide grin you think stella took care to lock the door as she left on the way to the golf course she went back over what her caller had said the thing about the hundred bucks was a joke stella had about fiftyfive dollars in her purse what was left from her onceaweek atm visit taking out another hundred would put her a little too close to overdraft territory for comfort stella had some money put away not a whole lot but enough if she was careful to get by on as long as the store continued to bring in its usual unspectacular haul every month because of the circumstances of ollies death insurance hadnt paid out a penny luckily when stellas mother passed there had been enough to pay off the mortgage and the car loan and set some aside after ollie died stella used a chunk to employ herself a fancy financial adviser up in independence the man taught her a few things ollied never seen fit to explain and recommended a few books now stella knew enough to scrape by the idea of course was to supplement her income with her little side business and sometimes that actually happened the bonus the kansas coff ee importers wife had given her for instance had paid for the new dishwasher and gas range but many of her clients had to work out payment plans and stella never had the heart to turn anyone away for lack of creative financing she had one gal who settled her account by making drapes for every room in stellas house that one was worth it seeing the exgirlfriend of the chief of police of a small town near the iowa bordera woman whod once believed that no one could help defend her from the most powerful man in townup on a ladder installing the curtains whistling and shimmying to an old pointer sisters song was a rare privilege she had a couple women who sent her plain envelopes of cash every month sometimes it was a few twenties sometimes more occasionally less with chrissy stella hadnt even bothered bringing up the subject of a payment plan beyond the fistful of rolled fives tens and twenties the girl handed over at her initial consultation chrissy already had too much on her mind no matter theyd work it out eventually stella pulled into the access road that ran along the park bright streetlights had been installed in the parking lot an improvement she welcomed as she parked she could make out a figure sitting exactly where hed promised to be on a bench theyd sunk in concrete across the pond he was a heavyset man and sat with his arms stretched out casually along the back of the bench legs crossed had it not been dark out he could have been there to feed the ducks stella patted the outline of her gun and slipped her car keys into her pocket as she made her way around the pond following the curvy outline of the fancy schmancy brick walk she was relieved that the man made no move toward his pockets when she got within twenty feet she could see his eyes shining in the moonlight hello she called here i am right on time i appreciate that cant stand a tardy bitch myself the man said and chuckled his voice was slightly highpitched and had a flat nasal quality and he seemed to find himself plenty amusing which irritated stella so what is it you have to tell me she asked she heard the slightest shuffle behind her coming from the left side of the path away from the ponda leaf against a rock or maybe trash blowingand turned to look at that moment something came at her from the right a low broad dark shape moving fast thudded into her hip and knocked her to the ground stella reached for the raven but before she could get to it her arms were yanked hard from behind there were two of themplus the man on the bench who was getting up slowly like he had all the time in the world fuck me stella thought just like a damn greenhorn not even checking her periphery first check this out she heard a voice say she felt hands roving her body as the other guy held her kicking and struggling in place the man searching her wore a stocking cap with eyeholes pulled low on his face his hands found her holster in the next second it was yanked from her waist for a second she was sure she was about to be shot with her own gun a feeling that intensified when she felt its barrel pressed against the hollow behind her right ear she scrunched up her whole face and waited for the shot in what she figured was her final half second on earth stella marveled at a new revelation waiting to get shot was different from waiting for a man to punch you on a jaw that was still healing from the last time or hit you on the temple with a beer bottle or knee you in the gut or maybe it was stella herself who was different who had changed since the last time shed been victim to the violent reckoning that ollie routinely dished out three years sixteen days in factthat counter had been put in motion when ollie slumped to the floor and bled out a counter that would never be turned off again three years sixteen days of freedom of calling her own shots and what she felt now wasnt anything like she used to feel it wasnt dull dread a sense of the inevitable a wish that hed just get on with it even a longing for the relief that would come from being knocked out what stella hardesty felt with the barrel of her own gun jabbed a few inches from her brain was mighty pissed off to her surprise it suddenly mattered a great deal to her that she not go down for the last time here by the little mud pond on the edge of town at the hands of two men she didnt even know you cocksuckers she screamed and tried to wrench her arms away from the man holding them behind her back she managed to work one leg free and kicked with everything she had connecting a solid hit to the balls of the guy in front of her she had the satisfaction of seeing him double over and start to vomit before she took a hit to the face that sent her sprawling and a second one that sent her out five stella could open only one eye she could see enough to know she was in a hospital room but the details were flickery and vague it was her right eye that still seemed to be working and for a moment she thought that was a good thing her being righthanded and all then she realized that made no sense at all her next thought was that she must have had a stroke that not only left half of her body incapacitated but also played havoc with her reasoning great she thought not just the lurching and the drooling but embarrassing conversational gaffes too and then it occurred to her that such a state wasnt all that different from lots of the customers down at bjs as the evening wore on and she felt a little more cheerful despite a splitting pain that seemed to bisect her head as though someone had stuck a shiv in one ear and shoved until they saw the point coming out the other might have to blow big johnson she thought just to celebrate if and when she got back on her feet againand to cement her new status as a regular in his joint since she probably wouldnt be fit to drink anywhere else that so the sound of goats voicedeep rumbly and closegave stella a shock that started in the gut and blasted out causing her arms and legs to spasm and her reluctant left eye to gap open just a little so she could see out of both her eyes and what she was looking at was goat joness broad tanned face leaning in and staring at her with what appeared to be equal parts concern and amusement she could smell him too his woodsy scent that had notes of laundry softener and coffee and a faint hint of man just sheer sweaty testosteroney man that final bit gave her a different sort of tremor that let her know that another quadrant of her anatomy had also pulled through goat she said licking her lips which felt sticky and crusty it occurred to her that it was unlikely that anyone had bothered to brush her teeth and goat was leaning close enough she was going to have trouble talking to him and sparing him the effects of her breath at the same time you got any gum he stared at her hard then split into a grin gum you get the shit kicked outta you get left to marinate in the golf pond dragged out by a couple of stoned teenagers and all you can think to ask for is gum ah that goats words filled in the details on the sketchy framework of last nights history shed remembered getting into a jam oh yeah and there was the thing with her gun tooand then the entire sequence came back to her right up to landing that sweet kick to the assholes gonads bet he was a little worse for wear today probably lying on a couch with a bag of frozen peas ducttaped in his skivvies that made her feel a little better whats so funny dusty you still thinking about goin down on big johnson stella felt her one good eye go wide shit shed said it out loud i didnt say that she protested what are you talking about yup just a minute ago you were coming out of la la land all these drugs they got in you for the stitchin up and whatnot must be wearing off and you were saying i said i got to show big johnson stella said feeling her face grow hot she could also feel little itchy pinpricks of sensation and she put her fingertips to her cheek felt stitches well damn traced them from close to the bridge of her nose down to the back of her jaw on the left and there was some sort of bandageandtape thing going on up on top of her skull too she continued her exploration and found a little nest of stitches buried in a shaved patch on the other side of her head the skin there raised up in a sizable goose egg yeah whatall you plan to show him obviously not my beauty pageant sash stella said sighing how bad off am i goat looked at her with one corner of his mouth quirked down and the other up like his eyebrows his mouth appeared to have a mind of its own when it came to expressing mixed feelings well he said slowly considering they hit you hard enough to put you out for a few hours i guess ive seen plenty worse i mean not on a girl i mean a woman or anything not that you look any worse than a guy whos had the crap kicked out of him jesus goat shut the fuck up and get me a mirror goat folded his arms across his chest and stared at her with a squinty expression you sure thats a good idea you know youre just damn lucky youre not in worse shape dr guevera says youre in a lot better health than she expected heart like a teenager great better than expected it wasnt exactly a ringing endorsement for her appearance it was nice to be judged healthy but stella already knew she was in basically superb shapeher job required it under her curves were muscles she never knew existed until a few years ago there was a reason she spent an hour every day on the stupid bowflex and ran her ass off a few times a week really what kind of health did she expect me to be in oh come on dusty dont get all prickly im sure she just meantwell hell you know were not spring chickens here me and you be happy youre on top of the curve besides you look fine to me you always do he looked away reddening how about we talk about what you were doing down at the golf course instead and who your little playmates were that decided to show you such a nice time stella rolled her eyes which turned out to be a bad decision since it made the ache in her head turn into more of a symphony of pain how should i know who they were she demanded its not like they wrote their names in my yearbook before they took off well lets back up a little then what did you do after we talked yesterday what kind of rocks have you been turning over looking for beetles stella was sorely tempted to tell goat everything that had happened breaking into pitt akerss apartment with all that extra cat food the trip to see benning his threats spotting the shed at the back of the lot the evidence of his livingitup lifestyle the call from darla and stellas suspicion that tucker might be marking time in nothing worse than a pissedoff girlfriends housein which case shed stirred up the mob pot for nothing and bought herself a mess of trouble in the bargain there was something about having the tar beat out of you that made a big strong man with a badge and a gun seem strangely comforting but the risks were too great so far shed seen no trace of tucker at all and she had to get more leverage before she could take a chance on pushing benning any harder not to mention the stakes being raised by his thugs it had to be the guys arthur junior had seen in the shed that day stella wished shed gotten a look at them but the only one shed have a chance of even recognizing again was the man on the bench stella would lay odds that was funzi himself since he seemed to be older than the other two and a little thicker and probably didnt move quite as fast plus he looked pretty comfortable directing the action while sitting on his ass if stella told goat everything now he would have to act but now that she knew how far funzi and company were prepared to go she was more frightened than ever of what they might do with tucker if for some reason the boy had ended up in their clutches if they got wind of an amber alert or a crosscounty search or something stella didnt doubt they would make the boy disappear forever she glanced at the clock on the wall and was reassured to see that it was only a little after nine oclock there was still time to keep her date with darlaroy deans date actuallyif she could just find out who and where darla was tucker had to be there he had to well lets see stella said shed play along now then try to get rid of goat so she could figure out her next move chrissy and i had lunch over at roseanns and then we minded the shop and sewed all afternoon were making a quilt for little tucker that so you conveniently left out the part where you went to the beauty parlor first where i did what went to the beauty parlor for a facial and a fullleg wax your social secretary told me my what you mean chrissy when did you hell stella when you didnt come home by midnight that gal went through your address book and called me on my cell phone got me out of bed had me out driving around all night until i got the call that they hauled you out of the pond and brought you here you were looking for me stella tried to keep a dopey little grin from settling on her face but the thought of goat driving around town worried about her made her feel warm and fuzzy on the inside well christ it was easier than listening to that young lady carryin on shes out in the waiting room you know been there ever since they brought you in sleeping in a chair far as i can tell she is yup and as soon as im done with you you can visit with her but im in here on police business and so far you havent been giving me much so i suggest we ramp up the confessin so we can both get on with things ill take up where you left off and you can just lie here and get better yeah right like that was going to happen stella intended to get herself out of the bed and back into the action as soon as it was humanly possiblebut there was no sense advertising the fact well you got the story from chrissy you know where i was all day last night i got a call around ten or so from someone saying that he had information about roy dean and would i come meet him out at the golf course so you just went eh didnt think about maybe meeting him in i dont know a public place maybe giving me a call first goat leaned forward aggressively and glared at her and stella thought oh yeah here it comes leave men out of the action and they cant stand it they just have to be the ones who do the stomping around and spitting well how was i supposed to know what they were gonna do she demanded all ive done so far is give the girl a place to stay i dont know why anyone would get all het up over that yeah and you didnt bother to take anything along to protect yourself i dont know dustyin the past youve proven yourself to be a resourceful woman in that regard any levity in goats expression was gone now and stella felt her throat go dry as she let his words sink in olliehe was talking about ollie did you take some sort of weapon with you he demanded his voice low cause they didnt find anything when the emts went out to get you come on dusty this isnt about me trying to get your permit in order or give you a timeout for nonregistration i need to know what you had on you inothing i have pepper spray in my purse but i left it in the car stella said then she told a bigger lie i dont even know how to shoot goat worked his lips evidently trying to figure out a response but ended up saying nothing stella held her breath until he eased back a little so youre still sticking to just hand tools he said irritation evident in the creases between his brows maybe you ought to carry around a screwdriver or a hammer with you at least maybe you could have pounded a nail into one of those guys stung stella said nothing at all she couldnt believe goat would make such a casual reference to the wrench shed used to kill ollieeven though she knew everyone in town talked about it made jokes even shed bet that half a dozen housewives watched their husband under the sink tightening up a pipe seal and thought about the wrench he held in his hand wondering what it had felt like when stella not even fully aware of what she intended to do brought it crashing down across her husbands forehead she blinked hard that was a memory she had sealed up under the tightest security for the longest time she couldnt remember any part of it after the funeral shed come home and other than letting the ladies from church help her box up ollies things for charity shed just gone about her days on autopilot when she thought about that day she remembered sheriff knoll taking her gently by the arm and helping her up and she remembered looking down at ollie slumped on the floor and thinking that it wouldnt do for him to ignore their company that way latermuch laterlittle bits and pieces would come to her at the oddest times sitting in a hot bath the following winter she remembered closing her hand on the wrench picking it up from the top of the stove where ollie left it after tightening up a loose bolt on the range hood a few weeks after that she was cracking eggs for an omelette and she remembered the peculiar sound he made as he crumpled to the floor a whispered nonsensical protestation eventually she remembered it all remembered it and made her peace with it but she still kept it tightly hidden in a corner of her mind it shouldnt be coming out like thisnot while she was in this vulnerable state lying here in a thin hospital nightgown with her face slashed and resewn while the man she longed for tried to drag out her secrets she felt the barriers go up the invisible ones the walls that would keep goat and everyone else as far away from her as she needed them to be chalk it up to emotional exhaustion but she didnt have the energy to juggle her conflicting desires it was time to compartmentalize there were evildoers walking the earth who badly needed to be dealt some justice and stella knew she was the only one who could keep dealing it until they got chrissys boy back what are you going to do now she asked letting her eyelids slide down setting her lower lip aquiver ive been out to talk to roy deans parents he said they seem to think their sons just taken the boy for a little fatherson time you know camping fishing like that funny stella said frowning as much as her stitches allowed he never struck me as the type well they say their boys quite the outdoorsman theyre getting me directions to a little cabin he sometimes stays in down near the lake had to be the trailer stella thought what else you got im planning to call on some people roy deans evidently been doing business with he said evidently hes been dealing in auto scrap plus ive got mike and ian out talking to roy deans neighbors his friends his parents were on the lookout for his car but so far nothing were looking into phone records you knowall the usual stella nodded just what she expected you must be exhausted she said turning up the sweet in her voice running around all night im so sorry to have caused you all this trouble i guess you best get home and get a little sleep before you start your day goat frowned only one needing to rest here is you i spoke to dr guevera by the way stella and she says shes keeping you another night to keep an eye on your head they dont take these concussions lightly stella nodded keeping her expression as neutral as she could dumbassesdidnt they realize shed taken her own concussions plenty seriously waking up on the kitchen floor or sprawled across her bed blood congealing from where ollied split her lip or busted her ear wondering if this would be the time she couldnt avoid the hospital shed been lucky that way if you could call it luckit had seemed like luck at the time because ollie had never actually broken anything she never had to go to the emergency room and make up excuses for why her arm or shin was bent at a strange angle she never had to pretend to have fallen down the stairs or tripped over a laundry basket no she dealt with all her injuries the oldfashioned wayat home with a bottle of rubbing alcohol and a stack of bandages and a hell of a lot of covergirl concealer so one more concussion didnt scare her all that bad thank you very much but there wasnt any reason to share that information with goat yes i suppose youre right she said meekly im actually feeling pretty tired myself to be honest maybe ill see if theyll give me a few more of those tylenol and take a nap that sounds like a good plan ill tell chrissy to come on back on my way out so you all can have a short visit goat stood then hesitated gazing down at her ill call you later in the day let you know what i come up with i dont want you worrying were going to find that little boy i dont doubt it stella said goat stared at her a moment longer and then moving so fast she couldnt even jerk out of the way he slid one big callused hand under the thin blankets and ran his hand up her leg letting his touch linger somewhere north of her knee tell you what dusty i think you best get your money back for that wax job youre about as hairy as a polecat chrissy took one look at stella and dropped her purse on the floor her hands flew up to her face and she let out a little choked gasp oh shit stella look what they done to you so she was frightening people now stella guessed she should be grateful that goat had handled his horror so well just give me a mirror will you she demanded not bothering to cover her crankiness chrissy nodded and blinked tears away she picked up her purse and rummaged around in it coming up with a plastichandled makeup mirror but she didnt give it to stella right away instead she sat gingerly on the side of the bed and patted stella gently on the top of her head and then on the shoulder so softly it practically tickled id hug you but im afraid id just hurt you worse she said miserably oh come on chrissy ill be fine you and i both knowwell we know were tougher than people give us credit for right chrissy paused and mulled that over then nodded decisively and leaned down for a big hug smashing stellas tender ribs and pulling at the stitches but stella let her and even tried to hug back a little when chrissy finally pulled away she handed stella her little purse mirror it was so small that stella couldnt see her whole face at once and after squinting at herself for a few minutes she figured that was probably a blessing she couldnt get over how darn colorful she was two black eyesbut the flesh was actually shades of purple and gray and a sort of green a rainbow of bruising all around the sockets the stitches were done with neat little knots in black suture thread and the path they traced made a sweeping curve so it almost looked like some kind of tattoo like the ones made to look like barbed wire that the kids were so fond of the shaved part of her scalp was almost a perfect square and stella couldnt figure out whether that was a good thing or not she tried pushing her hair over the patch to hide it but the curls sprung right back the way they were leaving the bald flesh exposed shed have to work at that with a little gel or something one thing she hadnt noticed earlierher bottom lip was split and swollen and stuck out all puffy like a moviestar collagen job gone terribly wrong jeez she handed the mirror back and tried for a smile which hurt like a bitch guess im not going to get on american idol anytime soon chrissy shook her head slowly then she took a breath and leaned in her eyebrows lowered and a flush of pink washed over her cheeks we need to get out and get those sumbitches she said fiercely stella if they gonna do you like this why i dont think theyre just babysitting little tucker oh stella said oh uh chrissy see i havent maybe told you every last thing ive found out whatwhat do you mean no no calm down stella said as she saw chrissy tense up the tendons in her jaw standing out dont tell me to calm down stella its my no listen some of its you know maybe good news i mean not good but er not terrible stella you tell me and you tell me right now she inched over on the mattress a bit her hip bumping painfully against stellas aching side well where to start with the most hopeful possibility stella guessed you know that darla gal that called she was talking about having something of roy deans over at her house wouldnt say what it was but the way she was carrying on i got to thinking it might just be tucker tucker shes got my baby boy over her house chrissy said voice escalating incredulously whats she done with him no now i didnt say for sure he was over there just that the way she was carrying on saying have roy dean meet her there today because she didnt want the responsibility forum whatever it is he left there well shoot lets go but now see the problem is she didnt say where she lived or what her last name was i have a feeling i might have a description of her seeing as it might be a woman somebody saw roy dean with the other day how do we find out hang on sugar let me tell you the rest first this darlas expecting roy dean at noon shes gonna get us instead we just got to figure out where shes at but theres a little more i need to tell you like what chrissy demanded well you know how you said pitt was visiting at your place when roy dean came over and you went out in the back yard for that hibachi and then he was gone when you got back in the house yeah and how he thinks tuckers his baby and all well sure but like i done told you theres no way hed take tucker he aint crazy that way hes all follow the rules and shit hed never honey i went over to his place yesterday he wasnt there so i broke in now dont get mad mad its a little late for mad isnt it stella anyway i dont much care what you do or who you do it to if it means we get tucker whatall did you see not much really he sure is a neat and tidy kind of fella there wasnt a whole lot to look at but i did see one thing that made me think he might have um taken a trip of some sort she told chrissy about the cat the huge mounded supply of food and the full water dish i always hated that cat chrissy wailed as though the cat had been the one to abduct tucker well now we dont know if it means anything at all stella said hastily maybe he just went i dont know visiting a friend or down to branson for a few days or something like that chrissy inhaled a big breath let her shoulders slump and blinked a few times you got any other ideas about who mighta took my boy any more bad news you aint told me yet she finally asked in a subdued voice only the worst news of all stella considered everything shed withheld from chrissy so far and came to the conclusion that shed messed up big keeping everything to herself had done nothing to prepare chrissy for this moment when she needed to hear the entire truth yes she said and forced herself to look chrissy in the eye these guys the ones i think beat me up the ones roy deans been working for well theyre very bad men chrissy sucked in breath how bad stella mulled over possible responses chrissy was not as it had turned out as dumb as stella had first assumed not by a long shot and now the girl had come within spitting distance of understanding the true dangers of the situation like mafia bad drugdealin bad crazy stone killer bad stella thought but didnt add and these guys that done this to you last night chrissy demanded they might know where tucker is i mean you think somehow they got tucker or something stella resisted the urge to bite her busted lip and gave a little nod if it aint darla and it aint pitt that took him then yes i think theres a chance they might know something that roy dean might have gone to them and i dont know looked for a place to stay or or or what why would roy dean take a baby into that mess that was the part that made no sense at all the part that kept stella hopeful that answers were far more simple chrissy nodded again and stella could tell she was thinking hard did you get a good look at them she asked her voice tight no dear im afraid not there was a few of them and i was stupid i didnt take the precautions i should have yeah ill say why didnt you tell me what you were fixing to do sheriff says you went over to that pond by yourself jiminy stella i would never have let you go off on your own like that sorry stella managed wont happen again you bet your sweet petunia it wont chrissy said and to stellas great surprise she leaned over and pressed the button on the bed so the frame started to rise electronically pitching her forward and shifting her painfully upright heywhat are you doing girl getting you out of here what do you think we got to find that darla come on we only got a couple of hours stella had as a matter of fact been thinking along the same lines but she hadnt quite expected to be heaved out of the bed okay but i cant just get up and walk out of here with this robe thing flapping around my bare butt no stella i know that dont be an idiot i got you some clothes in here i figured they might have kept your old ones like for evidence or something plus i know sometimes they cut em off of victims she dug in the gym bag and pulled out a pair of cornflower blue stretch pants and a matching shortsleeved top that had a deep v neck with embroidery around the edges as eager as she was to be on their way stella regarded the clothes with dread oh shit where did you get those things in your bottom drawer why my sister sent them stella hedgedwhich gracellen had for her birthday after stella lied and told her she was a size ten they just shrunk in the dryer is all well we dont have time to go back chrissy said so you might as well get dressed she handed the stack of clothes a fresh change of underwear on top to stella and pulled a pair of sandals out of the bag stella started tugging off her gown and eyed chrissy carefully where were you thinking wed be going once you bust me out of here well i guess we dont have no choice but to start with what we know now do we i cant help noticing that im hearing a lot of we here darlin stella said telling the girl the truth was one thing letting her join in the search with all its risks and dangers was another entirely did i miss somethingdid you go getting your pi license while i was out cold at that chrissy straightened and fixed her with a glare that practically threw sparks i dont really appreciate you being all sarcastic stella hardesty she said coldly bad enough you didnt tell me what was really going on tucker being my baby and all like i couldnt handle it or something shame on you im his mother well cats out of the bag now i guess so you aint going to be able to get rid of me no more were in this together sides last time i looked you didnt have no license either and plus you done way more lawbreakin than i plan on stella paused with the shapeless garment pulled down around her waist and looked chrissy over carefully the rebuke was the most impassioned speech shed ever heard out of the girl and it occurred to stella that she might have been treating her more like a child than an adult she chose her words very carefully chrissy youre right i have kept things from you and as my client you have a right to expect better i promise ill be straight with you from now on and im coming with you chrissy said in the same nononsense tone well make a plan and then im coming along i want my baby back and once i get him ill help you whup thesethesedevils i dont know if i aint asking stella chrissy said with an edge to her voice that made stella take notice silently she hooked her bra on and slipped into the tshirt tugging it over her belly trying to stretch the fabric a little larger chrissy wasnt asking she wasnt going to be denied every fiber of stellas being resisted the idea of taking the girl along stella worked alone and even more important she didnt risk womens lives not anymore not since lorelle im happy to have you come along to this darlas place she said softly and i dont suppose hunting down pitts really going to involve any special dangers but this other bunchtheyre ruthless there are at least four armed men that we know about maybe more there are two of us yeah but we got the advantage yeah how do you figure first of all they aint expecting us chrissy said calmly and secondwere moms were wired special to be fearless they have no idea what kind of hell we can raise when we get provoked aint that right stella stella opened her mouth to speak but realized she had little to add well she said i guess thats that i can promise you though this aint going to be any walk in the park its gonna be plenty dangerous and someone might end up getting hurt even worse than this stella chrissy scolded youre talking to a woman who married roy dean shaw i got myself hurt every single day i think i can handle what a bunch of amateurs want to dish out dont you at that stella couldnt help but smile sorry youre right she said now get on out of my way so i can put my pants on with chrissy playing lookout they were able to slip out of the hospital room and down to the elevator without anyone noticing stella left a note for the nurse written on the back of the dinner menu she hadnt bothered to fill out sorry i had to go ill be back to settle up asap ps dont worry im feeling fine best regards s hardesty on the ground floor stella started to gain confidence they went out the front door without attracting any attention in the parking lot she was surprised to see her jeep sheriff had one of his guys bring it on home from the golf course chrissy said they took the car keys out of your pocket and i figured with what all we got ahead of us it might make more sense to bring your car than mine hope you dont mind nogood thinking stella said she wondered if goat had noticed her little lockbox there was a reason she used a combination lock on ita key did no good you go ahead and drive im still a little fuzzy from them happy pills they gave me chrissy slid into the drivers seat and turned to stella well i guess this is my first lesson she said how do you find someone when you dont know much about em you know someone down at the courthouse or something can look up all the darlas in the county stella snorted she wishedthat would be a handy contact to have no but i got something about as good head us over to the popeyes whyyou got a hankerin for biscuits or something no youll see from the way chrissy lurched out of the parking lot stella figured she was still getting used to the handling a thought flashed through her mindollie would have had a fit to see chrissy snugging the tires over the curband she laughed it hurt but it felt good too whats so funny chrissy asked cutting her a glance nothing i just didnt expect to be chauffeured around today well get used to it we got to save your strength stella closed her eyes and settled back and wondered what exactly chrissy expected her to do they got my gun she said after a moment oh i got that took care of chrissy said she reached behind and patted a cardboard box sitting on the backseat picked up a few things from my folks house go ahead take a look stella reached for the box the type used to hold a ream of paper and pulled it onto her lap it was surprisingly heavy she lifted the lid and found herself staring at an eclectic arsenal of weapons lying on a pile of old rags was a grimy blocky old steel handgun there was also a wickedlooking big hunting knife with a hook two smaller knives a couple of holsters and three boxes of cartridges one open and half empty holy shit chrissy stella said your folks some kind of survivalists or something fixing to hunker down for the big standoff with the fbi chrissys face hardened and she didnt look at stella i dont appreciate that she said after a moment my family aint much but they aint criminals well i mean they get into stuff here and there but they aint that kind of criminalthe crazy kind sorry hon stella said hastily i didnt mean to offend you its just you got to admit this is a hell of a lot of firepower and i wasnt exactly expecting it chrissy shrugged well the gun thats an old soviet makarov my uncle fred brought it back from vietnam daddy used to let us kids shoot it sometimes when he took us out for rifle practice they didnt let anyone bring these back stella said picking up the handgun it was heavier than it looked with a star carved in the pistol grip and a simple safety catch at the rear of the slide there were two magazines in the box both empty chrissy snorted you didnt know my uncle fred i dont think he cared much what he was allowed to do or not do he sposedly smuggled that gun back wrapped up in a hollowedout bible i think daddy just keeps it around for sentimental reasons it aint been fired in ages yeahit looks it too nothing a little solvent wont take off that other stuff is just mostly for fun you know things my brothers pick up here and there and then they get tired of em and leave em lyin around and they end up in mom and dads attic your brothers have an interesting idea of fun stella said putting the gun back and hefting the biggest knife in her hand i wouldnt be talkin smart stella chrissy said people say the same thing about you besides you should see all the junk i didnt bring she lowered the knife carefully back into the box and considered chrissy for a minute the girls ramrod straight posture the firm set of her chin this was a different girl from the one whod spent most of the last two days lying on stellas couch this new chrissy had a hell of a lot more backbone and she sure seemed a lot less inclined to take any guff i think i might need to apologize stella said carefully thought you already did that when we agreed how im going to be your partner on the rest of this thing yeah buti think i need to maybe say im sorry for underestimating you chrissy i do believe you got some iron in you chrissy said nothing for a moment keeping her eyes fixed on the road ahead and then she nodded all right i accept your apology you know what i didnt know i had it in me either i kind of wonder now what if id got this kind of determined back when roy dean was around i mean right now im so mad i feel like i could just beat the shit out of him myself i imagine you could stella agreed softly vengeance was a funny thing you got a little taste of it and it brought out things in you that you never knew were there what was it they said vengeance is a bitter drink stella didnt much mind she drank hers straight up and now it looked as if shed found herself a drinking buddy hold on to all that determination she said were gonna need it chrissy coasted across two lanes without checking the rearview mirror when the popeyes came into view ignoring the outraged laying on of horns stella flinched then forced herself to relax risk was inherent in her business after all and she wasnt really in a position to micromanage at the moment chrissy managed to align the jeep more or less straight in a parking spot when they walked in the doors of the restaurant she took one look around and smacked herself in the forehead well dang why didnt i think a them stella youre a genius oh now stella said modestly ive been doing this a while youre just starting outyoull get there yeah but the green hat ladies just then novella glazer spotted them and hollered out a greeting her tablemates turned and followed suit as chrissy and stella made their way over purses of the large and floppy style favored by older ladies were moved out of the way and the remains of the mealplastic plates of chicken bones and a smattering of biscuit crumbswere stacked and shoved into the trash oh lord above stella what happened to you lola brennan said placing a hand over her heart and squinting up at stellas stitched and bruised face oh nothing muchjust took a tumble in the shop ill be fine you ought to be home in bed shirlette castro scolded you must have good reason to be out and about i dont guess this is a social call stella had consulted with the green hat ladies before when she needed information one of them had even been a client but that was hushhush her husband had needed only a light touch to be reminded that a foul mouth and ungracious commentary were not welcome in the house and she didnt care for anyone to know about their past troubles it was a funny thing about that generation stella reflected they kept their own problems to themselves but they loved to discuss everyone elsesso much so that this bunch of septuaand octogenarians gathered for an early lunch and gossip at popeyes nearly every day i believe you all know chrissy shaw stella said as they sat down greetings were exchanged you ladies sure look nice today chrissy said i do like those hats the hats were bright green caps embroidered with the john deere logo gracie lewiss husband ran a feed and supply store and the deere folks sent a regular supply of swag his way when his wife and her friends caught wind of the red hat ladies trend being a thrifty type he proposed a way to save some money and stand out in the crowded field of mature ladies clubs i am surely glad you got shut of that roy dean gracie said if you dont mind me sayin so oh not at all chrissy said she twisted her glosssticky lips into a thoughtful frown and added i guess i might ought to have done it awhile ago im not sure where my good sense went the ladies made sympathetic clucking sounds oh now we all have us a confused spell now and again gracie said specially when it comes to the gentlemen you wouldnt be the first to pick a rotten apple off the tree novella added stella laid out an assortment of facts about roy deans wandering ways as the ladies took turns patting and cooing over chrissy it was probably a misunderstanding she said but did any of the ladies know any darlas in the surrounding area especially skinny youngish ones with blond ponytails oh my yes lola piped up she was a tiny thing and her hat practically swallowed the top half of her head nearly obscuring her eyes there was that one over in harrisonville by the strawberry stand ungainly thing wasnt she piped up shirlette large bust unfortunate overbite oh mercy no youre thinking of that other gal out that way took up with her aunts boyfriend what was her name dora doreen something its a shame lindas not here novella said her husband hails from harrisonvilleshed know shes down with her usual unfortunate troubles she added in a stage whisper to stella and chrissy oh for heavens sake lola said you can say hemorrhoid novella it aint a bad word well novella said primly i suppose thats fine for some we could call her shirlette said pulling an iphone out of her purse and peering at it over her eyeglasses she tapped at it with her finger a few times and held up a finger shes not moving too quick today she said if you know what i mean oh linda how are you dear shirlette had the volume on the iphone up high enough that everyone heard lindas voice though stella couldnt make out what she was saying is that right oh im sorry listen guess who stopped by who no stella hardesty and she brought that darling chrissy shaw remember one of the lardner girls thats right the pretty one anyway do you know a darla out harrisonville way young gal blond yes ask him shirlette drummed her fingers on the table as all six ladies listened to the sounds of conversation on the other end of the connection is that like it sounds here novella gimme a pen yeah go ahead linda mmmhmmm okay ill tell her no ill tell you later what look linda its stella whos asking you catch my drift she dont have time to be waiting for this information yes ill call you back she dabbed at the phone and slipped it back in her purse well she said breathlessly there is a darla over in harrisonville darla merton thats right lola said snapping her fingers all the ladies leaned in and stella found herself following suit thats the one kind of a loose one if i recall a regular tramp is what linda said shirlette agreed she might as well install a revolving door on her bedroom shes out on dixon road past the mobil station you take a soft right and go over a dip and therell be a dirt bike track on the left she dont know the house number but its the yellowbrick ranch on the rightits a duplex and shes on the right side i know where that mobil is chrissy said gathering up her purse please thank linda when you see her stella said i wish we could stay and catch up but you have important work to do gracie said winking you dont have to tell us well god bless yall and stella get to healin you hear after quick goodbyes they hurried back to the jeep stella moving as fast as she could chrissy hurtled out of the parking lot its twelve minutes to noon she said we got to haul ass it was pretty much a straight shot to harrisonville down county road and stella gripped the dashboard most of the way as chrissy pushed the little jeep hard at the mobil she barely slowed down and stella was surprised the wheels didnt lift up as chrissy took the corner the yellowbrick duplex came up fast on the right and as she screeched to a stop the dash clock read now hold one second stella said slapping a hand down on chrissys arm to prevent her from bolting out of the car you know shes expecting roy dean i dont care if shes expecting tim mcgraw what im sayin is we can make this easier if we start out reasonable just stay calm and cool and help her see were offering a winwin all around here and then i call the bitch out if she gives me any shit well okay chrissy wrenched her arm away and got out of the jeep and stella had to hustle to keep up across the burnedout lawn and onto a cracked concrete porch chrissy laid into the door pounding with a clenched fist when it suddenly burst open a large man popped into view and chrissy went flying inexplicably floorwards only when she was laid out on the carpet with the large man sitting on her chest did stella see the second man more of a kid really who had taken chrissy down by throwing himself at her legs and yanking them out from under her ow chrissy said git off me shit dad thats a girl the younger man said scuttling away crabstyle before jumping to his feet the first attacker had apparently come to pretty much the same conclusion because he lumbered off chrissy hell he said sounding more annoyed than sorry stella offered chrissy a hand and hauled her up the effort ratcheting up the ache through her ribs you okay she asked chrissy glared at the two men who now that they were standing sheepishly side by side could be seen to be clearly related with the same blockish heads and thin lips and fleshy eyelids she rubbed at the small of her back and cricked her head one way and then the other ill live she said sourly before turning on her attackers wheres my baby where you got tucker the men looked at each other huh asked the younger one look here the older one said you kind of got in the way of a operation in progress theres someone coming along any minute now that needs a major attitude adjustment so if you dont mind we need to get ready for him i think thats my ex youre talkin about chrissy said roy dean he aint comin he sent you in his place the young one said clearly agitated at the notion he looked like a man who had his heart set on delivering a beating no he did not hes done disappeared look alls i want is my boy and then ill go wheres darla that aint any of your business the older one said stepping forward angrily i think it is stella kept her voice calm but she drew up to her full height and glared at him are you her father he hesitated only for a second before saying yes i am bill merton he turned to chrissy and added your ex has been treatin my girl pretty poorhe needs his ass kicked chrissy sighed i dont doubt it and i dont much care what you do to him but way i heard it is he mighta dropped off my little boy here and left him the men glanced at each other clearly mystified i dont know anything about no baby junior said call your sister the elder merton demanded junior pulled a phone out of his pocket and dialed im going to go look around chrissy muttered her disappointment clear from the slumping of her shoulders merton started to object let her go stella snapped she wont hurt nothing as chrissy made her way down the darkened catsmelling hall of the house stella listened impatiently to half a phone call for the second time in an hour darla the boy barked into the phone roy dean leave some kinda baby with you no he aint been by yet theres these two womeni said he aint come by you deaf or something whats her name he directed the latter at stella jerking a thumb down the hall where chrissy could be heard opening and closing doors thats chrissy shaw roy deans ex stella said chrissy shaw roy deans ex the boy repeated into the phone her little boys gone missing and she thinks roy dean had im youre sure hell i dont know im just askin well dont get mad at me i didnt do nothing darla darla im giving dad the phone he handed the phone to his father you talk to her shes goin all pms on me darla jane merton said in a voice that didnt invite argument you settle down now girl roy dean apparently aint comin no i dont believe they found him to tell him the message now you come on home and well figure out what to do mmmhmmm thats right love you he handed the phone back to his son as chrissy came shuffling back into the room looking like she wanted to hit somebody herself tucker aint here look merton said im sorry we took you down like that just we were expecting that nogood roy dean hes been beatin up on my daughter which i dont take kindly to i dont guess i blame you chrissy said though you could have looked out the front window or something and seen i wasnt him we did look junior protested we saw your car pull in but then we had to get in ready position amateurs stella thought shed lain in wait dozens of times in alleys behind bushes in cars outside office buildingseven in a mens room once or twiceand never had she taken down the wrong guy but thats what made her the professional that she was fastidious planning careful preparation flawless executionwhen you made a career out of delivering justice there was no room for error she knew there were lots of folks whod figure that working outside the law stella might have flexible standards and it was true in some waysbut not when it came to getting the job done she didnt tolerate near misses or botched reconnaissance or loose ends it made the job hardera lot harderbut no one ever changed the world by taking the easy way out so this thing that roy dean was supposed to have left here she said was that all just a trick the elder merton snorted theres a box of his clothes and shit out in the garage but i expect what hes missing most is them illegal drugs he left in my daughters home he dragged out the syllables in illlegal to show his distaste even as his son rolled his eyes heavenward in a grand show of impatience aint but a couple a nasty smokeddown blunts dad and that mess of paraphernalia merton huffed glaring at his son and chrissy in turn as though he suspected them of being in cahoots them papers and clippers and im sure i dont know what all else my daughter aint got no use for that sort of thing dont look at me i dont want none of it chrissy said listen up sugar stella said tucker isnt here these men dont know where he is and it sounds like darla doesnt know either im afraid this might just be a dead end chrissy nodded frowning all right she said never taking her eyes off the merton men were going to leave now but if you find out anythingand i do mean anythingabout my little boy you call me right away cause if you dont i will find out and i will hunt you down now get me something to write on as chrissy wrote their cell phone numbers on the back of a takeout menu underlining the digits three times and circling them stella noted that any traces of the earlier chrissythe one who battled her fears with nothing stronger than oreo cookieswere long gone with two avenues left to explorepitt and the hornets nest of corruption brewing in the northeast end of townstella made an executive decision as they got back in the jeep and chrissy pulled away from the curb at what was for her a sedate pace sweet pea i think it might be time to let the law do its thing she said if pitts got tucker the longer we wait the further he could be taking him youre saying pitt wants to keep tucker for himself like that well im just saying we got to consider all the scenarios here thats one of them chrissy frowned doubtfully i seen them tapes what was that england or something where they got that little girl in the grocery store and snipped off all her hair in the bathroom and put her in boy clothes but stella thats over there pitt wouldnt ever do like that how can you be sure chrissy well i know him is all hes tryin to court me to death stella tried to figure out a polite way to ask how sneaking over for noontime quickies counted as courting or if there were some other romantic behaviors she wasnt aware of but lets say i mean heres pitt wanting you to ah to date him again and on the other hand theres a baby he thinks is his and we know how that can get a mans spurs up right so if you had to guess sugar and meaning no disrespect which would you say is front and center in pitts mind you or tucker chrissy slowed to a few miles an hour to avoid a yellow dog lying in the street snoozing in the afternoon sun he wants the whole package stella me n tucker and the white picket fence shit idve been tempted too cause i am fond of that man but i just know myself a little too well you see what i mean uh not exactly well just that you know how some men scratch your itch a little but they still leave you feeling restless and then theres the ones that do it for you and then some you know like a little bit a what they got goes a long way they just kind of shiver you all over inside outside and twice on sundays see pitts the first kind of man and thats how i ended up steppin out on him when we was married and i just know id do it again she shrugged i guess thats the gift of being in your late twenties is you get mature you know yourself hell if youve managed that already you must be some kind of genius stella exclaimed it took me until i was almost fifty well youre smart in other ways chrissy said kindly driving lazily across the center line as she turned to give stella a reassuring pat on the knee chrissy whod barely let the needle drop below eighty on the way over was negotiating the streets of harrisonville like a blind old lady but how do you explain him leaving town then what you saidhe could be visiting someone or catching a show in branson or something course that was back when you were still shuttin me out of this here investigation so i dont guess you even believed them poor excuses when you said em ouch the girl had a point and stella swallowed hard guilt weighing heavy on her there still might be a logical reason tell you what lets just save that for now what im worried about is you said if the law gets on this and word gets back to them kansas city gangsters and roy dean is involved with all that then it could be even more dangerous for tucker if hes with roy dean well there was an uncomfortable amount of truth in what chrissy said stella still couldnt piece together a logical reason why roy dean would have taken tucker but if hed done something stupid and pissed off the mafia it wouldnt matter if hed taken the hope diamond or a can of pork and beans into their midst either way he wasnt likely to come out again and if that was the case their only hope of getting the boy was to somehow get inside their inner circle and take him back themselves i guess if youre sure about this me and you are going to have to go turn over some rocks what sort of rocks ugly nasty ones the rocks rolling around at bennings only look here chrissy i think theres every chance in the world ive poked a mad dog in the eye that dont have anything to do with tucker i mean even if roy dean took him through there on his way out of town theres no reason those men would want anything to do with a little boy yeah i guess but i know roy dean he wouldnt be able to stay away from a bunch of losers like that probly made him feel all important mr big man without warning she hit the gas and they screeched forward down the couple of blocks leading back to the state road a man working the front of his lawn with an edger jumped out of the way just in time as she barreled past him where are we going exactly stella asked as chrissy turned the wrong way down just a quick stop at walmart were gonna need some supplies if were going to bust into that place butbut walmarts the other way not that walmart were going to the other one over in casey stellas head throbbed and she gently massaged her temples avoiding the bruised and stitched areas of her face as well as she could i almost hate to ask but what are we shopping for exactly chrissy glanced over at stella an allbusiness expression on her face clothes for sneaking around in i figure we got to get back over to bennings tonight after dark and look around best we wear black so we dont stand out or camo maybe they make practically everything in camo these days you know oh stella had to hand it to chrissy for jumping right in to the details which were still fuzzy in stellas own mind of course chrissy had the advantage of not having a concussion so well head out there tonight yeah well we need to go when theyre closed right i mean its not like theyre going to be happy to see you again specially since its probably them as beat you up you think we ought to get some of those night vision glasses i dont know i think theyre pretty expensive yeah thanks to our stupid government chrissy said disgusted they pay six hundred dollars for a toilet seat they probably want like a thousand bucks for those glasses stella was lost how does the government figure into what walmart charges oh come on stella dont be naïve the government doesnt want us to defend ourselves or bear arms or anything like that they put a special tax on things that its our constitutional right to buy and then the money goes straight into their pockets or they use it for all those programs where they spy on whats in your trash and read your mail its truei saw a special on it uh yeah stella decided not to argue she was still a little lightheaded thats too bad i do have a good flashlight though good cause we dont want to buy too much because the checker might notice i was kind of thinking we want to draw as little attention as we can to ourselves here thats why were driving over to the walmart in casey you know good thinking sugar stella said plus theres an arbys near there isnt there chrissy perked up and nodded yes i think there is i sure love that roast beef dont you the way they slice it up so nice and thin my sister sue wont eat it because she says its all parts mashed up fine and then reformed but i say why thats the same as spam aint it and everybody likes spam that they do stella said smiling despite the pain in her busted lip that they do stella figured she needed to go long on iron and protein so she had a super roast beef sandwich it was time to quit messing around and treat the situation like what it was serious within the hour they were back in stellas kitchen stella laid old towels on the kitchen table and got down her shoebox of guncleaning supplies from a cabinet over the refrigerator she had brought the ruger in from the jeep it was already clean but it felt good to break it down and go through the motions across the table chrissy carefully disassembled the makarov laying the filthy parts out in a neat row she picked up the cleaning rod and the solvent and went to work on the receiver humming softly jesus chrissy anybody ever clean their firearms over at your house sure they do the ones they use but i didnt want to take daddys everyday guns you know on account of he might need em and all stella wondering what constituted the need for an everyday handgun remembered her pledge to be more respectful of the girl and kept her mouth shut you clean guns much she asked instead of course chrissy said rolling her eyes daddy made all us girls learn to take care of the rifles before he let us shoot squirrels we had a couple of marlins and they never had a speck on em we used to have contests to see who could get them took apart and put back together the quickest that was quite a vision stella imagined the little tykes lined up at the supper table waiting their turn at the guns a row of lardner girls with blond pigtails and rosy cheeks well then i guess ill let you clean that thing up after that were gonna go out and shoot a few cans sound all right yeah for a while they worked in silence stella went over the ruger with a tiny utility brush and then polished it with a silicone cloth stella chrissy said after a while mmmhmm you got anything to snack on i have to tell you im just a little bit nervous and when i get nervous i get hungry you know stella knew she was the same way she also got hungry when she was worried or pissed off about something or bored she smiled how about i make us some popcorn oh thatd be perfect stella got out her mothers old soup pot added the oil and a good layer of kernels put a stick of butter in the microwave to melt and shook the pot when the corn started popping inside she tossed the popcorn with the butter and a few good shakes of salt and set the bowl in the middle of the table as the two of them sat munching on the popcorn and sipping ginger ale and cleaning the guns stella noticed she was feeling something that she hadnt felt for a long time the scent of gun oil mingled with the buttery popcorn aroma and the silence between her and chrissy was companionable stella closed her eyes for a moment and remembered other times shed sat around this very same table it had been her parents kitchen table on sundays stella liked to sit with her dad while he shined his shoes before church handing him the rags and the tins of polish and the big brush happy to be his assistant in such an important chore later her parents got a new table and gave the old one to stella and ollie noelle used to sit at the table for her afterschool snack coloring with her crayons her little legs swinging not long enough to touch the floor when noelle was in high school stella waited up for her to come back from dates with schooner the high school boyfriend stella wished shed held on to the one noelle liked before she developed a taste for losers they would sit at the table and sip tea and noelle would describe every little detail of the pizza theyd shared or the movie they saw and stella would listen and try to hold on to every moment knowing her baby was growing up now she was at this same table with chrissy and as much as she missed her own daughter she was happy to have the girls company the thought that she was dragging chrissy into the midst of a bunch of crazed armed criminals hit her in the gutfollowed fast by a memory of lorelle or rather of lorelles feet white and bloodless and puckered from all that time in the water floating just below the murky surface in the rain barrel you know she said voice shaky as chrissy scoured out the spare magazine with a cotton patch you dont have to come along tonight i can do this by myself chrissy snorted like hell im not staying here its justyou know theres a chance things could blow up you should think about what youre getting into i guess i know enough roy deans done something stupider than i ever thought he could got himself involved with guys mean enough that theyll beat up an old lady oh i mean not old old but you know jeez chrissy im fifty not eighty you are chrissy whistled and stella felt a little better no kidding my moms like fortyeight and youre in way better shape than her she cant probably even run two blocks without sitting down to rest well thanks stella brightened a little the first time shed gone jogging in an old pair of keds and baggy leggings shed made it halfway around the block before she had to stop and walk home wheezing the entire way now she was up to tenmile runs through town and out dusty farm roads she might not look it but she was in the best shape of her life which was a good thing since she was planning to take on a bunch of guys who were a lot more freshminted yeah so what do you think it is anyway drugs probly drugs seems like thats what people get craziest over stella considered whether she ought to tell chrissy everything she knew she owed it to the girl really it wasnt right to leave her in the dark listen honey when i went over to talk to benning yesterday i had a little more than a feeling about whatall he was up to see the night before when i said i was going to lovie lees divorce party you didnt chrissy said i should have figured stella told chrissy what arthur junior had said about the car theft chrissy who had finished cleaning and wiping off all the gun parts and was working on putting them back together stopped working and listened with her head shaking slowly back and forth figures dont it do you know roy dean still had all his matchbox cars in this big old paint bucket in the garage threw out my box of bridesmaid dresses because he said we didnt have room but we got to keep those stupid cars boys will be boys i guess stella shrugged boys will be assholes more like chrissy said she held up the reassembled gun and turned it this way and that gleaming under the kitchen light okay stella she said im locked and loaded show me something i can shoot the shit out of six stella was relieved to discover that not only did chrissy know how to handle the makarov she wasnt a bad shot they drove out to the back side of an old peach orchard the trees so ancient and gnarled they didnt give up much fruit anymore and set up a row of fresca cans on a folding table she brought from home then they started shooting when chrissy missed it wasnt by much the ruger felt good in stellas hand it had been her fathers personal firearm and aside from target shooting it had spent most of its days locked in buster colliers gun cabinet along with his hunting rifles stella had always thought it was pretty with its ivory grip on the rare occasions that her father let her hold it hed cupped her hand in his bigger stronger ones and made sure her fingers didnt go anywhere near the trigger even with the cylinder empty and the safety on buster had died of a heart attack when he was still in his forties hed walked her down the aisle but he hadnt lived to see what a monster ollie turned out to be maybe it was better that way buster might have killed ollie himself and stella doubted whether the law would have been as lenient with him as it had been with her picking off fresca cans with her fathers gun stella wondered what he would have thought of the career shed stumbled into she was certain both her parents would have understood about ollie and theyd always preached a duty to lend a hand to those in need surely no one was more in need than stellas clients the ones society couldntor wouldntprotect the ones who resorted to begging and promising and praying as their only weapons against the horror in their own homes when stella started helping these women she remembered how her father dressed so carefully each morning putting on the missouri highway patrol uniform shirts her mother pressed and starched the heavy belt that contained the radio and the summons book and finally the gun buster had only drawn it twice in the line of duty and he hadnt fired either time but it was a powerful symbol of order for stella that gun went back to the highway patrol but the ruger was hers now the ivory was slickcool in her hand she kept her arm firm against the recoil sighted carefully and fired over and over the smell of the guns firing was acrid on the air burning her nostrils but she breathed it in hungrily anyway target practice had a calming effect on her and she did it regularly even if shed never fired a gun into a mans flesh and hoped shed never have to she and chrissy settled into a rhythm without speaking taking turns sighting down the cans and blowing them off the table stopping to reload now and then or to stack the cans back on the table when the cans were nothing but shredded scraps of metal stella and chrissy gathered them up in a plastic trash bag stella had brought from home guess youll do she told chrissy grinning you aint too bad either for an instant they just looked at each other stella was praying they wouldnt have to shoot when it came down to it she figured chrissy was doing the same at home stella defrosted a couple of rib eyes and microwaved some potatoes they ate on tv trays out on the back porch saying little as evening settled down and the sky turned pink and red you probably shot people before chrissy said as they dug into bowls of rainbow sherbet with cool whip and nilla wafers crumbled on top stella was silent for a while before answering honey i havent oh chrissy licked cool whip off her spoon a bit of the white stuff perched on her upper lip cause what they say and all i just thought and i wouldnt think no less of you either well thank you that means a lot to me but killing a man i mean it changes you she pausedthat was the first time shed actually admitted to anyone what shed done to ollie for a second she wished she could take the words back but it seemed important for chrissy to know its a oneway street you come out harder and maybe stronger but i hate to think what would happen to a person if they made it a regular habit i sure dont want to find out especially whenso far anywayit seems like theres other ways to handle men that need handled chrissy nodded i imagine i understand i mean if we ever do find roy dean i dont need him dead justjust really far away from me and maybe hurtin a little bit too or a lot even that wasnt a bad summary of what stella promised to deliver when she took on a new client she was relieved that the girl got it she didnt need a loose cannon for a partner she examined chrissy carefully she had pulled her hair back with a pair of orange plastic barrettes that featured butterflies with sparkly wings her eyelids were dusted with gold eye shadow she was wearing a scoop neck top that showed a bit of her creamy youthful cleavageand the edge of a fading ghost of a bruise chrissys eyes didnt look vulnerable but they didnt look bloodthirsty either they looked alert and hard and determined tucker dont have nobody else she said sometimes i wish id tried a little harder to find out who his daddy was you know i mean back then i thought i could do everything myself and mostly i have but right now it sure would be nice if there was some man out there who loved tucker as much as i do who was willing to do anything for him i know darlin stella did too she remembered sitting in church years ago watching other men with little ones on their laps or a hand on their sons shoulder and cursing herself for not picking out a better father for noelle but theres nothing a man can do here in this situation that you cant do you and me stella prayed that was true thought of goat of his broad shoulders and strong arms and determined jaw andshe couldnt help itof that heavy belt with his service revolver and cuffs and was sorely tempted to call him but goat couldnt go in the way they needed to which was to say sneaky and immediate honey stella said were going to use whatever tricks we need to until we find tucker even you know unlawfultype tricks yeah i know i just didnt want you to think that i was worried about getting caught or something i dont mind that i mean id mind i guess going to jail and all that but tucker comes first that made chrissy smile yeah right youd probably love getting arrested cause then sheriff jones would have to frisk you and all probly stripsearch you chrissy stella exclaimed shocked well come on youre all googly when hes around its like obvious i am no such thing stella could feel the blush creeping up her face oh please stella when hes around your voice goes up and you twist your hair and all that you might as well hang a sign around your neck says do me now hey it aint a bad thing is it i mean you got to signal to the man youre interested somehow dont you i guess you could come right out and ask him out but you probably want him to ask you first or something like that right i canti wouldntchrissy hes a law man for crying out loud im not my mas a baptist and my dad wont go in a church chrissy said she likes spicy food and he dont shes itching to go on one of those rv trips and he wants to go to branson but they get on good conflicts like the center of every good relationship you know im not talking about conflict here imlisten can we drop this subject we got to get ready dont we chrissy shrugged and gathered up the plates and glasses but she had a smirky little expression that didnt fade even as they worked side by side in the kitchen cleaning up stella retired to her room to prepare for the rest of the evening the stitches in her face itched fiercely and any lingering effects of the pain medication had long since dissipated she dabbed around the edges with the betadine swabs they gave her at the hospital and smoothed on a little antibiotic ointment at first she tried to apply it just to the worst spots but eventually she gave up squeezed out a glob and rubbed it all over her face then frowned at the result now she was puffy bruised scabbed and cursed with excess shine she considered dabbing on a little concealer and then realized how ridiculous the idea was pretty didnt really play into her agenda which led her to go over the plan essentially there wasnt one other than to get close enough to benning and funzi and the others to find out what they were up to yeah maybe theyd be sitting in a kiddie pool unarmed drinking root beer and talking about where theyd stashed tucker and the best way for someone to sneak up and take him back stella snorted with disgust as she pulled her hair back and secured it in a short ponytail with an elastic it was far more likely that she and chrissy were going to have to beat the information out of one of them with any luck theyd be able to separate one of the losers from the rest and somehow make him tell them everything all without causing the others to wonder where their friend had got off to and thats if funzi and his associates were even at bennings maybe it was bowling night or maybe theyd got tired of the local color and gone back up to kansas city they could try to get something out of benning and his skinnyass girlfriend if that was the case but if roy dean had somehow ended up bringing tucker into the mess and now the goons were gone tucker was probably gone with them stella didnt like thinking about that one bit no it would be better if it was another boys night at the play house she pulled on the pair of loose camo pants and black tshirt theyd bought at the walmart and laced up her hiking boots she surveyed herself in the mirror with her hair up and her mangled face she looked like a kid who couldnt decide what to be for halloween rambo or frankenstein disgusted she went to the garage and loaded up her backpack with supplies in addition to a pair of powerful led flashlights she packed a coil of nylon rope a utility knife a compact set of bolt cutters pliers her cell phone and bottled water chrissy was in the kitchen with the box shed brought from home strapping a shoulder holster over her own black tshirt it crossed in the back and bisected her generous bosom in the front she picked up the makarov gave it a fond little dusting with her fingertips and slipped it in the leather holder shed tucked her camo pant legs into pink hightop converse sneakers stella couldnt help grinning at the sight of her with her ample curves and blond ringlets spilling from her baseball hat she looked like a demolition cherub stella put on her own abdomen holster and patted the ruger after shooting it earlier it had become comfortable in her hands and she liked the feel of it close by you take the big knife she told chrissy rummaging in the box for an ankle holster she found one a velcro and nylon model that fit the knife as though it had been made for it what about you stella thought for a moment the other knives that chrissy brought were small and wouldnt have much stopping power and there didnt seem to be much point to bringing them especially as shed packed her utility knife stella had a sudden thought and went to noelles old room where she stored all her sewing supplies since she started her second business her sewing machine had been gathering dust but her best gingher scissors were in the tool caddy where she left them they were weighty in her hand a good pair of nineinch trimmers on a whim she grabbed her rotary cutter too she made sure the safety was on and slipped it into her pocket back in the kitchen she found another ankle holster an old leather one with buckles which she fitted carefully to her leg the scissors fit well in the sheath their handles sticking up in easy reach stella got a couple of advil considered them for a moment and added two more gulping them down with a glass of ginger ale bad chrissy asked watching her stella shrugged i dont feel the best i ever have she admitted but the smartins gone down mostly you look good chrissy said you got to be kidding no i aint you look like trouble with a capital t stella wiped her mouth on her arm and burped well then i guess i cant ask for much more right lets get this show on the road she was reaching for her backpack when the doorbell sounded stella froze and glanced at chrissy who was smoothing down her tshirt under the crossbody holster shit she said who the hell you got to answer it stella chrissy said urgently you dont want folks wondering where you are plus it could be the sheriff stella grabbed an apron off a hook on the wall and tossed it to chrissy it read your opinion wasnt in the recipe and had been a gift from a client whod bought herself a matching one once her husband had learned the hard way not to criticize as chrissy hastily tied on the bright red apron stella tugged her pants legs over her ankle holster as well as she could and yanked her tshirt low to cover the bulge across her stomach they looked each other over and chrissy gave stella a thumbsup stella took a deep breath went to the door and peered through the peephole a not tall sparebuilt man in a shiny blue sport coat and toolong brown pants stood in the doorway grinning nervously his yellowish hair had been recently slicked down but was already popping up from the attempted part he wasnt a whole lot to look atneither handsome nor the least bit intimidating stella swung the door open and glared yeah hello he said a little breathlessly you must be stella hardesty pleased to make your acquaintance these are for you from behind his back he produced a small bunch of flowers pink mums with a healthy puff of babys breath and thrust them at her stella took them too surprised to object and was starting to express her cautious gratitude when he craned his neck around her and peered into the house there you are he bellowed spotting chrissy oh good lord in heaven there you are as he made to sprint past stella her instincts kicked in and she stuck a foot out he tripped shiny brown shoes colliding with her hiking boots so that he splatted with considerable force flying flat out into the small foyer on stellas throw rug he made an oof sound and a small box that he had been holding went flying stella drew her gun and had it on him in a split second and was standing over him in an uwavering spread the adrenaline from the afternoon coursing through her veins just as she was about to scream something harsh and threatening chrissy knelt down in front of him on her hands and knees and shook her head pitt akers she said what have you done what the young man had not done as it turned out was to have kidnapped tucker nor had he developed much more hardboiled courage in the intervening days since hed last hid in a guestroom closet it was the latter that made stella so certain of the former after shed interrogated pitt for a mere five minutes or so it seemed pretty clear that his story was in fact the truth when he heardthrough the closet door behind which hed barred himselfroy dean demanding his hibachi back he was finally convinced that chrissys relationship with roy dean was well and truly over hed gone hastily back home to pack a few things and then jumped in his car for a road trip back to his family home in sikeston several hours away where he got the engagement ring shed returned to him after their marriage ended and which had been stored in a wad of tissue in a matchbox in his mothers sewing caddy he then shared the joyous news of his impending reunion with chrissy first with his parents over a pot roast dinner and then with a few childhood friends this second celebration turned into the sort of evening out at the roadhouse that tacked an extra day onto the trip for recovery purposes but by this afternoon pitt felt lively enough to make the drive home where he took care of the litter box and showered and dressed in his finest duds and came over to repropose it was stella supposed to chrissys credit that she emerged dryeyed but kindly from the brief private discussion she and pitt had in the guest roomand to pitts that he left without an argument though they could hear his hiccupsobs starting up as he cleared the door on the way back to his car chrissy turned to stella the minute he was gone for the love of pete she sighed i aint got time to wipe up any more broken hearts here lets rock and roll they stowed their gear in the jeep and hit the road stella feeling a little better since the advil had kicked in took the wheel and set her pace just a little above the speed limit when they got close to bennings stella cut the headlights and crept along at five miles an hour once she could see the lights of the compound up ahead she pulled across the road and drove onto a pullin between two fields the dirt ruts were nearly as weedy as the fields but none of the vegetation was much over ankle high and the silhouette of the jeep would be pretty obvious from the road if anyone shone a light in their direction but there wasnt much to be done about that at least there was little moonlight tonight it was a thin sliver of a crescent moon and clouds scudded past it throwing the landscape into neartotal darkness stella took the flashlights out of her backpack and handed one to chrissy shine just right in front of you not ahead she warned and lets keep em off as much as we can they walked the field stepping over the clumps of weeds crunching dirt clods and trying not to twist their ankles staying silent when they came almost abreast of bennings across the road stella spotted a figure on the other side of the gate illuminated clearly by the sodium lights up on poles behind the trailer and around the sheds and between the rows of ruined cars two threeshe counted four lights plus what looked like more back toward the large shed shed spotted the other day the light was glaring and eerily yellow what she could see of the guards skin appeared unnaturally pale and waxy he looked young and bored a buzzcut muscular guy with what looked to be a semiauto rifle across his lap his hand resting lightly on the stock he sat on a camp chair with his legs splayed wide tapping his foot and nodding to a beat stella could feel reverberating through the ground more than she could hear it coming from the boom box at his feet she held up her palm and chrissy stopped behind her stella touched her arm and pointed off in the direction away from the road and dropped down on her hands and knees chrissy followed suit i think we better crawl stella whispered i dont know what kind of shadow wed cast if he looks this way chrissy murmured her agreement and before stella could stop her she slithered ahead on her chest with surprising strength stella did her best to follow suit though when a weed stalk poked her torn and stitched cheek it was all she could do to keep from yelping with pain in a few dozen yards she was breathing hard and she was glad shed ratcheted up her fitness program in january her old self wouldnt have made it ten yards after what seemed like an hour they were a good distance past the gate and stella signaled for chrissy to stand up they walked the rest of the way to the corner of the benning property where the chainlink fence made a right angle here let me chrissy said unzipping stellas backpack and taking out the bolt cutters she went to work on the fence with surprising efficiency snipping the wire one section at a time stella slid the backpack off took out the pliers and used them to pull the fencing back as chrissy cut it didnt take long to get a threefoot hole cleared they stopped to rest for a minute drinking from the water bottles stella put the tools back in the pack and shouldered it again ready stella asked guess so stella ducked down making it through without even snagging her shirt as she turned back to check on chrissy she caught a blur of movement out of the corner of her eye and suddenly the two huge dogs from the other afternoon came hurtling toward her teeth snapping in the pale moonlight when they were twenty feet away one of them started an eerie howl and the other immediately joined in barking viciously fuck stella muttered hoisting her flashlight and preparing to club it down on whichever dog reached her first two shots cracked out and the dogs stopped in midstride and went spinning sideways legs splayed and pinwheeling the one that was barking switched midyowl to a highpitched keening cry and there was one more crack and it fell silent in the dirt a shuddering pile of fur the dogs were still ten feet away stella turned to chrissy in amazement she was standing in a perfect shooters stance the makarov still clutched in her grip and pointed toward the dogs but as stella tried to put together a coherent comment chrissy began to shake the tremor starting in her hands and shivering its way back through the rest of her body stella put a hand on her shoulder and she could hear chrissy take a big gulp of air nailed em girl stella said i didnt even have time to draw itheyre faster than squirrels i guess they are huh you did good sugar chrissy slowly lowered her gun arm but she didnt reholster stella didnt blame her she reached for the ruger i think were getting some company chrissy whispered coming from the same direction as the dogs the guard had left his chair and was walking slowly toward them sweeping the beam of his own flashlight to the left and right the arc would illuminate them in ten or twelve more steps move stella blurted and she ducked and ran to the dead dogs she grabbed a hind leg and pulled as hard as she could the thing was huge and surprisingly hard to pull as dead weight but adrenaline socked in and powered her along chrissy grabbed the second dog and they staggered toward a stand of trees and scrub when they reached the bushes stella yanked chrissys arm and they hit the ground and listened to the guard whistling and calling to the dogs while they tried to catch their breath hes not going to stop looking until he finds the dogs chrissy whispered hes going to holler back to the rest of them when he figures out something went wrong stella said right now he might still think it was a rabbit or something but shit whatre we gonna do stella could feel her heart pounding in her chest what indeed this was far from her standard operating procedure her brand of ruthless usually involved an element of surprise and an unsuspecting and unarmed target it didnt really take a whole lot of muscle to catch losers off guard and threaten to shoot their dicks off but in this dark junkyard corner her options were shutting down fast unless the guard was a certified idiot he had to figure that the dogs had run into trouble and if he swung the light just a little wider hed see the hole in the fence in the moonlight she could make out the rifle in his arms cradled like a babyand a lot more tensed muscle than shed noticed earlier when the guy had been sitting his tshirt with the sleeves ripped off revealed bulky biceps and ripped forearms he moved with the grace of a welloiled young machine she wasnt sure that the two of them stood a chance against him and the minute he got his buddies involved she and chrissy were screwed for certain there really wasnt any choiceshe had to take him down but even if she managed to surprise him the odds werent great that she could overpower himunless she somehow managed to end up sitting on him in which case he probably would have a struggle just to breathe she was going to have to shoot him and she regretted it because hurting men was something she reserved for womanhaters and this guy didnt look old enough to have even developed much of a grudge against the fair sex stella bit the inside of her lip took a deep breath and rolled up onto her knee help me big guy she prayed and then took her best shot immediately the man fell down sideways clutching his leg stella grabbed chrissys arm and they lurched forward running to where he lay on the ground moaning and cursing she kept the ruger trained on him but hed dropped his own gun and was clutching his leg below the knee stella used her momentum to hit him headon and they tumbled together and rolled when they came to a stop chrissy was standing above them pointing her gun down at the guys face her look pure fierce concentration as though she was trying to figure out the puzzle on wheel of fortune ill shoot your durn head off chrissy said you say so much as one thing i swear to holy god youre gonna have a hole where your face was now that they were closer the guard looked even younger sixteen seventeen with a smooth face that didnt look like it needed shaving too often popping out in sweat it was clear that he was in pain his eyes bugging out of his head his mouth working in fear stella crawled away from him and stood up she slid her backpack off and got out the coil of rope i did you a favor shootin you where i did she said i couldve capped your knee know what happens then the boy shook his head fast you dont ever walk too good thats what with this hole here you got a good shot at healing up right you play basketball the boy looked around wildly for a moment then gave a half nod stella yanked his arms hard behind him while chrissy took out the buck knife and cut off a length of the rope and handed it to her while stella secured the binding chrissy cut a second length of rope and went to work tying off his leg above the bullet entry it was a big messy hole but it seemed to have missed the bone if chrissy was put off by the blood it didnt show well thats too bad basketballs a shitty sport still youll get a chance to keep playing it if you do what i tell you the boy shook his head determination showing through his pain fuck off stella raised her eyebrows is that fuck off i enjoy getting shot and i hope youll do it again or fuck off im out of my mind with pain and dont know what im saying the boy just frowned and stared at the ground chrissy kicked him hard below the hole in his leg he made a sound that wasnt like anything stella had heard from a human before how do you like that dirtbag chrissy said winding up to do it again hang on there sweetie stella said laying a hand on her shoulder she crouched down to look the boy in the eye now i understand you got your reasons for not wanting to talk to me she told him if my boss was some kind of kingpin or what have you i guess id be worried myself i wouldnt be in any hurry to spill the beans in fact youre probably sitting there thinking your odds with us are better than with the rest of those clowns am i right the boy didnt say anything but he gave the muscles around his mouth a workout so that makes it our job to convince you that isnt the case you look at me you probably see a wrinkly middleaged woman your moms age you think she paused at the mention of his mom there had been somethinga little blip of emotion that flashed across his eyes stella reconsidered her approach were you one of the ones that nailed me the other night stella kept her voice pleasant as she fixed the knots in place when he didnt answer she gave chrissy a tiny nod and the girl toed his leg again not as hard but enough to make him grunt with pain sweat beads had popped up along his forehead he worked his lips a bit and then muttered no whats your name patrick how old are you seventeen his voice hitched ending in a bit of a squeak hell bound up like that he looked about as threatening as a teddy bear whatd you do to the dogs killed em chrissy said shot em and it didnt bother me a bit i think i might have got me a taste for shooting things stella glanced up at the cold steel in chrissys voice i am looking for a little boy chrissy continued my son is missing he is eighteen months old i want him back its not right him being away from his mother now do you know anything about him patrick squeezed his eyes shut and grimaced from the pain you know mothers stella said conversationally chrissy heres actually a nice lady most of the time wouldnt swat a fly but get between her and her boy and whoo i tell ya im not sure i like your odds i bet your mamas the same way i bet if she knew who you were working for shed probably hightail it out here and take old funzis head off am i right genuine anguish seeped into the boys eyes youre wrong its a family thing were related funzis her cousin look my dad took off when i was little okay i got three little sisters funzis just helping us out stella prodded him again a little harder the wound which was down to a trickle of blood gave up a small gush you think your mama would appreciate this kind of help huh do you though patricks face had gone chalk white he kept to his stony silence youre telling me your mama handed you over to funzi told him forget finishing high school forget college i prefer you take my boy and teach him how to maim and kill please i cant cross him i dont care what you say the boys breath was ragged hell kill me hell kill me slow man it was worse than stella thought if funzid got the kid running this scared he must be the genuine ruthless bloodyhanded mob article she wasnt sure how to convince the boy she was every bit as much of a badass threat as funzi because in the end she wasnt there was no way she was going to kill this manchild with peach fuzz growing on his upper lip as stella hesitated chrissy shouldered her out of the way and leaned in hard on patrick her face just inches from his i dont know if your mamas a nice lady or not i dont know her period thats why i can drive over there and start hurting her bad if i knew her i might have second thoughts but im not even going to give her time to offer me a glass of tea first thing im going to do is shoot her just like stella done you see except she dont have anything useful to tell me so i dont know if ill really take the time to tie her off so she dont bleed out aw hell i know itll take a long time to lose enough blood from a hole hereshe jabbed patrick hard in the skin an inch from the bullets entryso i might just have to aim a little higher theres some artery in the thigh i guess pumps a lot of blood the what do you call it femoral stella said softly femoral yeah chrissy said then she drew back slowly never taking her eyes off the boys face he gulped hard and stella knew they had him ill tell you what i know he wheezed you stay the hell away from my mom funzis got your kid for his wife there was a moment of shocked silence what are you talking about chrissy demanded roy dean gave him to funzi okay he and his wife couldnt have kids been trying forever roy dean said you wouldnt care chrissys eyes narrowed he said what she demanded and stella grabbed her arm before she could do the boy any more damage he said you never did want that kid in the first place the boy squeezed his eyes shut tight a sheen of perspiration dampening his forehead said he was an accident and all he like said you wanted to give him up for adoption that he was doing you a favor stella could feel chrissy start to shake and clamped her hand down harder easy there girl she murmured easy whatevers happened it aint this boys fault chrissy shone her flashlight directly in patricks eyes causing him to squeeze them shut whered funzi take my tucker i dont know okay i dont know probably the lake house mrs angelini spends most of the summer there what lake house they got a place in that new development down by camden beach you know about thirtyfive miles from here tuckers with funzis wife youre sure stella asked thinking fast if patrick was telling the truth and funzi and his wife planned to keep the boy it could be a stroke of luck the woman was bound to treat him well especially if she had started to think of him as her own theythey treatin him good chrissy said echoing her thoughts her voice was thin and wavery how the hell am i supposed to know they plan on raising himyou get it like you know their own son aint they ever heard of adoption chrissy said patricks expression shifted for the first time from straight fear to surprise whos gonna let them adopt dont you know who funzi is they got the whole organized crime unit up in kansas city trying to crawl up his ass stella sighed so that whole things true yall really are mob patrick said nothing and a single tear squeezed out of one eye and bounced down his cheek chrissy kicked at his bad leg not hard this time and patricks eyelids fluttered like he was going to pass out come on boy stella said not unkindly dont make this so hard on yourself our familys been connected forever patrick said through clenched teeth beez and gus theyre like his nephews or something they been with funzi a long time theyre the guys that nailed me stella said is that it everyone whos down here them and reggie rollieri whats he do he covers the casinos for funzi and he runs a book down along the shore hes only around a couple weeks a month so funzi reggie the two goons and roy deanthats five plus benning is six and counting you seven patrick screwed up his face and drew a breath so you gonna kill me now me nah stella said though chrissy here might shes turning out to be a little itchy on the trigger they say you kill just about everyone who pisses you off patrick mumbled who says funzi benning all of em interesting so theyd asked around stella couldnt decide if that was a good thing or not on the one hand it was flattering to know that her reputation as a coldhearted killer was thriving it was probably the reason they had junior here down at the gate on guard duty though they probably didnt think stella was a true threat or they wouldnt have given the job to such a greenhorn well i dont i havent made up my mind on you yet but you help me out here maybe we can work it out so you can spend next summer working at burger king like a regular kid okay he shook his head ill be dead in a week after they find out what i told you only if theyre still around to come find you heres what were gonna do she said briskly im going to ask you some questions and youre going to answer them fast and youre not going to leave anything out then im going to take you to a friend for safekeeping just until we get this mess straightened out what happens to you that depends on how you handle yourself now hear a single nod okay chrissy help me drag him over there chrissy and stella hooked his shoulders and dragged patrick moaned as they bumped over the ground but they got him propped up against a tree close to the fence stella checked his leg it could definitely use a cleaning and dressing but it didnt look like he was going to bleed out tonight satisfied she sat down crosslegged in front of him and motioned to chrissy to join her sitting side by side with the flashlight on its head making a circle of light on the ground between them and patrick reminded stella of longago girl scout campfires wheres roy dean patrick snuck a nervous glance at chrissy remember what i said stella reminded him the whole truth and fast im feeling impatient hes uh dead chrissy sitting next to her didnt flinch stella nodded im not all that surprised let me guesshe was ripping funzi off and funzi found out he um yeah tell me how patrick licked his cracked lips funzi had him driving weed up to kansas city hed go pick it up from these vietnamese guys in bolivar that funzis got growin the shit in their basement he start skimming is that it yeah outta the bales a little here and there but then he took a whole brick you know hard to miss that funzis not stupid whatd he want to do sell it i guess thing is he ah patrick glanced miserably at chrissy i mean im sorry if you didnt know mrs shaw roy dean had a girl that fucktard chrissy spat yeah i knew so i guess they were gonna sell it or i dont know he gave it to her or whatever but by the time funzi had beez and gus mess him up it was gone so funzi killed him not right then they gave him a week to come up with a couple thousand bucks chrissy barked a short laugh that was after they beat him up stella asked yeah stella looked to chrissy what do you think was roy dean looking for money that week was he ever not looking for money shit stella hed turn over the couch cushions every time before he went to the bar but he knew i didnt have none so it wasnt like hed ask me arthur junior didnt say anything about roy dean hitting him up either well hell he was fixing to trade my baby away i guess he didnt think he needed it chrissy said if he wasnt dead id kill him myself that what happened patrick stella asked roy dean come in here with tucker yeah if it was possible to look any more uncomfortable than he already was with a leaking hole in his leg patrick did he was supposed to have the money friday night but he showed up here saturday with the uh with your boy oh chrissy said that little i went out to my friend tiffanys house friday night to play cards and tucker was with me he was planning to take tucker out to bennings that night stella guessed no shit all along he meant tohe had it planned chrissy was trembling from her fury and stella put her hand on her back and patted gently righteous anger was good but she had to keep it under control so she prompted patrick so um benning has roy dean go wait in the shed and he calls funzi and and funzi was headed down to the lake house with gus and beez and reggie so they all turned around and came back up here how long did it take funzi and them to get there not long maybe fifteen minutes men roy dean we were kind of talking some and the kid was on the floor playin with some little stuffed dog puppup chrissy interjected thats his favorite oh god okay stella said giving chrissy a onearm hug a firm one to get her to focus we got to listen to the rest of this hon chrissy gulped and nodded patricks breathing had gone short and fast he looked back and forth between them his eyes unfocused so when funzi and them came in the kid had shit his pants and roy dean couldnt get him to shut up funzis all wheres the money you got my money and then roy dean tells funzi look here you can have the kid and thatll settle us up and funzi looks at him like hes out of his mind and then he goes nuts tells roy dean is he fucking crazy and then he smacks him around a little keeps asking where the fuck his money is and then all of a sudden he just stops he uh tells gus to take the kid and drive him down to the lake house you know where his wife is and roy deans looking all happy because like he figures funzi went for it and all but the second gus walks out the door with the kid funzi tells me and beez go outside and guard the place and dont go nowhere until he comes and gets us so we go out and it wasnt more than a minute or two after they locked the doors again we heard a shot and i knew funzi shot roy dean patrick swallowed hard stella had a pretty good idea it was the first time patrick had heard something like that despite all his swagger okay she said gently he killed roy dean maybe he figured he couldnt keep him around knowing where the kid was what happened to the body well shit we were likei mean funzi tells me go get some plastic and a chain saw from benning and i and i i did that and beez stayed and guarded the shed and when i got back i knocked on the door and gave the stuff to funzi and then a minute later we heard them fire it up funzi and rollieri yeah holy mother stella said a chain saw didnt that make a hell of a mess yeah patrick said his voice a hoarse whisper stella noticed a smell coming off him acrid fear mixed with blood and body odor funzi uh didnt make us help with the uh sawing he told us to stay outside and you know we did but later when we were cleaning up jesus so you and beez helped take care of the body when it was done no funzi gave me the chain saw and said clean it off and i wiped it down and all that and beez went and helped benning close up and funzi said wait for him in the house so we we um did how long did that take i dont know maybe like half an hour more maybe we were uh sitting around at the house and and finally funzi called on the cell he said for me and beez to come back up to the shed and like the pieces of of roy dean were wrapped in plastic and funzi told us to carry it all out to the burn barrel reggie had headed back to the city so it was just me and beez done it stella grimaced thinking of the grisly task chrissy looked a little green herself wheres the burn barrel out behind the shed on the back side patrick said lifting a limp arm to point back across the property then what did you do we uh laid in some newspaper and shit to get it started and then we put the uh you know roy dean in there plastic and all funzi wanted it all burned poured on the kerosene but we waited until dark to light it up did it catch right off yeah but it took all night to burn down the smell it nearly killed us in the morning there was there was a few pieces of bone or something with the plastic burned onto it gus was back by then and funzi made us dig like five or six holes and put the shit in was it all destroyed other than the bone pieces there was some little bits of cloth around the barrel that mustve come out of the flames or something and what didnt burn i think there were teeth like that patrick stared miserably at the ground could you find those holes again yeah since i had to do most of the digging funzi had me put the dirt back and drive the front loader over the top when i was done okay stella sat back on her haunches for a minute thinking over the story she glanced at chrissy whose anger seemed to have dissipated some though she kept the gun loosely trained on patrick patrick where exactly is funzi on the old mob totem pole kinda low i guess patrick said i mean hes got just gus and beez and reggie and me he reports up to donny calabasas and then after donny its justin frankhes got the whole south end of kansas city okay i get the picture stella said hes a pissant and gus and beez and reggie are little pissants and youre just a teeny little baby pissant that about the size of it patrick barely nodded his eyelids were slowly sliding down and stella was worried he was about to pass out look here can you tell me how to get to the lake house yeah its the biggestass house on the north shore its in that new development down past the ustoreit where route hits the shore road on that private drive they put in yeah theres maybe six eight houses on a culdesac and youre sure thats where they got the kid patrick looked uncertain well probably i mean mrs angelini spends most of the summer there and now shes got the kid my kid chrissy interrupted and patrick swallowed sorry yeah im like ninety percent sure thats where they are all of them funzi and gus and beez no funzi had gus run something up to the city some delivery for donny calabasas so its just him and beez stella still didnt like those odds ordinarily she wouldnt move until she was certain but there wasnt anything she could do about it now how long until someone figures out youre gone patrick shrugged depends if benning and larissa are partying sometimes he dont even come down but the rest of the time the rest of the time hes down here around eleven eleven thirty midnight maybe stella checked her watch ten shit and wheres funzi and them tonight at the lake house i guess unless they went into town to the bars i dont know they dont check in with me benning would know but yeah for a moment stella considered heading up to the house and scaring the crap out of benning and his girlfriend but that was introducing all kinds of opportunities to fuck things up if they left now there was a chance they could get to the lake house and figure out how to get tucker without funzi knowing they were coming if funzi had warning stella was pretty sure things would end in disaster she and chrissy wouldnt stand a chance against two armed thugs plus funzis wife she wasnt sure what the body count would be or who would be left standing but she wouldnt put money on any kind of motherandchild reunion we gotta move she said decisively sorry patrick but youre gonna have to haul your ass down to the road well help you but i dont want to hear any whining ill get the car and then youre gonna give chrissy here the best directions you ever gave while i drive you over to my friends house hear hell take good care of you while chrissy and i go get the job done patrick nodded miserably stella noticed with admiration that he made almost no sound at all as they helped him stagger to his one good leg and gimp his way to the road seven stella considered having chrissy keep her gun on patrick once they got in the car but since it was going to have to happen eventually anyway she decided they might as well take care of him now she left the car idling while they got patrick settled into the back seat stella helped hoist his bad leg up on the seat a pile of rags from the trunk spread out underneath to catch the thin stream of blood that ran from the wound sorry you have to see this she told him apologetically leaning into the car it was awkward to crawl in her knees on the floor of the car but she needed to get close to his face see what patrick asked this stella hit him fast and hard on the chin the way shed learned from watching boxing videos on youtube channeling muhammad ali from when he took sonny liston down she backed her way out of the car and slipped the brass knucks off her hand and returned them to her purse pleased to see that patrick was breathing well his head leaning back against the door ats a shame chrissy said shaking her head i was startin to like that one a little bit dont like him too much he stood by while they killed your husband chrissy snorted somebody ought to give him a medal for that well but he watched them haul your kid out of there didnt he would have put a gun on us too if we hadnt got to it first wouldnt a shot us though the hell you say he didnt have it in him stella come on it was obvious well until today i wouldnt have figured you for coldblooded shootin either but you sure nailed those two crazy mutts chrissy didnt respond stella got into the drivers seat and buckled herself in her body ached dully all over and she figured it was a delayed muscular response to the beating shed taken the night before well shed just have to power through the next hour or so and hope she had the juice for another round either way shed be in for a long rest after this night was over she just hoped it wasnt permanent stella made the uturn and drove slowly back past bennings glancing over at the trailer the blue glow from the television was the only light visible inside though the pole lights still illuminated the grounds if benning or his girlfriend looked out the window patricks post with its abandoned camp chair and boom box would be obviously empty the thought made her want to drive a little faster but she waited until bennings was out of sight in the rearview mirror before putting the pedal down the inside of the jeep was quiet as stella made the drive back through prosper and out to goats she slowed on the final stretch of gravel drive before pulling up in front of the house a tidy little woodsided foursquare that had been empty for a few years before goat moved in stella pulled the jeep into the yard cut the headlights and turned off the ignition and coasted the last twenty yards praying goat was a heavy sleeper off to the side of the house his service sedan was pulled up square next to his truck a battered toyota a single light burned somewhere in the house its soft glow pale gold in the windows through the gaps in the sheer curtains stella could make out the shapes of furniture the outline of the staircase a picture hung on the wall she felt an odd tug a longing that she couldnt at first identify she wanted to go inside and look around pick up objects off the tables and hold them in her hands examine the photographs she wanted to look in the fridge and the medicine cabinet and the bookshelves she wanted to know all about the man whod taken up residence in a protected corner of her mind upstairs out of sight goat was undoubtedly sleeping dreaming maybe stella imagined his bedside table there would be reading glasses of coursea person didnt get to be their age without themand maybe a glass of water an alarm clock though stella would bet goat was the kind of man who woke up a minute before it went off a bookmaybe a biography or a world war ii history the clickeror maybe not maybe he didnt like a television in the bedroom they said it distractedthat your sex life suffered from its presence that was about enough of that stella chided herself she opened the car door as quietly as she could and got out chrissy following suit then she opened the passenger door in back and stared down at patrick he didnt make for a very threatening captive unconscious in the back seat his lips parted and his long lashes casting moon shadows on his smooth cheeks he looked about twelve years old in fact well lets get it done stella said grabbing one of his feet and indicating that chrissy should take the other they pulled him out stella grabbing his head and barely preventing it from glancing off the door well and banging into the ground this fellows too damn big im getting tired of hauling him around we can just drag him i guess chrissy said you clipped him pretty good i dont think hes gonna wake up anytime soon yeah too bad we couldnt just put a timer on him a popup timer like you stick in a turkey i dont want goat finding him too soon we need to get in there you know without the law chrissy finished her sentence for her well we could hit him again i guess they staggered across the lawn up the steps and then lurched onto the porch and dropped patrick into one of the adirondack chairsnice ones looked like goat had made them himselfon the porch they stretched patrick out as comfortably as they could stella went back to the car for the rope and tied patricks ankles together she checked the wound which had nearly stopped bleeding and was drying to a crust around the edges the ankle of the shot leg was looking pretty pale and it felt cold to the touch the skin had a little too much give like chicken skin on a butcher fryer stella wondered if she ought to loosen the rope shed tied above the knee then she remembered patricksweet baby face and allstalking toward them with that gun slung across his body hand caressing the trigger and left the rope right where it was chrissy stepped back and examined their handiwork he looks kinda funny she said i guess maybe we ought to leave some sort of note stella said hang on she went to the car got her case notebook and tore out a sheet with the cars dome light for illumination she wrote a quick note goat dont untie this boy until you got some other way to keep him down its one of alphonse angelinis boyshe tried to shoot us tell you all about it later she looked at what shed written chewed on the pen there was a chance that things were going to go spectacularly wrong she and chrissy were about to go looking for a pair of coldhearted gangsters who had a whole lot of firepower between them neither of whom presumably were chubby or beat up or schooled only in shooting squirrelsand now of course dogs as far as weapons went stella didnt even want to think how outgunned they were still if today was her day to go out so be it stella sighed and added to the note if you dont hear from me by tomorrow afternoon find tucker she looked down at the note and couldnt help feeling like she hadnt quite written everything she wanted to say to the man but there wasnt time to worry about that now back outside the car she noticed that the moon was climbing higher in the sky and plumping itself up into a respectable shiner lighting up the closemown lawn and some flower beds goat had carved out along the edges and filled with petunias and marigolds on the porch chrissy was fussing with patrick wedging a chair cushion behind his head stella set the note on the little side table next to the chair and weighed it down with a rock okay say goodbye to your boyfriend there stella said time to hit the road chrissy gave a brief nervous giggle and waggled her fingers at the unconscious boy who now looked as though he was taking a noontime siesta with his hands clasped in front of him and his ankles crossed they made the drive to the lake mostly in silence chrissy piping up now and then to read from the directions patrick gave her the roads were practically empty they passed only three other cars on the way whatre we gonna do if these directions take us to a pizza hut or something chrissy asked as they got close or if the address dont exist i mean we didnt exactly get any guarantees out of patrick that would be a problem stella admitted but do you really think hes feeling the love for those guys right now if he has half a brain hes probably hoping we take them all out that what were going to do stella chrissy asked her voice whisperquiet take em all out stella said nothing for a moment then she gave the only answer that she felt she could well do exactly what we need to no more and no less when chrissy didnt say anything more stella figured shed better stop her from getting too far ahead of herself stop worrying about what you cant control she said trust me i know ive been there before what you want to do is stay in the moment deal with all the shit as it comes down the pike then later you can think about how you might have done things different over a beer or twelve chrissy nodded okay hey thats our turn loblolly pines road stella eased past a pair of stone pillars with fancy iron fencing sticking out at angles on either side there was a brass plate on either column bearing the words lakeview manor estates the road was smooth asphalt with a median strip planted with young redbud and dogwood trees im surprised they dont have them a little house here with some tightass guard ready to blow away any riffraff that comes along chrissy sniffed riffraff s already got in funzin them aint exactly quality folks theirselves stella laughed softly well said darlin okay lets see what we got she cut the lights and rolled slowly down the road after a hundred yards or so the street curved gently to the left and there in front of them lay the lake shimmering in the moonlight it was so beautiful it made stellas chest tighten up the little ripples on the waters surface danced silver and black the crescent moon was reflected in the water a flickering slice of pale light stars had come out just a smattering and they sparkled their way down the horizon until it looked as if they were bits of sugar dusted down from some heavenly shaker reluctantly she turned away from the water it wasnt a night for beauty up ahead she could see the lights of an enormous house and beyond that another and another id drive on past stella said check out the situation but theres no telling what funzis got in the way of manpower up at this hour if hes got one of his guys outside on some sort of watch she glanced at the dashboard clock one fifteen late enough that presumably everyone but the insomniacs would be asleep for the night if funzi had someone posted outside the house a car driving by at this hour would draw attention putting them on alert tuckers probly been asleep for hours chrissy said you know stella dont laugh but i got a feeling that hes right close by stella didnt laugh she eased the car over to the side of the road and let the engine idle and considered chrissy carefully yeah what do you mean well i dont know i guess it sounds kind of dumb but i get a sense about things sometimes i just got this feeling see she held up her hands turned them over and looked at her fingers like a little tingly feeling i can justoh stella i can just feel tucker you know under my fingers his little cheeks and his hair and his little baby butt when i hold him im tellin you hes here stella took a slow easy uturn in the broad street still well back from the first house and drove slowly back to the gated entrance at the turnoff back on the main road she drove a few moments until she found what she was looking for a turnin for farm vehicles with a padlocked gate over a cattle guard she parked off the road and cut the engine then turned on the map light and looked at her partner well honey girl whats this sixth sense of yours tell you about what were about to do chrissy put her fingers lightly to her face tapping on her chin and closed her eyes she focused hard for a minute her eyebrows knit in concentration and then her eyes popped open oh what i dont knowi had this like swirly feeling and then kind of a like a mini fireworks in my head is that good iim not sure yes wait yes its good im getting a good feeling but theres all this trouble firstthats what im sensing well that sounds about right stella reached in the back seat for her backpack she took out the flashlights again and handed one to chrissy you better reload she said she dug in the backpack for the makarovs spare magazine stella slid the other one out expertly and replaced it sending the slide home with a satisfying snap this old piece turned out okay i guess chrissy said tucking it back in the holster thanks to uncle fred so whats the plan unfortunately i dont have much of one kind of goes like this sneak in dont get caught and get tucker then we can get the hell out of here and call the sheriff chrissy put her hand on the door latch and nodded as if stella had given her a detailed strategy okay she got out of the jeep and stella followed suit slipping the backpack onto her sore shoulders they kept off the street a few yards on the lake side there were clumps of cattails and the occasional stand of willows which made for good cover so stella felt confident they wouldnt be spotted even by someone on the street as they passed the first two houses a motion light went on she grabbed chrissys arm and scrambled out of the illuminated arc close to the bank that sloped down to the water they stood motionless for a few moments waiting for a reaction from inside the house stella could feel chrissys pulse rapid and strong through her sleeve her own heart was pounding just as fast after a few minutes they ventured ahead staying close to the bank of the lake at the edge of funzis lawn they paused ahead loomed the enormous house three stories of pale stucco topped with a tile roof like it was in the middle of the damn mediterranean there were arched windows all along the back of the house and sets of french doors and little balconies sticking out from the upstairs rooms like some kind of romeo and juliet stage set stella was a little surprised to see that some of the windows were open she expected them to have the airconditioning blasting on a night as hot as this stella glanced at chrissy and saw that she had drawn the makarov and held it ready her hands steady thinking about dogs she whispered hell yes maybe the angelinis arent pet people in answer chrissy only snorted so heres what im thinking stella said the place has got to be alarmed every which way right we try to break in even through a screen theyll be on us before we have time to turn around plus theyll have the advantage of knowing exactly where we are yeah so what we need is we need one of them to come out then i figure its a fair fight chrissy scratched her chin with her free hand and gave stella a quizzical look well how are you gonna manage that ring the doorbell pretend you brung em a pizza searching for ideas stella looked carefully from the vinecovered trellis that ran from the front overhang along the side of the house around to the back where a wooden pergola had been built over a huge tiled patio extending out from the patio a stone path bisected the backyard continuing to a set of steps that led down to the water where a number of boats were docked she briefly considered climbing up the trellis to the second floor where she figured the master bedroom faced out over the water it would be possible to get from the trellis to the balcony and it looked like the french doors were open so she could slip into the room possibly surprising funzi and his wife in their sleep getting a gun on them before they had time to react it would be possible if she were tarzan she doubted the trellis would hold her weight and even if it did climbing the wooden structure was a little different from the climbing wall she occasionally worked out on at the gym she studied the pergola it had no handor footholds and the vine on it was still young its strands thin and weak no help there so she wasnt going to be able to get in there had to be a way to get someone to come out some way to cause a distraction in the backyard so that someone investigating would leave the door open behind him letting one of them get inside okay she finally said down on the docks see chrissy looked where stella was pointing yeah they got a speedboat couple a those wave runner things what do you want to do hop on one and drive it up on the lawn no not exactly do you know where they put the gas in on one of those things i guess i been waverunning with my cousin kip and we pulled up along the pumps at the marina to get gas theres a gas cap up there near the front just like on a car huh okay i think i have an idea a good idea not really kind of a pisspoor one but we dont have a lot of options or a lot of time either stella considered checking her watch and decided she was nervous enough already she got the bolt cutters out of the backpack and knelt at the edge of the flower bed rummaging through the impatiens with her hands until she found what she wanted she gave the irrigation systems drip line a yank and came up with a loop of black tubing then pulled carefully and followed where it snaked along the edge of the bed back along the fence and toward the host pipe she snipped off a sixfoot section and wrapped it around her palm what the hell are you up to chrissy demanded youll see in a minute she got two water bottles out of her pack and twisted off the caps she handed one to chrissy drink up now because you wont have another chance after chrissy obliged stella took the bottle back and upended both pouring the water out on the lawn whatja do that for we need the bottles stella said come on in the moonlight she took the stairs slowly and carefully to the sides of the steps long grasses and weeds stirred as they went past making an otherworldly whispering sound at the bottom stella took a breath and set one foot on the dock nearly jumping back when the thing swayed under her weight shit she said if i fall in pull me out girl i cant swim chrissy snorted know how my dad taught me to swim stella made her way gingerly toward the closer of the two wave runners a sharp little craft that looked as if it would seat a couple of bikiniclad nymphets no how took me down to the reservoir and threw me in when i was eight years old i set to dogpaddlin for my life made it to the side and swore id never forgive him but when i managed to haul myself out he was standin there with tears in his eye telling me how proud id made him wow sounds like a setup for hundreds of hours of therapy if i ever heard one aint no lardner ever had therapy chrissy said with a note of pride stella figured that was a discussion for another time she found the gas cap right on top conveniently located where she didnt even need to lean far over the open water she twisted it off and slipped one end of the black plastic tubing inside lets hope they left the tank full she said she let the hose loop down so that it touched the deck then lifted the other end up to her lips and made a face wow ive sucked all kinds of stuff in my day chrissy said giving stella a leering grin but im glad thats you about to put that in your mouth and not me well honey the idea is not to get any in your mouth how you gonna manage that its a physics thing she sucked on the hose until she figured the liquid had traveled as far as the dock then pulled her lips away and whispered here goes nothing after giving the gas a minute to make its way through the tube to level she put the open end in one of the water bottles and then held the bottle down along the side of the dock liquid began to fill the bottle yes stella exclaimed pleased a little surprised the technique actually worked damn chrissy said with admiration thats quite a trick but it smells nasty well were a couple of nasty girls stella said as she filled the second bottle when it was full she coiled up the tubing and dropped it on the deck she handed a bottle to chrissy and they started back up the steps so now what we ask them fellas to drink this shit and hope they pass out chrissy asked when they got back up to the lawn no darlin were gonna set this place on fire she led the way to the side of the house running her fingers along the stucco and the trim trying to judge flammability stella i dont think we better burn the house down chrissy whispered clearly worried i mean tuckers in there and if you know if we get blown away or something i still want him to get out even if its with you know them stella turned to chrissy and saw moonlight creamy on her pale broad cheeks eyes miserable with worry that was a mama for you putting aside thoughts of her own safety her own life even for her baby it gave stella an extra little burst of determination aint gonna happen she promised no ones getting blown away todayat least none of the good guys besides im talking about a little bitty fire just on the outside of the house just enough to set off the alarms and get their attention she settled on a stretch of flower bed that ran along the back of the house a row of shrubs had been planted out of reach of the sprinkler system and had died and dried up into sticks stella slowly poured the gasoline out of the bottles onto the shrubs and the wood trim and up along the side of the house she wasnt sure what stucco was made of these daysprobably styrofoamand hoped to hell it would burn okay she said moment of truth she dug her lighter out of the bottom of the backpack and then reached for chrissys hand and gave it a squeeze chrissy squeezed back what are we going to do when it lights well first of all try not to set ourselves on fire then i guess lets stay close to the house maybe around the corner that way we can see around but well be out of the fire this ought to smoke up good so it should set off the alarm and theyll be able to see it out the windows you gotta figure theyre gonna come out the back to see what happened but what if they go out the front well whoever comes out its going to be my job to take them down so all you need to worry about is getting in dont wait around to see just go if no one shows up back here i guess ill go check on the front door but i got to think theyll come around to the back once they see nothings burning out front dont you think sounds like a lot of guessin and hopin to me chrissy said fraid so but im plum out of alternatives okay so you get the guy outside i go in and find tucker upstairs im thinking theres probably three four different bedrooms up there ill be right behind you soon as i can and ill try to cover you but theres a chance youre gonna be on your own until you find him so you just concentrate on finding him and then you grab him and go im not kidding chrissy you come out of there and you fly back to the jeep unless you get hurt or something then i guess youll have to get to a neighbors house and call the cops shot she meant or stabbed or clubbed or any other manner of violent reckoningand then it would be a matter of great good luck if chrissy got out of there at all but chrissy just nodded calmly then what throw tucker in the jeep and go dont wait on me here youre going to need these she got her car keys and patricks phone out of the backpack and handed them to chrissy give me a call when youre safe ill take care of myself until i hear from you okay chrissy took the keys and stuck them in her pocket then flipped open the phone okay give me your number as she recited it and chrissy keyed it into the phone stella tried not to think about how flawed the plan was what if the fire didnt catch what if the flames outdoors werent enough to set off the alarms or if the smoke detectors were out of batteriesthey were always going on about that on the news how people let their batteries run down and ended up cooked in their beds or what if the fire just took off and sent the whole house up in a ball of flame unlikely they probably coated that styrofoam stucco with the stuff they made kids pajamas out of before the house got a coat of paint what if they all came outfunzi and his wife and beez that would be three against two and then stella forced herself to stop that kind of thinking wasnt going to help she zipped the backpack shut and slipped it on her shoulders the pain and fatigue she had been feeling earlier was gone replaced by a nervous tension that hummed through her whole body chrissy snapped the phone shut and slipped it into her pocket well whatre ya waiting for she demanded right stella muttered and flicked her bic she held the flame down to the trim around the window and there was a sputtering and a strong smell of burning chemicals but no fire stella realized she was holding her breath as her fingertips grew increasingly hot right when she thought she was going to have to drop the lighter a tiny lick of flame went up and over the edge of the painted wooden trim and spread its way down the board a fraction of an inch at first and then another one and then in a whoosh a finger of flame tracked down a rivulet of gasoline that dripped from the stucco and grew into a sizable flame i think were in business stella said she stepped back and slid the lighter into her pocket she grabbed chrissys hand and led her away from the growing fire chrissy gave her a businesslike nod and sprinted to the back porch where she took up position on the side of the door flattened against the house gun hand bent at the elbow looking plenty ready to blow the head off anyone who even looked at her sideways stella took the other side of the door copying chrissys stance the ruger drawn and ready her fingers felt faintly sweaty on the warm ivory grip and her heart was keeping up a pretty good pace it felt like an hour but stella guessed it was another three or four minutes before the flame spread itself out along the trail of gasoline that had dribbled down to the base of the houses siding and was burning well in the dried vegetation the fire leapt along a stretch of wall growing taller by the second flames licked at the bottom of the secondstory windows and the smell of smoke was thick chrissy coughed gently and stella put her sleeve up to her nose breathing through the fabric then they heard the bleep of the fire alarm from inside the house the thought that came unexpectedly to stellas mind was cooking that damn alarm that ollie had installed right in the middle of the kitchen after stella tried to convince him to put it in the hall like it said to do on the boxbut you couldnt tell the man anything the thing would go off whenever stella sautéed or fried or even baked a pizza and ollie would come stand in the door scratching his belly and demanding burning something again hell yeah she was burning something stella thought almost wished the fucker was there to see it for himself inside stella heard someone knocking around upstairs and imagined funzi and the other men lurching out of bedrooms bleary with sleep looking around and trying to figure out what was on fire probably wondering if it was a false alarm or if theyd left a cigarette smoldering in an ashtray or a pan of bagel bites in the oven above her a window was suddenly yanked open holy fuck marie theres a damn fire out back of the house stella shrank as close to the house as she could manage praying that whoever was looking outfunzi presumablywouldnt look down and see her there there was a growing cloud of thick smoke swirling blackened bits of charred crap through the air and she struggled not to cough the air acrid and poisonous even through the soft fabric of her shirt she felt rather than heard the reverberations of feet running along the hallway upstairs a couple of moments later there was a sharp percussive slap on the inside of the door they were guarding and then the sounds of someone rattling the knob throwing the bolt stella stared straight into chrissys eyes and was comforted to see that the girl looked just as unafraid and determined as she had a few minutes earlier she turned back to the door as it sprang openand nearly fainted from shock the man who came bursting out of the house was roy dean shaw eight roy dean wore boxer shorts and a muscle tshirt with the sleeves cut off and while there was little evidence of his having been recently dismembered and burned he was far from a robustlooking specimen of humanity his greasy brown hair lay flat on one side of his head and stuck straight out on the other his pale sloped shoulders were pocked with acne scabs and his narrow eyes were bloodshot you bastard chrissy yelped youre supposed to be dead dont worry about him just get on in there stella said giving the girl a shove and chrissy slipped past him into the house roy dean started to wheel in a circle toward the flames his feet scrambling on the ground it was kind of comical like a cartoon of wile e coyote when he ran off a cliff legs pinwheeling for a moment in midair before he fell stella took one big step toward him and raised her gun hand realizing just in time that the trajectory of his outstretched arm was going to connect about at her wrist knocking the ruger out of her grip she pivoted forward instead so that roy dean connected full on with her his whole mass slamming into her torso at full speed the impact knocked her back and she could feel it in her bones in her teeth but it stopped him coming and he tripped and fell forward on top of her arms flailing no gun roy dean had no gunthat was stellas thought as she rolled away from him tipping a stone planter off its base the broken shards cutting into her flesh as she scrambled out of the way then she realized that she didnt have a gun either as she watched the ruger skitter across the slick patio surface toward the lawn for a second her eyes locked on roy deans homely face above her there were red lines in his flesh from his pillow and she could smell his breath and sweat and then he pushed off her propelling his body along the ground toward her gun he managed to grab it and had it up and trained on her in what seemed like half a second bet youre wishing youd been a little nicer to me now aintcha he said leering stella felt her heart lurch shed let roy dean take her gun like he was taking a lollipop from a baby chrissy had made it inside but now she was on her own and after roy dean shot stella hed go right back inside and alert everyone else chrissy didnt have a chance the thought pissed stella off mightily she got to her knees hair escaping the ponytail holder and falling in her face obscuring her vision her hands scrabbled in the dark behind her finding the largest piece of the pot what was left of the bottom with a thick layer of potting soil matted to it surprise surprise here you are back from the dead she said stalling for time so who did you all kill in the shed rollieri he said who else only i didnt kill him i aint no killer funzi done that hisself stella thought back to what patrick told them reggied gone back to the city funzi and roy dean and rollieri were alone in the shed while patrick and beez waited outside funzi must have shot rollieri instead of roy dean but why whatd he do anyway roy dean snorted he was skimming the take on the book funzi figured it out a while ago but he had to wait for donny calabasas to give him the goahead whyd you all lie to patrick and beez roy dean blinked his brow furrowing how do you know patrick were old friends quilting bees fuck you stella anyway we didnt lie we just couldnt tell em until funzi sent proof back up to donny it was done roy dean giggled looking like a little boy caught with a cookie we sent up reggies hand that had the spider tattoothat was my idea brilliant stella said sure seems like there was a lot of we in that story how come funzis trusting you all of a sudden the way i heard it you were skimming off your own deliveries you were cheating funzi too i wasnt roy dean reddened with anger and the gun wavered in his hands stella was tempted to reach out and grab the barrel take her chances with him getting off a wild shot but he stood just out of reach i paid my debt he finally spat and that was all mostly just a misunderstanding anyway what rollieri didnow that was just wrong funzi couldnt let that go you didnt pay anything stella protested enraged you gave away a baby that wasnt even yours a baby how could you do thateven a scumsucking bottomdweller like you hey chrissy aint fit to be a mother roy dean said his watery eyes narrowing a vein throbbing on his temple shes no bettern a whore its her as brought this down on herself that was just the reminder stella needed of roy deans essential worthlessness enraged she screwed up her face into an expression of exquisite painnot such a stretch given the beating her fresh stitches and recent bruises had taken ohh she wailed reaching a shaking hand down to her legs which were bent beneath her i think you broke my ankle roy dean danced from one foot to another shut up stella or ill waste you right here but he hesitatedstella could see him do it worthless human being that he was hed been right about one thinghe was no killer hed fallen for the old lady ruse and that gave her just the fraction of a second the opening that she needed she gave one more weak moan for good measure and stumbled to her feet like she might collapse from the effort roy dean stutterstepped out of the way as though the thought of pounds of aarpeligible female falling on him was simply too much and stella recovered her balance at the last second and pushed off her left footpain shooting up into her bad hipand swung the heavy piece of pot up around and smashed it against his forehead roy dean went down without even a grunt collapsing into an awkward pile of splayed limbs his head bouncing off the slate patio with a thud stella could feel through her feet ouch she exclaimed that would have hurt plenty if roy dean wasnt already out stella took her gun out of his hand his fingers twitching slightly as she pried them off the grip she jammed the ruger back in the holster and dusted off her knees and then before she straightened up she put two fingers to roy deans neck finding a fluttery pulse you know what your mistake was stella whispered backing away you hesitated you thought you had me because youre young but badass comes in all ages she spun toward the house her heart pounding from exertion as well as fear how long had her encounter with roy dean taken three minutes four it was miraculous that no one had come out to check on him stella opened the door and slipped into the house flattening herself against the wall to the right of the door and swinging her gun arm to the left and the right trying to adjust to the dark of the room the only light came from under the counters in the colossal kitchen that opened up to the left of the family room a hall led from the far side of the family room straight through the center of the house and stella could see that the front door was open up ahead someonefunzi or his wife or beezmust have gone to check out front when they didnt find anything amiss they would circle around to the backand find roy dean laid out cold stella darted down the hall toward an ornate staircase on the right an enormous woodrailed affair that curved upward she grabbed the rail and hauled herself up the stairs trying to keep her steps light but thoughts of chrissy and tucker propelled her forward at the top of the stairs she could see a darkened bathroom with its door ajar and she dove across the hallway and into the bath skidding on the polished marble floor and went into a crouch facing out to the hall cautiously she peered out the hall was empty to the left it opened into a huge loft room dominated by a big sectional sofa the floor littered with electronics a playstation and wii controls and a plastic guitar plus stacks of dvd cases and some crumpled soda cans to the right the hall stretched twenty feet and ended at a set of carved double doors these were open a fraction of an inch not wide enough to see anything inside along the hall on either side were other doors all closed leading to bedrooms no doubt and possibly more bathrooms shit each of those doors presented a threat each one of them could have someone on the other side poised and ready to shoot not to mention whoever was outside who at any moment would come tearing back up the stairs sweating and hyperventilating stella counted the doors to the right five not including the master the wife was probably still in the master bedroom stella thought unless shed run to the baby when the alarm first went off would she do that would the last few days with tucker have been enough to make her start thinking like a mother stella ran that scenario through her mind if chrissy had managed to get up here fast enough if she found the nursery right away maybe got there at the same moment as funzis wifestella had no doubt about whod prevail in that conflictor maybe been lucky enough to get in and out before anyone discovered her was there any chance that chrissy could have made her way back down the stairs and out the front door with tucker could she be back at the jeep already putting it into gear and roaring back out onto the highway as stella considered this hopeful possibility she heard a sound from one of the doors on the right side of the hallway a footstep or something heavy being moved she realized her hopes were wildly unrealistic chrissy hadnt got away if she had managed to grab tucker funzi and beez would be in pursuit the wife hysterical instead theyd shut themselves in the roomsand they had chrissy and the baby with them her instincts propelled her and she burst out of the bathroom and across the hall and into the door smashing into it with all her force it wasnt locked and she went flying into the room knocking into a bed frame her shins slamming painfully against the brass her gut jarring against the rail staggering back with nausea rocketing through her she noticed the other person in the room stella thought for a moment she was staring at a ghost illuminated by a dainty ceramic lamp on a bedside table wearing a nightgown of sheer flowersprigged cotton an impossibly thin woman with lifeless blond hair hanging down past her shoulders stood hugging her arms to herself her eyes were rimmed red with huge purple circles underneath she looked terrified but stella knew betterappearances could be deceiving she seized the womans arm and twisted it behind her back doubling her over she trained her gun on the womans head pressing the barrel to her forehead the woman made a small mewling sound like a kicked puppy but didnt protest further wheres the baby stella demanded the only sound the woman made was a strangled sob and stella yanked harder she heard something pop in the area of the womans shoulder the woman screamed a thundering sound came from down the hall and a bulky figure burst into the room coming to a lurching halt in front of stella funzi the man whod watched from the comfort of a park bench while his goons beat the shit out of her a doughy man in his late forties he wore striped cotton pajamas thick black chest hair peeking out of the v neckline his hair was slicked back on top of his head in the style of a fifties crooner the gun he had trained on her made their entire cache of weapons look like toys from a cereal box stella figured it for a streetsweeper a fully automatic shotgun that could shoot six hundred rounds a minute ill shoot her she yelled oh i dont doubt it funzi said slow and deadly that youd shoot marie here the question is would it be worth it for a chance to put a bullet in your brain stellas finger on the gun twitched involuntarily and she realized funzi had just unwittingly saved his wife she couldnt shoot the woman now knowing that maries own husband was willing to stand there and watch her die there was the evidence of what mattered to him there was the balance of power there was a drama stella had seen played out a few times too often she relaxed her grip on marie angelinis arm and the woman fell to the floor whimpering with pain and clutching her arm stella pointed the ruger at funzi youll take me out with that thing she said voice hard but can you be sure i wont get off a shot too im not a bad shot and right now im sighting right up your hairy nostrils funzi laughed a horrible sound laced with what sounded like genuine mirth yeah you might and if you do know whatll happen next stella said nothing dread growing in her gut from down the hall she heard a huffing cry tucker beez come on down here funzi called bring our guest funzi stepped lightly aside never taking the gun off stella and a second later chrissys battered face appeared in the doorway she was being shoved along by a compact muscular darkhaired man in his twenties who was wearing a tshirt smudged with blood and a pair of cotton lounge pants with beer cans screenprinted on them chrissys hands were bound behind her and shed taken a couple of good slugs to the face one eye was rapidly swelling shut and as she opened her mouth to speak stella could see that a couple of her front teeth had been broken off you look about like i feel right now stella said trying to keep her voice from wavering but the situation was impossible now they were doomed chrissy gave her a small nod but her eyes glinted with fury down stella thought but not out there was still some fight left in the girl did you nail roy dean chrissy asked her voice thick and slurred through the busted teeth yeah i did stella said though a fat lot of good it was going to do i knocked him out now im gonna take down this jerk you shoot me beez here will put a bullet in your girls brain and then depending how pissed off he is he just might go put one in the kid too chrissy went rigid at his words her eyes wide her muscles straining as she worked against her restraints her lips moved and she spat at funzi the bloody glob landed on his cheek marie whimpered from the floor gus yanked upward on chrissys restraints making her gasp with pain but she didnt cry out funzi picked up a little decorative pillow from a chintz armchair and wiped chrissys saliva slowly and deliberately from his face then he tossed the pillow to the floor i think youll be sorry you did that he said he turned to stella okay you ugly sack of flesh how bout you give me that gun and come along like a good little girl reluctantly stella lowered her gun and handed it to funzi who stuck it in a pocket of his lounge pants he came forward and yanked her shirt up revealing the empty holster below he took it off her with a vicious yank and threw the thing in the corner of the room what you got here he demanded reaching down to her ankle holster he pulled out the scissors and laughed then tossed them in the corner too what were you going to do snip me to death stella focused her attention on chrissy never taking her eyes off the girls face hows tucker she asked quietly chrissy nodded once firmly good so the boy was all right for now she had to believe funzi had been bluffing about shooting the kid but it was too risky to try anything now especially given the odds two large armed and muscular men against the two of them unarmed and beat to shit get up marie funzi growled to the woman on the floor slowly painfully she got to her feet stella heard something a faint sound a wail that gradually got louder a siren someone had called the fire department orwas it possiblemaybe the nextdoor neighbors had been looking out their window and seen her struggle in the back of the house with roy dean maybe the cops were on their way suddenly the idea of being arrested sounded pretty damn appealing since it would mean chrissy and tuckers safety down the hall tuckers hiccuping whine escalated to a wailing cry chrissy bit her lip and squeezed her eyes shut for a second beez funzi barked go see what happened to roy dean ill deal with these two beez bolted from the room and down the stairs stella hoped roy dean had bled rivers from the gash on his forehead a blood pool so big and wide the cops or fire rescue couldnt miss it in the room funzi said to chrissy getting behind her and giving her a shove the girl stumbled forward and sat down hard on the bed you funzi said to stella next to her stella sat down on the bed close to chrissy and put her arm around the girl its okay she whispered fiercely whether it was or not might be up in the air but chrissy leaned into the hug i know she whispered back it clearly hurt to talk given the hit shed taken to the mouth marie get your ass in gear and get the rope funzi ordered his wife and the tape move holding her arm painfully to her side marie slipped past him without a word the blood had drained from her face leaving her skin white and lifeless and stella figured the shoulder was dislocated and hurting like a bitch too damn bad marie was back in moments with a coil of orange plastic rope looped over her good arm she also held a roll of duct tape outside the sirens had grown in volume until they were practically earsplitting then abruptly they stopped stella heard mens voices and the clop of heavy boots on the drive a pounding on the front doorbeez must have shut the door when he went down to deal with roy dean funzi took the rope from his wife and with surprising speed tied stellas hands behind her and then looped the rope through chrissys arms and secured the ends of the rope to the bed frame marie get that kid and shut him up for christs sake funzi said marie backed out of the room but at the doorway she hesitated he has a name she said her voice quiet but with a faint echo of something at the heart of it yeah alphonse junior now move your ass no marie corrected him its tucker and she was gone stella felt chrissy tense next to her but before she could say anything funzi grabbed the roll of duct tape and tore off a huge strip he slapped it across her mouth winding the ends around her head a couple of times stella had to work hard to keep the panic from making her hyperventilate and she breathed hard through her nose as funzi repeated the process on chrissy the pounding downstairs grew louder and stella willed the firefighters to break the door down to come in primed for actionbut instead she heard beezs voice slightly winded speaking calmly hey guys thanks for coming out sir we have a report of a fire at this address yeah yeah damndest thing i think i just got it put out ive had the hose on it out back funzi stepped away from the bed and gave his handiwork a onceover stella glared at him as hard as she could funzi wiped his hands on his pants and straightened the collar of his polo shirt and shot her a thumbsup before he disappeared around the corner tuckers cries had diminished to a cranky whimper with a rhythmic pattern to it and stella figured marie had picked him up and was bouncing him quiet much as shed done for noelle all those years ago of course shed never done it with a dislocated shoulder grudgingly she raised her opinion of marie a few notches gentlemen funzis voice boomed heartily from downstairs so glad you all came out men my buddy here cant figure out what happened out back why dont you all come on this way she could hear their voices at the back of the house but couldnt make out the words she strained her wrists against the rope but flexing her muscles just made it bind more tightly against her skin cutting in painfully she wondered if she and chrissy could maneuver themselves so their hands touched whether one of them might be able to free the others wrists but there was no way to make the suggestion not with their mouths taped shut stella fought against the panic in her chest was there any way to get to the scissors she could see them across the room where funzi had thrown them against the wall but they were four feet past the end of the bed too far away to do any good thats when she remembered the rotary cutter rocking her hips she worked her loose camo pants around twisting them against the shiny bedspread until she could touch the top of the pocket with her fingertips she tried to communicate to chrissy with her eyes to let her know what she was trying to do and though the girl looked confused she leaned as close as she could to give stella as much slack in the rope as possible she strained against the rope and managed to touch the top of the rotary cutters handle but it was smooth curved plastic and she couldnt get a grip on it she bent backward forcing her shoulders back and straining her fingers as far as she could until they slid down the handle far enough to get a grip stella grasped the cutter and worked it out of her pocket comprehension dawned in chrissys eyes and she nodded sharply and looked down at her bound hands stella followed the path of her gaze and saw that she was opening and closing her fist and realized what the girl was trying to communicate she had more freedom of movement in her hands than stella did she wanted stella to give her the cutter stella didnt hesitate she managed to turn the tool in her hands and pointed it toward chrissy she felt the girl take it from her and then she heard a beautiful sound the snick of the safety being released she looked at chrissy and for a moment their eyes held and she tried to communicate everything she was feeling encouragement resilience and sheer asskicking vengeance chrissy blinked twice and then she leaned back and stella felt the pressure of the blade against her restraints the blade was wicked sharp and it spun free making it hard to control it was meant to be held firmly against a flat cutting surface used against an uneven surface like the knots it could easily slip off slicing into the vulnerable flesh of stellas hands or wrist she held as still as she could but even so twice she felt the blade slip and sink into her skin she tried not to react knowing that chrissy needed all her focus for the task but she felt blood dripping down her hands and pooling in her curled fingers shed cut herself with the rotary cutter before and it was like a cut with a straight razorso clean and so fast that you didnt feel the pain at first the voices in the back yard faded and then came back louder as the men returned to the house stella could hear them in the downstairs hall laughing now all worries about the fire put to rest and her heart sank so beez had managed to obliterate all her hard work with roy deanthe unconscious body the puddle of blood well it wouldnt have been hard with a few minutes blasting with the hose she felt one of the strands of rope strain against the blade and suddenly it snapped free the frayed end hitting her fingers stella made a sound in her throat of surprise and gratitude chrissy murmured in response and stella could feel her tugging at the loosened rope funzi and beez led the firefighters to the front door and their voices carried easily up to the bedroom they sounded almost jovial like a bunch of guys going to the bar after a softball game i think ill have my wife and son go stay in a hotel for the night you know dont want the little guy breathing that smoke funzi said chrissy paused and stella wished she could pat her shoulder or comfort her in some way but after a second chrissy attacked the knots with renewed vigor not a bad idea sir if you call the station tomorrow they can give you the name of a couple of outfits that deal in smoke damage you know for the drapes and whatall yeah i guess the rest of itll keep us busy for the weekend so much for fishing thats a damn shame another voice hope to see you back on the water soon ill look forward to it just then stella felt chrissy pull the loosened strands free shoving them out of the way with her fingers and stella opened and closed her fists a couple of times to get the feeling back noting with dismay that they were slick with her own blood she closed her fingers over the handle of the rotary cutter just as funzi and beez stomped up the stairs and into the room she prayed they wouldnt see the blood seeping under her hands staining the bedspread beneath her and chrissy funzi stood in the doorway and leered in he looked almost maniacal a grin stretched across his otherwise grim features isnt that great he said nice to see your tax dollars at work like that huh behind him beez tagged along he didnt look one bit happy stella could sympathize the evening wasnt exactly a smashing success for anyone so far ought to rip your head off right now beez muttered you nearly screwed us with what you did to roy dean funzi said his manic voice edging higher leaving him lying out on the ground for anyone to see good thing beez got down there fast he put roy dean into the cushion box big old rubbermaid thing we keep the cushions for the outdoor furniture in i mean the thing was perfect like it was made for holding a body only roy dean started to wake up fucking beat that he starts to wake up and whats beez supposed to do we got the fuckin fire department down our shorts cant have roy dean making noise and pounding on the box now can we so beez had to put a bullet in his brain beez looked away his face darkening and stella felt her face go rigid with horror she remembered the feel of roy deans pulse under her fingers and she couldnt help thinking that he had been alive hed still been breathing when she left him lying on the patio she hadnt killed him but he was dead anyway and he wouldnt be if it wasnt for her did that make her guilty did it matter before the night was out more people were going to be dead probably her and chrissybut not if she had anything to say about it you might as well been the one who pulled the trigger funzi added as though he were reading stellas thoughts he prodded her tied ankles with a meaty hand you cost me one of my men i might have to you know express my displeasure with you before i shoot you stella looked at the pale skin of funzis stomach a band of which hung over the elastic waist of his pajama bottoms she imagined sinking the rotary blade in right there rolling a nice big slice out of him now wasnt the time though not with both of them focused on her and chrissy she needed to get one of them alone marie get down here funzi hollered down the hall his wife appeared in the doorway holding tucker in her good arm with a diaper bag over her shoulder chrissy strained against the ropes and grunted frantically against the tape against her mouth the sound was heartbreaking tucker heard it and his little blond head whipped around and he arched away from marie leaning out with his arms and screaming the boy recognized his mama even with her battered face and tape over her mouth stella figured her heart was going to break right there then she made herself take all that anguish and turn it into honed sharp fury pictured it swirling in her gut ready to burst out and take down all the evil in the room marie struggled to get the boy under control with her good arm the bag slipping to her elbow and dangling there tucker wasnt a dainty child he was pink and round and big and stella figured it would be a miracle if he didnt wiggle out of her onearm grasp marie redfaced with the effort of hanging on to him marie didnt look toward the bed stella wanted to scream at her look here right here this is tuckers real mother the woman your husband is going to shoot down like a dog just so you can playact at being mommy she willed marie to look but the woman turned away jesus fuck marie get him out of here funzi said pulling a set of keys out of his pocket take the escalade go to the town house ill be there later today move he gave his wife a perfunctory peck on the cheek and a little shove and she staggered down the hall without a backward glance that peck on the cheeknoisy briefollie used to kiss stella like that but only if there were other people around shed be standing with a group of women at the knights of columbus barbecue and hed come over flush with a few beers bringing the conversation to a halt with his lurching leering presence the women would all watch as he winked broadly and kissed stella sometimes hed pat her butt too and then hed wander off to find his buddies and another beer and there would be this little silence before the conversation started up again and even though it was a matter of seconds it was excruciating and stella knew what they were all thinking that she was a saint to put up with ollie hardesty and that somebody ought to stop him from doing what they all knew he did and then someone would mention that her niece was having surgery for a fibroid the size of a tennis ball and stella would stand quietly with the trace of the kiss burning an invisible scar on her cheek stella felt a little sorry for marie it was going to be a tough drive wherever she was going probably up to the city fifty or sixty miles with her arm screaming in pain maybe theyd get pulled over for not having a car seatbut what would that accomplish if she and chrissy didnt walk out of this place even if tucker somehow escaped funzi and his wife hed be headed straight for social services foster care the start of a whole other kind of nogood life there were no two ways about it she and chrissy had to come out of this alive funzi gestured at the women so beez what do you think of taking the ladies out for a boat ride sure beez said but he still looked pretty crabby go get the keys i think theyre still on the cooler out in the garage or maybe on the hook in the game room somewhere down there anyway beez left the room heres the thing girls funzi said going to the corner of the room where he had thrown stellas holster he picked up the scissors examined them carefully admiring the curve of the blades then he came over and sat next to stella on the bed you ladies are the plussize variety thats a problem beez and i are gonna have a hard time carrying a couple of heifers like yourselves out of here so youre going to have to cooperate stella glared at funzi he was enjoying this having fun at their expense as if to confirm her suspicion he pulled the hair away from her face almost delicately and put the tip of the scissors to the edge of the duct tape gag slowly carefully he worked the blade under the edge of the tape and cut through it he was cutting into her skin too stella was pretty sure given the sharp pain she felt once he got the cut started he picked at a corner of the tape with his thumb and forefinger he leaned in close to her face and stella could smell him sweat and body odor and traces of some fruity aftershave there was a ripping sound and suddenly her face was a world of pain funzi had yanked the tape away in one furious motion and it felt like it had taken a couple of her stitches out and opened up all her gashes again and stripped a few layers of skin as well her lip dribbled blood no doubt split further than before she gasped involuntarily and then worked her jaw back and forth trying to get some sensation back into it not much of a looker is she funzi laughed addressing chrissy and pointing to stella with the scissors they say she took out her husband poor guy he probably wasnt sticking it to her enough that what got you so mad stella huh he chuckled at his own humor and stella squeezed the rotary cutter hard the handle sticky with her blood but its kind of hard to blame him i mean even without the shit kicked out of you its not like youre gonna win the miss world title you know now you pointing at chrissy with thumb and forefinger cocked gunstyle you got some potential i hope i didnt hurt your feelings calling you a heifer you see my wife see how damn skinny she is man she aint had anything decent to eat in years drives me batshit im like marie have a fucking french fry for christs sake more mirth funzi was able to amuse himself pretty easily yeah but i like you i do funzi said softly letting his gaze travel up and down chrissy nice and soft probably feel pretty good to sink into and youd have plenty to hang onto you know he leered suggestively but chrissy shot him a glance that stella figured made it pretty clear what she thought of the idea good girl she thought stay angry youre not her type stella muttered through her bloody lips you aint anybodys type cept your own too bad you couldnt just fuck yourself so you could be with someone who loves you back funzis eyebrows shot up and then he was laughing but his laughter had a hard mean edge to it now now see theres that bitterness again woman you are desperately in need of a good screwing but im sorry thats just not going to happen maybe in your next life the humorous tone was gone now he had lost his patience he was done playing with them and stella tensed sensing the moment was near you know he said pointing at chrissy again you ought to be thanking me your boys gonna have things youd never have been able to give him private school soccer and baseball decent clothes a car on his sixteenth birthday and you know what he leaned across stella getting as close to chrissys face as he could and it was clear that he was enjoying her pain enjoying dishing out the cruelty he wont remember you he said voice soft and silky dont fool yourself about that little episode a few minutes ago this time next week hell be calling me daddy stella found herself staring into his ear a fleshy large knobby thing with hair on the inside as she swung her arm from behind up and over in an arc she was able to make a detailed observation of funzis ear hairit was one of those moments that seems to stretch on forever even though it lasted a mere fraction of a second evidently funzi hadnt done any personal grooming in a while because the bristly black hairs were a quarter of an inch long as though he was growing a wire brush inside his ear and as stella brought the rotary cutter down across his neck and blood came flying out of the severed artery in a spray whose volume surprised even stella stella whod brought forth the blood of a dozen men before stella whod knocked the life blow by blow from her husbands cruel eyes the thought that went through her head in slow motion was that she might not be beautiful but because of her the world was going to be short one truly ugly son of a bitch funzi jerked back hands flying to his neck blood pumping between his scrabbling fingers as he tried to scoop it back in his eyes widened and his lips moved and some of the blood splashed across stellas face and more of it landed on her shirt as she instinctively pulled away there was blood on her lips she sputtered as some of it got in her mouth spat out the blood of the man whod wanted to kill her and she pulled her bound ankles in toward her body as far as she could and then kicked them hard and funzi was shoved off the bed onto the floor making choking sounds of horror all the way down from her peripheral vision stella saw beez burst into the room watched his glance fly from her to chrissy who was struggling to get up off the bed and funzi on the floor in his bath of blood twitching now fingers extended out stiffly eyes rolled back in his head beez had his gun up and got off a shot before stella could react and chrissy jerked back against the headboard a neat hole blossomed red in her chest and then she started to tilt slowly to the side stella dove off the bed on top of funzi reaching for the scissors that had fallen from his grasp onto the white carpet her fingers brushed against the blades as the sound of another shot exploded way too close as she grasped the handles there was another shot and she felt a giant wallop in her left shoulder and thought holy shit he got mebut she palmed the scissors rolling over onto her back on top of funzi as beez seemed to fly through the air toward her she grabbed the handle with both her bloody hands and held the scissors in front of her for a fraction of a second she saw beezs eyes widen as he flew toward her and then he crashed on top of her as the gun went off once more and the scissor handles jabbed hard into her sternum and knocked the wind out of her stella struggled against his weight trying to figure out if that last shot had connected but she was still moving her shoulder burned but she was moving she was kicking and clawing and holy mother she wanted to be out from under him and then she was crabscuttling away on her one good arm and only then did she see that the scissors were sunk into his throat and blood was leaking out fast beez lying now halfway on top of his boss on funzi the two of them going still and cold even as their blood continued to leak out if they werent dead yet they would be soon but what good was it going to do with chrissy dead and stella shot twice shot twice oh shit how had she been so lucky for so long how had it worked out that a washedup fuckedover driedout shell of a disappointed woman had managed to keep it going as long as she had and as her hands found the holes in her flesh felt her own blood leaking out heard her own whimpering stella knew the answer knew it as sure as shed known anything in her entire life shed had the luck of someone who just didnt care who didnt much give a damn if she lived another day who didnt believe life had any more gifts to give her who believed that death would be every bit as satisfying as rattling around that empty house as waking up in the early morning hours and feeling loneliness like a huge weight pressing on her chest and then shed gone and done the one thing that shed never thought she could do againshe had cared and caring was what had got her dead sweet fucking irony stella fell down in degrees feeling her strength ebb out as she grabbed for the bed frame felt it slip out of her fingers unable to hold on she felt woozy circling clouds of hot red in the outskirts of her vision there was no more movement from the men on the floor with an effort that felt like it took about a year stella forced herself away from them catching sight of funzis staring eyes no longer mean just empty slowly painfully she pushed herself to her forearms and looked over the bed chrissy lay on her side turned toward the wall away from stella her cap had come off and her pale curly hair spilled out prettily stella couldnt see the wound from here couldnt see the blood stella dragged herself the rest of the way up until she was almost sitting the crime scene guys were going to have a field day in herefour bodies all bleeding out by the time the cops came no one would be left to tell what happened and goatwould they call him was he going to have to see her like this banged up and wearing the blood of too many other people was that going to be what he remembered years from now when somebody happened to mention her name in passing from somewhere in the vicinity of her heart stella thought no it was a small notion but as she sat on funzis floor with a couple of holes in her it bloomed and grew until the word itself crowded out all her other thoughts and rang in her ears no it was too much it was just too damn much no shed been humiliated beaten taunted and now shot but no one not even the entire kansas city mob was going to leave little tucker motherless and take away stellas chance to get her hands on sheriff goat jones on the same day god damn she mouthed as she edged her way along the bed pulling at the frame with her fingers until the sidetable phone was in reach it took a couple of tries to get the receiver off the base and then stella sank back down on the floor exhausted from the effort of trying to stay upright she brought the phone close to her face and as the numbers swam blurrily she tried to remember where the hell shed left her reading glasses this time but she could see just well enough to press the buttons it took a while and she went slow because she wasnt sure she had the energy to do it twice if she messed up but then she heard goats voice goats sleepy deep sweet voice saying hello and stella closed her eyes and breathed through a smile come and get me big boy and then she let the clouds swirl on in nine when stella woke up she didnt open her eyes at first didnt quite feel up to the job with her head fuzzy as if it had been stuffed with fluffy cotton and the rest of her body suspended in a kind of swimmy grogginess then the pain made its appearance what it lacked in immediacy it made up for with sheer intensity it felt as though there were a burning ember on the left side of her stomach and a dull ache that radiated out from her shoulder her entire torso felt as if it had been stomped on by someone wearing heavy boots it took her only a few seconds to decide she wasnt dead whatever the afterlife held and stella didnt have any special convictions on the subject she did believe that it probably wouldnt include all this pain and sweaty nausea but what really convinced her was the smell a combination of industrial disinfectant bleach burned salisbury steak and an undercurrent of floral preservative had to be the hospital again goat must have come and got her that thought sparkled into her brain like silvery glitter bringing with it a little hoppityskip sensation in her gut she remembered dialing his number but it had taken a long time thoughts and images flashed by and stella tried to seize them and make sense of them but her thought processes seemed a bit compromised no doubt they had her pumped up full of all kinds of drugs which were preventing her from using all her powers of logic but a few things stood out now that she thought about it like the fact that shed been shot twice and hadnt she left most of her blood on the pale carpeting of funzis lake house the scene came back to her in fits and starts until after a dreamy little while stella remembered everything she moved her fingers under the hospital blanket to her stomach where the second bullet had slammed into her wasnt all that surprised to find a thick layer of bandages she tapped it experimentally and grimaced from the pain hopefully theyd dug that sucker out it and its twin lodged somewhere around her shoulder a location that seemed like too much trouble to explore right now didnt they leave the bullets in sometimes like if they were too close to an organ or something stella did not at all relish the thought of carrying around any souvenirs of the last few days something to ask the doctor about sighing stella opened her eyes the left one seemed more eager than the right but a little effort unstuck it and she found herself looking around at a room very similar to the one shed been inwhat was it two nights ago it felt like a hundred years had gone by this time chrissy wouldnt be arriving to spring her a thought that made her heart hurt shed be all alone in her room in sawyer county regional hospital a place shed visited dozens of times over the years funny how the humble act of everyday living brought her through the doors of this place from time to time everything from noelles stitches when she fell off a swing set to ollies emergency appendectomy to friends and neighbors gallbladder surgeries and hysterectomies and cancers and strokes and basic human frailty but before this week the only time she herself had been a patient was when noelle was born almost three decades ago stella remembered that the curtains had been yellow then thickwoven polyester things and the floor tiles had flecks of green in them and the trays they brought the food on were turquoise plastic shed stayed three days dozing and nursing and hobbling to the bathroom marveling all the while at the tiny little life shed brought into the world it had felt like a solo effort lots of men stayed in the waiting room during childbirth back then but ollie seemed uncomfortable not only with the babys arrival but with everything else about noelle he made only one appearance per day hands in pockets shifting from foot to foot uncomfortably and staring out the window declining to hold his daughter back then stellas room had a view of the parking lot now her view was of the tops of trees so she knew shed scored a room on the other side of the hospital complex the side that overlooked the little park where patients were taken in their wheelchairs to get some sun she was moving up in the world an iv cart stood next to the bed with a line that led under the covers stella flexed her fingerstried to at any rate but they were covered with something she pulled her hands out from under the covers and saw that they both had been bandaged and wrapped the right one with enough layers that it looked like a mitten the left wearing a wide band of dressing around the palm the iv entered her arm in a neat little taped hole gingerly stella tried to move her legs they felt as if they had fallen asleep but she saw the blanket shift a little on the bed that was good news she guessed it meant that neither bullet had nailed her spine sometimes bullets did all manner of pinballstyle ricocheting around in the flesh if the tv shows were to be believed she wondered if the little bits of metal had punched through any of her organs or sliced up a lung but decided shed be hooked up to more than just an iv if that were the case the longer she was awake the more stella was beginning to realize she didnt feel all that horrible she was going to pull through no doubt all that exercise had helped her body too strong and stubborn to succumb to a mere double shooting in fact if shed started weight watchers like she meant to six months ago shed probably be feeling even better but hey maybe this would be her wakeup call they always talked about wakeup calls on the latenight weightloss infomercials my reunion was coming up and i weighed eighty pounds more than i did my senior year some little stickthin gal would gush or my doctor said i was headed straight for typetwo diabetes if i didnt make some changes stella pictured herself sitting in an armchair staring into the camera with an unctuous host sticking a microphone in front of her shed say i got my face pounded to a pulp and then i got shot a couple times and nearly bled to death in the middle of a hotbed of organized crime some wakeup call that would be the thought made her frown frowning it turned out hurt like a bitch sharp pain seared along the tender skin of her lips and around her forehead and along the lines of her stitches hell she probably had a whole new set of stitches by now she probably looked like she was sporting zippers in every direction across her face or maybe they just took a staple gun to her pushed that flap of skin in place and let fly why not might as well save the nitpicky detail work for a case where they could actually make a difference stella put the fingers of her left hand gingerly to her face and made an exploration and it felt as if she hadnt been far off the ridges and bumps and sharp little knots were an unfamiliar landscape with bulges and valleys nowhere near where they ought to be stella sighed and put her hands back on top of the cool sheets so her face was wrecked so what it would heal she was trying so hard not to think of the other thing the thing that had been slinking along the edges of her mind ever since she first woke up the thought shed taken down with her as she first sank into unconsciousness and which had featured in her hazy troubled dreams as she came out of anesthesia there was no keeping it at bay any longer chrissy chrissy braver than stella had ever imagined fearless to the end beautiful in her fury rosebud lips focused in a deadly frown of concentration those cornflower blue eyes glinting with fearless determination stella knew that even as she took the bullet even as she fell chrissy hadnt faltered stellas grief welled up and it was stronger than any of the other emotions shed experienced so far shed sworn she would never again endanger a woman while doing her job but somehow along the way the task of finding tucker had seized them both and thrown them together on this desperate journey and it was only together that they had been able to get as far as they had stella didnt regret taking the girl along with herit was no more an option for chrissy to stay home than it was for stella to turn away when chrissy had first arrived at her door theyd given their all she was sure of that stella knew that neither of them had held anything back that theyd put fear behind them and barreled ahead knowing the situation could end up like this if only things had worked out differently the fact that chrissy was the one to go down and stay downit didnt seem right stella should have been the one who died no one needed her no one waited for her and besides shed rolled the dice more than most people ever had a chance to taking risks scraping through situations that by all rights should have ended in disaster why couldnt chrissy have been the lucky one this time stella heard soft voices in the hall and then the door to her room was pushed open wide and a young woman with spiked magenta hair came into the room dropped the paper cup she was holding and burst into tears noelle baby girl stella said surprised to find that her voice was nothing more than a scratchy whisper and she held out her arms and her sweet grownup angel girl rushed straight into them laying her head on stellas chest and immediately jerking back with a shriek which might have been a good thing on balance since the pressure of the embrace felt like an axe cleaving stellas flesh but she needed to hold her daughter and she grasped noelles hands and tugged her back very gently noelle knelt down next to the bed and laid her cheek on stellas arm blinking tears from her big violet eyes mama she said what on earth have you gone and done she sounded so distraught so dismayed that stella had to laugh it was a hurtin little laugh bumpy and rough but it felt good just makin trouble sugar im sorry to say it but i cant seem to stay away from it oh mama noelle said you look just awful you had me so scared when the sheriff called me i sheriff jones yes he called this morning when i was getting ready to go to the shop he said you were trying to rescue a kidnapped baby and got all shot up did they find him stella asked quickly the baby noelles pretty worried face flashed confusion and she shook her head there wasnt any baby mama nobody found anything like that the sheriff said he seemed mighty concerned about that part stellas heart which had been thrumming along with renewed vigor to see noelle gave a lurch so after all this poor tucker was still missing theyd failed if it hadnt been for her daughter warm and real and close enough to touch stella might have rolled over and prayed her way back to numb unconscious instead she forced a ghost of a smile onto her lips and told a mothers lie thats all right sweetheart sheriff offered to send somebody over to get me noelle said but i just jumped in the car and came straight here mama i been here for hours waitin on you to wake up and now alls i did was go get a cup of coffee and i wasnt gone but a minute and look at you wakin up when i was out of the room this brought a fresh onslaught of tears and stella reached to brush them off noelles cheek her daughters skin was soft and creamy as beautiful as it had always been and stella let her fingers linger there her heart swelling with the knowledge that one thing shed done anyway had turned out better than she ever could have dreamed how long have i been out anyway she asked it was hard to tell if the light in the room signaled morning or afternoon what time is it its almost three they took you to surgery as soon as they got you in here but time i got over here you were in recovery stella thought of the thick dressing on her stomach the pain in her shoulder how bad am i she asked oh mama they said you were just incredibly lucky noelle exclaimed it was smallcaliber bullets and the one in your shoulder just chipped your clavicle the bullet came out the other side so they didnt have to hunt for it but they had to dig around in there for the little bone pieces but they did it artherarther arthroscopically right i just cant seem to get that out so you just got a few stitches there and the one in your stomach why alls it did was kind of bounce off your spleen is what the doctor told me they had to take out the bullet and repair some blood vessels but they say your spleenll fix itself right back up youre just going to be mighty tender there for a while yeah i can tell stella said grimacing do i have to stay here much longer just a few days mama and then im going to take you home and take care of you and make sure you dont go jumping up trying to do too much before the doctor says its okay noelles declaration was so lovely and so unexpected that stella couldnt think of any kind of response noelle coming home even if it was just for a while was a gift shed stopped hoping for long ago thats some hairdo you got there baby girl she said instead the last time shed seen noelle at the sawyer county fair last september her daughter had a yellowblond bob with long pieces coming down past her chin and the back trimmed up short to the nape of her neck in stellas view her daughter would be gorgeous even shaved bald but noelle did manage to come up with unusual things to do to her hair that day at the fair stella stopped in the middle of the throng of people unable to move forward her friend dotty edwards chattering on about how shed been robbed in the jam competition and noelle had turned in the bright early autumn sun and caught sight of her mother for a fraction of a second the two women had stared at each other across the crowd of fairgoers amid the screeches from the midway and the sweethay smell from the animal barns and then noelle had dashed off looking stricken and stella had made her excuses to dotty and gone home with a headache all those months ago months that had gone by without seeing her daughter without talking to her without having a chance to hug her and hold her the loss of it seized up in stellas throat and she realized that no matter what she was going to do whatever it took to stay in her girls life noelle touched the spiky top of her head selfconsciously i got an award mama she said shyly i did this competition up in kansas city with this new amino glycine color process and i got the judges choice i mean it didnt come with any cash or anything but i got two hundred dollars in product and my pictures going to be in midwest salon magazine oh thats wonderful sweetie stella said pride swelling up in her battered chest could iwhen it comes outdo you think i could have a copy the leaky tears noelle had already produced were nothing compared to the torrent she unleashed then her face crumpled and she buried it into the crook of stellas elbow and sobbed mama ive been so terrible to you and i just missed you so much and i dont know why i was that way just everything that happened you know and ii she finally pulled away her face damp and splotchy and smeared with mascara and went for the tissue box and snuffled and wiped at herself until she had most of her composure back stella waited patiently choking back a tear or two herself im sorry noelle she said you havent had an easy go of it and i havent been you know mother of the year noelle shook her head dont mama lets not even talk about the past okay its justi mean stella reached for the girls hand and squeezed it noelle picked at the blanket for a minute frowning mama she said im not seeing gerald anymore that guy you know my boyfriend relief and surprise flooded stella but she was careful not to react shed made the mistake of throwing in her two cents a few times too often to risk doing it now are you all right with that sugar she asked noelle snorted in disgust more than okay justi just wanted you to know i mean i dont know if im even going to date at all anymore you know its all so she made a helpless gesture and glanced at her mother tentatively stellas heart contracted she knew all too well how it felt when you realized that the man who shared your bed wasnt who you thought he was how it felt when your hopes and illusions slowly shriveled and died all that trust all that hard work going into the hopeless project of making a broken relationship keep rolling along on sprung wheels rejecting the whole mess might be a sign of sanity but still the thought of noelle barely a grown woman shutting herself off from love hurt stella to the core maybe dont give up completely she suggested oh i forgot the sheriff s out in the waiting room mama he wanted me to come get him the minute you woke up he is yeah hes been here almost the whole time he had to go on some call or something and hes been in to see that other girl a bunch of times but wait stella said grabbing noelles arm what other girl that got shot with you you know that lardner girl chrissys alive stellas heart did a somersault her throat dry she didnt dare hope but um i mean shes alive but theybutmama im so sorry they dont know if shes going to make it she barely had a pulse when they got there and the bullet went through her lung and there was some problems with her heart and they got her on all these machines slowly stella relaxed her grip on noelles arm she nodded once all right chrissy had made it this far good girl she thought fiercely there probably wasnt a betting pool in the hospital but if there were stella would put all her chips on chrissy shes a good kid she said i think youll like her for a moment noelles expression wavered her smile slipping her eyes going a little opaque and stella realized something surprising noelle was jealous just a tiny bit maybe she wasnt even aware of it but it was there nonetheless i know youll like her stella said quickly shes not smart like a whip the way you are and shes still got some growing up to do but i think shes got potential noelle nodded and the worried expression relaxed well maybe when this is all over i mean when you get out of here i can bring you to visit her or something yeah stella said id like that there was a silence but it was a nice one i think im supposed to tell the nurse youre awake noelle said after a while and you know fetch sheriff jones speaking of that stella said look i dont know how to put this exactly but i imagine i look pretty terrible and with you being an expert and all do you think you could do a little fixing up before he comes in here i mean strictly for practical reasons she added hastily im going to come out of this with a lot of explaining to do and ill probably end up in court or jail or something and you know seems like i ought to get off on the right foot with goat uh with the sheriff jail noelle demanded eyes widening mama they cant put you in jail those guys were the worst kind of criminal the sheriff told mei mean theyre like the mafia mama up in the city sheriff told you that stella asked hopefully yeah and whats with noelle broke off and studied her mother carefully the scrutiny was uncomfortable stella flinched at noelles unwavering examination suddenly her daughter raised one eyebrow and cracked a small grin huh well i got my makeup kit in my purse lets see what we can do he stared stella kept the determined smile fixed on her face trying to ignore the uncomfortable tugging of her stitches the warm buttery weight of the concealer and foundation and whatever else noelle had dabbed on her and waited for goat to say something but he just kept staring hed walked into the room two three steps then sputtered to a halt a good three feet away from the bed his big hand went to the back of his neck as though to brace himself and he grimaced eyes crinkling up to glinty iceblue slits damn it goat stella finally said could you say something please i just got done taking two bullets i dont think im up for carrying the conversation you know goat snapped to life as though a switch had been turned on his look of detached horror was replaced by a weak smile he grabbed the visitors chair and spun it around backward straddling it with his long legs jutting out at angles and his arms draped across the chair back im glad youre not dead stella gave the smile one last surge and then let it collapse her facial muscles crying out in protest yeah me too you had me worried uh stella licked her lips tasting breath mints and the waxy gloss noelle had brushed on so when i called you from funzis we got it traced to the lake house right away and ogden county responded lights and sirens they made it in less than ten minutes i was probably fifteen minutes behindi gotta tell you i burned rubber goat blinked hard and a pink flush warmed his cheeks it was some kind of mess stella when it went out on the scanner fire service picked it up and they came on back i dont even know how many paramedics there were and the coroner and the crime scene techsive never seen anything like it what about you know the scene in the bedroom i couldnt get anywhere close until the emts got you and chrissy on the bus they had to move the other bodies to get the stretchers in and get you and chrissy tubed and loaded up so by the time the first guys on the scene and the paramedics had been in and out of that room it wasnt much of a crime scene anymore if you know what i mean was there any sign of tucker at all no except it looks like they had him sleeping in one of the guest rooms there was some toys all new stuff a few new outfits in a drawersome even still had the tags on did you see him in the house at all stella gave him an edited version of marie leaving the house with tucker in her arms and passed along the few details shed overheard the escalade the town house ill get the word out goat promised but she could be anywhere by now i know stella said sadly she was silent for a moment considering how little there was to go on did they retrieve anything useful goat wrinkled his forehead they took quite a few things out of there took em forever just to bag and tag it all they just let me stay as a courtesy you know so i couldnt give you the specifics lets see there were all the guns there was a knife and some sort of sewing implement i know theyre having a devil of a time trying to figure out what went with who stella swallowed hard and tried to arrange her face in an expression of confusion i just wish i could remember what happened you know its just all so hazy goat regarded her solemnly for what seemed like hours stella was aware of noelle standing off to the side looking from one of them to the other like a spectator at a tennis match the poor girl was no doubt bewildered so goat finally said why dont you just tell me about what you do remember going back to when they kidnapped you and chrissy stella started to correct him but thats when she noticed the eyebrows goats beautiful expressive eyebrows were tilted askew which along with his faint grin gave him a rakish expression as she was trying to puzzle out his meaning he winked at her kidnapped by funzi in my own car she said and then elaborated making it up as she went um from my house chrissy took me back to the house after she sprung me from the hospital and you know we just rested the rest of the day we were getting ready to watch a little tv and i guess i uh left the back door open and suddenly there they were i mean chrissy and i didnt stand a chance that goat said carefully must have been terrifying youre telling me why there was nothing to do but go along with them not make a fuss them being armed and all i mean the weapons they found at the scene knives and handguns and pistols and i dont know whatall goat said it was just a real wide range of firepower you know stella shrugged i guess maybe funzi was a what do you call it gun fancier goat snorted okay that might have been pushing it a little if mine and chrissys prints were to show up on any of those she said carefully yeah now that was a concern of mine frankly goat said but i figure you all obviously gave them quite a battle grabbing at everything in sight who knows what you would have touched besides there was a hell of a lot of matter on everything its not clear whether the evidence is going to give up much in the way of prints stella swallowed she remembered trying to hang on to the handle of the rotary cutter with her hands slick with blood remembered looking up into the snub barrel of funzis handgun now the scene in the back yard thats sure got everyone scratching their heads oh stella said um what did they findwhat happened in the back yard well its a puzzler there was a struggle back there thats for sure lots of blood trace though somebody hosed it down see there was a fire earlier in the evening like i mentioned with the fire department called out and all just a little structure fire on the back side it got put out pretty quick duty boys barely logged it but get this we found roy dean shaw shot dead and stuffed in a landscape box no kidding stella said faintly how on earth i wonder i mean he must have done something to piss off funzi goat said but we just cant figure what it was you know i mean maybe it was some sort of doubledealingwe got some leads that he was doing work for that outfit oh by the way theres a team out at bennings now digging up pieces of a body must be somebody else that ticked him off theres a thousand things when you get down to it that can get you in bad with the boss you know ii just wish i could remember stella said i mean if i could remember what happened after they took us to that house yeah that would sure clear up some things goat said but if it aint happenin it aint happenin the brain is a mysterious thing yeah stella agreed very mysterious and you know that wasnt the only strange thing about today goat said i found something real interesting sitting on my doorstep when i went home to take a shower awhile ago shit stella had forgotten all about patrick the kid had been laid out on the chaise since the middle of last night he would have woken up at some point with a hell of a headache wondering where he was and how he got there was hewas it i think somebody left it there by accident he continued ignoring her clearly this thing didnt belong there and it was in kinda bad shape i fixed it up as good as i could put a fresh shine on it and took it back to its rightful owner he put extra emphasis on the last words fixing her with an intent stare and then he winked and the corner of his mouth twitched and under all the layers of gauze and bandages and tape and antiseptic gel stella felt a little stirring a little warmth a little reminder that there was at least one darn good reason to hurry up and get better and did she the rightful ownerpatricks mother it had to be was the owner happy to have this thing back yup i think its safe to say shes gonna take real real good care of it not let it out of her sight you know stella tried to absorb what goat was telling her hed been hinting pretty broadly that he was ignoring and willfully misinterpreting the evidence laid out at the funzi place that was bad enough but freeing patrick had to add up to evidence tampering or worse if hed told the boy to keep his mouth shutthat might be considered a threat goat was riding straight into a storm without an umbrella and he was doing it for her her gut flipflopped over again that trick with the rotary cutterthat was really something goat continued oh uh now that you mention it seems like i might have had that on me took us a little while to figure out you know it has that retractable blade and all plus it was pink we had to call a gal from joann fabrics up in fayette to explain that one they stared at each other and then goat gave a little chuckle nothing more than relief it sounded like but it was contagious and stella couldnt help joining in though she had to be careful because of the pain in her stomach it benefits breast cancer research she finally said we carry a whole line of pink accessories down at the shop ill make a note goat said maybe i ought to come check it out you know the whole sewing thing goat jones stella said coquettishly batting her eyelids as well as she could given the fact that they were swollen nearly shut and gluey with noelles eye shadow and mascara are you one of these pathetic men who cant sew on a button to save his life as she watched goats broad handsome face slowly reddened starting at his cheeks and spreading out to his ears and up to his lovely smooth scalp he opened his mouth to say something and closed it again then he shrugged guilty well about time we take care of that dont you think you off erin me sewing lessons stella hardesty stella smiled for real this time searing pain in her lips be damned i might be she said what have you got to trade goat grinned back i dont know stella he said his voice low and rough just the way she liked it i have half a mind to paddle you out to this little spot i know ten stella was trying to nap the next morning breathing the cloying scent of flowers and wishing evil on the nurses whod come in every few hours during the night to poke and prod her with any luck shed be out of here in another couple of days but she planned to return fortified with snacks and celebrity magazines to set up camp in chrissys room apparently chrissy had woken up for a few minutes early in the morning stella was torn between dismay at not having been there and enormous relief when the shift nurse described how chrissy looked around the room and asked where she was the doctor said it would probably go like that for a while little lucid periods and lots of sleep while chrissys body made up its mind to start rebuilding the destruction the bullet had wreaked on her innards stella let her eyes flutter slowly open and noticed that there were even more flowers than when last she drifted off lots of her wellwishers had remained anonymous stella figured her past clients had heard about her troubles but the biggest arrangement was from goat it was a funnylooking thing giant pink and green caladium leaves with white roses delphinium and shasta daisies all my favorites hed confided embarrassed when he stopped last night as he was heading home for the day i had em make it up special then theyd stared at each other for a while not saying much while noelle watched from her chair a knowing little smile on her face noelle had finally gone home this morning after spending the night on a cot she said shed be back after a showerwith doughnuts stella pressed the button to lift the back of the bed slowly gliding to a more upright position her stomach if possible hurt worse today but the shoulder throbbed a little bit less and her face was more itchy than anything noelle had removed the makeup carefully dabbing with swabs and cotton squares and then spent forever massaging cream in between the stitches stella hoped she wasnt having some sort of allergic reaction thered be hell to pay with her doctor whod practically blown a gasket when she saw the makeup stella was reaching for the clicker figuring shed see what the fuss over the view was about these days when noelle walked in the door carrying a baby stellas mind did a loopdeloop and then she recognized the familiar shock of whiteblond fluffy hair and said is that who i think it is noelle turned the little guy around in her arms he was rubbing at sleepy eyes with a fist yawning showing a pair of tiny white teeth mama a lady came by the house this morning and dropped this little fella off she said i should bring him to you holy shit stella breathed her heart leaping mama not in front of a child noelle scolded covering one of tuckers perfect little shell ears with her hand while they made their way down the hall stella going as fast as she could while limping and dragging her iv drip noelle said the lady looked as if she hadnt had a decent meal in a year but was dressed nice and driving a new escalade and that she said stella would know what to do where was she going stella asked i didnt ask her noelle said exasperated i was still trying to figure out what to do with this guy you know stella shut her mouth but not before noticing that noelle seemed to be finding her way around a baby without too much trouble maybe shed make stella a grandma someday the notion wasnt entirely unpleasant stella pushed open the door to chrissys room and tucker took one look at the sleeping woman and made a sound that was half burp and half exclamation and then he leaned out of noelles arms like he wanted to fly through the air to his mother noelle sat gingerly on the bed just as chrissys eyes fluttered open and then she saw her baby and cracked a smile that couldnt have been lovelier if shed been the mona lisa herself stella watching from the foot of the bed holding her gown shut with one hand and the iv pole with the other beaten and bruised and smelling of a couple hard days got a little sniffly and figured shed never seen anything prettier good job she
