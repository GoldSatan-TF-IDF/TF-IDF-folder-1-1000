jack higgins edge of danger paul rashid was one of the richest englishmen in the world he was also half arab and few people could tell you which influence most ruled his heart pauls father had been the leader of the rashid bedouin in the province of hazar in the persian gulf and a soldier by both birth and tradition sent as a young man to the royal military academy at sandhurst he had met lady kate dauncey the earl of loch dhus daughter at a formal dance there he was wealthy and handsome and despite the obvious problems it was a love match and so despite the initial misgivings of both sets of parents they had married pauls father travelling back and forth between england and the gulf as necessary over the years they had produced four children paul the eldest michael george and kate the children were intensely proud of both sides of their family in deference to their illustrious omani past they all spoke fluent arabic and were bedu to the heart but as paul rashid would say their english half was just as important and they fiercely guarded the dauncey name and their heritage as one of englands oldest families the two traditions flowed together in their blood the medieval british and the bedouin producing a general fierceness that was most remarked upon in paul and was perhaps best epitomized by an extraordinary incident that occurred when paul was himself about to pass out of sandhurst hed just gone home for a few days leave michael was eighteen at the time george seventeen and kate twelve the earl was away in london and paul had gone down to hampshire and found his mother in the library of dauncey place with a badly bruised face she had reached to hug him and it was kate whod said he punched her paul that awful man punched mummy paul turned to michael and said carefully explain travellers his brother told him a bunch of them moved into roundhay spinney with four caravans and some horses their dogs killed our ducks and mother went to speak to them you let her go alone no we all went even kate the men laughed at us and then when mother started shouting at them their leader a large man very tall very aggressive punched her in the face paul rashids own face was very pale the eyes dark as he stared at michael and george so this animal laid hands on our mother and you let it happen he slapped them both you have two hearts a rashids and a daunceys now i will show you how to be true to both his mother grabbed his sleeve please paul no more trouble its not worth it not worth it his smile was terrible there is a dog here who needs a lesson i intend to give him one and he turned and led the way out they drove to roundhay spinney in a land rover the three boys paul had forbidden kate to come but after they left she saddled her favourite mare and followed anyway galloping across country they found the caravans parked in a circle with a large wood fire in the centre and a dozen or so men and women grouped around it along with several children four horses and dogs the large man described by the two younger boys sat on a box by the fire drinking tea he looked up as the three young men approached and who might you be my family owns dauncey place oh dear mr highandmighty is it he laughed at the others looks more like a prick to me at least i dont punch women in the face i try to act like a man which is more than anyone can say about you you made a mistake you piece of dung that lady was my mother why you little shite the large man started and never finished paul rashids hand went into the deep pocket of his barbour and pulled out a jambiya the curved knife of the bedu his brothers followed suit as the other men moved in paul slashed with the jambiya down the left side of the large mans skull slicing off the ear one of the other men pulled a knife from his pocket and michael rashid filled with energy he had never known slashed sideways with his own jambiya cutting open the mans cheek sending him howling with pain one of the others picked up a branch and used it as a club to strike at george but kate rashid ran from where shed been hiding picked up a rock and hurled it into his face with a shrill cry in arabic as quickly as it had begun it was over the rest of the group stood warily in silence not even the women and children crying out and suddenly the skies opened and rain poured down the leader held a soiled handkerchief to his ear or what was left of it and groaned ill get you for this no you wont paul rashid said because if you ever come near this estate or my mother again it wont be your other ear youll lose it will be your private parts he wiped his jambiya on the mans coat then produced a walther pistol from his pocket and fired twice into the side of the kettle over the fire water poured out and the flames began to subside ill give you one hour to clear out i believe the national health hospital in maudsley covers even scum like you but do take me seriously he paused if you and your friends ever bother my mother again i will kill you nothing is more certain the three young men drove away through the rain kate following on her horse the rain was relentless as they entered the village of dauncey and drove up to the pub named the dauncey arms paul braked outside they got out and kate slid off her mare and tied her to a small tree she stood looking at them in the rain her face troubled im sorry that i disobeyed you brother but paul kissed her on both cheeks and said you were wonderful little sister he held her for a moment as his brothers looked on then released her and its high time you had your first glass of champagne inside the pub were beamed ceilings a marvellous old mahogany bar ranged with bottles and a huge log fire in the grate half a dozen local men at the bar turned then took off their caps the landlady betty moody whod been polishing glasses looked up and said why paul her familiarity was expected she had known all of them since childhood had even been pauls nurse for a time i didnt know you were home an unexpected visit betty there were some things i needed to take care of her eyes were hard like those bastards at roundhay spinney how on earth do you know about them not much gets by me not here at the arms theyve been bothering people in the neighbourhood for weeks well they wont be a problem to anybody betty not any more he placed his jambiya on the bar there was a sound of vehicles passing outside and one of the men went to the window he turned well ill be damned all they shites be on their way out yes well they would be michael said betty put down a glass no one loves you more than i paul rashid no one except your blessed mother but i do recall your temper have you been a naughty boy again kate said the awful man attacked mummy he beat her the bar was silent and betty moody said he what its all right paul cut his ear off so theyve gone away kate smiled he was wonderful the silence in the bar was intense she wasnt too bad herself paul rashid said as it turns out our little kate is very handy with a rock so betty love lets open a bottle of champagne i think copious helpings of shepherds pie wouldnt come amiss either she reached over and touched his face ah paul i should have known anything else yes im going back to sandhurst tomorrow could you find time to see if mother needs any help oh and excuse the fact that the child here is too young to be in the bar of course on both counts she opened the fridge and took out a bottle of bollinger she patted kate on the head get behind the bar with me girl that makes it legitimate as she thumbed off the cork she smiled at paul all in the family eh paul always he said later after the meal and the champagne he led the way across the road and through the graveyard to the porched entrance of the dauncey parish church which dated from the twelfth century it was very beautiful with an arched ceiling and the rain having stopped a wonderful light coming in through the stained glass windows and falling across the pews and the marble gravestones and carved figures that were the memorials of the dauncey family across the centuries their peerage was a scottish one sir paul dauncey it had been until the death of queen elizabeth and then when king james vi of scotland became james i of england his good friend sir paul dauncey was one of those who galloped from london to edinburgh to tell him james i had made him earl of loch dhu the black loch or the place of dark waters in the western highlands as it usually rained six days out of seven though the daunceys had understandably remained at dauncey place leaving only a small brokendown castle and estate at loch dhu the one signal difference between scottish and english peerages was that the scottish title did not die with the male heirs if there were none it could be passed through the female line thus when the earl died his mother would become countess he himself would receive the courtesy title of viscount dauncey the other boys would be honourables and young kate would become lady kate and one day paul too would be earl of loch dhu their footsteps echoed as they walked along the aisle paul paused beside a lovely piece of carving a knight in armour and his lady i think he would have been pleased today dont you he recited part of the family catechism familiar to all of them sir paul dauncey who fought for richard iii at the battle of bosworth field then cut his way out and escaped to france and later henry tudor allowed him back young kate said and restored his estates which inspired our family motto michael addedi always return and always have paul pulled kate close and put his arm about his brothers always together we are rashid and we are dauncey always together he hugged them fiercely and kate cried a little and held him tight after sandhurst paul was commissioned into the grenadier guards did a tour in ireland and then in ninetyone was pulled into the gulf war by the sas this was ironic because his father was an omani general a friend of saddam husseins who had been seconded to the iraqi army for training purposes and found himself caught up in the war as well on the other side no one questioned pauls loyalty however for the sas behind the iraqi lines paul rashid was a priceless asset and when the war ended he was decorated his father however died in action for his part paul accepted the situation father was a soldier and he took a soldiers risks he told his two brothers and sister i am a soldier and do the same michael and george also went to sandhurst afterwards michael went to harvard business school and george into the parachute regiment where he did his own tour in ireland one year was enough however he left the army and joined a course in estate management as for young kate after st pauls girls school she went to st hughs college oxford then moved into her wild period carving her way through london society like a tornado when the earl died in it was totally unexpected the kind of heart attack that strikes without warning and kills in seconds lady kate was now the countess of loch dhu and they laid the old man to rest in the family mausoleum in dauncey churchyard the entire village turned up and many outsiders people paul had never met in the great hall at dauncey place where the reception was held paul went in search of his mother and found one such person leaning over her a man in his late middle age paul stood close by as his mother glanced up paul dear id like you to meet one of my oldest friends brigadier charles ferguson ferguson took his hand i know all about you im grenadier guards myself that job you did behind iraqi lines with colonel tony villiers was fantastic a military cross wasnt enough you know colonel villiers paul asked we go back a long way you seem to know a lot brigadier that sas operation was classified his mother said charles and your grandfather soldiered together funny places aden the oman borneo malaya now he runs a special intelligence outfit for the prime minister kate you shouldnt say that ferguson told her nonsense she said everyone who is anyone knows she took his hand he saved your grandfathers life in borneo he saved mine twice ferguson kissed her on the forehead then turned to paul if theres anything i can do for you heres my card paul rashid held his hand firmly you never know brigadier i may take you up on that some day being the eldest paul was selected to go to london to consult with the family lawyer about the late earls will and when he returned late in the evening he found the family seated by the fire in the great hall they all looked up expectantly so what happened michael asked ah as you are the one whos been to harvard business school you mean how much he leaned down and kissed his mother on the cheek mother as usual has been very naughty and did not prepare me for what michael asked the extent of grandfathers position i never knew that he owned large portions of mayfair about half of park lane for starters george whispered what are we talking about three hundred and fifty million there was a gasp from his sister his mother simply smiled and it gives me an idea paul said a way to put this money to good use what are you suggesting michael asked i did irish time after sandhurst paul said then the gulf with the sas my right shoulder still aches on a bad day from the armalite bullet that drove through it you did sandhurst michael and harvard business school george a year in ireland with one para kate has yet to make her bones but i think we can count on her michael said you still havent told us your idea its this its time we banded together made ourselves a family business a force to be reckoned with who are we we are dauncey and we are also rashid nobody has more influence in the gulf than we do and what does the world want most from the gulf right now oil the americans and russians in particular have been nosing around the gulf for months trying to buy up exploration leases but to get to that oil they have to acquire the goodwill of the bedu and to get to the bedu they have to get through us they must come to us my family george said what are we talking about here their mother laughed i think i know paul said tell them two billion three he said sterling of course not dollars he picked up a bottle of champagne i am after all a very british arab with shrewd investment and the muscle of the bedu behind them the rashids pushed the development of new oilfields north of the dhofar money poured in unbelievable amounts the americans and russians did indeed have to deal with them albeit unwillingly and the rashids helped iraq restore its oil industry as well the first billion was realized in three years the second in two and they were well on their way to the third george and michael were named joint managing directors of rashid investments and young kate rashid now with her oxford ma became executive chairman any businessman who thought her simply a lovely young woman in an armani suit and manolo blahnik shoes was swiftly disabused of the notion paul himself preferred to remain a shadowy figure behind the scenes he spent much time in hazar with the bedu to the rashid he was a great warrior who would appear every so often to roam the desert by camel to live in the old bedu way in the empty quarter guarded by fellow tribesmen burned by the fierce sun to eat dates and dried meat with them often he was accompanied by his brothers or by kate who scandalized the locals with her western ways but no one could deny her for by now her brother was a legend with more power than even the sultan in hazar to whom he was a second cousin it was whispered that some day he would be voted sultan himself by the council of elders but for now the old sultan still held power his chief strength the hazar scouts a contingent of soldiers officered by british volunteers and then came the night when at an encampment at the oasis of shabwa as he was seated by a blazing fire a hawk helicopter came roaring in and settled in a cloud of sand camels and donkeys milled around children cried out in delight and women scolded them michael george and kate emerged in arab dress and paul greeted them what is this a family reunion kate said weve got trouble he took her hand led her to the fire and waved to one of the women to bring coffee kate nodded to michael tell him your bit first michael said weve cracked three billion so we finally made it paul turned id be happier about it if i wasnt waiting for the bad news go on kate i only have to look at your face to know if the weather is bad and id say its raining have you seen the sultan recently no hes been on a pilgrimage to the holy wells the holy wells thats a laugh his only pilgrimage was to dubai to meet with american and russian government and businessmen theyve agreed on joint exploration rights in hazar without us paul said but they couldnt possibly do it without bedu cooperation and they cant get that without us paul kate said they can and they have the sultans sold us out you know how much the americans and russians have disliked dealing with us well now theyve cut us out theyre going to walk all over us and walk all over the bedu in the process without us those damned oilmen are going to drill wherever they please and the arabs can go to hell paul said is this true michael michael nodded they are going to rape the desert paul and theres not a damned thing we can do about it paul nodded thoughtfully and stirred the fire do not speak in haste michael there are always things that can be done if one has the will what do you mean george asked not now said paul he turned to kate do you have the gulfstream at the air force base in haman yes kate said he drew her up and kissed her on the forehead have a good night tomorrow we will speak he nodded to his brothers and they all rose kate turned and began to walk away and it was then that it happened beyond from the shadows a bedu emerged screaming a curved jambiya raised above his head running straight at them with kate in his way pauls guards were caught momentarily unaware their aks at their feet coffee cups in their hands and it was paul rashid who flung himself forward knocked his sister to the ground and pulled a browning from his waistband he fired four times quickly and the assassin was driven to the sand there was another shrill cry and a second man jambiya raised emerged from the darkness but this time he was instantly overwhelmed by the guards alive paul called in arabic alive he turned to george who is he where does he come from find out george ran to the struggling group as they held the man down and paul helped kate up are you all right youre not harmed she held him close and spoke in arabic no my brother thanks to you he embraced her leave this to me go to bed she turned reluctantly and paul rashid went into the shadows and squatted beside the second assassin now pegged out on the ground the mans face was lined and drawn the pupils of his eyes were like pinpricks and there was foam around his mouth a hired assassin drugged with quat george said paul rashid lit a cigarette and nodded quat was a narcotic found in the leaves of shrubs in hazar many of his people were addicted to it for some it lent false courage for this man it would lend only death do what you have to do he said to george he went back and sat by the fire drank more coffee and kate appeared and sat at his side a cry of pain came from the shadows a sudden scream then silence george and michael appeared so paul asked the sultan arranged it for the americans and russians they couldnt afford us staying alive what a pity for them paul rashid said that they failed there was a pause michael and george sat down what happens now george asked first i think its time for a new sultan your speciality is working with our people in hazar paul told him see to it but theres a larger issue at stake do we let these mighty powers do this to our people do we let them destroy our land do we let them strike at us no i think we must strike at them at that moment his mobile phone rang he took it from his robe rashid he sat there in the firelight and his face changed before them his eyes turning to bleak holes he said well be there as soon as possible he switched off the phone and handed it to kate call haman tell them to have the gulfstream ready for immediate departure were leaving in the helicopter now but paul why what happened kate demanded that was betty moody something terrible has happened to mother something terrible indeed driving home to dauncey place lady kate had been involved in a headon collision with a car driving on the wrong side of the road the rashids made it to the hospital ten minutes before she died time enough only to stand the four of them and hold her hands my lovely boys lady kate said in her bad arabic always the family joke my gorgeous girl always love each other and she was gone michael and george broke into a storm of weeping but not kate she clutched pauls hand as he leaned down to kiss his mothers forehead and her eyes burned but there were no tears those would come later after she discovered the man responsible for this but when the name came there was only more bad news a chief inspector of the hampshire police told them that yes the other driver one igor gatov had been driving on the wrong side of the road on his way to london from knotsley hall which was owned by the russian embassy and yes he had most certainly been drunk and miraculously had been able to walk away from the crash with only minor injuries but unfortunately he was also a commercial attache at the russian embassy in london which meant that he had diplomatic immunity their mothers killer could not be tried in an english court in deference to their mothers christianity they buried her in the mausoleum at dauncey village church on a march afternoon one of the most important imams in london graced the proceedings with his presence and standing there the three rashid brothers and young kate had never felt closer later at the reception in the great hall at dauncey place paul rashid was approached by charles ferguson the brigadier said this is a rotten business paul im so sorry she was a great lady kate said do you know something youre not telling us brigadier ferguson looked at her give me a call sometime he walked away kate said paul as soon as were done here her brother said well go and see him two days later paul and kate rashid arrived at charles fergusons georgian flat in cavendish place london they were admitted by fergusons gurkha manservant kim and found that ferguson was not alone two other people were there one of them a small man his hair so fair that it was almost white lady kate this is sean dillon who works for my department ferguson said then introduced the other a redhaired woman detective superintendent hannah bernstein from special branch lord loch dhu how can i help may we offer you a glass of champagne no thank you my sister perhaps but i would prefer a bushmills irish whiskey like the one mr dillon is pouring good man yourself dillon told him but first the ladies and he poured champagne hannah bernstein said to kate you went to oxford i believe i was at cambridge myself well thats not your fault kate said and gave a small smile her brother said i did irish time with the grenadier guards and the sas i heard many things about sean dillon there probably all true hannah bernstein told him with an undertone rashid could not decipher dont listen to her dillon said ill always be the man in the black hat to her but to you and me major to soldiers everywhere were the men who handle the crap the general public cant thats a showstopper dillon added and turned to kate wouldnt you agree thats a showstopper she wasnt in the least offended absolutely so paul rashid said igor gatov a commercial attache at the russian embassy kills my mother while driving on the wrong side of the road drunk the police say he has diplomatic immunity im afraid so and hes gone back to moscow no hes needed here ferguson told him needed rashid asked the secret security services would not thank me for telling you this but theyre not my best friends tell him superintendent but how far do i go she asked as far as it takes dillon said this russian shite takes out a great lady and walks away he poured another bushmills toasted young kate turned to paul rashid and said in good arabic gatov is a dog of the first water if the superintendent hesitates dont hold it against her she has delicate sensibilities her grandfather is a rabbi and my father was a sheik paul rashid said to her in hebrew perhaps we have much in common her surprise was obvious im not sure what to say she replied in the same well i am dillon cut between them in english its not just the russian embassy thats keeping gatov from justice theres the american connection there was a pause what would that be paul rashid asked hannah said to rashid as you know the americans and russians are great rivals in southern arabia but they will work together if it suits them paul said i know all this but what has it to do with my mothers death it was dillon who told him and in arabic this piece of dung is a double agent he worked for the americans on the other side of the coin its not only the russians who dont want him in court but the yanks as well hes too important too important for what paul rashid asked it was ferguson who said the americans and russians are working on some kind of oil deal and gatov was brokering it hes right in the middle there are billions to be made down there dillon said hes right arabia felix happy arabia thats what they called it in the old days kate rashid who had listened in silence said so were talking about money here id say so dillon said and to facilitate their wheelerdealing both the americans and russians look upon my mothers death simply as an inconvenience a severe one she paused and glanced at her brother who nodded she said some days ago at the oasis of shabwa an interesting event took place were you aware brigadier that the sultan of hazar had allied himself not only with a major american oil company but also a russian one ferguson frowned no thats news to me two assassins attempted to kill my brother on the night we received news of my mothers accident she nodded to dillon one tried to kill me my brother saved my life and shot him dead the important thing is that we discovered from the second assassin that i was targeted by the sultan himself on behalf of the americans and russians paul rashid told them ferguson nodded he told you everything of course dillon put in ferguson said are you suggesting that your mothers death was deliberate no paul said the police have gone over the evidence with us and i see nothing these dogs could have gained by murdering my mother but what is clear to me is that for them life is cheap and i plan to make it very expensive he stood up and held out his hand thank you very much for your information brigadier he turned to dillon in the guards in south armagh a loyalist politician told me once that wyatt earp could account for the deaths of twenty men but that sean dillon didnt even know his total a slight exaggeration dillon told him i think rashid smiled at each of them and turned to follow kim kate held out a hand to dillon youre a very interesting man oh you have a way with the words girl dear he kissed her hand and a face to thank god for thats my sister mr dillon rashid said and how could i forget it they left and before ferguson could say anything his red phone rang he picked it up listened had a brief conversation then replaced the receiver his face grave it would seem the sultan of hazar has just been assassinated he turned to dillon a remarkable coincidence dont you think the irishman lit a cigarette oh yes remarkable he blew out smoke i know one thing i feel sorry for igor gatov that evening there was a function at the dorchester a political affair attended by the prime minister and ferguson bernstein and dillon had been drafted for security not without a little grumbling dillon and the superintendent moved in from the park lane entrance to the ballroom checked all the arrangements and satisfied followed ferguson through and there at the bar was the earl of loch dhu and his sister ferguson said talk about a bad penny hannah and i will continue with the security see if theres anything more you can find out dillon kate and paul rashid stood together watching the crowd as dillon approached and said what a coincidence ive never believed in coincidences mr dillon paul rashid told him have you funny you should say that like you im a cynic but today just then a young man interrupted my lord the prime minister would like a word rashid said to the irishman im so sorry mr dillon our conversation will have to wait however id appreciate it if youd see to my sister for me itd be an honour rashid walked away and kate turned to dillon well as long as youre seeing to me how about a fresh drink dillon was just turning to hand her a glass when a rather large man with a florid face appeared and gave her a squeeze from behind kate my darling he said in a booming voice seeing he would have no chance to talk to her now dillon decided to leave but managed to step on the mans right foot as he moved away the man let her go damn you you clumsy oaf dillon smiled so sorry he bowed to kate ill be in the piano bar he walked through the main hotel to the dorchesters piano bar where since it was still early evening it was quiet guiliano the manager greeted him warmly for they were old friends glass of champagne why not dillon said and ill give you a tune on the piano while youre waiting for your man to turn up he was well into a gershwin melody when kate rashid appeared i see youre a man of many talents good barroom piano is all it is maam what happened to the gentleman the gentleman and i use the term loosely is lord gravely a life peer who inhabits the house of lords and does little good there i wouldnt think your brother would welcome fas attention to you thats an understatement did you really need to stand on his foot im glad the man is an absolute pig hes always grabbing at me groping me the man just wont take no for an answer he deserves a sore foot and a lot more besides she picked up his glass of champagne and finished it off anyway i just came by to say thank you now id better be off i asked for my car at seven seeing that there was to be no further conversation dillon smiled its been a sincere sensation she walked out and dillon came to the end of his tune and decided to follow her he didnt know why exactly but there just seemed to be unfinished business he went out of the main door turned right into park lane and found limousines picking up people from the reception at the ballroom entrance lady kate rashid was standing on the pavement a shawl about her shoulders and there suddenly was lord gravely again he put his arm around her and pulled her close whispering in her ear she struggled and two things happened simultaneously paul rashids daimler coasted in to the kerb with rashid in the back and as he scrambled out dillon moved in on gravely and screwed both fists into his kidneys gravely cried out and released kate and her brother pulled her away into the car gravely turned on dillon in a fury and pivoting dillon gave gravely a reverse elbow strike to the mouth whereupon his lordship slid down to the pavement as they were driven away rashid looked out of the rear window and saw dillon melt into the crowd and a policeman approach gravely a remarkable man dillon i owe him one are you all right im fine brother and im the one who owes him you like him very much ill have him checked out thoroughly no paul that ill do for myself after a lawyers meeting the following morning the two of them drove down to dauncey place paul had phoned ahead so his brothers were there as well and theyd given photos of gatov to betty moody betty in turn had spoken to the locals when he saw her in the bar that evening she gave him his usual glass of champagne and spoke in a low voice hes in the village paul arrived at lunchtime with a party from the russian embassy good he savoured the champagne what are you going to do she asked im going to execute him betty he told her and smiled over her sharp intake of breath later that night he spoke to his brothers in the great hall betty was there as well shed come up from the pub with lastminute information overheard from the local staff at knotsley hall gatov was leaving at eleven to drive overnight to london paul rashid told his brothers what he intended to do but hed purposely excluded kate i dont want her involved he said this is mens work what he did not know was that kate was on the minstrel gallery above and listening furious she was about to call out but betty appeared behind her and fastened a hand on her shoulder you mind your manners girl your brothers are going in harms way they dont need you making it difficult for them and lady kate rashid for the moment a child again did as she was told that night igor gatov drove around a corner of a narrow country lane and found a van tilted into a ditch and someone lying in the middle of the road he got out of his bmw walked forward and leaned over the figure on the ground it was paul rashid and he struck him across the neck he and his brothers wore black special forces overalls michael and paul carried the semiconscious gatov to the bmw and pushed him behind the wheel george went to the van got in and reversed it out of the ditch paul rashid took a bottle from his overalls and doused gatov in petrol fire purifies so the koran tells us he said then switched on the engine of the bmw and slipped off the handbrake its not much of an exchange for my mother but its better than nothing he flicked his lighter touching the edge of gatovs petrolsoaked jacket which immediately started to burn then george and michael pushed and the bmw rushed down the hill and hit the end of an old stone bridge where it fireballed the next morning at the ministry of defence hannah bernstein took a signal flimsy to ferguson in his office it detailed the terrible accident that had burned igor gatov to death dear me ferguson said another remarkable coincidence sean dillon leaned against the door and lit a cigarette the question is what coincidence is going to be next sitting in the drawing room of kates house in south audley street paul rashid said gatov is dead the sultan is dead such executions are right and just but they are not enough michael said what do you mean brother i mean it is not enough simply to have eliminated two small men their deaths will quickly be swallowed up and the great powers will continue to swagger arrogantly around the world as if nothing has happened america and russia the two great satans have attacked arab culture they have walked over the bedu they have screwed arabia and hazar out of what is rightfully theirs and ours we must teach them a lesson they will never forget what do you have in mind asked george first kate i want you to contact our friends in the army of allah the sword of god hizbullah everyone i want them screaming about the us and russia trying to plunder arabia i want them creating havoc whenever and wherever possible then what said michael then we assassinate the president of the united states there was a stunned silence michael said in a whisper but why paul because gatov was just a servant because the sultan was just a pawn because it is no good killing just the little people if we dont make a statement and i mean a big statement the great powers will never understand they will never leave us alone properly orchestrated the killing of president jake cazalet will tell the world once and for all that arabia is for the arabs for cazalet the buck stops here isnt that what they say oh we could kill the russian premier instead hes just as culpable but cazalet will make a much bigger impact there was more silence michael said youre serious about this yes michael never more serious it is time to take a stand he looked hard at him this is for the bedu he shifted his eyes to george this is for hazar he rested his gaze on kate and they sat their eyes locked for what seemed like minutes finally this is for mother the harsh whisper seemed to fill the room after a moment kate said but who will attempt this thing a mercenary with the peace process taking over northern ireland there are many expert ira killers at loose ends he produced an envelope and passed it to her this man one aidan bell comes highly recommended he is to be found in county down it seems he shot a russian general for the chechens and blew up his staff a man willing to take risks go and see him kate take george with you hes soldiered over there and knows the ropes there was no longer any hesitation a decision had been reached of course brother one other thing he lit a cigarette you liked sean dillon i told you go and see him arrange an accidental meeting concoct a story see what he knows of aidan bell she smiled itll be a pleasure well dont make it too much of one he smiled back at her london county down northern ireland kate rashid went through the information her brother had supplied and it was good detailed stuff aidan bell was fortyeight years of age had been a member of the ira since the age of twenty and had never served a day in prison for years hed been a member of the irish national liberation army a very extremist organization he had often been at loggerheads with the provisional ira but was responsible for some important hits the most interesting fact was that over the years he had also worked as a mercenary cash on the nail for many foreign revolutionary movements kate put the matter into the hands of her head of security at rashid investments a trusted man and exparatrooper named frank kelly not in complete detail however she didnt trust any employee that much at this stage all she wanted was a chance to meet dillon as if by chance and it came on the following monday night kelly phoned her at the south audley street house which was only five minutes up the road from the dorchester dillon has just gone into the piano bar he seems dressed for a night out got a dark blue suit on and a guards tie but he wasnt in the guards probably taking the piss if youll excuse my language maam i did a lot of irish time in one para i know about this guy i didnt realize you were in one para kelly did you know my brother george yes maam though he was way above me he was a second lieutenant and i was just a sergeant in my day fine have you a car there one of the company mercs drive up and get me you can come to the dorchester and wait you personally kelly i dont want anyone else lady kate i wouldnt dream of making it anyone else kelly told her he picked her up a welldressed man no more than fivefeeteight with a good hard face and hair closecropped the army bit that wouldnt go away in no time he had dropped her at the dorchester and parked in one of the privileged spaces she went through the swinging doors trim in a black trouser suit as she walked into the bar there was music and there was dillon playing the piano again guiliano turned up lady kate what a pleasure the usual table no the bottom left by the piano id like to speak to the pianist ah mr dillon hes good isnt he sits in before our regular comes only now and then lord knows what he does the rest of the time you know him you could say that he escorted her to the table she nodded to dillon ordered a glass of krug champagne sat down and took out her mobile phone which was strictly against bar rules she called her brother george at his apartment not too far away when he answered she said im in the piano bar at the dorchester dillon is here and frank kelly is outside call him on his mobile and tell him to pick you up i want you of course george said see you soon dillon was really very good she decided he was playing the old standards the kind of things she liked a cigarette dangled from the corner of his mouth and he suddenly moved into our love is here to stay a slightly crooked grin on his face as he came to the end the regular pianist appeared and dillon smiled slid off the piano bench and the other man took over the irishman came across to her serendipity isnt that the word this is a total and unexpected pleasure why mr dillon youre a man of erudition well unlike you i didnt go to oxford i had to make do with the royal academy of dramatic art you were an actor oh come off it kate rashid you know damn well what i was all of it she smiled and as guiliano came up she said his personal preference used to be krug but i understand hes switched to louis roederer cristal well have a bottle dillon produced a silver cigarette case opened it and took one out she said you might ask a lady reached took the case from him examined it and selected a cigarette herself art deco a man of taste or perhaps a souvenir of the national theatre you are well informed dillon said he flicked his zippo and gave her a light as the champagne arrived he lit his own cigarette you know theres coincidence which could be this meeting and then theres carl jung you mean synchronicity a deeper motivation is intended he toasted her so what are we into here at that moment george came down the steps into the bar and joined them frank kelly following kate said ah here come two freebooters from one para dillon this one is my brother george but it was kelly that dillon bothered with i wouldnt wear a shoulder holster if i were you son its too difficult to dump your gun in a bad situation its better in your pocket and dont say stuff you or ill say stuff you kelly actually smiled and kate said sit at the next table frank so you can hear he smiled again at dillon yes maam like a good dog i obey dillon laughed out loud well this dog i like can he have a drink not on duty kelly said and by the way im from county down too you fenian bastard so we know where we are dillon smiled go on have one bushmills and sit down and hear what the lady wants her story was quite convincing the thing is dillon we that is rashid investments are moving into ulster in a big way because of the peace process but were experiencing roadblocks if you know what i mean our developments would bring high employment but were being leaned on so dillon asked well we need what i suppose you would call protection people who might help and who might that be she waved to a waiter and paused until hed poured more champagne have you heard of a man called aidan bell dillon almost fell over the table laughing jesus girl hes tried to shoot me more than once our aidan was big with what you might call fringe organizations on the hard right of the ira i heard he was possibly responsible for killing lord mountbatten weil i was accused of that myself they also say you attacked number ten downing street in february ninetyone with mortar bombs never proved he smiled mind you if wed had a bit more time all right she said so youre a bad boy but i need to get to aidan bell to see if we can do a deal protection call it what you want he lives in a place called drumcree in county down i know it well im from down myself but then you know that im supposed to meet him on thursday ill take george she turned to kelly can i count on you too of course maam dillon said to him good man yourself and turned to her and youre asking for me i work for ferguson so youll tell him this isnt an intelligence matter i want backup thats all and in that damn place youre the best whats the matter doesnt ferguson ever let you work freelance ill see what the good brigadier thinks and ill let you know at fergusons flat later that night he gave the brigadier a rundown of what had taken place hannah bernstein heard it all too when dillon was finished ferguson thought about it then turned to her what do you think on the surface it makes sense the rashid outfit is definitely into ulster these days but so are a lot of people on the other hand its a good story too good ferguson turned to dillon who smiled and said i always believed in women coppers shes right ferguson nodded theres a hidden agenda see if you can find out what sean there you go calling me sean again dillon smiled still and all things are quiet ill take a look and keep in touch ferguson told him the rashid gulfstream flew from raf northolt a popular venue with executive jets that found problems with the congestion of heathrow besides the two pilots the other people on board were kate dillon george rashid and kelly dillon had arrived last and once they were in flight he opened the bar box and found a half bottle of bushmills we still dont know whats happening kate said well its reasonably simple aidan bell at drumcree is expecting you sometime tomorrow to discover whatever you want to discuss with him we land this afternoon at aldergrove my arrangements are that we go to a little fishing port called magee sail overnight to drumcree and you can see bell in the morning there was silence she said are you sure about this its a nice fortyfoot boat called aran i could handle it myself but these two can act as deckhands it leaves aidan bell slightly leftfooted you arriving that way he wont expect it so a bright girl should do rather well bastard she told him why is it i think of you like that because thats what i am well as long as youre my bastard on this thing all right not that she believed him not for a moment but she had her agenda and she was playing it through the flight was normal the drive down to the coast just as uneventful magee was a small place the kind that in the old days had been mainly occupied with fishing the aran was tied up at the pier a shabby boat as dillon had said forty feet but having used fergusons best efforts he knew it had twin screws and the kind of engine you needed for action by night he waited until almost midnight before leaving they had a simple meal of fried eggs and canned spaghetti bolognese and even split a bottle of white wine so cheap that it had a screw cap instead of a cork well take our leave dillon said the weather isnt too bad winds six or seven half engines mostly he nodded to george and kelly you two cast off then i suggest you get some sleep theres no way of knowing how things will go in the morning and what about you kate asked ill manage dillon ive been sailing boats for years then if it gets rough you can give me a hand as the aran moved out to sea the tide was still running in visibility was poor rain drifting kate stood beside dillon in the wheelhouse with only the light over the chart table rain squalls and maybe fog in the morning he said are you okay there are seasickness pills in that drawer i told you dillon ive sailed before ill make some tea and perhaps a sandwich not long afterwards he smelled bacon and she came into the wheelhouse with a thermos flask of tea and three sandwiches two for you one for me and you half bedu eating bacon islam is a wonderful moral faith dillon and how does that sit with those twelfthcentury dauncey christians oh they were hard people and their beliefs were very similar in some ways you know something dillon im half bedu but my god im proud of my dauncey roots there are a lot of great ancestors there dillon finished his second bacon sandwich its an unusual situation i can see that im not sure about the aristocracy kate but i like you what about george and kelly last seen getting their heads down good ill do the same and since you keep boasting of your sailing prowess ill hand it over when he returned four hours later it was to a rolling motion he had been lying on one of the bench seats in the saloon come awake slowly and gone up the companionway he opened the door of the wheelhouse to the sight of dawn a grey light heavy mist and rain and the down coast a couple of miles away kate stood there hands steady on the wheel good man yourself dillon said ill take over he eased her aside are you okay fine i havent enjoyed anything so much in years ill make some tea would you like some more sandwiches see what the deckhands want id say well arrive at drumcree in about an hour i know the place from the old days theres a pub called the royal george dont be misled by the name its a hotbed of republicanism well call in and ask for bell surprise him is that your tactic oh you could say that let me be sure ive got this straight kate rashid you dont want me there when you meet him am i right its business dillon private company business george can come with me fine sean dillon told her and turned the wheel now what about that tea george and kelly joined them eventually in the wheelhouse drank mugs of tea and listened to dillon the pub the royal george is a good fenian institution and right on the jetty youve both done ulster time so you know the kind of place should we be carrying kelly asked feel under the chart table theres a catch a flap fell down kelly pulled out a drawer and there was an assortment of handguns inside ill take the walther in my pocket so when im searched theyll discover it dillon said youll find three ankle holsters with shortbarrelled twotwos one for each of us you think well need them george asked him this is indian territory and im one of the indians dillon smiled keep the faith people slow and easy drumcree was a small place with a tiny harbour a jetty a scattering of houses in grey stone and a few fishing boats they coasted in dillon eased to the jetty and george jumped over the rail andtied up it was very quiet no one about there you go kate dillon pointed the royal george it was obviously eighteenthcentury but the roof looked sound and the sign was in green with black lettering and what looked like fresh gilding so what do we do kate demanded well like any decent pub in these parts theyll do an irish breakfast id say lets partake and ill tell mine host to inform aidan bell were here and that will do it absolutely were already on their screen as they say he turned to the other two you stay with the boat kelly and be prepared for anything a bell tinkled as they went in the bar dillon and george were in jerseys and reefer coats kate wore a black jumpsuit and carried a briefcase there were three men sitting in the window seat eating breakfast one was middleaged with a beard the other two were younger they turned to stare men of a rough persuasion with hard faces a man appeared behind the bar thickset whitehaired can i help you wed like breakfast kate said the wellbred english voice sliced through the quiet like a knife and the men at the window continued to stare breakfast the man said dillon cut in making his belfast accent even more pronounced thats it me ould son three ulster fryups weve just sailed in from magee then phone aidan bell and tell him lady kate rashid is here phone aidan bell the man said whats your name dillon asked patrick murphy the man replied as a reflex good man yourself patrick now breakfast and bell in whatever order you want murphy hesitated and then said take a seat which they did on the opposite side from the three men dillon lit a cigarette there was a murmur of conversation then the bearded man got up and crossed to the table he stood there looking at them english is it he said to kate then leaned down and brushed her face still i suppose anythings better than nothing where a womans concerned come on english bitch lets see what youve got there was a large bottle of brown sauce on the table george tried to get up but dillon pushed him down picked up the bottle and smashed it across the side of the mans head sending him to his knees the man knelt blood and sauce on his cheek and dillon stamped on his face sending him sprawling patrick murphy appeared at that moment and was totally shocked as the two young men jumped up and dillon produced his walther i dont think so for christs sake the barman said what are you doing theyre provisional ira once in never out i was told dillon said and ive been a member since i was nineteen ill tell you what martin mcguinness wouldnt approve of this lot i mean hes a family man he turned to the two young men and nodded to the floor get this piece of dung out of here their rage was plain but they got the bearded man to his feet behind them the door swung open and a man almost as small as dillon strode in dark hair tousled needing a shave wearing a barbour jacket against the rain with a large redhaired man behind jesus he said is that you quinn and in a damn bad way he laughed out loud and whose toes did you stand on mine dillon said bell turned in astonishment and his expression was close to awe dear god is it you as ever was a long time ago it was derry and those brit paratroopers chasing us through the sewers you saved my life once bell held out his hand you tried to kill me twice ah well so we had a falling out bell turned to the two men supporting quinn get him out of my sight they took the bearded man out of the door and bell said what in the hell goes on dillon this is lady kate rashid i believe you have a meeting arranged bell didnt even look surprised i should have known take me unawares is that it and where does this bastard fit in he asked her mr dillon is acting in a private capacity i wanted his expertise on county down and hes been provided with ten thousand pounds to supply it flew into aldergrove yesterday boated out overnight back to magee in an hour or two money for old rope dillon said come off it you still work for ferguson you turncoat he took a browning from his pocket hands high see to him liam the redhaired man ran his hands over dillon and found the walther he turned to kate now you darling it was bell who said mind your manners casey a lady this he gestured to the briefcase see whats in there no mr bell kate told him whats in there is between you and me i see he turned to george as liam casey checked him this would be the younger brother one para youre well informed said kate i always am and if your head of security is on that boat hes also one para and a damned prod which you are yourself dillon reminded him and shrugged to kate one of the few in the ira so what am i doing here bell asked business mr bell as youre so well informed youll know i am executive chairman of rashid investments and youll know we have big plans for development in ulster i had heard can we talk bell nodded to the barman well use the snug he led the way to a door opened it to usher her through and turned to dillon sean you still dont understand kate told him dillon is here only as a minder my business is with you and you alone on behalf of rashid investments she turned and nodded to her brother george join us the door closed dillon turned and said to the barman i know its early in the day but its cold out there and pouring with rain and im county down myself so lets celebrate and get the bushmills out there was a fire in the open hearth of the snug chairs on each side and a small coffee table in between kate rashid sat down her brother standing behind bell sat opposite and lit a cigarette liam casey stood behind so the word is that rashid investments are having problems with their plans in northern ireland and need a little protection not really mr bell thats a story even dillon believes no i dont need you to guard the door as it were youre far too talented for that really then what do you need me for last year you killed general petrovsky in chechnya and also blew up most of his staff the world in general thought the chechen freedom fighters had scored a great coup but i know that you were paid one million pounds by chechen sources in exile in paris do you now oh yes his face was calm you or your famous brother the earl isnt it a man to reckon with and all the money in the world i hear not quite but close youve never met of course almost he was a lieutenant in the grenadier guards crossmaglen in south armagh i was with one of my best snipers your brother and a small patrol were moving in my man had him in his sights then a helicopter dropped in with another twenty guardsmen and we had to run for it if youd shot him youd have missed a big payday she pushed the briefcase across have a look he flicked the catches and lifted the lid inside were rows of fiftypound notes how much he asked a hundred thousand pounds as evidence of good faith you keep it whatever happens my brothers gift to you and what do i have to do you may or may not know about this but the americans and russians intend to prospect for oil in hazar the sultan brokered a deal for them it involved assassinating my brother the sultans dead it was in the papers exactly one of his assassins almost killed me my brother shot him dead hes that kind of man he would be irish time lady kate me dillon casey here your brother were all cut from the same piece of cloth but theres more here i know im a bastard but im a clever bastard all right ill tell you it involves my mother and a man called igor gatov afterwards aidan bell said excuse the language but theyre all fucks the americans russians brits they use people then throw them away like a paper cup so for once we teach them a lesson and i do mean a big lesson we go straight to the top i hear jake cazalet is a good man but so what someone pays for people like gatov and ultimately it must be the one in supreme power for president jake cazalet you get two million now are you in or out liam casey said jesus bell sat looking at her youre mad woman no perfectly serious as i said you keep the hundred thousand no matter what she took a phonecard from her purse and a pen she wrote quickly my coded mobile number youve got seven days my brother and i will be at trump tower in new york next thursday at our apartment if youre interested present yourself plus a coherent plan if not youre one hundred thousand pounds richer and no hard feelings bell smiled ill be there lady kate trump tower thursday she nodded a certain satisfaction on her face it was never the money was it its the game to you just like dillon well i still expect to be paid and for a job like this ill expect not two but three million sterling he held out his hand and she took it somehow i thought youd say something like that well meet again next week then in manhattan ill be there casey opened the door for her and they went out to dillon who was at the bar drinking bushmills a little early even for you she told him we have to walk back through the rain girl i like to keep the cold out were all done here i presume yes back to magee she said dillon turned to bell a sincere sensation aidan im sure youll do whatever the lady wants with your usual ruthless efficiency oh you can count on it sean kate dillon and george went out and bell and casey stood in the door and watched them go casey said its madness aidan even you couldnt get away with it bell smiled looking incredibly dangerous now thats where youre wrong liam i can get away with anything theres something burning in my brain already something i read recently ill go and check it out thats a hell of a woman he watched her go dillon and george on either side but dillon thats a strange one having him here a minder she said could be but he still works for ferguson which means he cant be in on this business it wouldnt make sense they walked out into the rain and moved towards the harbour at the same moment that kate rashid and the two men reached the aran and stepped over the rail and found frank kelly facedown on the deck quinn the bearded man from the royal george came out of the wheelhouse with a savage grin backed by his two cronies they were all armed without hesitation dillon flung himself over the rail into the harbour dived deep and swam surfacing at the stern quinn was shouting get the bastard get him dillon reached to the ankle holster and drew the pistol the men above looked over the rail and he shot each one between the eyes quinn shocked turned to see what was going on and george rashid pulled the from his own ankle holster and shot him in the right arm quinn dropped his gun scrambled over the rail and stumbled away george took careful aim just as dillon came back up over the rail let him go and lets get out of here see to kelly he added to kate then moved to the wheelhouse and started the engines on the way down from the royal george bell and casey saw what was going on below on the boat bell said that shite quinn hes going to ruin everything come on and he ran down the hill to the harbour they saw the action dillon taking to the water and shooting quinns two sidekicks quinn being shot by george rashid and running for cover bell and casey paused watched george cast off and the aran move out of the harbour saw quinn stumble between the boats on the beach ive had it liam bell said the provisional ira can go to hell this is my patch and this bastard has come close to screwing up the biggest job of my life this time he goes down he ran followed by casey in working his way round the beach quinn had to wade through water and when he turned around the stern of a fishing boat he found bell and casey facing him aidan he said bell smiled youve been a stone in my shoe too long you bastard lets end it now he drew a browning from his pocket and doubletapped quinn in the heart quinn fell back in the water his body floating half submerged casey said you want me to do anything no need the tides on the turn it will take him out and in drumcree wholl ask questions the aran moved out to sea kate went to the stern and sat in the rain using her coded mobile paul rashid answered its me darling how did it go ill tell you when we meet bell will go for it good how was dillon well he and bell turned out to have shot at each other in the old days so dillon bought your story god knows hes a devious bastard what he did do was save my life there was a pause and paul rashid said explain afterwards he said he doesnt take prisoners no mind you george didnt let you down either im proud of him tell him so for me ill see you soon the aran was plunging out to sea through strong waves dillon and george were in the wheelhouse and kate arrived with tea hows kelly dillon asked hell be all right a bash to the head thats all hell have a headache for a while but hes a tough nut good dillon said dillon said now kate theres half a bottle of bushmills under the chart table she found it got it out and poured into two mugs of tea dillon said george boy as my jewish friends would say youre a mensch my thanks dillon ive been through sandhurst and one para sometimes i forget the estate management go on dillon laughed get him out of here kate when she was gone he used her coded mobile phone to reach ferguson when the brigadier answered he gave him a rundown of events christ dillon youve been killing again the ranks of the ungodly charles all right did you believe that story of hers hiring bell for protection for rashid investments not for a moment so why involve you ive told you i know down and i knew bell in the old days i knocked off guys who wanted to knock her off she hired me as a minder and mind her i did without me shed be dead and you still think theres something going on absolutely something big but ive no idea what come home sean and well think on it at aidan bells house casey was in the kitchen making tea suddenly the door opened and bell appeared a magazine in his hand i was right i found the story in time magazine it tells me exactly how to shoot jake cazalet youre mad casey told him not at all liam this could work trust me manhattan london west sussex white house aidan bell and liatn casey shared a suite at the plaza hotel beside new yorks central park they had flown over earlier on concorde the seats provided by rashid investments and found a chauffeurdriven limousine waiting to take them to the hotel this is the life aidan casey said well dont let it go to your head shave shower and put your best suit on its like were visiting royalty tonight i dont want him to think were straight out of the bogs he showered in the second bathroom then dressed in a white shirt blue tie and an easyfitting dark suit when he went out to the sitting room liam casey was standing at the window looking out jesus aidan what a town he turned wearing a black suit and shirt and black tie will i do you look like a bouncer at the colosseum bell said now lets go were only a couple of blocks away just behave yourself and do as i say and this ought to go as smooth as butter at trump tower they went up in a private lift to the rashid penthouse where kate opened the door she wore a black dress and a gold chain round her neck very understated mr bell lady kate what do i give to the woman who has everything he opened his briefcase and took out a cheap plastic box a present from county down a sign of good luck a fourleafed shamrock well we can do with lots of that mr casey she nodded in you come my brothers are waiting paul rashid sat by the fire in the drawing room with michael and george kate made the introductions aidan bell and his associate liam casey mr bell paul rashid didnt shake hands my sister tells me you almost had me shot in crossmaglen true but allah was good to you bell told him i like that i like it very much you want a drink perhaps later for now lets get to business i think fine you wouldnt be here if you didnt think you could do it am i right bell said yes you are now there are two common types of assassination one is by nutcases who press through the crowd and shoot the president up close with no chance of getting away often they dont even want to get away thats not for me two is the clever complicated kind the dayofthejackal thing meticulously organized every possibility accounted for like i did in chechnya when i got petrovsky and his staff that takes a long time to plan however and i sense you want results a little sooner youre quite right paul said so whats the answer bell smiled theres a third way there was silence it was kate who said what for gods sake bell was enjoying himself well to shoot the president of the united states should be an impossibility or could it be absurdly simple he opened his briefcase and took out a magazine he held it up america like britain is a democracy you can write anything you want about the great and the good theres an article in here on jake cazalet everyones favourite president it was in my head so i looked it up and its all i need for a general plan now i only need to finish working out the details the silence was profound he smiled feeling his power i think id like a large bushmills irish whiskey and then well talk a few minutes later he stood on the terrace looking down at the traffic while paul rashid read the article then passed it to the others all right paul said now tell us your plan mr bell as the article says jake cazalet loves to spend his weekends at that old beach house on nantucket they helicopter him straight from the white house lawn to the house late friday and he spends saturday and sunday there before coming back sunday night he has no family just that one daughter in paris cazalet doesnt like a big fuss hes notorious for it at the house even the cook and the housekeeper come in on a daily basis they live in town there are staff quarters but he refuses to have more than two secret servicemen there at the weekend i did a little extra research and learned that one is called harper hes the communications officer the other is his favourite a big black former marine named clancy smith who served in the gulf war smith is devoted to cazalet hed step in the way of the bullet if he had to and then theres blake johnson yes the article mentions him it says he is the director of something called the general affairs department at the white house rashid said known as the basement because that is where it is in actuality its the presidents private hit squad totally separate from the cia the fbi or the secret service its been passed on from president to president for at least twenty years no one knows quite how long johnson is also cazalets closest friend a vietnam vet with a strong record and youre sure of all this george rashid said i have to be its why im still alive okay so weve got a downtoearth president who doesnt want a fuss and likes to be on his own said paul you know damn well that the perimeter of that area will be well monitored by the secret service exactly bell opened the briefcase again took out a map and unfolded it see from the presidents house we have a seafront of beach and sand dunes but at the rear we have this area of marsh very unusual for nantucket its the only spot like it on the island it stretches in quite a way high reeds water mud a paradise for bird watchers cazalet loves it goes for a run along the paths every morning with his dog and good old clancy smith running behind smith has a gun under his left arm and an earpiece naturally but theres no one else around unless his friend blake johnson happens to be there that weekend and decides to join in the fun if he turns up ill stiff him too there really was a heavy pause now and it was kate who said everything you say makes sense but there would be no way you would get inside the perimeter inside the marsh bell smiled sorry i havent explained you my lord have a house on long island i believe thats right youll supply me with a boat a sport fisherman will do and someone to pilot it well sail up to the area and drift around a mile or so offshore youll also find me a dolphin speed trailer those things have two large batteries and travel underwater liam and i will go scuba diving something were good at and then invade the marsh underwater into the reeds then what michael rashid asked then wait for cazalet shoot him and clancy smith and bugger off out of there itll take a little while for harper to wonder why he hasnt heard anything and in that time well return with the dolphin to the sport fisherman then get back to long island where youll have a gulfstream waiting to get us the hell out of there and onwards to shannon he paused emptied his glass then said to paul rashid will it do rashid said calmly i think it will do very well he turned to his brother george another bushmills for mr bell it was kate who said thats quite a script but what if the script goes wrong what if it doesnt work nothing is certain in this life said bell therell be dicey bits but if we prepare this properly it should work then see that you do prepare properly said paul remember well only get one chance at this if you fail cazalets security will become so heightened itll be impenetrable and then well have to go through the trouble of finding another target another target said michael i told you brother one way or another someone is going to pay there was silence then bell turned to kate will you be handling the organization of what we need she glanced at paul then nodded anything you want all right the sport fisherman ive already mentioned the dolphin speed trailer diving equipment for two weaponry paul rashid asked i prefer basic ak assault rifles with silencers a couple of brownings with carswell silencers thats all very simple if things go well you said if again kate told him bell smiled oh lady kate ive been at it for twentyeight years and if you knew how often the bestlaid schemes go wrong youd understand why im a cynic now bell took a card from his pocket your one hundred thousand pounds was nice but i want the next instalment now thats my swiss bank account one million on deposit against the three paul rashid nodded of course he took the card and passed it to michael see to it he smiled champagne is indicated i think a nice thought bell smiled but its the last time once i start working i stop drinking well that seems sensible kate offered champagne all round rashid raised his glass so we change the world bell laughed out loud god bless ould son but if you believe that youll believe anything two days later kate rashid took bell and casey down to the pier at quogue where they found a sport fisherman named alice brown and a man named arthur grant who was fiftyish with greying hair tied behind his neck mr grant kate said these are the gentlemen i spoke about they want a run up to nantucket to do a little diving mr bell is looking for some interesting wrecks you already have the dolphin on board grant poured himself a jack daniels well lady thats your story me i think maybe theyre up to something more than interesting wrecks but i dont give a damn twenty thousand bucks and shes yours agreed she turned to bell keep in touch and she went up the companionway grant said shes got a great ass on her bell dropped the bag containing the weaponry and kicked him on the right shin then swung him around and casey headbutted him grant fell back across onto the deck and bell leaned over from now on you belong to me grant do we understand each other watch your mouth do your job and youll get the twenty grand otherwise he nodded to casey who took a knife from his pocket pressed a button and the blade jumped up im sorry grant said well remember youre sorry bell told him in london ferguson sat in his office at the ministry of defence working through papers detective superintendent hannah bernstein came in anything for me ferguson asked not much sir that business with the rashids what our information is theyre all in new york some kind of family party whats dillon up to believe it or not sir hes gone shooting in west sussex with harry salter pheasant salter that damn gangster yes sir and young billy the nephew wonderful hes almost as bad as harry i need hardly remind you sir he was a great help last time around on that job in cornwall you dont need to remind me superintendent but hes still a gangster he agreed to jump by parachute with no training whatsoever and killed four of jack foxs men dillon would be dead without him agreed and hes still a damned gangster at compton house in west sussex it rained remorselessly none of which bothered the shooting party it was a syndicate of thirty that harry salter had paid into he emerged from a long wheelbased shogun wearing a cloth cap a barbour jeans and rubber halfboots he was sixtyfive with a fleshy and genial face until he stopped smiling one of the most famous gang bosses in london hed been to prison only once in a long career these days he had millions in dockside developments and leisure construction though the rackets being in his blood he was still involved in smuggling from the continent there was a lot of money to be made from the cigarette trade in europe they were incredibly cheap but in britain the most expensive in the world no need to get involved in drugs or prostitution when you had cigarette smuggling he stood in the rain bleeding marvellous isnt it bleeding marvellous dillon country life harry dillon was wearing a cap and black bomber jacket billy salter harrys nephew a man in his late twenties with a pale face and wild eyes emerged next wearing cap and anorak his uncles righthand man hed been in prison four times all relatively short sentences for assault and grievous bodily harm this is all your fault dillon what have you got me into now shoot a few pheasant billy breathe the country air last time out it was villains trying to hit you this should make a change joe baxter and sam hall harrys two minders dressed in jeans and anoraks what a bunch of idiots billy nodded at the other members of the syndicate emerging from jeeps and range rovers why the funny gear what are those ridiculous trousers its how people like that dress to shoot billy dillon said its an old english custom the rest of the party was grouped around a large man with a florid face and dillon heard someone address him as lord portman they all turned and looked at the salter party with disfavour good god what have we here portman asked another large man this one with a grizzled beard approached gentlemen can i help im the head keeper frobisher i should hope so old son salters the name harry salter frobisher was astonished hesitated then turned to the others this is mr harry salter president of the syndicate there were looks of horror salter said lord portman is it that is correct portman said frostily chairman of riverside construction right so weve got something in common i cant imagine what you dont have to imagine i took you over last week im salter enterprises so in a manner of speaking you work for me the horror on portmans face was profound he actually recoiled and it was dillon who said genially to frobisher can we get on joe baxter and sam hall were unloadingthe gun bags frobisher said well space the valley up to that wood ill give you a number each we know how it works old son dillon told him ive explained to my friends frobisher hesitated so you have shot before only people billy told him so lets get on with it three hours later in the shogun baxter was driving and billy opened a bottle of champagne and poured it into plastic cups what a bunch of toffeenosed idiots the look on their faces when i scooped the pool yes well you have had a certain amount of practice dillon said harry salter swallowed his champagne that portmans bleeding face was something to see are you going to throw him out harry billy asked no i know his track record and hes good ill improve his package hell come to heel its whats called business billy and bloody boring billy turned to dillon you got anything on the go i could help with back to heidegger is it billy you feel the need for some action and passion here you lay off salter told his nephew last time we almost didnt get you back so im bored billy said and you wont let me do the booze and cigarette runs from amsterdam anymore cos i dont want you nicked lesser mortals can take that chance you just be a good boy he poured more champagne and dillon said ill keep you in mind billy billy raised his glass always willing and available dillon at the white house jake cazalet sat at his desk in the oval office in shirtsleeves working through a stack of paperwork the door opened and blake johnson came in outside rain drove against the window the president sat back what have you got for me hazar mr president the sultans death the sultans assassination jake cazalet got up went to the window and looked out blake said the cia doesnt know anything about it they say they claim to be totally baffled the question is baffled or embarrassed we know the sultans people tried to kill paul rashid on behalf of our own oil interests and the russians and the sultan was the cias man id say they have a lot to answer for and now theres all this agitation from hizbullah army of god sword of allah all the rest of them somethings going on dammit jake cazalet said i dont like it at all its a dirty world mr president i cant prove it but ill lay you odds rashid struck back does charles ferguson know anything about it i dont know mr president i havent asked him well do so then get back to me it was late in london as ferguson sat by the fire of his flat in cavendish place and talked to blake i cant help you with the sultan although my personal feeling too is that it was a rashid hit youre certain absolutely i have a trusted operative colonel tony villiers commanding the hazar scouts as a contract officer he keeps me well informed during the gulf war he also commanded the sas unit rashid served in well thats close enough thanks charles hows dillon ferguson hesitated well since you mentioned him dammit blake this is strictly confidential but sit back my friend ive got a story to tell you it concerns the rashids he went through everything drumcree aidan bell kate rashid the shooting of the provisional ira men my god blake said what are they up to so you dont believe their story either do you the rashids are moving into northern ireland thats a fact maybe but theres a lot more to all this than theyre saying well keep me informed charles give my love to hannah and tell dillon to watch his back he put down the phone and went back to the oval office to bring the president up to date nantucket they made the trip from long island to nantucket in the alice brown overnight arthur grant took the wheel from casey at midnight aidan bell replaced him at four am it was still dark and the irishman sat in the swivel seat smoking a cigarette in the light of the binnacle enjoying every minute of it and thinking about things hed enjoyed seeing dillon again a great comrade in the old days although their paths had altered and hed liked the girl what a woman and shed seen right through him it wasnt the money never had been hed really showed those russians in chechnya the general with one round through his head at six hundred metres and fifty pounds of semtex for his staff what theyd called an ulster fryup in the old days in the ira the door creaked open and liam casey came in with tea and sandwiches i couldnt sleep how are you fine aidan bell put on the automatic pilot and took a sandwich as casey poured tea into two mugs how are you feeling ill be fine myself aidan and why wouldnt you we got away with it in chechnya didnt we casey took a sandwich himself yes but the president of the united states aidan thats something else again ah but what a ploy he took another sandwich and casey said ive been thinking what if cazalet doesnt turn up this weekend he must do that sometimes i checked his schedule liam what am i daft i also checked cnn news earlier today on the tv there above the chart table there was a mention of him going to the old family house by the sea as usual this is america they tell you everything then why the hell didnt you tell me aidan because grant was in the wheelhouse at the time and you were on deck stowing the gear whats it matter casey gave him a cigarette i dont like him hes what my old gran used to call a sly boots yes well if he crosses me ill cut off his boots with his feet still inside but dont worry ive a story for him that should keep him happy leave it to me just make sure he doesnt get into the weaponry bag it was raining slightly more of a sea mist than anything else as the alice brown drifted parallel to the coast three miles off nantucket arthur grant was at the wheel and aidan bell and casey worked under the stern canopy which theyd draped with fishing nets they already had the dolphin speed trailer over the rail and tied up and were checking their diving gear throttle back bell called and grant did as he was told so that they simply coasted along as bell and casey pulled on their diving suits and inflatables grant had the windscreen open and leaned out any problems no bell said put her on automatic and get down here bell eased on his jacket with the tanks attached and wrapped the velcro straps while casey did the same casey said youre sure about this three miles in fortyfive minutes its easily done at the speed this thing goes well manage at fifteen feet all the way weve plenty of air and theres an onshore current he dropped the weaponry bag over onto the dolphin and clipped his holding line to his weight belt as grant arrived bell pulled on his gloves well its the moment of truth were going on towards the coast looking for a world war ii wreck an irish boat called rose of tralee the story was beginning to sound so good that he almost believed it himself amongst other things it was carrying gold bullion from the bank of england for safekeeping in boston people have been looking for her for years but last month i traced an old guy of eightysix who was a deckhand and survived when she was torpedoed by a uboat he didnt know about the gold but he was able to give me the position jesus christ grant said so play your cards right and ill cut you in for a piece sure anything you say mr bell grant said eagerly okay you stay here drop your line get the nets out look busy with luck well see you in three hours he pulled down his mask put in his mouthpiece and went backwards over the stern rail as he untied the line on the dolphin casey joined him bell switched on the two heavyduty batteries mounted the front seating position and as casey got on behind took the dolphin down levelled off at fifteen feet and turned towards the distant coast of nantucket island with a surge of power standing on the front porch of the old house wearing a united states marines tracksuit jake cazalet drank his first cup of coffee of the day and watched murchison his beloved flatcoat retriever walking with clancy smith on the beach below there was a step behind and as cazalet turned blake johnson joined him also nursing a coffee always great to be back blake cazalet told him it sure is mr president cant wait for my run youll join me if youll excuse me not this morning even though its the weekend and early in the day harper is finding himself under considerable pressure in the communications room theres a lot coming down from the hill id better stay and give him a hand all right then come and look at my new toy i had it shipped down during the week he led the way round to the yard the barn door stood open and inside was a large motorcycle on its stand a montesa dirt bike the president said itll be a lot of fun riding it along those roads ill take your word for it blake said to be honest mr president i havent ridden a bike of any kind for years hell a child could work this thing shepherds use them to herd sheep he sat astride started the engine rode out and circled the yard there you go he switched off and pushed it up on its stand feel free i will blake said as they walked back to the porch it started to rain murchison was sitting waiting tongue hanging clancy smith came over wearing a hooded oilskin coat in yellow and carrying another which he passed to cazalet knowing you mr president i figure were going rain or no rain youre always so right clancy cazalet pulled on the coat buttoned it up and whistled to murchison come on boy he went down the steps and started to jog the dog at his heels clancy smith adjusted his earpiece transferred his favourite old browning from his shoulder holster to his righthand pocket and went after them aidan bell was not far off in his calculations and helped by the strong current they entered the estuary leading to the marsh in fifty minutes it was a salt marsh of course a magnificent wilderness of tall reeds deep water channels mudflats and birds of every description who rose angrily as the dolphin surfaced bell coasted onto a sloping sandbank then he and casey dismounted eased the dolphin forward and got rid of their jackets and air bottles all this was done in silence finally bell undipped the weaponry bag handed casey an ak assault rifle and browning and took out his own they stood there strangely medieval in their black diving suits bell said one thing we know is that he always runs before breakfast that could mean hes halfway round the roads already or that hell turn up at any minute but theres only one main road from the house leading to the marsh network id say three or four hundred yards we wait there were bound to get him either going in or coming out so lets move in he turned and led the way through the reeds feeling cool calm and completely unemotional jake cazalet clancy and murchison were running fast now in the heavy driving rain and the president was enjoying every minute of it as he had said more than once it washed the years away and with the world as it was he could certainly do with that murchison ran strongly at his heel clancy was five yards back and he paused on an old plank bridge that was roofed over a temporary shelter from the rain you okay mr president clancy asked fine ill have the usual clancy produced a packet of marlboros lit two and passed one to cazalet who took it and inhaled with deep pleasure dont let any press photographers see you doing that mr president hell im entitled to one weakness these things got me through vietnam and you through the gulf they surely did clancy agreed they smoked in companionable silence then ground out their cigarette butts lets go cazalet said and led the way out into the rain breaking into a run again hidden in the reeds beside the main road bell saw them coming he whispered loudly across to casey who was on the other side there they are get ready you take the secret serviceman ill have the president and dont be too eager take your time he waited there was no need for a long shot when it could be done virtually at pointblank range he raised the ak to his shoulder and cazalet ran directly toward him and as bell had told kate rashid how often the bestlaid schemes could go wrong hed planned meticulously every contingency foreseen except for the instincts of a flatcoat retriever named murchison with that special extra facility known only to dogs he sensed something wrong took off like a rocket and plunged into the reeds on the other side of the road casey lurched out into the open struggling to cope with the fact that murchison had him by the left ankle and his ak discharged jake cazalet stopped running some twentyfive yards away and aidan bell stayed hidden and took aim but clancy smith was fast in the same moment he knocked the president sideways and took the bullet that bell had intended for cazalet in his right shoulder he staggered but never wavered take coyer mr president he cried and shoved cazalet down into the shelter of the reeds cazalet gave a piercing whistle and a moment later murchison joined them there was blood in quantity pouring from the rent in smiths yellow oilskin jacket is it bad cazalet asked ill be all right youd better take this mr president and he passed the browning across bell called softly across the road stay out of sight liam and then he loosed off several bursts in the general direction where hed seen clancy smith and cazalet disappear clancy was already calling in and cazalet fired back twice in the communications room blake johnson was seated next to harper working through some signals when clancys voice crackled over the loudspeakers with the shocking words blake empire down empire down at the same moment came the sounds of gunfire blake reached for the mike where are you halfway along the main road ive been hit but the president is okay hes doing the shooting back im on my way blake turned to harper give me your piece you know what to do harper face wild handed him a beretta blake slipped it into his righthand pocket ran straight out onto the porch and to the barn a moment later he rode out on the montesa and hurtled along the road peering through the reeds clancy and the president could see him coming when he was still some distance away so of course could bell and liam crazy damn fool cazalet said hell get himself killed why couldnt he wait till the cavalry got here thatll be the day clancy smith said blake pushed the little bike up to sixty a ludicrous speed on the narrow road and aidan bell fired through the reeds a short burst that exploded the front tyre and sent the montesa into a long sliding skid on one side as blake kicked free liam casey made a bad mistake then and emerged from the reeds ak raised ive got you now you bastard blakes hand came out of his righthand pocket holding the beretta and he shot the big irishman in the chest casey cried out his ak discharging and plunged headfirst into the reeds beside bell further along the road cazalet stood up briefly over here blake ill cover you he dropped out of sight and blake staggered along the road limping liam casey said can you get the bastard who shot me aidan bell watched blake go and disappear into the reeds its not worth it liam god it hurts aidan bell took in the bullethole in the stomach of the diving suit yes it would in the far distance there came an ominous rattling sound oh dear here comes the heavy brigade time to go what do you mean liam demanded what i mean is you win some and you lose some and this one is very definitely down the plughole thanks to that damn dog cazalet will buy him a gold collar after this ill just keep their heads down over there and be on my way he sprayed the reeds in the general direction of the presidents party emptying his ak dropped it into the mud and picked up caseys but what about me casey moaned thats a problem but i have a solution our friends didnt see two of us only one so if they find one that should keep them happy while the other one gets away he stood up and took his browning with the carswell silencer from inside his diving jacket liam casey said you cant leave me aidan im being practical aidan bell aimed for a heart shot the browning coughed once liam casey jerked and lay still sorry old son aidan said softly then he put the browning back inside his jacket and slipped off through the reeds four hundred yards away the dolphin waited that wasnt too far and then hed be back underwater before the security helicopters started to blanket the area on the other hand theyd find liam soon enough and that should hold them after that long final burst there was silence maybe hes down cazalet said or out of it clancy observed murchison whined then snuffled nose up somethings getting to him the president said the helicopters were close now two of them he wont wait around for this lot blake said hes either on his back or on his way im going out he stepped out of the reeds before the president could order otherwise and stood on the path and waved with both arms as the two hawk helicopters swung down they made their landings each one disgorging six secret servicemen in navyblue assault gear each one carrying the new parkerhale machine pistol they crowded round and the president emerged helping clancy smith who had lost a considerable amount of blood the presidents fine blake said only because clancy took a bullet meant for me cazalet said two of you get him into one of the choppers and you mr president you know the rules we take you straight out of harms way till everything is sorted out blake said all right damn you cazalet whistled to murchison and followed them as they took clancy smith one of the hawks lifted off and blake turned to the others there was one man wearing a black diving suit he tried to shoot me with an ak i shot him for sure and he sort of dived into the reeds on that side down there dont come back without him about the same time aidan bell back in his diving gear was sliding the dolphin into the water he switched on climbed on board and took her down to twenty feet as a precaution within ten minutes he was moving out to sea always the great survivor aidan he told himself always the great survivor they found liam casey and at first thought he was dead one of them went for blake but by the time hed arrived the situation had changed and they were carrying him out of the reeds toward the second hawk campbell the agent in charge said hes got a real bad stomach wound your shot id say but you did say you only fired once absolutely then theres been someone else around someone tried a heart shot probably to finish him off but he had a browning inside his jacket and it turned the bullet i think hes on the way out mind you well lets get him into surgery as soon as possible there was a military hospital on a small air force base twenty miles away on the main coast i just heard the presidents there already with clancy campbell told him then lets get moving on the hawk they put liam casey on a stretcher battle packs taped to his wounds his eyes opened and he stared around him and there was a kind of recognition when he saw blake i know you he whispered blake leaned close how do you know me the basement youre dillons friend the basement man blake had never been so astonished how in the hell do you know that but there was no reply for liam casey had passed out at the hospital he was taken away and blake found the president having coffee in a private lounge hows clancy mr president blake asked hell be fine he should get a medal hell he shoved me aside and took that bullet blake ive been informed youve found the assassin how is he being rushed into surgery he spoke once blake told him what the irishman had said the basement man dillons friend blake what have we got here god knows sir well have to wait well one thing is certain i dont want any publicity keep this totally under wraps it never happened you me and the secret service thats all who know but what i want to know is who is behind this and why should i call ferguson mr president the man did mention dillon i should check that makes sense okay talk to charles and dillon too no one else not murchison he already knows murchison lying by the electric fire got up and the president of the united states kissed him on the nose he went straight for that bastard saved my life hes special all right blake smiled excuse me ill get on with this if youll follow me mr president the alice brown rose and fell on a heavy rolling swell as bell surfaced on the dolphin nets trailed into the water all very businesslike and grant came to the stern rail bell undid the velcro ties of his jacket and eased off his air bottles into the water he pulled off his mask and flippers the ak he had dropped off a mile back throw me a line grant frowned wheres your friend there was an accident grant didnt like it his face clouding now look whats going on here bell unzipped his nylon diving jacket produced the browning and shot him between the eyes then he reached for the rail and pulled himself over and turned and fired several shots into the dolphin which started to settle into the water he went through the lockers in the wheelhouse and found a length of chain which he wound around grants ankles before pushing him under the rail the body slid under the surface and bell hauled in the nets quickly then went below got a bottle of irish from the galley and hurried back on deck he went into the wheelhouse switched on the engines and moved away one hand on the wheel while he poured whiskey a very large one into a plastic cup he swallowed the lot then poured another as rain started again in the living room of the great house at quogue paul and kate rashid sat by a log fire michael and george were in london rashids coded mobile rang he answered and found bell what news there was a screwup this is the story he gave an account of what had happened which was a reasonably true version omitting only the fact that hed finished off liam casey id like to say im sorry bell said but i did nothing wrong and everything right it was just that damned dog you know what the arabs say inshallah as god wills paul rashid told him you couldnt shoot the dog there was no time when will you arrive four hours all right ill have the gulfstream waiting at westhampton airport my sister is here well fly back to the uk together suits me what about grant i hate loose ends taken care of whats the expression arthur grant is asleep with the fishes and what about his boat ill swim ashore well see you soon then paul rashid switched off and turned to kate a dog a flatcoat retriever called murchison he started to laugh then he reached for his mobile ill phone the airport and tell them to get the gulfstream ready then well have a glass of champagne but what do we drink to why murchison of course at the hospital the fight for clancy smiths life continued for four hours the air force flew in two additional trauma surgeons and the presidents own doctor after the surgery cazalet and blake sat for a while with clancy whose pain had been dulled by drugs the chief surgeon came in and had a look at him youll be fine son just fine thank you sir the surgeon nodded to cazalet who followed him out mr president does this mean what i think it means robert i need your holy oath on this cazalet said of course mr president that was an ak bullet we took out of that young man i had one in me myself in vietnam well this one was meant for me and that brave boy pushed me aside turned his back and took it for me god in heaven and the other is the assassin although we think there could have been another one too will he live debatable ill keep you posted were just finishing in there cazalet went back in the room and brought blake up to date lets hope he survives its a bizarre business and id like an answer clancy was drifting off do i still have a job mr president or are you having campbell move someone else in over my dead body clancy started to laugh helplessly god that hurts but youve got to admit its kind of funny get some sleep clancy blake said the president and i are going to grab something to eat well see you later aidan bell was really lucky on the final approach to quogue in the alice brown there was a heavy sea mist blanketing everything he tipped the dinghy over the side with its small outboard about half a mile out then went below and opened the seacocks he went over the side switched on the outboard and moved some little distance away and waited it didnt take long the alice brown settled decks awash then went very quickly bell opened the throttle and sped away toward the shore in the living room rashid and his sister were talking so what now she asked i have an alternative target i always did am i permitted to know soon my dear but not yet there was a rapping at the french windows paul rashid opened a drawer near at hand and took out a walther he stood up and nodded to kate it was bell standing out there when she opened the window he stepped in with a smile still wearing the diving suit god bless all here thats what the fenians say youre all right she asked yes just show me where you parked my bags a shower and a change of clothes and im ready then make it fast paul rashid said were leaving westhampton in one hour has there been any news on the television yet there hasnt been a hint which i find very strange i dont like it so lets get moving at the hospital the president slept on a small bed in one of the interns rooms blake dozed in a chair in the lounge and came awake to a hand on his shoulder he looked up and found one of the surgeons an air force colonel there mr johnson hes come round but its not good hes very weak can i talk to him you can try but i dont think youll get much fine notify the president ill go in liam casey lay there wired up to life support a male nurse was in attendance ive got permission to try and speak to him blake said i dont think youll get far sir blake pulled a chair forward and casey opened his eyes for a little while his voice proved surprisingly strong im dying arent i and youre the guy who shot me the basement man dillons friend look what do i call you behind him the president and the colonel eased into the room i dont suppose it makes any difference now casey liam casey where are you from there was a little blood on caseys mouth and the nurse wiped it away drumcree county down blake frowned ive heard of drumcree but why do you call me the basement man dillons friend cos ive seen your details in the file your picture which file the file aidan prepared the plan to do away with the president three million she promised when she saw us in drumcree she lied to dillon told him she was looking for protection for some business enterprise in northern ireland the president said what in the hell is going on blake waved him down and said to liam so aidan is aidan bell and he was here and tried to shoot the president shot me i thought hed finished me off left me to carry the can and cleared off how underwater he seemed suddenly stronger fishing boat three miles out then back to long island they have a house the rashids have a house just take it easy blake soothed him why why would paul rashid want the president dead american russian double agent called gatov killed his mother so he killed him the arabs tried to kill rashid for some yank and russian oil people he wanted revenge only he didnt get it did he he failed thats all right alternative target what would that be rashid said it would be his choice suddenly he grimaced in pain and moved convulsively the male nurse and the colonel went in fast and blake got out of the way please leave gentlemen the colonel asked in the lounge the president said for gods sake what goes on let me remind you mr president of my conversation with charles ferguson not too long ago concerning a trip lady kate rashid made to county down using sean dillon as her minder when blake went into the lounge a little while later the president was drinking coffee a frown on his face he looked up well caseys dead ive spoken to harper in the communications room hes checking out the long island situation the rashids cazalet lit a marlboro got up and paced around it beggars belief rashid is one of the richest men in the world an earl a war hero a friend of royalty who in the hell would believe it nobody mr president nobody in the wide world caseys dead and what he said could easily be dismissed as the ramblings of a dying man right now weve got nothing to use against rashid but why is he so determined blake cazalet asked a lot of reasons i suspect the attempt on his own life the death of his mother the perfidy of the sultan his desire to rid hazar of our influence were the great satan dont forget that he may be english but that bedu side well i wouldnt like to be alone with him in the desert cazalet said all that money it means nothing to him does it its just a tool of power it lets him fly down there in a helicopter so that he can roam on a camel with his warriors theres nothing more important to him there was a long pause cazalet was about to speak when blakes mobile rang he answered listened then said fine ill get back to you harper the rashids were in quogue and flew out of westhampton four hours ago paul and kate rashid and some man named thomas anderson aidan bell id say so destination northolt raf base there was a long pause before cazalet said theres nothing we can do is there to be frank no not at the moment but ill speak to ferguson right do that then get to london yourself i want you to coordinate everything with the brigadier actually hes just been promoted major general now really im very glad ill speak to him myself before you leave but for the moment its been a hell of a day so lets get back to the house on the gulfstream halfway across the atlantic the rashids and bell had a light meal of smoked salmon salad and champagne bell emptied his glass so what next im thinking about it paul rashid told him ive other problems in hazar ill be in touch well dont leave it too long in the meantime ill go back to drumcree and check that things are in order that the lads are behaving themselves im sure they are kate rashid said they usually do they dont like to upset me aidan bell tipped his chair back and closed his eyes it had after all been a long day london at cavendish place late that night ferguson sat with dillon and hannah bernstein and went over the whole business after hashing it out for hours with no particular conclusion ferguson said all right so his personal hit man this aidan bell failed with cazalet by a stroke of good fortune i dont think theyll try him again now so whos the alternative target hannah bernstein said as he seems to have it in for both the americans and russians general what about the russian premier i cant see even aidan bell operating in moscow dillon observed he wouldnt have to ferguson said gloomily the premier is due in london on the seventeenth of next month trade talks with the prime minister i didnt know that sir hannah said it isnt public knowledge superintendent but thats only six weeks away so you think he could be the target how do i know what do you think dillon its a bit obvious sos cazalet if you think about it in hindsight a wonderful thing hindsight who else could it be beats me dillon said so the best thing to do is ask him there was a stunned silence hannah bernstein said ask him dillon turned to ferguson brigadier he laughed sorry general in the past you have talked about situations where they know that we know and we know that they know true so lets push the good earl a little make sure he knows we know and that were on his case ferguson nodded not a bad idea maybe itll shake something loose make him a little incautious lets wait until blake arrives in the morning then well beard rashid in his den as it were excellent dillon said and aidan is back we assume in drumcree lets make sure can you get people to check on that charles aidan bell may be minus liam casey but hes still got tommy brosnan jack ohara pat costello a whole crew of blackguards lets make sure theyre all still in county down the following evening the rashids walked into the piano bar at the dorchester to find sean dillon seated at the piano he was wearing a dark blue suit and a guards tie and a cigarette drooped from the corner of his mouth unlit kate rashid walked over to him flicked her gold lighter and lit his cigarette is that better god bless you maam for the decent soul you are and ill forgive you only because i love you dearly for conning me over our drumcree trip conning you absolutely i know all about the good aidan trying to stiff the president very naughty kate very naughty indeed she lit her own cigarette why dillon i never knew you for a fantasist oh im a realist all the way sweetness aidan bell tried to finish off liam casey on nantucket only casey had a browning tucked inside his diving jacket and it turned the bullet of course that still left him with a bullet in the belly how interesting still he lived long enough to spill the beans he was very annoyed with aidan liam was yes well he would be i imagine kate said general fergusons due any minute with blake johnson id tell you who blake is but im sure you already know dont you kate id listen to what they have to say if i were you she turned and went back to her brothers they had their heads together for a while when charles ferguson appeared at the head of the stairs by the bar with hannah and blake johnson they came down and joined the rashids as they sat dillon eased off the piano bench and went to join the others so mr dillon paul rashid said what an extraordinary tale you have told my sister the eyewitness account is even better blake told him i was there liam casey tried to shoot me and i was the one who shot him in the stomach the wound killed him eventually but we had a fine old chat did liam and me you cant prove any of this you know paul rashid said youre right charles ferguson told him not yet but we intend to rashid i intend to pursue you to the ends of the earth dillon here is particularly looking forward to it is that so paul rashid smiled it would appear you are declaring war on me general ferguson exactly rashid stood up followed by his two brothers and sister beware i could declare jihad on you myself but i do not think that will be necessary will it general he walked out the others followed blake said you really pushed him charles ferguson said i intended to he looked at hannah what did you think you didnt leave him much room to manoeuvre he turned to dillon and you me dillon laughed jesus your honour im just a simple irish boy what intrigued me was the fact that he didnt actually deny any of it well hes your business now ferguson told dillon stay on his case hannah said we should remember what he said sir he really could declare war on us are you querying my orders superintendent dillon said oh dont worry shes good at taking orders general however stupid they are im the one who looks at things differently but then as we both know ive always been a little mad come on hannah lets go and put the world to rights and he turned and led the way out leaving blake with ferguson at kate rashids house paul held a council of war with the other three its damn unfortunate casey survived even more unfortunate that aidan bell was economical with the truth kate told him true but its only to be expected with people like him im going to let it go for now i still need him so what happens now i think ill teach ferguson a lesson he made dillon into a direct threat so its time to get rid of dillon he turned to michael thats your task use ali salim from the party of god hes good enough only keep out of it yourself and when do you want this business handled brother as soon as possible if salim is available let him get on with it now but leave it up to him youre a good boy michael but not against the dillons of this world he turned to kate you agree absolutely she kissed michael on the cheek just give it to ali salim dillon and hannah had a light meal at a small italian restaurant near his townhouse in stable mews theyd discussed the situation until it was coming out of their ears their chief worry being whether ferguson had pushed it too hard or not they were on tea and coffee when blake who had phoned on dillons mobile earlier came in you want something to eat dillon asked i had scrambled eggs with ferguson at his place he sat down ive spoken to the president he thinks paul rashid is nuts then if he is so am i dillon shook his head the curse of our civilization these days has been the unrestricted growth of capitalism and the interference of western companies into places like arabia intent only on making a buck were from societies that think money is everything what we should realize is we can be dealing with people who think it means nothing and the bedu are like that thats all right for rashid blake said he is a pretty rich bedu yes but everything hes involved in is beducontrolled rashidcontrolled theres a difference anyway do you want to walk round to my place have a drink there im parked outside we can drive blake said he went out with hannah dillon hung on to pay the bill then went after them ali salim was a yemeni arab of thirtyfive with wild eyes and a dark pockmarked skin he had accepted the contract without hesitation and made light of dillons reputation so this one is trouble you say i will give him more trouble than he has ever known where will i find him they were in the sitting room of alis flat near marble arch he opened a drawer and took out a beretta michael was confused and unhappy he found the man disturbing but then his brother had been insistent that he stay out of the affair personally he lives in stable mews number five ill take you there in my car and drop you off then lets do it ali took a bunch of keys from a drawer picklocks just in case hes not there to answer the door keep your money this i do for your beloved brother who is an example to us all dillon unlocked the front door and led the way in hannah following blake behind they moved down the hall and entered the sitting room and ali salim was there standing behind the door he struck dillon a heavy blow across the side of the head with his beretta dillon staggered across the room and fell to one knee ali grabbed hannah and pushed her hard putting her on her knees her purse flying from her hand salim pivoted and struck blake a glancing blow across the head as well then aimed his pistol at dillon hannah grabbed for her purse reached inside and took out her walther and glimpsing her out of the corner of his eye ali salim turned and shot her three times blake grabbed at ali salims legs and was hit across the head again dillon got to his feet and reached inside the chimney to where he kept his ace in the hole a walther suspended from a nail by the trigger guard his hand swung up and he shot ali salim between the eyes hurling him back over a chair ali writhed on the ground blood all over his face and dillon stepped close and shot him twice in the heart he dropped to one knee and checked hannah her eyes were glazed and there was blood everywhere he got up went to the phone and dialled rosedene dillon theres been a major incident superintendent bernsteins been shot three times were at my house get over here right away he went into his bedroom ransacked a cupboard and returned with two or three field service wound packs get these on her blake he said johnson was on his feet looking no worse for wear and went to alis body searched it and came up with a wallet he phoned ferguson when the general answered he said i came back to my house with hannah and blake and an arab hit man was waiting according to his id hes one ali salim he shot hannah three times and i shot him dead ive spoken to rosedene an ambulance is on the way dear god ferguson said if i were you id notify her family ill send blake with her ill stay here to clean up leave it to me ferguson said managing to stay calm dillon used the phone again there was an instant reply dillon here ive got a disposal for you immediate the consignment is at my place on our way a voice said dillon replaced the receiver the doorbell rang and when he answered three paramedics came in with a stretcher he led the way into the sitting room where blake crouched by hannah three gunshot wounds close range this beretta was used he handed over ali salims weapon they busied themselves over her quickly put her on a drip then got her onto a stretcher go with her blake ill catch up suddenly he was alone he lit a cigarette and went and poured a bushmills he drank it down and poured another his hand shaking a little if she dies rashid he said softly then god help you a moment later the doorbell rang again he answered and admitted two cadaverous middleaged men in dark suits and overcoats one of them with a bodybag in black plastic over his left arm in here dillon led the way through dear me the older one said when he saw ali salim save your sympathy he shot superintendent bernstein three times ive got his wallet ill pass it on to general ferguson just get him out of here of course mr dillon later thinking about hannah bernstein and all theyd been through together he felt not rage but concern it was after all the business they were in rage would come later he found a leather trenchcoat and let himself out many people thought that arnold bernstein was the finest general surgeon in london but to operate on his own daughter would have been unethical which was why professor henry bellamy of guys hospital was in charge he allowed bernstein to observe in the operating theatre which was as far as ethics would go ferguson dillon and blake waited in the anteroom with rabbi julian bernstein hannahs grandfather they drank coffee and tea and waited through the fourhour operation you must hate us all rabbi ferguson told him the old man shrugged how could i this was the life she chose the door opened and bellamy and bernstein came out still in their surgical gowns they stood up and ferguson said how bad is it very bad bellamy told him the stomach is damaged the bladder the spleen one bullet went through the left lung her spine is chipped its a miracle shes here but she is dillon said yes sean she is and i think shell pull through but its going to take time thank god rabbi bernstein said no thank a great surgeon dillon said turned and went out ferguson called to him sean wait he caught up with dillon on the front steps blake at his shoulder sean youre not going to do anything stupid now why would i do a thing like that ill deal with rashid dillon stood stone still gazing at him then soon general soon if you dont i will just remember that and he went down the steps and walked away blake johnson said an angry man general yes and with every right to be lets talk things over blake and see if we can come up with the right way to handle this back in stable mews dillon answered the door and found the older of the two men who had taken ali salims body away he was carrying a light black plastic urn ah mr dillon i presumed youd want them what is it ali salims ashes dillon took the urn excellent ill see they reach the right destination he put the ashes on the hall stand then phoned ferguson its me when are we seeing rashid im not sure well i am i told you if you dont make a move ill face him myself theres no need for that ill phone him and arrange a meeting do that dillon put the phone down to his surprise the doorbell sounded again and when he opened it he found rabbi bernstein standing there may i come in sean of course the old man followed dillon into the living room dillon turned suddenly anxious shes all right isnt she so it would appear sean i dont know all the details but i know what shed want me to tell you she wouldnt want revenge well i do im sorry rabbi but im feeling very old testament at the moment an eye for an eye you love my granddaughter not in the way you mean god knows she doesnt love me in fact she hates what i stand for but that doesnt matter here i think a great deal of her and i dont intend to let the man responsible for her present situation get away with it even if she doesnt want that yes so rabbi unless you want to stay for a cup of tea youd better go god help you sean the old man went to the door dillon opened it for him sorry rabbi bernstein went out dillon closed the door hesitated then went back into the living room the phone rang when he answered it ferguson said eleven oclock tomorrow at my place ill expect you ill be there sean dillon said and put the phone down the following morning he checked at the hospital and found that she was poorly but stable that she was getting the finest treatment in london was a given ferguson wouldnt accept less so there was nothing dillon could do he dressed in dark leathers a black bomber jacket and white scarf and took the black plastic urn with him when he left and walked round to fergusons flat in cavendish place kim let him in and dillon found ferguson having tea and toast by the fire i didnt have time for breakfast blakes on the phone to the president in my study hell be with us shortly help yourself to a drink i know you like to start early dillon did just that had a bushmills with a little water any news from county down oh bells there all right and his three cronies tommy brosnan jack ohara and pat costello have i got it right absolutely blake came in the president sends his best hes very concerned about hannah anything she needs any kind of special treatment you only have to ask the front doorbell rang kim appeared and looked inquiringly at ferguson who nodded and the gurkha opened the front door paul and kate rashid were shown in she wore a black suit he was in a leather bomber jacket himself pullover and slacks they both seemed cheerful a drink sir ferguson asked coffee tea something heavier ill have what dillons drinking said kate bushmills whiskey girl at elevenfifteen in the morning you have to be raised to it well ill have to try wont i suit yourself dillon poured her the whiskey and added a little water oldest whiskey in the world they say invented by monks in ireland she took a sip no superintendent bernstein this morning yes well shes lucky to be here at all shes in the hospital in intensive care when we got back to my place last night there was a guy named ali salim waiting ive checked him out a party of god fanatic there was silence paul rashid said is the superintendent all right oh sure dillon told him shes got a damaged stomach bladder spleen a bullet in the left lung a chipped spine just the kind of thing you expect when some religious fanatic shoots a woman three times kate rashid said carefully and this ali salim where is he on the table over there dillon nodded to the black plastic urn i brought his ashes for you six pounds thats all thats left he poured another bushmills oh didnt i tell you i shot the bastard after he shot bernstein she sipped a little of her whiskey then took a cigarette case from her purse and extracted one dillon gave her a light there you go im sorry she said about superintendent bernstein well you would be wouldnt you after all it wasnt supposed to be her it was supposed to be me really paul rashid cut in why are we here general ferguson because i warned you before rashid and now im telling you outright if its war you want then its war youll get i dont take kindly to my people getting shot were going to be over you so closely that you wont have room to breathe let alone pursue your alternative target really and who would that be paul rashid said i cant help but notice that the russian premier is in town next month is that so paul rashid told him how interesting also too damned obvious dillon said and lit another cigarette no hes got something else on the agenda youll have to wait and see wont you paul rashid got up come on kate it was blake who said for gods sake why sir your mothers death was a tragedy but why take it so far youre a decent man mr johnson and yet you still dont see it the business interests in your country think they can walk in anywhere they like in the world take over corrupt trample on peoples rights the russians are exactly the same well you wont get away with it in rashid territory in hazar or the empty quarter i have the financial resources to back me up and i have my people chew on that my friend one thing ill promise ill surprise you he turned to his sister dillon took them to the door and opened it try and make him see sense kate my brother always makes perfect sense dillon she told him then well all end up going down the same dark road to hell an interesting thought paul rashid observed and led the way out the door closed and ferguson said so we know where we are only with him blake said but we dont know the first damn thing about what he intends to do the balls in your court dillon said to ferguson ferguson nodded lets try the simple approach we wont get very far trying to listen in to rashids phone calls and coded mobiles make things even more difficult these days but well tap them anyway we can monitor his travel movements his planes need a slot passengers have to be declared beforehand special branch can check them out meanwhile well plough through all his friends all his associates maybe well get lucky sooner rather than later blake said theres an energy to rashid that i find disturbing what will you do dillon asked im going home theres a lot i have to talk about with the president if theres anything you need me for though anything at all just let me know and ill be back in the car paul rashid pushed the glass divider closed and said to kate theyll be on our case in every possible way t know itll be next to impossible to get to the premier now he was never my alternative kate she was amazed but paul i assumed it must be which is what i wanted everyone to think and they did except for dillon of course then who for you and you alone its the council of elders in hazar all twelve of them theyre dragging their feet theyre afraid of me and they dont want me they distrust my influence with the tribes and theyre right to once i dispose of them and am named the sultan i will declare a jihad then all the great powers will have reason to tremble how do you intend to do it theyll all be together in two weeks i want you to go down and base yourself in our office in hazar ill join you later and how will the job be executed a suitable bomb and for that well need bells expertise and well also need to get you there to talk with him without people knowing speak to kelly he knows some dodgy people the kind who do illegal flights in small planes from old raf airstrips in and out very quickly get it arranged as you say brother and kelly came up trumps he produced a place in surrey called grovers air taxis where the proprietor was a shiftylooking middleaged man in a brown flying jacket and overalls who met them outside a second world war nissen hut two hangars looming behind now then mick kelly said lets call this lady miss smith and get on with it as i told you we need drumcree a couple of hours at the most then back again no trouble i can do the old titan its got twin engines and an airstair door no problem on the approach none ill go in under six hundred from a couple of miles out at sea theres an old raf landing strip ten miles out of drumcree ill use my local contact and have a car left there good man then lets go just a minute what about my money kate opened her briefcase took out a brown paper envelope and handed it to him can we leave now grover hesitated obviously tempted to look into the envelope then thought better of it all right he turned and led the way to the end hangar rolled back the door and disclosed the titan how long will it take kelly asked hour and a half depending on the wind fine lets get on with it kelly said and ushered kate through the airstair door she called bell on her coded mobile when they were halfway across the irish sea she caught him in the kitchen of his farmhouse this is kate rashid ill be with you in an hour youll what i want to discuss your vacation in a much warmer climate what are we talking about a big payday the alternative target well thats for me sweetheart kellys minding me she said well see you at the royal george without bothering to check with ferguson dillon had been following kate rashid from the moment shed left london wearing black leathers and astride a suzuki motorcycle hed waited in a small copse and watched kelly kate and grover through glasses when they got in the titan and took off dillon drove to the village a mile down the road and went into the pub there was a log fire burning but no sign of customers a middleaged woman came in from the kitchen my god its like a funeral parlour in here dillon said cheerfully its early she said what do you expect a bushmills whiskey and directions to hoxby he lied effortlessly and lit a cigarette i was surprised to see a plane take off a little while ago oh thats mick grovers outfit just up the road in an old wartime feeder station he does crop spraying the odd charter flight dont know how he makes a living i dont know how i do dillon grinned you do food thats right ill go and see to my business in hoxby ill probably look in on my way back grover stayed with the plane and kelly drove kate down to the royal george it was quiet enough at that time in the morning only patrick murphy the barman reading the belfast telegraph at the bar kelly led the way in aidan bells expecting us hes in the snug kate went first and opened the door and kelly followed aidan bell sat by the fire smoking a cigarette and drinking tea he looked up lady kate now this really does sound interesting what do you want me to do what you do best twelve arab sheiks the council of elders in hazar are proving a problem well now we cant have that on the other hand id always understood that the rashid would follow your brother anywhere all those wild tribesmen they will once the sheiks are taken care of this one needs the expert touch it also needs to be a spectacular make various people sit up and take notice youll need a team of course no problem there ive got some boys are they any good were all still here arent we and yes to answer your question they wont screw up like liam so whats the deal rashid investments has construction interests in hazar and im flying out today supposedly to supervise them i want you and your boys to turn up the day after tomorrow at dublin airport our gulfstream will run you down to hazar well talk things over more when you arrive what are you looking for some sort of ambush a bomb whats your pleasure well discuss that when i see you any equipment you need will be down there so all i have to do is think of the best way of disposing of twelve old arab sheiks and getting away with my bollocks still intact she laughed harshly true that last item could be a consideration we arabs are terrible people you must be careful he smiled that i will lady kate you may be sure he raised his teacup a toast to peace lady kate to peace he took a swallow and stuff it dillon had shepherds pie at the pub and a glass of indifferent sancerre there were perhaps a dozen people in locals from the look of them he finished his meal paid up and went to his suzuki fifteen minutes later he was in the copse overlooking the small airfield waiting he sat there thinking and smoking sheltering from the light rain and eventually he heard the sound of engines in the distance and the titan appeared and turned in for a landing dillon watched through his glasses as kate rashid kelly and grover talked then she and her security man got into her mercedes and drove away dillon waited for a while then got on the suzuki and drove down to the airstrip in the old nissen hut grover was boiling the kettle on the stove when he heard the suzuki he went to the window and glanced out as dillon got off and pushed the bike up on its stand the irishman removed his helmet left it on the bike and came in pushing the door open before him grover said what can i do for you information dillon said answers that kind of thing what in the hell are you talking about dillon unzipped the front of his leathers took out a walther with a silencer and shot the kettle off the stove grover was terrified whats this for christs sake well for starters you tell me what i want to know and i wont cripple you so lets get down to it the people you just flew out and flew in again who were they guy called kelly ive known him for years the woman he said her name was smith really where did you take them grover hesitated and dillon fired on the floor between grovers feet where did you take them county down a place called drumcree to see who how in the hell would i know i flew them in they left me at the airstrip and drove off to the village thats all i know they were back in an hour and a quarter for the return flight and you didnt hear a word no ive no idea what they were up to dillon raised his walther again and grover jumped i dont know anything i tell you he paused just that at one point during the flight they were talking i heard her say hazard hazar something like that good man yourself dillon shoved the walther back inside his leathers now lets get one thing straight whats just taken place is between you me and my god no kelly and no miss smith are you with me because if youre not ill come back and blow your right kneecap off look i dont give a damn grover told him just bugger off and leave me dont make me come back dillon went out put on his helmet and rode away grover watched him go to hell with them to hell with the lot of them at least he had three and a half thousand pounds in the brown paper envelope he opened a cupboard and found another kettle not too far along the road dillon pulled into a layby and called ferguson on his mobile where in the hell are you ferguson demanded well if youll shut up you old bowser ill explain when he was finished ferguson said all right so she went to see bell and the pilot heard her say hazar what does that mean i have a suggestion dillon said the rashid house in mayfair did you put in the phone taps yet yes of course they havent said anything theyre too smart for that well it will make him feel confident if we appear to be doing the expected thing so why dont you get your communications department chaps into the street outside have them pretend to be working on the telephones the usual rubbish in reality why not instal a directional microphone instead who knows it could pick up some useful stuff all right leave it with me only get back here i need you dillon went home to stable mews and changed then he called at the hospital to check on hannah the matron gave him five minutes only she lay there propped up festooned with tubes dillon sat for a while then left angry and bitter he met professor bellamy in the corridor whats the verdict dillon asked not good sean i think shell survive but i cant promise exactly what shape shell be in we will travel hopefully dillon said and left at cavendish place he found ferguson going over papers at his desk ive got some interesting news that directional mike of yours caught a conversation between rashid and his sister rashid said you be there to meet bell and his three cronies when they arrive in hazar did he now that is interesting so what do we do what do you do is more like it dillon id say hazar is your next port of call general the minute i turn up in hazar ill be in deep trouble well have to take that chance i cant keep an eye on them without your being down there being your usual bloody nuisance ive even found a legitimate excuse for your presence my cousin professor hal stone of corpus christi college cambridge is by one of lifes coincidences in hazar right now conducting a diving operation on a world war ii freighter with typical university nonsense he has no real money so he can afford only a small operation of local arab divers sounds exciting actually it is whats really interesting is that hes discovered whats left of a phoenician trading ship partly underneath the freighter youre a master diver dillon hal would love someone like you to help out especially as you wont cost anything youd be able to monitor lady kate and bell and company ill arrange for your flight then come down myself once youre settled in do you agree lets give it a try theres just one thing i know these arab divers they jump with a stone in both hands i need another master diver to back me up ferguson sighed oh dear do you mean who i think you mean billy salter is a firstclass master diver and you think hell go do i think hell go dillon started to laugh at the dark man they found harry salter billy joe baxter and sam hall sitting in a corner booth jesus brigadier what brings you here harry salter demanded first of all its not brigadier anymore harry theyve made him a major general dillon said well damn my eyes salter waved to dora behind the bar get champagne over here girl its a special occasion she found the bottle and came round the bar but it was young billy who said what gives dillon you arent here playing patty fingers im going out to hazar in the gulf of oman billy the generals cousin is trying to work a world war ii wreck with bits of a phoenician ship under it hes what billys face was pale with excitement the thing is hes got no money billy just arab divers so im going to work for bed and board billy got up if he needs you he needs me when do we go tomorrow morning billy turned to go but ferguson said tell the lad the truth for gods sake last time out he killed four times for us we owe him billy turned slowly is there going to be trouble bad trouble billy were up against rough trade this time then youd better bloody well tell me billy said and sat down again afterwards he said what a bunch of bastards i mean if youre british youre british i dont mind this rashid being half arab but you behave yourself i dont know dillon ever since ive met you i end up trying to save the world what time do we leave in the morning ten oclock from northolt whos flying us lacey and parry as usual who else could you trust to drop you in from six hundred feet billy smiled wolfishly too bloody right they got an air force cross each last time didnt they thats right any chance of me getting one not in a million years billy and they wouldnt give you one all theyd give me is twenty years if they could harry salter got up right wed better go and get on with the packing we ferguson said i cant bloody well dive but i can use a shooter and sit in the boat salter said its called family at the mayfair house paul rashid said to kate take george he can act as a link with the tribesmen he knows the dialect and they respect him because hes my brother they respect you too because youre my sister but theyre arabs they still feel uncomfortable with a strong woman then they must learn he embraced her bell is what matters hes good but he has to obey you any trouble and ill have him and his three friends wiped off the face of the map those are my people there i know brother i know i wont let you down ill astound you dillon went back to check on hannah bernstein she was slightly more alert and responded to him what are you up to sean she murmured its what rashid is up to hes recruited bell to go down to hazar with his cronies we dont know what for yet and youre going yes tell me about it which he did afterwards she said so its you and billy and dear old harry into the war zone again so it would appear youll never stop will you sean its what i am hannah i lack a good woman thats my trouble oh get on with it and stop making excuses i love you too he kissed her on the forehead god bless hannah and for once she gave him a smile a real smile god bless sean strange but there he was sean dillon the ultimate hard man and when he went out there were tears in his eyes when he got home he spoke to blake johnson on the phone and brought him up to date blake said jesus sean hazar is rashid territory and you and billy and harry are going to go play deepsea divers with fergusons cousin come on you wont be able to go into a waterfront bar for a drink without someone trying to stick a knife in you true all life will be there blake you should come and join in the fun frankly my fine irish friend im tempted what are the rashids up to sean why import an ira hit squad into hazar well thats what im going to find out then watch your back dillon laughed out loud that i will blake who would have thought it an ira enforcer and two of londons finest gangsters in the middle of the desert why does it always have to be us sean im not into moral philosophy i just have a sneaking suspicion that you and billy are going to have much too good a time i dive too you know do you really think the president theres only one way for you to find out at northolt the following morning they found lacey and parry waiting and in something of a surprise ferguson i thought id see you off laceys had the roundels removed since we neednt advertise the raf what are we calling it lacey a united nations charter general ah well no one will quarrel with that the quartermaster appeared a rather tall and forbidding retired guards sergeant major theres a question of weapons mr dillon may we talk of course dillon said the quartermaster led the way into an anteroom on a wide table were several aks brownings carswell silencers and three small machine pistols parkerhales mr dillon excellent sergeant major ive had diving equipment loaded on board youll need air bottles down there id take care if i were you never know what these arab buggers might try to put in them i take the point dillon told him good because i would like to meet you again mr dillon well see what we can do the sergeant major said ill load up sir while the plane was loading they drank coffee and tea in the lounge ferguson said we have little outright influence in hazar any longer all these small countries like their independence these days they dont have an army just the hazar scouts a small regiment of arab bedu traditionally commanded by british officers at the moment villiers is the commander you know about him do i liaise with him dillon asked he could be useful he has his ear to the ground knows whats going on at the moment as i understand it the scouts are patrolling the empty quarter they have problems with adoo bandits up there men on the run from yemen lawrence of arabia stuff its just like the old days any game is better than no game just like northern ireland really billy said the old sods getting at you dillon yes i know he is billy but its okay dillon smiled amiably what do you want me to do tell him to get stuffed oh youve been doing that one way or another for some years now dillon ferguson got up i dont know whats going on out there but its certain to be dodgy take care ah but i always do dillon shook hands dont worry charles youve got me billy and harry were an unbeatable combination a few minutes later the gulfstream roared along the runway at northolt ferguson waited then turned and got into his daimler and was driven away it was all up to dillon now but then there was nothing new in that hazar the airport at hazar was five miles out of town it was a single runway but had been built by the raf in the old days for military use so it was capable of handling anything even a hercules when the gulfstream landed and they disembarked two land rovers drove up the man who got out of the first one was in his sixties deeply tanned whitebearded wearing a crumpled bush hat khaki shirt and slacks hal stone he held out his hand i understand youre a hell of a diver dillon how did you know it was me the wonders of modern science computers the internet the downloading of pretty colour pictures he turned to the others billy and harry salter what a combination even the kray brothers would have been impressed he called in arabic and two men got out of the other land rover load everything take it to the sultan lacey and parry found them and dillon made the introductions stone said are you staying over not this time sir lacey told him good then you wont need my rather dubious expertise on hazar what to avoid which on the whole is everything he turned to the others come on i could do with a cold beer before i show you the sultan in the land rover dillon lit a cigarette youre actually a cambridge don a fellow of corpus christi and hoxley professor of marine archaeology theres another thing you should know about me i used to work for the secret security services when i was a lot younger and rather more foolish cousin charles has filled me in on you and your friends so i know what youre up to but frankly i dont care as long as you do some diving for me well that sounds okay billy told him billy is a master diver dillon said hes good and you okay im just modest and i do have another agenda a rashid agenda stone smiled kate rashid turned up yesterday with four irishmen northern variety should make you feel at home dillon and where would they be staying the excelsior hotel down on the waterfront its like a set from an old warner brothers movie all you need is humphrey bogart i said i wanted a cold beer and well have it there dillon lit another cigarette and stone added give me one sure stone took it and inhaled with conscious pleasure let me just tell you one thing what youre up to is your business but i would like to point out that this is the sort of place where theyll cut your balls off for a packet of marlboros the dogs harry salter said we cant have that can we there were cottages in the grounds of the excelsior hotel kate had booked bell and his three friends into a triple complex around a small courtyard she herself was staying at the rashid villa which also housed the company headquarters and a small computer and communications setup a young arab came into her office and placed a couple of sheets on her desk a un plane landed a short while ago these are the passengers downloaded from the computer kate had a look and smiled well now picked up by professor stone get my jeep ill take a run down to the harbour the port of hazar was small with narrow alleys and white buildings stepped back up the hillside the excelsior as stone had indicated was very oldfashioned with electric fans turning in the ceiling a huge marbletopped bar french windows open to the harbour there was an assortment of vessels there a few small coastal freighters many dhows stone pointed to a spot a mile out theres the sultan the big old dhow the ship were looking at an american ammunition ship sunk by a uboat on its way to japan is about ninety feet down they were sitting on the hotel terrace the awning flapping above them in the wind whats this phoenician thing billy asked oh some of the boys brought up shards of pottery and various other items its down there all right whats left of it ive carbondated them theyre possibly from a couple of hundred bc but you cant be sure i cant wait to go down billys an enthusiast dillon said behind him bell brosnan ohara and costello came into the bar and sat on the high stools in the moment dillon saw them in the mirror bell saw him he was totally astonished dillon got up with me billy he walked over why aidan youre a long way from drumcree and all that soft irish rain jesus bell said what are you doing here being your worst nightmare costello who had just sampled his beer raised the glass suddenly but billy kicked him hard on the right ankle hooked his arm and removed it from his hand thats very stupid do that again and ill put it in your face a quiet voice said no need for that dillon turned and found kate rashid standing there why kate he said and arent you the wonder of the world you turn up everywhere they walked back to the terrace while stone and the salters maintained an uneasy truce with bell and company bizarre isnt it dillon said do you know stone of him so what are you doing here im diving for him if you know anything about hazar youll know about the sultan oh i know everything about it just as i know everything about you and your friends the salters you mix in interesting company dillon very true kate harry salter is legitimate now mostly but still one of the most influential villains in london billys killed four times theyre not chesterfields dillon said yes and youre not here to spend your time diving for hal stone oh yes ill dive for the professor and so will billy and nothing else kate my love what could there be youre on my case dillon beware the heat of the sun kate it can lead to paranoia he finished his beer and got up ill have to love you and leave you i cant wait to check out that wreck she went back to the bar bell said whats that little shite up to theres nothing he can do here she said not a damn thing this is hazar the council of elders think they control it but not for much longer soon it will be all rashid now lets go to your bungalow and look at the plans in the living room of bells cottage many papers were stacked on a desk including a large ordnance survey map bell said theres only one main road up there to the holy wells yes she nodded and next tuesday all twelve of the council of elders will be there you still havent said how you want it done ambush or semtex bomb we can do either t think the bomb would be more persuasive ill arrange to have some of my people take you up there so you can see for yourself excellent but what about dillon oh ill take care of that you know what they say diving is a hazardous occupation the wind blowing in from the sea was warm and somehow perfumed with spices as they left the harbour in an old motorboat crewed by two arabs christ dillon you dont half bring us to some strange places harry salter said come off it harry you love it its the edge of danger this place youll need a shooter in your pocket as the professor said youre upagainst the kind of people wholl cut your balls off for a packet of fags id like them to try salter said i havent had a bit of action for a while that sultan looks like something out of an old sinbad movie stone laughed youre just about right harry if i can call you that its great virtue is that its big lots of cabins on board dillon breathed deeply of the salt air and a school of flying fish erupted from the water jesus dillon billy said this is special i mean this is the real business they coasted up to the sultan someone threw a line and they tied up and mounted the ladder one by one the boys will take care of things hal stone said ill show you your quarters as it turned out billy and his uncle were sharing and dillon had a cabin to himself in the stern he unpacked then checked out the weaponry bag he laid out the aks on a table the parkerhale machine pistols the brownings with the silencers his own favoured walther there was a kick on the door it opened and billy and his uncle came in are we going to war again billy asked well we are in the war zone billy dillon shoved two brownings over loaded plus spare clips you need something in your pocket here especially with bell and company around yes well screw them harry salter hefted a browning yes this will do me nicely he put it in his pocket plus the extra clip loaded for bell billy did the same all right so weve got the heavy artillery here only for when its necessary at the moment all i want is to go down to that wreck well lets go out on deck and well see there were three arab divers on deck as dillon and billy got ready stone was there and harry salter shook his head i dont know dillon salter said i mean it isnt natural all this diving youre right dillon was pulling on a blue diving suit the air we breathe is part oxygen and nitrogen the deeper i go the more nitrogen is absorbed and thats when trouble starts he clamped a tank to his inflatable and strapped an orca computer to the line of his airpressure gauge he eased on the jacket with the tank found a net diving bag and a lamp then spat in his mask and pulled it on billy was doing the same dillon made the okay signal with his finger and thumb and went over the rail backwards followed by billy way way below was a great reef with coral outcrops sponges a kind of blue vault a crowd of barracuda swam by there were angel and parrot fish silversides horseeyed jacks it was a total joy and dillon jackknifed and went down checking his dive computer for its automatic readings on depth elapsed time underwater and safe time remaining and then there below was the freighter still in very reasonable condition dillon turned made the ok sign to billy and went down he led the way in through a torpedo hole on the starboard side worked his way through a maze of passageways emerged through another torpedo hole in the stern and paused he made a sign to billy thumbs down and jackknifed again there in the detritus on the seabed under the stern he hovered and scrabbled with gloved hands and by a miracle came up trumps straight away what he pulled out was a small figurine a religious figure a woman with large eyes and a swollen belly billy came close and looked his expression ecstatic then he went down himself and started to search dillon hovered then billy came up with some sort of plate dillon nodded and they started up back on the boat they held their finds out for hal stone and stripped off their diving gear the professor was delighted dammit dillon this figurine is a major find the british museum would go crazy for it and what about my plate billy demanded its a temple votive plate billy and an absolute beauty billy turned to his uncle there you go i mean weve brought up stuff the british museum would give their eye teeth for and weve only started billy dillon said as he lit a cigarette and turned to stone weve got visitors colonel tony villiers was a tall saturnine grenadier guardsman in his late forties many of those years with the sas he had soldiered from the falklands to the gulf war through countless tours in ireland decorated several times there wasnt much he hadnt seen and a tour in bosnia and kosovo had compounded it he sat there in a small motor cruiser now in headcloth and khaki uniform a young officer with him and coasted in to the sultan he came up the ladder and hal stone greeted him weve met before im charles fergusons cousin thats a recommendation villiers said and this is cornet richard bronsby blues and royals so were still at it hal stone said just like the good old colonial days this is sean dillon by the way and billy and harry salter i know about everyone villiers said charles ferguson has been very forthcoming a few moments later sitting in the stern of the sultan under an awning dillon said and just how much has good old charles told you enough to indicate that he doesnt know what the rashids are up to which is why hes sent you and your friends dillon you and i have been close in the past but never met thank christ dillon said villiers said god help me but i spent enough time chasing you all over south armagh ah well dillon said i suppose were off the same side of the street is cornet bronsby hes just learning good then lets have a drink and see what the rashids are up to they pulled beers out of a cooler and villiers said paul rashid is an old comrade we did the gulf together he got an mc hes a firstclass soldier who runs this place dillon said that he does and yes before you ask me theres little doubt that hes responsible for the sultans death so what would you say theyre up to why do you bring a notorious ira terrorist and his team to a place like hazar because you want them to kill someone for you id have thought but who dillon asked well have to see unfortunately i cant stay weve trouble on the border from yemeni marxists so bronsby and i must get back and do a little policing stay in touch dillon said you can rely on it just one thing whats that the youngest rashid brother george the one who was a second lieutenant with one para in ireland my spies tell me hes up in the empty quarter operating with the rashid out of shabwa oasis george not only speaks fluent arabic but the rashid dialect well good for him dillon said my arabic isnt too bad my irish is perfect villiers laughed and replied in irish i had a grandmother from cork who used to force it into me when i spent school holidays with her good man yourself dillon keep the faith heres my mobile number if you need me dillon turned to cornet bronsby listen to your man here son hes the best youre in bad company up there so if you want to live he shrugged cornet richard bronsby smiled which made him look about fifteen id say ive been in extraordinary company mr dillon he held out his hand and dillon took it well as we say in ireland watch your back towards evening dillon and billy decided to dive again there was still plenty of light and it was warm and the wind gentle as they drifted in in the harbour kate rashid sat on the stern deck of an arab dhow and watched through glasses kelly stood beside her dillon and billy salter theyre going down again what do you want me to do kill them now she said take said and achmed with you and i want no slipups kelly theres too much at stake here as you say lady kate dillon pulled on his jacket with his tank and billy did the same harry and hal stone checked their gear christ this is great billy said youve got your knife of course i have then take a spear gun why dillon because sharks are not unknown in these waters really billy laughed well you learn something new every day harry said you bleeding watch yourself billy grinned pulled down his mask and went over dillon laughed at hal stone what was it suetonius said those who are about to die salute you i could give it to you in latin stone told him oh its the thought that counts said dillon and went over the rail after billy there was the blue vault again that strange feeling of space extending all around them the freighter below dillon and billy went down together spear guns in hand they saw barracudas again and three or four manta rays down on the bottom dillon felt good enjoying every moment as he dived down billy following they went through the first torpedo hole entry followed each other through the maze of passages then emerged through the stern torpedo hole when kelly plunged down toward them with said and achmed all three clutching spear guns dillon tapped billy on the back and pushed him away as achmed fired a spear it narrowly missed billy dillon jackknifed spiralled fired upwards and caught achmed in the chest kelly fired his spear and it dropped into dillons left sleeve a glancing blow that did no damage except to rip the material of his diving suit kelly closed a knife in his hand and dillon grabbed for his left wrist as they wrestled said fired at billy who swerved to one side and fired in return the spear caught said under the chin dillon and kelly struggled frantically then dillon pulled him round and slashed with his knife across kellys air hose there was a great disturbance in the water bubbles everywhere and then kelly stopped kicking and drifted away achmed struggled to pull the spear from his chest and billy swerved around him and slashed at his air hose then billy hovered beside dillon and they watched the three bodies sink below them dillon gave the thumbsup sign and they started to ascend on deck they sprawled exhausted for gods sake hal stone said what went on down there the third world war i looked over the stern rail i could see we were attacked dillon said a guy named kelly exsas head of security for the rashids the other two seemed arab jesus harry salter said it must be the bird that lady kate rashid oh i think you can count on that harry were an encumbrance a serious one which means only one thing hal stone said whatever theyre up to here its still something that could fail yes im inclined to agree with you dillon got up lets get a shower billy and clean clothes then well go and book dinner at the excelsior who knows who might be there hal stone stayed on board as dillon harry and billy went to the excelsior the bar was not all that busy and the restaurant was almost empty arab workers standing waiting there were white linen tablecloths silver crystal just like the old days they sat in deep chairs by the bar dillon ordered a bottle of veuve clicquot then called villiers on his mobile villiers said still with us dillon only just dillon filled him in villiers said it reinforces what i said whatever is going on is damned important keep me posted they sat talking and lady kate rashid drifted into the bar bell with her dillon got up watch my back billy costellos out there on the terrace he walked to the bar billy leaned on the other end and looked toward costello then he took out his browning and put it on the bar dillon said they tell me the foods not bad here its not le caprice but its okay aidan here would be happier with irish stew but you cant have everything i hope youre not looking for kelly she went very still he rather foolishly attacked billy and me down on the freighter it got very nasty knives air hoses being slashed quite messy the last i saw of him he was on the bottom very dead indeed along with two arab divers rather stupid kate you shite dillon bell said oh come on aidan did you want me to roll over and die bell smiled reluctantly youd never do that never so if you dont mind billy and i will go back to the diving now bell burst into laughter and turned to kate and if you believe that youll believe anything the next day bell and his three friends crammed into a cessna and flew up to a landing strip near shabwa oasis where they were met by george rashid who was dressed as a bedu ill take you to the road to the holy wells he said we want you to know the situation exactly he led the way to a triplebenched jeep sat in the front with a driver and bell and his men got in behind they drove through the heat the dust rising costello said what a bloody country it separates the men from the boys george rashid said and one other thing thats very important for you to understand this area here where hazar borders the empty quarter its always been disputed territory which means no one has legal jurisdiction you could kill the pope here and no one could do anything about it well thats useful bell said they stopped at the main rashid camp at shabwa oasis to refuel and renew water supplies and took the opportunity to eat costello said what is this its goat stew with rice george rashid told them costello said excuse me he went some little distance away and was sick behind a palm tree when he returned george rashid said are you all right mr costello not really on the other hand when you worked south armagh with one para ill lay odds you ate pub food in every village absolutely george grinned irish potatoes and bread and cabbage in season screw you costello said youre making it worse bell said come on lets go and look at the site then we can go back to hazar and get you an egg sandwich pat the road ran through a defile between shallow stone outcrops and beyond it sand dunes marched away to the horizon the jeep pulled in on a slope and george got out that one spot there below where the road is is not in the open its the obvious place for an ambush the holy wells are ten miles east lets take a look bell led the way into the defile followed by george and the others it was quiet down there the sides of the defile rising three hundred feet bell said well make it a line bomb boys one side of the road to the other ill do it up with costello you two can set up with a light machine gun on that ridge lay down covering fire take out anyone left george said well that looks pretty damned good to me so well go back to hazar and check on the supplies you have to offer whatever you need you get george said and led the way back to the jeep hal stone called dillon harry and billy to the stern deck of the sultan under the awning ive been checking with my local contacts and george rashid bell and his friends flew upcountry in a threeten landed near shabwa stayed a couple of hours and came back and we dont know why dillon said im afraid not i have my boys sniffing around for rumours but nothings come up dillon thought about it then said if we flew up to shabwa would it make a difference as regards finding things out im not sure and what do you mean by we well for starters i can fly anything i dont need a pilot just a plane thats interesting ben carver who owns carver air transport has two threetens and a golden eagle just for local flights fine so hire me a plane harry billy and i will fly to shabwa and nose around well if thats what you want to do stone said ill arrange it at the villa kate rashid was working on company papers when her mobile rang george said ive had word from a source in hazar dillon and the salters are flying up to shabwa in one of carvers threetens dillons piloting i sometimes think he has a death wish kate said what do we do im getting tired of him brother shoot dillon and his friends out of the sky a pleasure george rashid said later in the day the coasted toward shabwa billy and harry sitting behind dillon the sky a deep blue the sand dunes some three hundred feet high stretching to infinity dillon throttled back eased the control column slid over an enormous dune and saw below him a column of three vehicles all crammed with men the next thing he knew they were firing at him the windscreen and a side window shattered and harry cried out as a splinter sliced his right cheek a burst of machinegun fire cut into the port wing dillon hauled back banked away and boosted speed the column disappeared behind them but the engines coughed angrily and then first the port then the starboard engine cut out silence enveloped them broken only by the wind the sand dune in front was five hundred feet high billy said christ dillon ive never seen anything like it well brighton beach it isnt billy hang on you two dillon hauled back on the column scraped across the ridge and drifted down to a soft sand plain below the plane bounced a couple of times wheels up then ploughed to a halt dillon switched off you two okay salter said thats it no more foreign holidays after this i wont even do a day trip to calais dillon got the door open and scrambled out over the wing billy and his uncle followed harry said what happens now theyll come looking dillon said if you want my opinion they knew it was us if you follow me so where does that leave us billy demanded lets see dillon got his coded mobile out and started to search his pockets damn i dont have villierss number with me he thought a moment all right and called ferguson in london he got an almost instant reply charles its me were in trouble after the explanation ferguson said dont worry ill get hold of villiers ill give him your number hell handle it hes as bad as you when he gets stuck in im glad to hear it dillon switched off and said to the others we wait it was only twenty minutes later when his phone rang and villiers said are you all in one piece dillon absolutely myself and the salters they were waiting for us well what could you expect in a place the size of hazar they had to know you were coming so what do we do theyll find us again before long im forty miles east with the scouts ill leave bronsby with half of them and come myself with the others but id suggest you move check your gps and let me know your whereabouts give me a minute dillon went to the plane and got the required information villiers said good now get the hell out of there theres an old fort not that far from you thatll be better cover than the plane trek northeast well push hard but theyll be close dillon damn close take my mobile number and keep in touch good luck dillon turned to the salters and told them what villiers had said get water food an ak each and spare ammunition then were out of it he grinned at harry youll be able to cancel your subscription at the gym harry youll lose a stone in two days out here it was two hours later that george rashid and ten bedu in two land rovers found the his chief tracker went sniffing around came back and pointed northeast that way effendi they are on foot then run them down george said the salters and dillon walked abreast wearing headcloths against the intense heat the problem was finding a way through the dunes dillon led but it was heavy going in the soft sand they came out into a level plain and there was the oasis and the remains of a fort billy said is that a mirage it was harry who called out behind you dillon they turned and found george rashid and the two land rovers appearing over a sand dune run for it dillon cried and i mean run if they catch us in the open were finished and he stumbled down the hillside they dashed past a well a line of palm trees and then through what was left of the gateway in the crumbling wall dillon led the way up steps to the large wall where they looked out and saw george rashid and his ten bedu arrive the land rovers came to a halt and the bedu got out with george rashid leading on the wall dillon peered through one of the openings billy and harry on either side clutching their aks harry said what are we doing here its like this movie i saw as a kid ray milland gary cooper beau geste that was it i saw that one billy said when the men were killed the sergeant put them on the wall to make it look busy well theres only three of us dillon said and wed better make it good because these guys really do cut your balls off they took positions and the arabs spread out from the land rovers harry salter said what in the hell am i doing here dillon having a good time harry trust me and youll get back to wapping he took careful aim and fired and a bedu went down there you go weve got plenty of ammunition spray the bastards the rashid retreated behind the land rovers and opened fire heavily on the wall dillon and the salters returned fire take your time billy dillon said single shot let harry loose off but you and i take individual targets thats your strength billy squeezed off a single round as asked and a bedu fell to one side from the shelter of one of the land rovers there you go billy thats the way dillon said we hold them back until villiers gets here he took out a pair of zeiss glasses there was a flurry of bedu moves from one land rover to another dillon said i just caught a glimpse of george rashid so we know where we are with that bleeding lot harry salter said and fired a long burst below george rashid spoke to his men i want covering fire from one land rover ill go with four of you in the other round to the rear the wall is half fallen there we take them two ways now move a moment later the land rover roared away dillon looked again through his glasses and saw legs underneath the other land rover he took careful aim and fired and another bedu fell into view and lay writhing on the ground at the same time there was a burst of firing from the rear dillon turned and george rashid and his men poured over the broken wall below into the courtyard dillon and the salters fell down on their faces as automatic fire raked the wall dillon and billy fired back another bedu went down but at the same moment the men behind the land rover at the front gate raked the wall with automatic fire dillon and his friends crouched low as pieces of the wall cascaded over their heads and then there was a burst of firing from some other direction and dillon looked out and saw tony villiers and his hazar scouts come over one of the huge dunes in five land rovers they paused then opened up with heavy machine gun fire at the land rover in front of the forts main gate it fireballed as its fuel tank was hit and the four men left ran for their lives across open ground and were cut down villiers and his men came down the side of the dune and george rashid and the three survivors of his group disappeared back over the crumbling rear wall a moment later their land rover raced away and disappeared into a narrow defile it was suddenly very still dillon leaned against the wall with billy and got a pack of marlboros out harry was slumped down for christs sake dillon im an old guy youve done good harry yeah id be great if i were the third lead in some old blackandwhite movie on a satellite channel only you make it happen for real youre a monster dillon the land rover column of hazar scouts came in through the entrance and halted in the courtyard dillon and the salters went down the steps and tony villiers got out of the lead vehicle and approached hot stuff dillon shook hands george rashid was in charge really then youve definitely hit a nerve dillon youre a lucky man id say that speaks for itself villiers lit a cigarette right ill take you to shabwa oasis well arrange for carver to find a plane and fly you back to hazar that makes sense dillon said and dont forget to thank charles ferguson without him you gentlemen would have been dead in the bar at the excelsior dillon sat with hal stone and the salters stone said it really is like a bad movie harry you can bleeding well say that again a few days away with dillon isnt like walking up the palace pier at brighton and having fish and chips and a glass of champagne this one puts you in serious hazard of your life oh come on harry dillon said you havent had so much fun in years and what have you got to worry about its tony villiers and his boys whore up there taking all that shite hal stone said thats all very fine dillon but we still dont have the slightest inkling what the rashids are up to the only thing we know for sure is that they want to knock you off but why why are you such a threat id like to know that myself dillon told him billy said if you look at it the most significant thing is that bell and his mob are here as a team what do they need a whole team for well we dont know do we his uncle asked there was a moments silence and then hal stone said of course we could always find out they all looked at him and dillon said what are you suggesting well theres four of them including bell i assume they must all know what the game is billy said so if we cut one of them off from the pack is that what youre saying something like that i dont know seems rather obvious but sometimes the most obvious plans are the ones that work best dillon said harry said what wed need to know is when these bleeders are available when they come into town and for what purpose to get laid billy said they all laughed but stone said actually youre right ive kept my ear to the ground one of them costello i think is apparently quite fond of an establishment named madame rosas so what do we do kidnap him harry salter asked stone said why not billy said okay so what do bell and his goons do when costello turns up missing i dont know stone shrugged of course its possible they just might think hes in bed with a woman somewhere or two why professor harry salter teased him im shocked a man of learning like yourself indulging in such unsavoury thoughts ill get over it dillon left the planning of the operation to harry salter and harry performed brilliantly that night he wore an opennecked dark linen shirt and a cream linen tropical suit and looked quite affluent he sat with billy at a pavement cafe on the other side of the road from madame rosas and thanks to a discreet bribe waited for word from inside that costello was on his way when it came harry went in himself older welldressed wealthylooking and had the girls queuing up billy waited until he saw costello arrive then followed bell and his group sat with kate rashid and went over the maps again bell said so were on line here the elders will be en route to the holy wells at around noon well fly up tonight in carvers golden eagle sort out weaponry at shabwa then carry on by land rover in the morning kate said that sounds good one change well connect with your brother and his bedu up there we may need backup better to have them available fine kate said ill speak to george and arrange it she phoned her brother in london and got nowhere so she tried his mobile paul rashid answered at once how are things going fine were going to fly up to shabwa in one of carvers planes ill see you there im on my way ill land at haman come on in the hawk helicopter look for me i will costello had slipped out of the excelsior and made his way to madame rosas where he was greeted with enthusiasm he had three girls to take care of his every want irish whiskey and cocaine to influence him south armagh it wasnt hed never known such pleasure and when they took him to a luxurious bedroom kissed and fondled him a little then suggested he undress he was falling over himself the girls left and costello started to get ready the door opened behind him he turned and harry salter came through the door followed by billy here what is this costello demanded harry had him by the throat keep your mouth shut start dressing again now look here billy took a browning from his pocket and clouted costello across the side of the head just do as the man says if you want to live and costello frightened for the first time in years did as he was told they took him out to the sultan where dillon and hal stone waited two arab deckhands ran costello into the stern dillon barked orders in arabic they ripped off costellos jacket and shirt and then his trousers leaving him in his underpants the salters leaned against the rail and hal stone sat on a canvas chair and drank cold beer two of his divers behind him dillon said dont screw me around patrick bell wouldnt be over here with you lot if you werent up to something big costello said go on stuff yourself oh i like that harry salter said i mean thats elegant dont you think thats elegant billy no actually harry i think its rude and stupid and selfdestructive youve been reading those books on philosophy again dillon said its a waste of time i thought there might be some sweet reason here and obviously there isnt he went and picked up a length of chain by the stern rail and handed it to one of the divers he said in arabic round his ankles and over costello cried out as they put him down and started with the chain here whats going on youre going down dillon told him you can join kelly and the two arabs who tried to finish me and billy off you wouldnt hal stone got up for gods sake dillon you cant do this his part in the good policemanbad policeman routine was impeccable well im tired of being mr nice guy professor killing bombing you name it hes done it he can go for the deep six and who cares he nodded at the two divers they upended costello and put him over the stern rail he screamed in mortal fear and his head went into the sea harry salter said pull the bugger back maybe hes learned sense costello lay on the deck sobbing dillon squatted beside him so whats it about patrick ill tell you i swear it costello said theres this bunch of arab leaders called the council of elders and tomorrow morning theyre going to this place called the holy wells and we take them out dear god in heaven hal stone said where dillon asked rama its called rama dillon removed his chain costello still sobbing put him in the hold dillon said in arabic to the divers what did you say what did you say oh god youre going to kill me costello said turned and hurled himself over the rail he surfaced on the pale yellow stern light and dillon said billy billy took careful aim and shot him in the back of the head was that strictly necessary hal stone asked it was if we want the fact that we know what theyre up to to stay private harry salter told him bell and kate rashid waited while tommy brosnan and jack ohara went looking for costello they came back with no result and bell was furious the bastard ill cut his balls off he cant resist skirt probably holed up in some whorehouse and drunk what do we do kate asked we can manage ill kick his arse later but right now lets get moving ben carver ran the air taxi firm at the airport he was fifty an exraf squadron leader with a dfc from the gulf war he was tending to overweight these days his boys were loading the golden eagle bell and his men and kate rashid approached i heard you lost a plane carver kate said a private charter yes a mister dillon carver said it crashed in the empty quarter but colonel villiers and the hazar scouts found them well thats good i hope you have insurance absolutely lady kate lets get going then fifteen minutes later the golden eagle took off climbed to five thousand and headed for shabwa dillon caught villiers on his coded mobile ive got bad news really bad news as to why theyre here tell me which dillon did afterwards villiers said have you told ferguson no he should be on his way out here by now dillon im a hundred and fifty miles to the south of that road to the holy wells and ive split my command sent bronsby east we each have fifty men ill never make it all right so warn the council of elders to turn back dillon it wont happen theyre obviously doing the whole thing on the quiet these are very oldfashioned people i tried to speak to the advisers earlier a routine call and the mobile phone was out you mean we sit here and let them drive up through one of the worst deserts in the world to their deaths ill go like hell but through that terrain fifteen miles an hour is tops ill call in bronsby for support thats not good enough dillon thought about it what if we fly to that airstrip at shabwa its surrounded by rashid bedu at the moment and dillon saw it then leave it ill call you back hal stone called ben carver i heard youd gone upcountry so youre back obviously stone said i want a flight to a position east of shabwa to drop two men by parachute a thousandfoot job you must be mad ten thousand sterling carver hesitated and there was silence stone looked at dillon who nodded all right ben fifteen thousand come on just a onehour flight drop them and come back greed as usual ruled the day carver said okay ill do it dillon took the phone carver dillon here we might need you later to pick up major general ferguson from haman military airfield and take him upcountry now look carver said twenty thousand dillon told him how about that carver took in a deep breath ive heard of ferguson well you would he runs things for the prime minister so its all kosher its just like being back in the raf so have the plane ready and two chutes dillon went to the rail where billy and harry were having coffee so what gives harry asked this is me and billy dillon told him billy said come on dillon what are we into now ive spoken to villiers hes split his command hell drive hard through the night but its a hell of a way to cover at fifteen miles an hour besides that that airstrip at shabwa is in rashid hands the council of elders seem to have a security blackout according to villiers hal stone said so theyll simply drive through the night to certain death some time tomorrow morning thats not the way i see it dillon turned to billy in cornwall last year you did brilliantly jumped from six hundred feet without any training somebody should have given you wings here come off it dillon harry said youre talking about jumping from a plane up there the two of you trying to screw things up until villiers and his cowboys get there am i right harry its what im doing billys a free spirit and billy and i share a love of philosophy what in the hell is that supposed to mean plato remember him billy and billy salter london gangster four times in prison a killer in his time smiled the coldest smile possible sure i remember the life which is unexamined is not worth living which means to me the life not put to the test time to put ourselves to the test sean good man yourself ill fly up with carver in his golden eagle just like cornwall billy except its headfirst at one thousand feet in this case some say im mad billy unhinged you might say ive done bad things in my life but the rashids have done worse and im going to stop them no youve got it wrong dillon billy said we are going to stop them billy youre mad too harry told him what else do i do go home to wapping chase birds get so frustrated i finally do one job too many and pull five years billy smiled id rather go down for something worthwhile harry salter was astonished what can i say nothing dillon said just come along for the ride in london charles ferguson was clearing his desk when the doorbell rang and kim showed blake johnson in good to see you blake the president wanted me here this latest news has shocked him greatly you realize blake that hazar is neutral the border with the empty quarter is disputed territory you could have a war there butcher the council of elders do what you like and be totally untouchable by any other country yes we know that charles but the ramifications would be farreaching which is why the president has sent you yes and has spoken to the prime minister so i believe well were going to downing street to speak to him now youve done well blake the president and the prime minister on the same day at the door of the most famous address in the world an aide greeted them general ferguson mr johnson the prime minister is waiting he took them upstairs past the pictures of previous prime ministers knocked and opened the door of the prime ministers study he was working at his desk in shirtsleeves the youngest prime minister for more than a century he glanced up the face firm and then smiled in a familiar way general ferguson he got up came round the desk and shook hands and mr johnson about time he clapped blake on the shoulder the president has brought me up to date id like to hear it from you two later someone brought tea and coffee and the prime minister sat there his face very calm it defies belief that the rashids would behave in such a way i know the earl well its a fact prime minister ferguson said its appalling he tries to assassinate the president and now the hazar council of elders the prime minister turned to blake would you agree with me that this would be a disaster in our opinion sir thats exactly what it would be the prime minister sat there face calm brooding well you may act with my full authority he stood up i have another appointment do what you have to do general they were ushered out it was over ferguson said hazar next stop blake in hazar kate rashid and bell had landed at the airstrip near shabwa four hours later they were waiting for the rashid gulfstream at the military base at haman early in the southern arabian dawn light the plane glided down and several land rovers moved forward kate got out of the first one wearing a khaki bush shirt and slacks and an arab headcloth paul rashid embraced her wheres george with his men on the road to the holy wells with bell and his people is michael well holding the fort in london rashid warriors had emerged from the land rovers and stood there with their rifles in total silence kate turned and snapped her fingers a young boy ran forward holding a robe helped paul rashid into it and then offered a headcloth rashid fastened it then turned and raised his right arm fist clenched my brothers he called in arabic and put his arm around kate they brandished their rifles and roared approval so lets get on with it he helped her into the lead land rover and got in beside her he lit a cigarette so bell and his team are definitely on schedule yes as i told you george and his warriors are supporting them the only problem is that one of bells men went missing a drunk and a womanizer they tried to find him but bell thinks hes holed up in some whorehouse i dont like that when a pattern is disrupted i wonder why well hes that kind of guy paul and dillon still on the sultan with professor stone and the two london gangsters totally out of their element whatever hazar is its not wapping over there they are something here they are nothing true paul rashid brooded and shabwa is ours absolutely dillon couldnt fly up there and land even if he wanted to and why should he he doesnt know whats going on rashid nodded so i go with an escort to the holy wells ambush site join george and his men and bell he turned and smiled would you come with me itd be a privilege brother good he lit another cigarette well set the world on fire little sister she took his hand and held on tight at the airport just after dawn carver checked out the golden eagle hal stone was there with dillon and the salters dillon had opened the weaponry bag from london the best the sergeant major could supply titanium bulletproof waistcoats aks a couple of brownings with silencers half a dozen fragmentation grenades two parkerhale machine pistols dillon and billy got kitted out carver said whats going on here are you still on the raf reserve dillon asked so what well youve got a dfc after this you might get another one were the good guys ben your guys does that give you a problem carvers smile was instant no it bloody well doesnt so lets do it dillon turned are you coming harry but it was stone who said dillon they wont believe this at high table at corpus but im coming too billy was right a life not put to the test is not worth living up in the high country bell ohara and brosnan worked on the road through the defile laying packs of semtex stretching wires to a detonator it was early the real heat of the day still to come bedu squatted and watched george rashid crouched close by bell said funny isnt it back there in south armagh you were trying to stiff us of course i was i held her majestys commission as a second lieutenant in one para you were the enemy i shot two of your people personally bastard brosnan snarled bell said dont be silly he was doing his job now get on with the wiring an hour and a half earlier in the dawn light carver had flown in at five thousand feet and descended dillon leaned over his shoulder is that it rama thats all i know go down and lets make sure theyre not there the golden eagle descended to a thousand feet carver said it looks clear to me good go round again and well jump youre crazy you know that yes but it does make life interesting ben dillon went back and nodded to billy time to go get the door open it was harry who moved first as he wrestled with the locking bar the airstair door opened the steps went down and there was a huge intake of air stone and harry hung on and billy and dillon moved forward the aks and parkerhales across their chests after you dillon shouted above the roaring youre a younger guy billy laughed youre an older guy so ill be on the ground first to protect you he stepped out onto the airstair door went headfirst and dillon went after him the golden eagle started to turn away and stone and harry wrestled with the door and finally got it closed harry ran to a window and as they banked saw the two chutes land way below they made it good professor stone said so lets get out of here before the other people notice us and start asking questions at northolt ferguson had found lacey and parry waiting with the gulfstream plus the sergeant major with two aks and four brownings youre going into battle again general he said well its not exactly good where we are going so lets be ready he turned to blake you can handle an ak charles thats like asking if your grandmother can cook i was in vietnam ferguson shook hands with the sergeant major and turned to lacey four brownings squadron leader thats one each for you and the flight lieutenant hazar may prove a serious problem as regards your health i thought you should be ready very considerate of you general lacey said weve got a young lady on board to handle catering flight sergeant avon ferguson turned to the sergeant major find another browning of course sir later sitting in the plane the door closed ready to go the young flight sergeant appeared not wearing an raf uniform but an internationallooking navy blue job as the plane moved away she said anything you gentlemen would like later sergeant ferguson smiled you know who i am of course general he picked up the extra browning the sergeant major had given him i presume youve had basic weapon training of course sir good take this were going into harms way id like to think you can defend yourself if needs be she was so cool he could feel the ice thats very good of you general ive got prawn salad lancashire hotpot smoked salmon and game soup sounds fine blake said ferguson smiled mr johnson works for the president of the united states but do be prepared to use the browning the people on the other side arent nice no problem sir ive a bottle of tattinger in my fridge if youd care for a glass of champagne she left blake said i wonder how its going for dillon the question should be how is it going for the other lot ferguson said on the ground dillon divested himself of his chute covered it with soft sand and went looking for billy he clambered up the nearest sand dune and found him below on his knees burying his parachute dillon ploughed down to join him youre okay fine billy told him we should do this more often dillon took out his mobile and called villiers the colonel replied almost instantly dillon said billy and i are on the ground in one piece any sign of the opposition not when we flew over well make for rama see what the situation is on the road where are you twenty miles and bronsby about thirty miles maybe forty to the east good billy and i will push hard and cut the road the minute i get a smell of them ill call you he stuffed his phone into a pocket of his bush shirt turned to billy took out a compass and checked it right lets move it once we find the road well climb one of the dunes and see what we can see he took a headcloth from his backpack and pulled it on do the same billy its going to get hot they cut the road an hour later and moved along it at a half run there was a fine covering of sand but no sign of tyre tracks no sign of anything finally dillon stopped the defile was before them this has got to be it lets go up there he pointed to a sand dune that was at least five hundred feet high well see anything thats coming it was hard going the heat increasing as they toiled up the steep side of the dune and then they were on top and sat down billy produced a bottle of water drank some and passed it to dillon who drank deeply then took out his zeiss glasses and scanned the horizon thats it he pointed and passed the glasses to billy theyre to the east the farthest part of the road billy looked adjusted the glasses and the lead land rover sprang into view the column behind jesus billy said the rashids are coming up fast id say youre right billy and two of us let them get closer then ill call in and let villiers know where we are down in the defile at rama bell ohara and brosnan worked on their bomb george rashid sat waiting with some of his men up above on the edge of the defile a handful watched suddenly one of them fired a shot into the air stood up and waved a moment later two more land rovers appeared and braked to a halt paul and kate rashid got out rashid went forward and spoke to bell so it goes forward it will if we can get on with it instead of having a lot of idiots in bed sheets interfering beside him stood a plastic bottle of water suddenly there was a single shot and the bottle jumped into the air two of paul rashids guards ran forward and pulled him and kate to one side turned them and ran them to the land rover column there was another shot and one of them a bullet in his back fell on his face on the top of the sand dune dillon looked through the glasses its paul rashid down there and lady kate who wrote this script i dont know dillon what i do know is theres forty down there and two up here so live dangerously billy ill take the one on the left doing the wiring you do the one on the right he took careful aim and shot ohara who had stood up in the back brosnan was running weaving toward the column and billy got him in the lower spine driving him forwards onto his face paul rashid looked up to the top of the sand dune calm controlled adjusting his glasses and caught a glimpse of the two men dear god its dillon he turned and called to his men as bell arrived surround the dune he said in arabic and i want them alive dillon got his mobile out called villiers and brought him up to date villiers said wont be long now but can you hold theres two of us colonel thats all just hang on there dillon ill push like hell and bronsby trying just as hard from the other direction well i hope you all make it theyre coming up to get us right now he put the phone back in his breast pocket here we go billy he took careful aim and started to shoot at the arabs climbing the dune billy joined him listen dillon if the council of elders lot turn up all this shootings going to put them right off exactly billy lets pray colonel villiers gets here soon but villiers had done better than that he cut the road ahead of the council of elders convoy stopped them and spoke to their escort commander the convoy turned and went back villiers carried on to rama with his men dillon and billy burrowed in confident of only one thing they had the high ground they shot several of the rashid bedu as they came up the sand dune but they were still only two and then in the far distance on the road villiers appeared one of paul rashids men ran to his side and pointed rashid turned focused his glasses and saw tony villiers in the lead land rover damn he said to kate its the hazar scouts so all we have down there is a totally useless bomb kate said lets get out of here paul rashid said and live to fight another day his men retreated to the column some firing up at the top of the sand dune billy and dillon fired back and then the column moved away and turned out into the desert dillon lit a cigarette and checked the approach of villiers and his men just in time isnt that the phrase they went down and found villiers as the land rovers rolled to a halt dillon said weve got a bomb here if youve got a pair of wire cutters ill take care of it for you so kind villiers spoke to one of his men in arabic after a while dillon was supplied with what he needed later they sat beside the lead land rover drank bitter black tea and smoked cigarettes so the elders are safe villiers said dillon produced a pack of marlboros and lit another one tony villiers reached over and helped himself ill tell you i may have commanded that man in the gulf but id still like to know what goes on inside his head rashid dillon said tell me colonel you did irish time remember frank barry who could forget he also had a title an irish peer the lord of spanish head up there on the down coast pots of money but all that was important was what went on in his head the game and you think thats true of paul rashid hes done everything else hes got everything else yes id say the one thing hes seriously left with is the game so bosworth field is rama today it was billy the london gangster who said dauncey that was the family name thats right dillon said well they lost with richard iii and they lost with us dillon sat there thinking about it then smiled true billy very true are you trying to make a profound point he turned to villiers billy and i share a love of moral philosophy so does paul rashid what i find really interesting is sean dillon pride of the ira loving moral philosophy you didnt approve of my cause colonel but i was just as much a soldier as you and you know damn well that soldiers go beyond position beyond money beyond normal success they stand up and take the sword to hell with you dillon tony villiers said youre too damn good they started west now following the tracks of rashids column and gradually the light changed things got darker some miles away cornet bronsby of the blues and royals approached with his men toward an improbable rendezvous and was suddenly under fire they responded at once there was an exchange the column they had reached headon was paul rashid and his group on the retreat from rama there was a brief return of fire but rashids men held them off then bronsby decided enough was enough and ordered his men to retreat at some time in the confusion men rushed in from the shadows and overwhelmed him paul rashid his sister and bell pushed south and finally made contact with george rashid and discovered bronsby paul rashid was not happy he sat their with kate and george and bell and bronsby was brought forward in a way it was like being back at sandhurst this young decent englishman was a soldier just doing his job in many ways so like rashid it was a kind of turning point he couldnt really explain to himself all he knew was that this wasnt the way it was supposed to have happened i know where they are villiers said to dillon my spies out ahead are earning their money one of their wounded has confirmed that theyve caught bronsby dillon said that isnt good is it no theyre a very cruel people by nature what you and i think of as horrific they think of as normal in a strange kind of way dillon said so theyre going to give him a hard time im afraid so dillon sat there smoking a cigarette and thinking about it i dont like that he said to billy bronsby is what youd call a posh git but he was just doing his job yeah well i dont like it either he turned to villiers so where do we go id say shabwa and what do we do take rashid and the good kate on facetoface to a certain degree there was a pause and villiers said you like her dillon who the hell wouldnt dillon laughed and lit another marlboro go and stuff yourself colonel and lets press on just in case we can help bronsby outside shabwa oasis cooking fires glowed and the rashid bedu held the high ground villiers and his men were exhausted but they had enough energy to make something to eat and then the screaming started it was just after midnight and continued at intervals up there on the hill paul rashid george and kate approached to where cornet bronsby was tied down kate said is this what you want brother he was one of your own a guardsman yes but that isnt the point it doesnt bother you it bothers me a great deal he said bitterly but other things are more important a full moon bathed the mountainside in a harsh white light the men of the hazar scouts waited impassively behind what cover there was they smoked cigarettes and drank the english version of coffee provided in selfheating cans tony villiers sat behind a boulder with dillon and billy drank tea and topped it up with bushmills whiskey from a bottle provided by his servant ali this suit you dillon perfectly not me i dont drink billy told him villiers said to ali in good arabic id offer you one but i know the prophet forbids it but the prophet whose name be praised is always understanding ali told him and the night is cold then two whiskey sups villiers said one for you and the other for the radio operator he nodded to aziz ali passed the bottle to aziz who restricted himself to one swallow then passed it to ali who wiped the neck and had a drink above them there was another scream it faded away billy said what are they doing ali said the skin they slice the skin sahb his masculinity they take later the screaming started again i could do with another dillon said villiers splashed bushmills into the irishmans cup billy said its enough to make me ask for one but i wont what id like to do is put a bullet in paul rashid villiers said to ali you know the sahb up there is twentytwo years a baby colonel the radio crackled aziz listened then turned visitors sahb a british general named ferguson and two others excellent make sure your people are alerted coming up the hill in a jeep ferguson blake and harry salter wore combat gear and arab headcloths the jeep paused in the shadows and the three men got out billy went forward and his uncle put an arm around him so you made it you young bastard i hear it was a load of shit you must be rivalling billy the kid you look interesting billy smiled you didnt get that lot in savile row billy i feel like im an extra in a christmas pantomime at the palladium blake johnson colonel tony villiers ferguson said and there was a cry of agony from above ferguson was horrified whos up there cornet richard bronsby of the blues and royals second lieutenant in the household cavalry he could have been riding around london in a breastplate and helmet instead hes out here being tortured to death by rashid bedu the scream that followed was prolonged and appalling villiers added i wish we could interfere but there are too many of them and they have the high ground and up there paul rashid kate george and his men waited beside their own fires and beyond in the shadows cornet richard bronsby lay stretched out and endured torment aidan bell sat beside the fire shivering drank whiskey and smoked a cigarette paul rashid crouched beside him i want you out of here the staff will expect you at south audley street the russian premier arrives in london next week ill be hard on your heels work something out jesus wasnt nantucket enough for you wasnt this no not until i get my revenge not until i am satisfied land rovers will take you leave now and work fast i want a plan ready when i get there he stood up and walked away and joined kate and george at the fireside she was upset the screams from bronsby were hard to take paul is this necessary my people expect it kate it is hard but it is what they expect she sat there unhappy upset bronsby cried out again quite dreadfully on and on before stopping ali said i think he has gone sahb villiers sat there brooding about it ferguson said dear god dillon turned to blake well there you go it must remind you of the joys of the vietcong in the mekong delta harry salter said and we let people like these into the country dillon managed a hard smile why harry youre a racist villiers picked up an ak all right thats enough ali lets take a look ive waited long enough dillon said would you mind some company villiers hesitated then said i suppose that at the end of the day we are from the same side of the street lets do it they went up the hill villiers dillon billy harry and blake and they found cornet bronsby pegged out he was quite dead his skin peeled down from the chest his private parts stuffed in his mouth there was no need for that sahb ali said i am ashamed there is no honour in this he was carrying an old british lee enfield bolt action rifle as he turned to lead the way he stumbled tripped and fell over the rifle flying from his hands dillon helped him to his feet and villiers picked up his rifle ali held his arm ah its bad sahb maybe broken well see villiers told him well go back to the camp tell half a dozen men to carry him down but tell them to be careful no need sahb the triumph up on the hill is in what they have done they will kill no more we are of the blood i know well im not dillon said they brought cornet richard bronsby down the mountainside to the camp and loaded the corpse into a body bag and onto a land rover ferguson had a look why on earth would they do such a thing villiers said this kind of mutilation is a warning with all respect to dillon ive seen as bad in ireland dillon lit a cigarette hes right but hes wrong in one respect i was ira for more than twentyfive years i killed soldiers i killed loyalists but always as a soldier never like this he turned to villiers theyll taunt you as the sun comes up you know that villiers nodded and that will be five hundred metres away its a funny thing dillon i was never much good with a rifle thats why i used ali now hes cracked his arm and in the morning theyll stand up scream and shout and give us a hard time dillon smiled i hope they do colonel i hope they do he picked up alis lee enfield my grandfather used one of these in in the trenches of flanders he was awarded a medal for bravery in the field its a boltaction singleround threeohthree tony villiers lit a cigarette and passed the packet across i also remember that the preferred weapon of ira snipers in south armagh was the lee enfield well im from county down myself but i would agree with you dillon said in the morning dillon ferguson and the others drank coffee as light filtered through the orange globe of the sun slowly arose suffusing the dawn light suddenly six figures appeared on the hill five hundred metres away dillon looked through the zeiss glasses paul rashid sprang into view george and three bedu and kate with him guess who dillon said and passed the glasses to villiers villiers said christ one of the scouts was behind him holding alis lee enfield dillon snapped his fingers and said in arabic now on the hill paul rashid looked through his own glasses its dillon he said tony villiers and ferguson billy salter and his uncle one of the scouts passed dillon the lee enfield dillon secured its belt around his wrist and then for some perverse reason he fired to miss kicking up sand between paul rashids feet rashid dived for cover pulling kate with him then dillon shot the man on the end of the line then shot another one ferguson said theyre running scared sean well have a go back home in london leave it like hell i will ive just shot those two ill make it four watch he took number three then four and four was george rashid it was quiet and on the ridge kate fell on her knees in horror paul said leave him and grabbed her hand come with me now they made it to a land rover and departed villiers led the way up the hill the four arabs were all very dead eyes staring arms outstretched villiers said youre one hell of a marksman dillon harry salter said christ they should call you the executioner villiers and ferguson were looking at the four arabs and it was ferguson who said dear god this one is george rashid have we got a problem dillon asked well paul rashid wont be pleased neither will mrs bronsby so stuff paul rashid and his bloody money dillon stood up and walked away at the rashid villa at the port kate rashid stood in a shower letting the heat soak into her a futile attempt to make herself feel better she had lost a brother but more than that this girl who was half english aristocrat an oxford ma had been forced to confront bronsbys truly dreadful torture she dried herself pulled on a robe and went out paul rashid sat by the open french window working his way through papers he looked up how are you how should i be george is dead yes and it was dillon who killed him do you still like him kate we killed bronsby and in a terrible way true and the good book says an eye for an eye i dont mean the koran im referring to the bible so now we get home to what we dont go home not yet this is hazar i still rule the rashid not the council of elders the attempt was in the empty quarter disputed territory no one can touch us so what do you intend brother dinner at the excelsior if i were a gambling man id say thats exactly where our friends will go this evening i think that of all of them its dillon who will expect it you know i love old movies so often they depict life in a way life itself doesnt so what happens theres a confrontation guns are pulled not necessarily what happened to me at shabwa the assassins these people are always available they take quat they would kill their grandparents for the right price if we take out dillon and his friends to a certain degree it pays for george and afterwards we return to london to what oh ill think about it now get dressed wear a nice frock and well go to the excelsior and see if im right on the sultan they sat under the stern awning and had a drink ferguson said what happens now tony villiers said you cant touch him but then you know that we couldnt even touch him in manhattan blake said dillon nodded or london ferguson asked so what happens there was a sudden flurry of rain and ali who had accompanied villiers reached for a bottle of champagne his left arm in a sling and refreshed the glasses dillon said id ask harry hes a student of human nature the krays and al capone couldnt hold a candle to him harry drank some champagne ill take that as a compliment you little irish soandso as you said the bastard cant be touched here or apparently anywhere else but you with the colonel and billy behind you screwed up rashids plans and killed his brother now its just like brixton in the old days eyes everywhere we go into hazar to have dinner at this excelsior place and hell know in ten minutes professor hal stone said correction five minutes sure dillon said just like belfast on a bad saturday night ferguson said so what do we do it was billy who answered well actually im hungry myself i say lets go ashore to the excelsior and take them on if theyre not there we have a decent meal villiers laughed out loud you young bastard its marvellous to find you confirm everything ive heard only one thing harry salter said if we go we go tooled up he turned to hal stone you know what that means professor i used to work for the security services remember you mean a pistol under my arm im quite happy with that dillon laughed if only they knew about you at high table at corpus christi i put up with it hal stone said the wine list is excellent ferguson said so were going to eat and were all going armed you old bugger dillon said youll be disappointed if theyre not there they sat on the terrace at the excelsior the awning flapping a light rain drumming there were ferguson dillon billy and his uncle hal stone had decided to stay to watch things on the sultan there were lights on ships across the harbour lights up in hazar town looks like a tv programme about package holidays billy said it was at that moment that paul rashid walked in with his sister dillon stood up kate youre looking grand dillon she said paul rashid wore a tropical linen suit and a guards tie villiers stood up paul he offered his hand rashid took it colonel tony villiers kate you know the story the gulf war villiers turned on his considerable charm guardsmen are all the same lady kate you see the tie and always ask which regiment and you and the earl and general ferguson were all grenadiers dillon said and cornet bronsby billy put in lets not forget him the household cavalry blues and royals there was a pause it was rashid who said so i believe tony villiers said the trouble with the households is that all that people see are those glamorous uniforms they dont see them in places like kosovo in challenger tanks and armoured cars they also provide a lot of volunteers for g squadron in twentytwo sas ferguson put in well thats a bleeding show stopper harry said im harry salter can i get you a drink ive heard about you mr salter you used to know the kray brothers kate said they were gangsters love and so was i it was what we were only i got smart and turned legitimate almost billy said okay almost glass of champagne love no with all due respect there is a limit paul rashid told him he turned to dillon i saw you i knew it was you with george i mean and bronsby that means nothing george meant more the arab side rising to the surface you couldnt be more wrong dillon the dauncey side it was ferguson who said ill be formal my lord leave it its gone too far i would hope you have no expectations of course he has dillon said thats why aidan bell isnt here really ferguson turned to rashid could that be true wait and see ive spoken to the prime minister about you he was very angry and so was the president blake johnson said what a pity rashid smiled a smile that could chill the heart and i so much wanted to please the both of them well i will just have to think of some other way good night gentlemen paul rashid walked out his sister on his arm there was silence and it was harry salter who said i just hope youve got the message were going to get fucked when we leave here really ferguson opened a menu well the kebabs they mention sound delicious we might as well eat and enjoy ourselves and then walk down the dark streets of hazar shoulder to shoulder blake said yes something like that so make your choice ferguson told him the rashid gulfstream took off from haman and aidan bell sat back accepted a whiskey and started to read a supply of english papers which had come out from london on the trip in the premier and the prime minister were going to take a trip down the thames to the millennium dome the twopage article in the daily telegraph carried an itinerary a night trip down the river the major television companies would be involved and the two leaders everything you could want bell sat back a halfsmile on his face it was like time magazine and cazalet all over again not that nantucket had worked out as expected but this could be different hed always done well in london all right hed lost the team but this could be one of those jobs where you were better on your own he called to the steward for another drink and started to work through the article again ferguson was right the kebabs were excellent and they ate with enthusiasm billy said all right so we survive which i certainly intend we survive and get back to wapping in one piece what happens then general whats rashids next move dillon dillon sat back it has to have something to do with bell thats why he isnt here seen getting onto a rashid gulfstream at haman military airbase booked for london villiers said nice of you to tell us i decided to save it in case you didnt want dessert blake said come on sean what is his agenda dillon lit a cigarette he failed with the american president he failed with the elders maybe this time his target really is the obvious one the russian premiers due soon in london isnt he charles ferguson said come on even he wouldnt try that now with all the new security impossible you think so blake shook his head it should have been impossible to get as close as bell got to the president on nantucket with the greatest respect to my fine irish friend sean dillon here if i gave him the job hed find a way people like him always do thank you i love you too dillon said but hes right rashid would go for the premier without a second thought and thats where bell comes in harry salter asked well the other year we had the president in london two people loyalist terrorists a man and a woman tried to knock him off i managed to stop them with some assistance and i still bear the scars whats your point blake said that to use an english underworld phrase harry and billy know well you dont need to go in teamhanded one person is enough two at the most and thats true billy said yes but were talking as if rashid had this agenda ferguson told them maybe hes had enough general sean dillon said if you think that youll believe anything all right ferguson said coffee then lets go tea dillon said im irish it goes with the rain general from the gulfstream bell called rashid on his coded mobile and caught him at the villa listen ive had a thought tell me bell went through the article in the telegraph theres a real opportunity here all right but not the prime minister rashid said just the premier the minute youre in london go into the situation ill be over in a day or two anyway ill send instructions to give you any support you need and dillon and company well im hoping theyll be distant history after tonight bell laughed rashid said you find this amusing only the idea of sean dillon being distant history if hes on your case hes your worst nightmare having said that ill get on with it on board the sultan hal stone stood in the stern drinking a glass of cold beer and ali hovered it was raining again a fine spray and stone was enjoying it hed have to go soon of course back to cambridge and students instead of being here and what he was involved with there was a splash in the water as ali poured him another beer and as stone turned a man pulled himself over the rail a knife between his teeth ali cried out sahb hal stone saw and in the same moment reached for the browning under his left arm he pulled it out and as the man took his knife from between his teeth shot him so that he went back over the rail another appeared stone fired again but the browning jammed he grabbed ali by the shoulder the cabin come on then he pulled him away inside he slammed and locked the door then unloaded the browning and took out the clip as he discharged his bullets someone started to kick the door in dillon and the others walked down through hazar ready for anything and finding nothing they reached the harbour found the motor launch got in and cast off making for the sultan they coasted in the stern light was on under the awning and it was quiet as billy climbed up the ladder to tie up harry followed him then ferguson blake and dillon at that instant hal stone managed to reload the browning and fired through the cabin door the next moment four arabs ran out of the darkness to attack fergusons party dillon fired at one of them but the man in a drugcrazed frenzy rammed into him and drove him over the rail dillon took a deep breath went under the sultan and surfaced on the other side there were a couple of shots he pulled himself up the ladder moved in behind a crouching arab with a knife in one hand took his neck and twisted there was a crack and the man slumped silence someone said in arabic hamid are you there of course dillon answered and stepped forward he took the man broke his right arm so that the arab dropped the pistol and put him over the rail it was quiet dillon said its me are you all there ferguson called on the deck but in one piece dillon said lets check if the professor is all right then id suggest we get out of this sodding place an excellent idea ferguson called later rashid came into the living room at the villa and said to kate no go the attack on the boat failed ferguson dillon and the others have just left for london so what do we do now kate rashid asked go home my darling and try again her brother said london the thames in london bell spent time travelling up and down the thames following the itinerary for the russian premier as laid out by the daily telegraph he went on a trip to the millennium dome then returned to the savoy pier he thought about it and did the same trip the following day there was another article discussing the visit this time in the daily mail he read it meticulously noted that the riverboat for the trip was called prince regent and that the catering was in the hands of the orsini brothers he sat by the fireplace in the drawing room on south audley street and a plan began to form in his mind rashid and kate left in the second plane after he had made various deals with his people in the empty quarter what he was leaving was a situation so difficult that neither the council of elders nor the americans nor the russians would be able to handle it themselves he also arranged for the retrieval of georges body and its return to england in london dillon went to check on hannah she was sitting up in bed and by chance bellamy was there checking her over dillon excused himself and waited outside finally the professor came out how is she dillon asked better its still a waitandsee situation as to how much back to normal shell be on the other hand i remember when norah bell stabbed you in the back you made it through i know on a good day youre a genius bellamy sighed how many times have i saved your hide sean i cant always succeed try and take care he went out and dillon thought about it then knocked on hannah bernsteins door how are you pretty rotten but ive only got to look at you to see its been pretty rotten for you too tell me about it he opened the window lit a cigarette and sat beside her as he talked when he was finished she said young billys turning out to be a star you could say that bellamy says youll make it so does my father though i may not be able to run around hyde park again in the morning well you cant have everything as to rashid you might want to take a look at the papers i read a lot of them every day out of boredom look at the pile over there you should find a daily telegraph id say it might interest you he read it and sat there thinking it could fit she said id say so do you remember the norah bell affair how could i forget i shot her dead she and her boyfriend found it no problem to join the crew of that riverboat waiters hannah said its easy enough to carry the canapes around dillon stood up suddenly id better go god bless hannah take care dillon he got a cab to cavendish place and found ferguson and blake sitting on either side of the fire talking he explained what he had found are you suggesting the same script as with norah bell ferguson asked hannah thinks so and so do i what do we do inform the security services ferguson snorted that bunch theyd only screw it up royally you know that dillon all right so what do we do tell you what blake said i love rivers take me on the same trip tomorrow sean and lets see what we can see the next morning was typical london the rain drifting down as dillon and blake boarded the prince regent at the savoy pier a grey morning out of season there were no more than fifteen people on the boat its a great city blake said as they stood under the awning at the stern even in the rain dublins not bad and manhattan has a feel to it but yes the thames is special tell me about this business with norah bell sean an iranian fundamentalist group called the army of god didnt like arafats deal with israel over the new status of palestine they also didnt care for the president presiding over the meeting at the white house and giving the agreement his blessing so they approached a loyalist hit man from ulster and his girlfriend names of michael ahern and norah bell characters so bad that even the red hand of ulster had thrown them out and what was the deal five million sterling to kill the president my god even i never heard of that blake said oh it was kept under wraps the prime minister cooked up an evening of frivolity and cocktails for the president cruising the thames past the houses of parliament and ending up at westminster pier ahern and norah got on board by pretending to be waiters a confederate had left a couple of walthers for them and well i managed to work it out and at the last moment joined the boat with charles and hannah i killed ahern but norah gutted me with a spring knife hannah shot her dead dillon lit a cigarette it was a bad scene for a while it looked as if i was finished but with the help of friends i made it a hell of a story the door opened behind them and a waitress came through coffee gentlemen or the bar is open coffee for me blake said dillon smiled ill have tea and an irish whiskey or scotch if you insist they stayed under the awning and the young woman finally came back with a tray dillon said to her so you must be pretty excited about this big event coming up oh yes she said in fact youre lucky todays our last day before the company pulls the prince regent out of service to titivate it up for the big night will you be working dillon asked im afraid not she was obviously disgruntled believe it or not theyre bringing in a royal navy crew to run the boat and some firm to do the catering we cant even get near the place thats a hell of a shame blake said yeah but thats life excuse me gentlemen blake drank his coffee and dillon poured his whiskey into his tea as the rain increased in force the american said what do you think dillon sighed theres just something i cant put my finger on it its just look i did my time on jobs like this right and i never liked my left hand to know what my right hand was doing you tried to get people to look one way so theyd miss whats happening the other way this its all just flat in our face i agree but you cant afford to take the risk dillon youve got to get the security people out here in full force all your efforts have got to be focused on this boat dillon turned smiling his personality almost changing jesus son youre right all our efforts its so obvious its too obvious what was i thinking he pulled out his phone and got through to ferguson blake and i are on the prince regent so you think thats where theyll hit nope not in a thousand years have you got the itinerary there yes wheres the premier staying at the dorchester that suite on the top floor dillon said perfect ill get back to you he turned to blake hes staying on the top floor of the dorchester i know that suite its got the best rooftop views in london from its terrace you stand out there and you can see everyone and everyone can see you you think thats it i could be totally wrong but if i wanted my left hand not to know what my right was doing thats where id do it in the drawing room at south audley street paul kate and michael sat at a table with bell it was the moment aidan bell disclosed the truth fergusons going to be on tenterhooks hes expecting a hit and by now hes convinced himself itll be on the boat trip but it wont what then whats your plan kate asked the premiers staying on the top floor of the dorchester there are some lovely flat roofs below with perfect lines of fire ill climb up there and do it myself there was silence michael said ill go with you hey thats not necessary bell this time i want to make sure i was trained as a marksman myself im going with you paul rashid said and so am i kate said for gods sake paul what are you thinking of three people its much too dangerous i dont care this is our last chance kate if we fail this time then it doesnt matter if we get caught anyway he turned and smiled and for the first time she thought it the smile of the truly mad this is for george kate and for our mother theres no turning back dillon blake and ferguson visited the dorchester and were shown up to the suite the views from the terrace were as advertised they were extraordinary and extraordinarily dangerous dillons right ferguson said the premier cant stay here how will you handle it blake asked no need to make a big fuss ill just tell the prime ministers office that im not happy with the overall security which means you wont need to explain the plot blake said exactly low key thats how well keep it ill see the prime minister again at downing street dillon sat in the daimler while ferguson and blake were taken to the prime ministers study he was sitting with a small man in his early fifties with white hair and the look of the academic hed once been he was simon carter the deputy director of the security services and no friend of ferguson so what happened in hazar the prime minister asked well for one thing the council of elders is still intact thanks to dillon not that little irish swine again carter said carter were not friends but ive never disputed your efficiency in the past let me tell you what dillon achieved if youll allow me prime minister of course afterwards the prime minister said extraordinary and even carter had to agree now tell him about nantucket the prime minister said this time when ferguson had finished carter said its incredible the whole damn business he looked more shaken than ferguson had ever seen him well its clear well have to cancel everything with the premier wipe it all out hold on ferguson said we have a better idea what is that the prime minister said russian security must be told we might have a problem i would handle it this way if the deputy director approves allow the arrangements at the dorchester to go through that would be for the media and then cancel the cocktail party on the prince regent but only at the last moment any excuse will do change the dinner venue to somewhere like the reform club im sure theyd love to have you sir the prime minister smiled im certain of it carter said and then the premier is taken back not to the dorchester but to his embassy but what would the final point be the prime minister said that i would wait in the suite at the dorchester with people of my choosing dillon yes sir and some friends of his they did great service in hazar however you wouldnt put them on the new years honours list and theyd wait to see if rashid or this man bell turned up yes sir but its even better than that i think the deputy director already sees what im getting at carter smiled yes and he turned to the prime minister theres been no indictable proof against rashid up to now but if he comes or one of his men and we get him alive he wont be untouchable any more he must be getting desperate by now at last we can lay a trap for him instead of the other way around then so be it the prime minister stood its in your hands gentlemen mr johnson ill speak to the president outside it was cold dillon stood beside the daimler smoking a cigarette as ferguson blake and carter approached ferguson said to carter can i give you a lift no i feel like a walk and sitting in the car with someone who once mortarbombed downing street is more than i can take dillon said jesus sir the grand man you are and absolutely right in spite of himself carter laughed damn you dillon he moved away toward the downing street gates paused and turned back and he wasnt smiling i dont care who he is i dont care about his medals or his money stop him dillon he walked away ferguson phoned rashid at the company offices and found he was not available a secretary asked him to wait and after a moment kate rashid came to the phone general ferguson what can i do for you ill be in the piano bar at the dorchester at eight oclock am i supposed to be interested id earnestly advise it lady kate bring the earl he put down the phone she reported to paul who was down at the dauncey arms with bell and michael and told him of her conversation with ferguson ill handle it if you want me to she said no paul said well come up this afternoon im not going to leave you on your own with dillon and ferguson never underestimate the general ill see you later he switched off his phone michael said trouble ferguson wants a meeting well go back all of us oh yes he turned to bell youll have to keep your head down he smiled at betty moody were heading out love as they sat in the rollsroyce the glass divider closed the earl said to bell i think youd better not stay at the south audley house where would you suggest michael has a motor cruiser parked at a place called hangmans wharf at wapping you can stay there overnight that sounds good to me this meeting brother michael asked what does ferguson want whatever dillon wants well see paul rashid closed his eyes and leaned back but in london dillon had been doing some thinking himself he had hooked up to fergusons computer and trawled the list of the rashid companys assets then he called harry salter at the dark man harry michael rashid has this boat parked at hangmans wharf in wapping you know everything thats going on along the river whats the story let me check my computer after a while salter came back laughing its called hazar well that fits is billy there yes put us on conference after explaining the situation dillon said so he must have bell tucked up somewhere what do you think south audley street or hangmans wharf could be either billy said ill check out south audley for an hour or two this evening if theres no result ill try the hazar that evening kate rashid arrived first to find dillon waiting for her what no piano this evening dillon im disappointed i came all this way just to hear you play youd never know that your true vocation is for killing people but not torture kate not killing a young decent man in the most horrific way bronsby deserved better well fuck you too she said jesus girl did they tell you that at oxford in spite of herself she showed a glimmer of a smile oh posh girls can be worse than the tarts how exciting he lit a cigarette and she reached and took it from his mouth and smoked it for a moment you killed my brother whod arranged for bronsby to be skinned and you and the earl were there do you mean to tell me you approve of one and hate the other she took a deep breath not really i just hate you for georges death no kate no you dont thats the problem billy and his uncle sat in a shogun in south audley street billy at the wheel harry reading the evening standard he happened to glance up and saw a mini emerge from a side entrance to the house its bell and michael rashid billy get moving paul rashid appeared in the piano bar just as ferguson and johnson walked in he looked well tanned from the hazar sun in a cream linen suit and the usual guards tie general ferguson he didnt shake hands dillon mr johnson they all sat down ferguson said its over what is rashid asked you know very well i thought id give you one last chance stop it now youve got away with a great deal but not again i can promise you paul spoke softly and deliberately im a great believer in family i had a brother a greatly loved brother killed in hazar if youll excuse me my lord dillon said the fact that you can make such a fuss about that after what you did to bronsby indicates that youre seriously disturbed kate tossed her glass of champagne in his face dillon ran his tongue over his lips and reached for a napkin what a waste just then his mobile rang excuse me he got up and walked away dillon billy said harry and i have followed michael rashid and aidan bell to hangmans wharf theyve boarded the hazar do you want to tell fergiison no this is our business i didnt want ferguson to know in case he says dont do it ill be with you in half an hour he returned to the table sorry ive got to go im sure youll handle things here general tell them we know about their plans for the boat trip and theyll never get away with it theyve come to the end of the line do you need me blake asked not this time old son he looked at paul rashid id listen to the general i really would then he turned and went out smiling it was raining driving in across the thames at hangmans wharf as billy and harry parked billy went round and opened the tailgate of the shogun and produced an umbrella well thats nice harry said i tell you what it doesnt make you look like bogart in the big sleep yes well i do have a shooter in my pocket billy said so i suppose thats all that matters on board the hazar bell and michael rashid had a drink rashid said right you have a quiet night ill be in touch tomorrow and tomorrow night unless things change will be the big one well well see aidan bell told him outside a voice called hey are you there rashid and that irish fuck with you bell and rashid drew brownings and approached the companionway dillon had arrived fifteen minutes earlier parked behind billy and harry and joined them he called ferguson on his mobile where are you ferguson asked so dillon told him for gods sake what are you playing at we still cant confirm the hit the river or the dorchester so im taking the initiative im with billy and harry bell left the rashid house with michael they followed to michaels boat at wapping and ive joined them dillon just listen to me no im going to listen to me general ill let you know how it goes he switched off he wasnt pleased harry asked not really he might be if we get a result how do we play it billy asked dillon took off his jacket and loosened his tie as he told them he took but his walther and slipped it into the waistband of his trousers at the rear so you do the facetoface billy and you cover him harry christ dillon its going to be cold in there never mind that just watch yourself billy bells tricky dont worry about me think of yourself dillon youre the one at the short end fine just let me go in then do your bit harry salter crouched behind a bollard on the wharf dillon went down a ladder from the edge of the wharf and sank into the water it was bitterly cold he swam round to the other side of the hazar and discovered as hed expected a boarding ladder it was then that billy salter approached the hazar and called out hey are you there rashid and that irish fuck with you bell said to michael rashid you go to the stern ill take the bow and dont screw around rashid said i can hold my own get on with it then bell left him to go up the steps to the deck and rashid went back through the cabins and pulled himself up the transom into the shadows of the stern several things happened at the same time harry behind the bollard moved and aidan bell fired and hit salter in the right shoulder the force threw him back and bell pulled himself over the edge of the wharf and scrambled away in the shadows michael rashid fired several times and billy returned fire rashid moved back against the rail and dillon reached up and pulled on his ankles and rashid toppled over dillon got an arm around the neck took a deep breath and reached for the anchor line to pull himself under rashid struggled kicking and dillon hung on until the struggling stopped from the shadows bell watched then faded away dillon released the body and pulled himself up the ladder to the wharf harry was on his feet groaning billy supporting him sorry dillon weve lost bell michael rashid is dead dillon turned to harry salter get in the shogun you drive billy take us to rosedene ill call ferguson hell pull in professor henry bellamy dillon im getting too old for this harry said nonsense well get dora in to nurse you as they drove away he called ferguson youre going to need the disposal team yes michael rashid youll find him in the water off hangmans wharf by his boat the hazar you did it yourself i suppose bell got away after shooting harry in the shoulder were on our way to rosedene get bellamy if hes not available hannahs dad only the best consider it done but dillon it would be nice if you talked to me sometimes at rosedene dillon waited with billy bellamy was busy doing a bypass operation at guys but arnold bernstein had been available dillon said lets look in on hannah suits me billy said she was sitting up reading the evening standard and looking far better than when dillon had last seen her so the two musketeers bring me up to date which dillon did afterwards she sat there brooding dillon said what do you think she was silent for a moment before she answered did anyone ever tell you the details of how paul rashid got his military cross in the gulf war no what about it well ive read the file villiers took twenty men behind the iraqi lines in two russian sand cruisers rashid was in charge of group two ten men but he made a mistake he radioed villiers on a clear line when it looked like there was an emergency and the iraqis picked it up homed in and took out every man in his command billy said except rashid exactly however when villiers got to where rashid was there was no one there just seven iraqi soldiers all dead and all emasculated and rashid dillon asked reached the allied lines ten days later walking on his own dillon said tony villiers never mentioned this why not hannah smiled and shook her head thats a comfort even the great sean dillon can be naive look rashid is an earl and the product of sandhurst the grenadier guards and the sas now whatever else those outfits taught you it wasnt how to cut off your opponents cock so that we keep quiet about this is all interesting stuff superintendent billy said but whats your conclusion he is mad and he believes very much in revenge in the harshest possible terms dillon has killed his two brothers so dillon must die she turned its the only certainty sean he would be incapable of living with himself with you alive and kate dillon asked empathetic inclusion to aristocratic people family is everything and in this case theres a double dose with the dauncey on one hand and rashid on the other kate is aware of her heritage and looks up to him as head of the family it couldnt be otherwise billy said so even she might want to kill dillon off i would say so suddenly she looked tired i need to rest the door opened and her father looked in still wearing his operating gown they told me you were here billy said how is he well my recommendation is that at your uncles age he should try not to get shot having said that hes not going to die on us he moved to his daughter how are you tired then go to sleep he turned to the other two out they moved dillon got the door open and she called sean take care for gods sake rashid is obsessed he must kill you in fact hell challenge you its like being back in the desert sean he wants you for himself she was crying arnold bernstein pushed dillon and billy through the door and said ill be back my love dillon said shes taking it very hard why she never approved of me youre such a smart man you must be to have got away with killing people for the last thirty years on the other hand if you cant see why shes crying my little irish friend then you really must be stupid he walked away and billy said i think he means she likes you dillon dillon lit a cigarette yes i did get that impression lets have a cup of tea well hang around and maybe theyll let you see harry before we leave they went into the reception lounge gave one of the girls an order and sat down aidan bell made it up from the river to the high street and caught a cab to mayfair he walked the last few hundred yards to the back of the south audley street house where he rang the bell at the kitchen door it was kate who answered her face dropped whats wrong everything is he here yes then lead the way she suddenly looked fearful wheres michael get on with it she took him to the great drawing room where paul rashid sat by the fire he looked up what are you doing back here wheres michael theres no easy way of telling you this dillon turned up at hangmans wharf with the salters i managed to shoot harry salter but dillon got your brother over the rail the last i saw he had an arm round his neck and was taking him under the water kate let out an agonized cry turned and stumbled away rashid his face very calm said tell me exactly what happened dillon and billy were drinking tea in the reception lounge when ferguson appeared hows harry he asked hell survive billy said pay him off with an obe ferguson turned to dillon what in the hell were you playing at i suddenly realized we didnt have any certainty weve been talking about the prince regent and about the dorchester and everything sounded right but we didnt know so billy and harry followed michael rashid and bell to hangmans wharf where rashid had this motor cruiser it got a bit frantic then bell shot harry and got away i pulled young rashid over the rail and drowned him what a bastard you are dillon yes well its the line of work you put me in has the disposal team found him no the police have i decided to handle it that way an anonymous phone call someone walking the dog on the wharf who saw the body in the water and paul rashid must have heard by now and bell god knows id have thought bell was a closed chapter youve effectively blocked any of rashids aspirations as regards the premier if bell has any sense hell be well on his way out of it thats interesting billy said we had a very illuminating chat with superintendent bernstein i didnt know she had a psychology degree the way she analysed it paul rashid is a raving loony hell have to kill dillon because of the family pride and his sister would probably do it for him bell dillon said hes mad too and when it comes down to it maybe so am i i wouldnt bank on bell doing a runner he loves the game and if rashid decides he still needs him there could be a lot of money in it for him at kensington mortuary paul and kate rashid waited in a grim room painted green and white there was an electric fire a window over a parking lot after a while a male nurse came in he looked uncertain mr rashid it was kate who said no my brother is earl of loch dhu and the deceased michael rashid also my brother would you like to see him yes paul rashid said tonelessly theres just been an autopsy the pathologist is still there you mightnt find it very pleasant im thinking of the young lady thats kind of you but it must be done the thing is there are some gentlemen in there a general ferguson and two others lady kate made an exclamation but her brother put a hand on her arm thats fine we all know each other they were led into an operating theatre white paint lots of stainless steel the forensic pathologist stood with ferguson dillon and blake the nurse went and whispered to him the pathologist turned lord loch dhu im very sorry rashid said ferguson if youd be kind enough to wait outside id appreciate a word of course ferguson replied very formal very english upper class he walked out with dillon and blake kate walked to the operating table where michael rashid lay naked crude stitching on the body and a line around his skull was this necessary your brother drowned after falling over the rail of his boat but the coroner demands a full autopsy theres no way around that ive established the cause of death as drowning and under section three of the act i can issue a certificate releasing the body to you theres no need for a court hearing thats extremely kind paul rashid said ill make the necessary arrangements when he and kate went out ferguson was in the reception area talking to a middleaged man in a raincoat and oldfashioned trilby hat the general nodded to the rashids ill see you outside the man in the trilby said im chief inspector temple theres no evidence of foul play just a tragic accident of course i presume the pathologist has told you that in these circumstances under section three he can release the body without a coroners court hearing yes i have to countersign it as investigating officer so ill do that now after that youll be able to have the body at any time there was a look in his eye and after all why should a chief inspector be the investigating officer in a drowning paul rashid smiled and took his hand youve been very kind outside ferguson waited on the pavement beside the daimler his chauffeur at the wheel dillon stood close by with blake smoking ferguson said i dont know about you chaps but im famished theres that nice italian restaurant next to the dorchester you know the one he turned ah there you are my brother georges body was delivered earlier from hazar theyre releasing michael well bury them at dauncey in the family mausoleum the day after tomorrow after that its open season your brother drowned ferguson told him its as simple as that kate walked up to dillon and struck him in the face and you drowned him jesus kate he was trying to kill me why is it the rashids seem to think its okay for them to shoot other people but not to get stiffed in return she turned away and got behind the wheel of the mercedes paul rashid said vengeance is mine dillon you should understand that its the old testament well ill tell you what my lord ill make you a fair offer being just as mad as you ill come to the funerals that way you can try to finish me off if you can or i might just try the same with you what do you say to that rashids eyes gleamed for a moment and he almost seemed to smile then with a brief nod he said ill be expecting you and drove off jesus ferguson said that was really pushing it dillon turned to him its time this whole thing ended general he stared after the departing car one way or another as kate drove her brother called the number of a service flat around the corner from the south audley street house normally it was for the use of extra staff at the moment it housed bell when he answered rashid said its me now listen he told bell exactly what had happened when he was finished bell said what a bastard sean is but then thats how hes lived so long you talk as if you admire him hes a decent enough stick weve a lot in common well id like to take care of this myself but if you can do it so be it the three of them are on their way to some italian restaurant next to the dorchester fergusons car is a daimler you cant miss it what do you want me to do take them out come round to south audley street ill supply a weapon ill pay you of course youre on see you soon rashid switched off his phone kate said you mean it kate i told them when the funeral would be and i got the reaction i wanted from dillon so the last thing they expect is a hit now he shrugged this is right up bells alley ill give him one more chance if he fails this time then ill kill dillon myself after i kill bell he was so calm so certain there was no way she could argue and she continued to drive bell arrived at the back door at south audley street and was let in by rashid who took him upstairs and unlocked a door into what proved to be a gun room most things were on offer but bell chose an armalite an old friend this one a folding stock and you have a silencer its not completely silent what would you want to do shoot a tyre out get all of them at the same time that sounds good lets see if you can do it whatever happens return to the flat ill expect to find you there good now find me some sort of road map bell found an old raincoat with capacious pockets so that the armalite with its folding stock was easily concealed he walked down south audley street until he found the restaurant and there was the parked daimler the chauffeur sitting with the light on reading a newspaper he had worked out from the map that on leaving the restaurant they would have to turn left down park lane then make a uturn into curzon gate to make for cavendish place along the other side of park lane so bell crossed the road to the shadows of hyde park scrambled over the fence and stood in the darkness of a tree he had a pair of night glasses which he clipped to his head and he watched the front of the restaurant when ferguson blake and dillon emerged they walked to the daimler and got in bell took out the armalite unfolded it and waited there was little traffic at that time of night and the daimler turned out of curzon gate and picked up speed bell aimed at the rear wheel on the passenger side and fired at that moment dillon happened to turn his head and saw the flash the tyre burst and the daimler slewed across the road then back again bumping over the kerb ferguson was thrown against the passenger door blake on his knees this is a hit dillon said i saw the flash im going he jumped out vaulted the fence and drew his walther aidan bell turned and ran holding the armalite across his chest dillon went after him chasing him through the shadows they came to a huge monument suffused with light all around and bell tripped and fell and the armalite went flying dillon came to a halt and stood there chest heaving holding the walther to his side why aidan its you old son how much did the earl offer to hell with you dillon he grabbed for the armalite and dillon shot him twice in the heart he went back to the road and the car ferguson was holding his arm i think its broken what happened sean blake asked it was bell i shot him hes by the monument i dont know how you want to handle it general do you want to leave a famous ira terrorist to be found shot dead in hyde park or call in the disposal team in the circumstances lets make it lowkey you call in explain where you are and wait frankly i need to get myself to rosedene he got out of the daimler with blake and said to his chauffeur call in recovery for the car mr johnson will see to me later sitting in the shadows of the monument dillon rang paul rashid on his mobile its me dillon aidan bell tried to take us out but im afraid hes failed for the very last time youve killed him yes well if you hadnt done it i would have that doesnt surprise me im looking forward to the funeral rashid if you think you can take me youre welcome to do it this things gone on long enough i look forward to it as well dillon kate sitting opposite him said what is it bells dead dillon who else so hell come to the funeral hell come to his death as far as im concerned dillon sat on the steps of the monument smoking a cigarette and after a while the disposal team arrived dauncey place blake went home the following morning bell vanished off the face of the earth dillon visited rosedene and found ferguson with his left arm in a sling by hannahs bed how are you dillon asked ive been better dillon turned to hannah and you ill survive general ferguson has filled me in so you killed bell you sound disapproving for gods sake woman he tried to kill us he smiled ah i see it now youre not in favour of capital punishment damn you dillon the general says you told rashid youd attend the funerals of his brothers tomorrow so you told me hed challenge me i figured id just challenge him first you stupid man i told you hes crazy hell do anything to finish you off now and as ive told you many times hannah i just may be crazy too i really dont think you should do it dillon ferguson said in fact thats an order dillon said and if i say no what will you do lock me up in wandsworth prison i could your past record condemns you really when you got me out of a serbian prison blackmailed me to come and be your enforcer the important part of the deal was that my ira slate would be wiped clean now in effect you tell me no if youre serious all i can say is that billy salter may be a gangster but hes got a grip on morality thats far better than yours he reached over and kissed hannah on the cheek god bless girl and take care as for rashid wanting me dead well the british army wanted that for long enough and im still here he nodded to ferguson you know where to get me if thats what you want to do otherwise ill go down to dauncey tomorrow to that funeral ill give rashid his chance he turned and went out hannah said are you going to have him banged up sir of course not ferguson sighed i just wanted to see if i could bluff him out of it these past eight or nine years ive grown rather fond of him you too i think you could say that sir but id appreciate it if youd promise not to tell him of course my dear now as im feeling perfectly wretched i think ill go home paul and kate rashid went into the dauncey arms at lunchtime betty moody was behind the bar and all the usual locals were there everyone stood up rashid said no my friends sit down get a drink for everyone betty but im hungry as a hunter whatever youve got there were tears in her eyes she reached and touched his face oh paul and then kate was crying too and betty took her hand and lifted the bar flap you stop snivelling girl ive told you that since you first learned to listen come and do some useful work in the kitchen later they ate she opened a bottle of champagne for them and they sat by the fire tomorrow she said hesitantly the funerals you havent said much service at the church is eleven thirty were scaling it down this time betty no general invitation like the last time the villagers are welcome though you could do us a buffet here at the pub we dont want a fuss i dont even want staff at the house after the funeral whatever you want paul leave it with me she moved away kate said will he come oh yes hell come her brother said ive never been more certain of anything in my life dillon called in on harry at the rosedene and found him propped up in bed dora hovering the epitome of the barmaid turned nurse watch it dillon told her if you keep doing such a good job the old bugger might decide to marry you her eyes gleamed harry said dont give her ideas above her station he slapped doras bottom go and find me a bottle of scotch theres a good girl she went out dillon said you think youve got her but shes got you by your bits and pieces harry mind you youre a lucky sod shes actually a damn nice woman and shed kill for you you dont need to tell me then treat her right salter looked at him why do i get the impression youre not exactly on top of the world ah well we all have our ups and downs ive seen hannah you know how it is she loves me and hates me and worries about me youre going to do something stupid harry said christ dillon you really are going down to dauncey to that double funeral tomorrow its a challenge harry he wants to face me i killed his two brothers hes entitled you know what my old son that sounds like a death wish to me are you thinking of pulling billy in there isnt anybody else no im going to drop in at the dark man and have a bite to eat but billys done enough you know harry he calls himself my younger brother and in a way thats what hes become im not putting him in harms way again i wont ask him to go to dauncey tomorrow for all i know the earl could set the dogs on us so youre going to go down there wearing a black suit and stand in the congregation at the dauncey parish church it has to be done harry well thats nice isnt it just when i was willing to accept you as billys older brother youre going to put your head on the chopping block dillon got up harry youre a diamond and so is billy but there comes a time yes i know when a mans got to do what a mans got to do john wayne rest in peace dora came in with a bottle of scotch harry said go on clear off dillon youre making me angry dillon went harry sat there absentmindedly fondling doras rear then reached for the bedside phone and rang his nephews mobile billy was at the cable wharf office listen dillons just left me he said he was going to call in and have a bite of lunch with you as you know rashids burying his brothers at dauncey church tomorrow and dillons determined to go and face up to him like some kind of gunfight at the ok corral whats more hes going to go on his own billy said no way if he goes i go with him i know you might not approve actually billy im proud of you only dont tell him just say hes stupid well let him go then catch up later you say we billy even with dora i cant be here for ever at least i can give you moral support well follow dillon down at the dark man trade was busy with plenty of cars parked on cable wharf it was raining on the river again that season of the year dillon found an old umbrella in the mini coopers boot put it up lit a cigarette and walked for a while he was strangely melancholy a feeling that he was somehow at the end of things he didnt hate paul rashid and kate as most men would have to admit he admired tremendously he had killed many times over the years it was his nature hed excused himself by claiming the death of his father caught in the middle of a firefight in a belfast street between ira members and british paratroopers but what if it really was his nature his fathers death only an excuse what did that say about him he could argue that in his way hed been a soldier for years but could he condemn rashid and not condemn himself the only difference between them the thing that really was unacceptable was cornet bronsbys appalling death he lit another cigarette slightly morose and depressed oh to hell with it whats getting into me at that moment he was hailed from the door of the pub and turned to find billy running toward him he ducked under the umbrella what are you trying to do drown yourself something like that oh i see a bad hair day lets all feel sorry for sean dillon go to hell dillon told him yes well you need some dark man food in you and a drink i mean youre an older guy you cant go through what we have in the last few weeks and come out of it as fresh as i do dillon laughed out loud you cheeky young sod thats better he led the way inside where the bar was busy but baxter and hall had the end booth billy and dillon found them and billy said scarper you two weve got things to discuss tell the bird at the bar to bring us a bottle of bollinger two glasses and some irish stew the irishman said what is this be nice to dillon week come off it you killed rashids two brothers and now he wants your balls and expects you to go to dauncey tomorrow and face up to him superintendent bernstein said and for some reason you want to give him his chance hes the one whos crazy and maybe me too billy like i said bollocks ive never known when you didnt know exactly what youre doing you speak several languages you can fly any kind of plane youre a master diver harry told me all about it you were the one who challenged rashid and now youve got this daft idea youre going to do it on your own well i wont let you i told harry that he must have loved that actually he approved he told me to let you go then he and i would follow you down moral support was a phrase he used one of the young girls behind the bar brought a bucket of ice bollinger and glasses dillon nodded to baxter and hall at the bar drinking beer a glass each for those two youre so considerate billy said ill show you how considerate i can be im actually going to give you your wish billy you can walk down the street with me just like in a bad movie ill supply walthers and titanium waistcoats because he means it billy like hannah bernstein said he couldnt live with me alive hed love getting you too i know billy said but im going to cover your back theres only one thing billy ferguson knows im going and wont stop me but harry as much as he may joke about it really is getting older i dont want him worrying about you so what do we do you phone him late tonight at the rosedene and tell him fergusons had me put in the nick to stop me doing anything stupid you and i can clear off for dauncey in the morning you provide the limousine the service is at eleven thirty will you do it that way hell never forgive me but yes i will dillon toasted him cheers as you say in the east end and billy try and make it a black suit i will the undertaker look exactly terrific the girl brought irish stew i cant wait billy said and called joe baxter and sam hall to him joe i need the jaguar first thing in the morning dillon and i are taking a run down into the country the rashid place dauncey so wear a chauffeurs uniform were going to a funeral whatever you say billy billy looked up at hall youll have to take over for me at the warehouse handle those blackmarket cigarettes from calais now another thing i dont want harry to know because if he does hell want to come so keep shtoom hes already taken one bullet and we dont want him to take another dillon told them baxter nodded so im the kind of chauffeur with a shooter in the glove compartment absolutely this rashid is bad news you know the story boys mind you joe if youd rather not billy said baxter was outraged dont insult me billy weve been together since we were seventeen billy kept eating his irish stew if harry checks on me you say ive been called to southampton about that booze consignment hall said hell go crackers when he finds out the truth billy yes well hes gone crackers before dora will calm him down show him hes still a man now dont let me down go on get something to eat dillon said so were into hard times again absolutely billy grinned youve changed my life dillon persuaded me i have a brain what was i before four nobigdeal prison sentences a kind of gangster of the third rank how many people have i killed now in circumstances youve pulled me into as we said before a life not put to the test is not worth living ill con harry about you later as he would say you young bastard ive got a great idea i hear that fringe theatre the old red lion is doing this brendan behan play about the ira called the hostage a masterpiece great lets go and see it itll fill in the evening and maybe ill learn something about you youre on dillon said as a performance it was a huge success and afterwards in the bar they discussed and argued about the points behan had made joe baxter who had driven them to the old red lion and been forced to watch the play sat there bemused they dropped dillon off at stable mews and billy phoned harry at rosedene i hope i havent called too late i cant sleep billy ive been in bed too long now what happened with dillon i expected you to get back to me well i saw him for lunch at the pub and he was full of going down there like you said but there was a development this evening what kind of development well ferguson warned him off going down to the funeral and when dillon wouldnt promise to do as he was told he had him lifted by special branch something about dillons record with the ira but ferguson had that wiped clean when dillon agreed to work for him yes well hes had him banged up billy warmed to his story theyve got him at west end central at least theyve got decent cells there harry salter was outraged bloody disgraceful ferguson gave his word to dillon when he got him out of that serb prison yes well hes upper class the general billy said its the class system harry the countrys still riddled with it and were supposed to be the bad guys harry was fuming wait till i see ferguson again and i thought he was a true brit harry this is bad for your blood pressure have a decent nights sleep ill call in tomorrow the following morning at stable mews dillon dressed carefully as hed told billy a black suit white shirt black tie jesus son he said looking at himself in the mirror you look like youre auditioning for a part as a mafia hit man in godfather four he frowned and said softly is that what its all about the theatre of the street was that it belfast from the very beginning all those years the doorbell rang he went down to the hall found an armani duster coat in black and the weaponry bag when he opened the door billy was there black suit and tie curiously elegant baxter stood against the jaguar in uniform hey youre looking great billy said dillon opened the weaponry bag and took out a titanium waistcoat as you know this thing will stop a fortyfive at pointblank range ive already got mine on under my shirt come in the cloakroom and put this one on billy well wait if you say so billy went into the cottage and dillon nodded to baxter open the boot joe baxter obliged dillon put the weaponry bag and his coat in and opened the bag from the assortment of weapons he produced a browning and a silencer with luck you might not need it joe but on the other hand baxter smiled coldly who knows he opened the drivers door reached for the glove compartment and slipped the weapon inside a moment later billy came out another coat on his arm i figured this was for me dillon it could rain dillon said great mind you on the other hand you could put an uzi in one of these pockets i like walking in the rain it puts you in your own private world lets go they got in the rear and baxter drove away harry sat up in bed dora beside him eating a boiled egg and toast fingers hed had a sleepless night so it was already midmorning he said get me the office i want to speak to billy she tried then turned phone in hand billy isnt there its sam hall harry reached for the phone where is he sam there was a problem with the booze consignment and hes been called to southampton well he might have told me ill call him on his mobile hall panicky said i just found it on his desk harry stupid young bugger okay if he rings in tell him to contact me still a major in the army reserve paul rashid was entitled to wear uniform on appropriate occasions and as he pulled on his tunic and adjusted the grenadier guards buttons in front of his dressing table mirror his medals made a brave show he picked up his dress cap and went out the centre of dauncey place upstairs was a great circular minstrel gallery all the main rooms led off a stairway went down to the great hall and above the curving staircase of the bell tower lifted above the old house paul adjusted his cap and went down the stairs and found kate standing by the fireplace logs burning betty moody stood nearby in a black suit betty came forward reached up and kissed his cheek oh paul how wonderful you look well its the least i could do for the boys one para wanted to send an honour guard and a bugler for george but as i told you kate and i want it muted this time i only came to check the final arrangements the buffet at the pub is set up and the champagne you do want champagne were celebrating their lives rashid told her but later you said you didnt want anyone up at the house not even servants kate and i will leave the buffet early after saying hello to everyone we want to be quiet we want to be alone of course ill go now ill see you later she went out and the great door clanged kate wore a black jacket with a black jumpsuit underneath a gold chain round her throat and diamond earrings you look very nice he said and you look wonderful a true hero it would be nice to think so little sister shall we go they took the range rover from the stable block kate driving went down the long drive turned to the village and parked by the green a few vehicles were already there they got out and moved to the door of the dauncey arms passing the parked jaguar joe baxter already beside it in his uniform there were many people mostly locals in the saloon bar and amongst them dillon and billy standing by the fireplace in their black suits and duster coats kate gave a sharp intake of breath he came didnt you think he would rashid moved through the crowd with her grasping hands thanking people for coming glad you could make it dillon a great performance dillon said to him glad you approve i love the coats amazing what will go in those big pockets and very considerate of you to bring your friend here what do you want to do pay me off for rama do what you did to bronsby billy shook his head just try thats all i ask kate said paul lets go betty came up frowning is there a problem not at all these gentlemen are friends of mine rashid smiled buffet and champagne afterwards betty turned away and then ill expect you at dauncey place if thats your pleasure well its certainly my bleeding pleasure billy told him excellent i look forward to it come on kate and they turned away people started to filter into the church from eleven oclock still only a few limousines were outside this time unlike the old earls funeral and lady kates as rashid had arranged it the great and the good were virtually excluded although as before one of the most important imams in london had agreed to appear with the rector a measure of the liberality of the muslim religion not often appreciated by outsiders dillon moved in with billy people were seating themselves others walking around examining the marble edifices of the long dead billy was walking ahead joining in he suddenly paused then motioned to dillon look at this geezer sir paul dauncey says he died in fifteenten hes the original paul dillon said the one who fought for richard iii at bosworth a bad day for his side he escaped to france and the new king henry tudor pardoned him how do you know all this i looked it up billy its all in debretts thats the bible of the english aristocracy billy looked down at sir paul dauncey he even looks like rashid that kind of thing happens in families billy i tell you what he looks a hard bastard he looks like a warrior billy which is what he was he shrugged its what rashid is to be honest its what you are remember something i once told you there are men of a rough persuasion who look after those things ordinary people cant handle in life usually theyre soldiers of one kind or another just like you and me in a manner of speaking dillon smiled now lets move to the back of the church the congregation settled the organ started to play and major paul rashid earl of loch dhu and lady kate rashid came through the main entrance followed by the undertakers carrying the two coffins one behind the other each was draped in the union flag georges had his paratroopers red beret on top michaels the cap hed worn when passing out of sandhurst and in both cases the ceremonial jambiya of a rashid chieftain the rector had moved in from the vestry followed by the imam there was silence the rector said we are here to celebrate the lives of two young men george and michael are rashids but also daunceys a bloodline linked to our village that has borne that name since the fifteenth century the service began later it rained as the coffins were taken to the family mausoleum the congregation followed one undertaker carrying a huge black umbrella over rashid and kate baxter had parked the jaguar by the churchyard gate billy ran down to him and came back with a brolly jesus ive never seen so many umbrellas its life imitating art i could do with a cigarette and a large bushmills in that order so were going to this buffet at the pub why not in for a penny in for a pound he turned and walked away and billy followed at the jaguar joe baxter got out and dillon said well walk you wait by the green joe baxter glanced at billy who said what he says goes just do it as you say billy he got in and drove away as dillon lit a cigarette billy said were not tooled up yet theres time for that billy plenty of time lets take a walk and they moved down towards the green billy holding the umbrella over them in london harry salter called sam hall but had difficulty in contacting him a young woman secretary informed him that sam was taking care of a consignment down the river in truth sam was well and truly keeping his head down harry totally frustrated told dora to arrange his car and a driver and got dressed she had to help him because his shoulder wound needed its sling as she finished the matron looked in are you discharging yourself mr salter no im just going home ill come back any time you want for my checkup well professor bernsteins here at the moment having a look at general ferguson but i dont think for long you mean fergusons here certainly you show me where a little while later he sat in a reception area turning a door opened and ferguson emerged followed by arnold bernstein briefcase in hand why harry ferguson said dont harry me you old sod bernstein said i cant remember telling you you could get out of bed mr salter well im out and im going ill sign anything you want only i need a word with his highness here oh dear trouble bernstein sighed im going to see my daughter ill be back shortly and i urge you to seek my advice you need the correct medication at least he walked away and harry turned on ferguson what a bastard you are having dillon banged up ferguson said what in the hell are you talking about billy told me last night you had special branch lift him using the old ira record you were supposed to wipe clean and banged him up at west end central to stop him going to the dauncey funerals and confronting rashid ferguson said i ordered dillon not to go he wouldnt listen you say billy told you this yes where is he phone him now well hes unavailable a job in southampton a look of horror appeared on his face oh god he lied to me dillons gone down there and i think youll find billy has gone too to watch his back its the only likely explanation for his absence i knew he wanted to go and i said id go too well that explains a lot youve been damaged enough he wanted to keep you out of it you see a facetoface confrontation with rashid will probably be like a spaghetti western and youre letting this happen youre worse than me ferguson said because of our connection over the last few years ive really had you checked out in your days of empire as one of the most important guvnors i believe thats the phrase you fought off the corelli brothers three of them who totally disappeared then there was jack hedley the one called mad jack found in an alley off brewer street i could remind you of a few more all right harry said that was business it was only ever that with me i never did whores never did drugs i know harry you just killed people who got in your way i do the same thing or have it done theres always a good reason its my job harry its business so what are you getting at ive had enough of rashid i dont need to go into it you know what hes been responsible for his two brothers have gone down thanks to dillon bell and his cronies are out of it that only leaves rashid and hes got to go too but you didnt want dillon to go down to that funeral and face rashids challenge so im a liar harry i pushed dillon a little but i knew hed go and if he finishes rashid in the right way it suits me you see dillon is a remarkable man not just because of his many gifts and his good brain and the fact that he can kill without it giving him a problem so what have you left out he couldnt care less whether he lives or dies thats good thats very comforting and my nephews going the same way your nephew was to use london underworld parlance a right villain his involvement with dillon over the past few years has given him a sense of himself he actually has quite a brain on him all right so i know that but what do we do ferguson glanced at his watch the funeral service started at eleven thirty theres a buffet afterwards at the dauncey arms mainly for villagers as its now twelve thirty i dont think theres much we can do except rely on dillon and billy of course billy bernstein came back so youre still leaving mr salter i have to harry said all right come to the reception desk and ill arrange the right antibiotics but i insist on seeing both of you tomorrow at my rooms in harley street at ten oclock ill sort you out then people ate and drank champagne at the dauncey arms betty moody supervising everything tirelessly dillon and billy joined in had some salad smoked salmon new potatoes billy as usual only drank water dillon tried the champagne and rejected it as reasonably inferior a young woman leaned over the bar are you mr dillon thats right my love this champagne is just for you she held it up cristal the best dillon said now who would do a thing like that why the earl sir as she removed the cork dillon looked round the room there was no sign of rashid the girl poured offered billy one and he waved it away the earl doesnt seem to be here dillon emptied the glass in a single swallow the girl looked bewildered thats strange sir he was at the fireplace with lady kate did he say anything else oh yes he said if youd call in hed buy you the other half well thats nice of him another glass sir no thanks ill have a large bushmills whiskey it could be my last no water she gave it to him betty moody moved in from the back kitchen her face was swollen with weeping dillon raised his glass a terrible day for you mrs moody for all of us he said lchaim and swallowed the bushmills down lchaim whats that a hebrew toast it means to life he put down his glass and turned to billy we must go and led the way out dauncey place was quiet when rashid and his sister went in through the massive door and entered the great hall as he had arranged there was no staff it was theirs alone the logs burned in the fireplace and on the centre table was an ice bucket with a bottle of bollinger and four glasses he helped her off with her raincoat and moved to open the champagne bottle why four glasses she asked two for dillon and billy salter he poured theyll come and im a gracious host both as a rashid and a dauncey he gave her a glass and raised his own to us little sister and george and michael and to dillon she drank a little you dont hate him it was a statement not a question he shrugged kate our father was a soldier and took a soldiers risks sean dillon is a soldier i am still a soldier george took a soldiers risks in hazar michael at wapping each time dillon took the same risks you really think that of course he raised his glass to sean dillon from paul rashid one brave man to another she said do you want to do this brother he refilled his glass my darling girl ive done everything in my time put my life on the line made incredible riches but at the end of the day how much money can you spend so whats important i suspect dillon would say the game and thats how you see it he swallowed his champagne and laughed out loud oh yes kate the only game in town the fire crackled it was very quiet she looked around the great hall all we have ever been as daunceys all our yesterdays is the phrase so what happens now dillon will come with billy salter and what do you do face him kate a far more interesting prospect than making another billion there was a long pause and she sighed you havent answered paul by the champagne bucket there were two small transceivers he picked one up these are very simple things press the red button and youre in touch with me but why he smiled ill explain but first you must have a final glass with me i dont like that its as if youre saying goodbye never my darling well always be together always dillon and billy found baxter drove up to dauncey place in the jaguar and pulled into the stable yard they got out baxter opened the boot and dillon unzipped the weaponry bag he took out two walthers put one in his belt at the rear and gave the other to billy is this it billy asked no dillon took out two parkerhales just like rama he put one in the lefthand pocket of his coat so how do we do it billy asked unless hes brought reinforcements hes in there with his sister but id discount her how do you know just a feeling so we knock on the front door maybe its open lets see you come with us joe and bring your browning the three of them went up the steps of the great pillared doorway dillon tried the ornate handle the ring in the lions mouth the door opened a couple of inches and he closed it too obvious an invitation lets try the terrace exactly as rashid had anticipated they moved along the series of french windows that fronted the library one of them stood open so hes giving us a chance inside between ornate curtains was a book cupboard the kind of thing usually concealed and painted in seventeenthcentury italian style it stood slightly open kate inside now what billy asked ill take the front door you go this way only try not to shoot me by mistake dillon turned to baxter you go round the back of the house fire the browning in the air three times and take off the carswell so hell hear it and think were coming in that way thats crap billy told him i know but its the best i can do billy its a question of what rashid wants to do he turned to baxter on your way and well go straight in see you billy in hell billy told him no chance a bottle of champagne for me and irish stew for both of us at the dark man and dillon moved away kate having heard everything closed the cupboard door and signalled her brother he responded at once whats happening she told him he said good ill draw him up to the bell tower meet him on angel terrace you stay out of it he clicked off up there on the minstrel gallery he moved to the balustrade holding a silenced ak its butt folded he was still wearing his uniform but no cap he waited the shots rang out baxter ran for it billy pushed the window in and went through dillon at the front door turned the lions head handle and moved in the hall was a place of shadows flames from the burning logs reflected in a strange way dillon was behind the chairs of the enormous dining table rashid saw him for a moment but didnt bother to fire hey dillon why the big coat parkerhale in the pocket dillon crouched the walther in his hand i can see you infrared sight im up here on the minstrel gallery take the main staircase then what we call the blue arch to the circular stairway up the bell tower angel terrace is above the leads ill wait for you if you have the courage if you need a machine pistol okay but a walthers fine with me or bare fists he laughed and the library door creaked open billy whispered you there dillon using his infrared sight rashid targeted the chest and fired twice dillon recognized the distinctive muted crack of a silenced ak at once billy was hurled back one down rashid called and his laughter faded away dillon crawled to billy who moaned gasped for breath dillon tore his shirt open felt around and found the two rounds sticking in the titanium waistcoat take your time he whispered youve got traumatic shock to the cardiovascular system but the vest stopped penetration buy shares in the wilkinson sword company billy gasped ill make it hang on until your breathing is right im going up this bell tower after him he stood took off his coat and left it with the parkerhale when he crossed the hall and went up the stairs his only weapon was the walther in his right hand billy lay there trying to steady his breathing the library door behind him creaked again lady kate rashid peered down at him then dashed across the hall and went up the great staircase after dillon dillon took no particular precautions going up the circular stairway of the bell tower rashid wanted him on top wanted to face him that was an essential part of the situation beside the door at the top was a slit window he peered through what was obviously the angel terrace curled away with no sign of rashid dillon opened the door flattened himself to one side and looked out the rain had increased into an almost tropic downpour there was a curved railing and on the other side the oldfashioned roof made of sheets of lead sloped down to an edge that looked like a foot of granite behind him although he didnt know it kate rashid mounted the circular stairs dillon took a deep breath and moved out into the rain walther extended nothing he took another breath and from above the top of the cover over the door paul rashid dropped on him sending him to his knees he chopped dillon across the right wrist so that he dropped the walther dillon raised his elbow back into rashids face and managed to stand he turned and rashid faced him that magnificent uniform soaked in rain now then my friend at last he launched himself at dillon and they met breasttobreast behind the door opened and kate appeared she cried out as rashids greater weight forced dillon back against the rail there was a moment of struggle then they went over together on to the leads sliding apart the pouring rain had made the wet leads almost as slippery as ice rashid slid one way lurched and went over the edge of the granite dillon slid a few yards away but was more fortunate his feet slamming against the granite he started to work his way along and held out a hand come on go to hell down below joe baxter and billy looked up dillon said for gods sake just take my hand and argue later no damn you there was a cry and above them kate rashid appeared paul no she ducked under the rail and slid down the wet slope of the leads finishing with her feet against the granite edge rashid was slipping further she braced herself reached and grabbed his left hand come on paul just hang on to me he did for a moment and his weight pulled her forward so that she almost went headfirst over the edge he smiled up at her nothing but love and understanding and a strange kind of grace a most heartbreaking thing that would haunt her for the rest of her life hey little sister enough is enough not you too he pulled his hand free almost floating away from her turning over once in midair before hitting the terrace below beside billy and baxter there was no scream from her nothing like that it was as if every possibility of such a reaction had died for all time such was the shock dillon caught her right hand and reached up for the first edge on the leads come on for a moment she hesitated and he tried again come on unless you want to go too something went out of her in a shuddering sigh and he reached again pulling them up to the railing she broke away from him and then ran down the stairs and through the great hall dillon picked up his coat and went after her he paused on the steps and put the coat on her as she knelt over her brother billy slightly dazed and baxter stood beside her she looked up her face incredibly calm hes gone youve done for all of them dillon all my brothers im sorry it was the instinctive reply empty and stupid go away for gods sake girl this is my business dillon just go you and your people ill deal with you later at a more suitable time dillon hesitated then nodded to baxter and billy lets get out of it they got in the jaguar baxter started the engine and drove away dillon turned and looked she was still kneeling are you all right he asked billy sore as hell what happened up there at the end it was handtohand we fell across the rail down the roof and he went over i offered my hand when he was hanging there but he didnt want it she slid down to join us but he pulled away because he thought shed go over too when dillon lit a cigarette his hand shook he said hey little sister enough is enough not you too jesus christ billy said what did she mean ill deal with you later at a more suitable time simple billy it means its not over now id better phone ferguson and he took out his mobile epilogue london to the world in general and the media in particular it was a sensational story that on a day of family tragedy the funeral of two brothers paul rashid earl of loch dhu and one of the richest men in the world had fallen from the angel terrace of the bell tower at the ancient family home the sisters story had been simple leaving the reception after the funerals hed been distressed hed wanted to be alone and had gone up to the top of the bell tower a favourite place the stories were muted the rashids being who they were and having large holdings in both television and the newspaper world most newspapers spoke of a tragic accident there was the odd hint of suicide but that was all one story that was generally reported was the account of paul rashids funeral all the newspapers carried it it was a simple service not even the dauncey villagers invited an imam from london joining the rector the only mourner lady kate rashid as usual the media got it wrong for someone else attended sean dillon didnt go into the church for the service he sat with billy in the jaguar and waited its raining again billy said nearly always does dillon told him the cortege emerged from the church kate rashid now countess of loch dhu following behind the coffin dillon got out of the jaguar billy said do you want the umbrella whats a little rain billy he let them reach the dauncey family mausoleum moved forward and stood at the edge of the churchyard while the rector and the imam did their thing strange but kate rashid didnt have an umbrella and there was no one holding one over her she stood in the rain in her usual black her only cover a black raincoat while they took the coffin in the rector and the imam shook hands the undertakers dispersed she turned and started to walk away and came through the churchyard toward the gate where dillon stood it was almost as if she moved in slow motion she was totally alone her dark hat shading her face no emotion not even when she got close to dillon it was as if he wasnt there no more as if he didnt exist she was so close that her coat almost touched him she moved out of the gate and turned up the street toward dauncey place dillon watched her go then returned to the jaguar back to london billy started the car and drove away is that it then i dont think so on friday night of that week they met in the dorchester piano bar harry and billy ferguson and dillon harry still wore a sling ferguson appeared normal no sign of his broken arm dillon stepped behind the piano lit a cigarette and started to play working his way through a few standards he was aware of her appearance but made no sign continuing to play she leaned on the piano i like that dillon a foggy day in london town from damsel in distress fred astaire ive seen the movie joan fontaine was terrible but youre good good at everything seated at the end table ferguson and the salters could hear the entire exchange dillon shook out another marlboro and lit it with his old zippo what do you want kate not just you dillon you and your friends she turned to the others and stood there in her usual black jumpsuit only this one looked as if it had cost three thousand pounds at the armani shop her black hair was superbly cut hanging to her shoulders and for once she was ablaze with jewellery she looked incredible not just amazingly beautiful but strong powerful the queen of sheba dillon said quietly really she smiled oh yes and its not just the arab influence there are dauncey wives with marble faces from long ago in that church who have the same look you couldnt have paid me a greater compliment dillon slid from behind the piano and joined the group lady loch dhu ferguson said formally and they all stood sit gentlemen they eased down i thought youd like advance notice of todays news american and russian oil interests have agreed on terms for exploration in hazar and the disputed empty quarter with rashid investments theres been strong movement on the stock exchange for a familyowned firm and me as executive chairman she smiled huge movements in new york and the city of london weve jumped to seven billion my accountants tell me it makes me the richest woman in the world ferguson managed a smile excellent my dear i was sure youd think that general there was silence dillon said get it done kate she turned and actually smiled sorry dillon i just wanted to say that i intend to destroy all of you its the arab half of me you see i had three brothers now im on my own and how do you intend to do it he asked gently it doesnt really matter i believe in the old saying that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold i can wait she smiled again but it does leave you gentlemen on the dangerous edge of things when you start the car will it blow up the footfall in the darkness is it an assassin do what you like darling harry salter told her people have been trying to knock me off for the last forty years ferguson said my thanks for the advance warning very civilized she smiled at dillon dont forget me sean and remember the dauncey family motto i always return she walked away supremely beautiful the epitome of elegance dillon watched her go and said softly oh i wont forget you girl
