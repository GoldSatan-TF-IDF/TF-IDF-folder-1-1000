gerald seymour home run prologue june she was led down the iron steps and across the hallway and out into the chill of the morning she would have gone on her toes to protect the rawness of the wounded flesh on the soles of her feet but the guards on either side of her held her firmly above her elbows and she was hurried across a chipstone yard she did not cry out she did not flinch from the pain that burst into her body from her feet there was a jeep parked on the far side of the yard beyond it four posts in front of a sandbagged wall there were two groups of soldiers lounging on the ice wet grass between the jeep and the stakes and some were cleaning their rifles she saw the ropes that were knotted to the posts they were waiting to do their work but she was not a part of that work at the back of the jeep she was handcuffed then lifted roughly inside under the loose canvas her escorts climbed in alter her she was pushed to the floor where the fuel fumes merged with the sweat stench of the black and hooded chador the jeep lurched forward she heard the exchange between the driver and the sentries at the gate and then she heard the early morning choking whine of the street traffic she closed her eyes there was nothing to see she had learned when she was taken to the gaol three months before that her ears were to be her eyes it was an hours journey to the airfield the canvas at the back of the jeep was raised the tail dropped she was levered out of the jeep for a moment she was slumped on the tarmac before the guards hoisted her to her feet she saw no pity in their faces she thought that they hated her as their enemy she knew where she was as a child she had many times been brought here by her mother to welcome home her father from field exercises away from the capital she could remember soldiers and junior officers ail polished and creased and snapping to attention to salute her father as he passed them she could remember the disciplined laughter all around her as she had broken free from her mothers hand and raced forward to jump at her fathers chest precious memories now she was shepherded by her guards up the rear ramp of the aircraft as she was taken forward in the closed cave of the aircraft the light of the morning died and the soldiers tucked in their boots and shifted their rucksacks and their weapons to allow her and her escorts to pass they took her to the front of the aircraft to where some seats had been curtained off with sacking the guard who fastened the seatbelt across her waist leered into her face and his breath was heavy with chillis the engine pitch rose the aircraft stumbled forward the flight from tehran to tabriz a distance of miles took minutes she did not turn her head she did not try to look out of the small porthole window behind her left ear she did not need to see the gold sun streaming from behind the great mountain of damavand she sat still unmoving unspeaking she found a place on the cabin floor in front of her a place amongst the ammunition boxes and the ration crates she stared down at the place it was an old aircraft she heard the rumble of the engines and sometimes the cough of a missed stroke she heard these sounds above and dominating the reading of the quran from beyond the sacking screen her guards talked quietly and kept their eyes from her as if contact with her could contaminate them taint their souls she tried not to think was her short life an achievement was it wasted better to shut her mind to thoughts the pitch of the aircraft changed she closed her eyes she had no god she willed courage into her body the transporter rattled down onto the long strip of the tabriz field and the interior was flooded with light and the squeal of the tail ramp going down after the pilot had braked and the aircraft had stopped she was kept in her seat until the last of the soldiers on the far side of the sacking screen had gone with their kit and weapons and ammunition and food their voices trailed away from her she wanted so much to be brave she wanted so much to be worthy of her father the guards unfastened the safety belt they made her stand from a plastic bag one of the guards took a loose white robe with open seams and tapes under the armpits the white robe was lifted over her head and the tapes were tied at the sides she was alone in four days she would have been eighteen she had been brought to the second city of her native country for public execution they led her down the echoing interior of the aircraft out into the bold crisp sunlight of the morning she was a small waif figure amongst the men she wanted to think of her father and she could not because the pain of her body had crept through to her mind she wondered if her father at his same moment at the moment when he was lashed to the post in the garden of the evin gaol had thought of her his daughter a short and hazed thought and then gone the lorry waiting a few feet from the aircraft ramp spilled out its exhaust fumes over them a guard on each elbow half walking her half carrying her to the back of the lorry and a small knot of men waiting there for her arrival the young mullah was there she had stood in front of him in the courtroom high in block one of the evin gaol in the late afternoon only yesterday perhaps he had travelled from tehran to tabriz last night after he had heard the case against her weighed it passed judgment announced sentence perhaps he had boarded the aircraft after her and sat away from her and amongst the soldiers it was of little matter the mullah stared into her face she tried to stare back at him but her guards pulled her forward to the back of the lorry and lifted her bodily up and inside the mullah had taken a very few minutes to hear her case she had not spoken in her defence she wanted it over she did not know how long she could stay brave the lorry drove into tabriz she was not innocent of the crime of which she had been convicted yes she had thrown the grenade and yes her regret was very keen that it had not killed more of the pigs she knew why she had been brought to tabriz she knew it was the custom of the regime to exact retribution and punishment at the scene of the crime sometimes the lorry was held up in traffic that not even the bellow of a siren could clear slow jerking progress she pictured in her mind the road they were taking it was the same route that she had travelled with the two boys into the city the heart of the city and the offices of the pasdaran to her mind the pasdaran were the symbol of slavery repression bigotry the islamic revolutionary guards were the embodiment of an evil that had consumed her nation the lorry stopped the hands of the guards rested on her arms she saw that they watched her eager to see how she would be in the last minutes they lifted her from the wooden seat of the lorry propelled her towards the open end of the lorry numbness in her mind a quivering weakness at her knees she heard the bellowing of a tannoy and realised that it was the same voice hushed and musical then that had sentenced her to death late yesterday she stood at the edge of the lorrys floor there were people as far as she could see a roar greeted the sight of her the sound of the voices came at her as waves across shingle repeated and again impossible to make out what was shouted because her ears were still confused by the pressure drop of the aircraft the faces told her the faces were shouting their hatred their pleasure at what was to happen to her as far as she could see faces of hate and faces of pleasure she could not see the mullah but she heard the excitement in the shrillness of his voice hands reached up for her she was lifted down from the lorry no pain in the soles of her feet now her guards dragged her forward and men in uniform forced a passage clear ahead of them she saw the crane the crane was on a platform behind the cab of a truck the truck was outside the front gate of the offices of the pasdaran the truck was parked where she had thrown the grenade where the two boys who had been with her were shot down where she had been captured there was a table of heavy wood under the lowered arm of the crane there was a noosed rope hanging from the crane and beside it a man in the combat uniform of the pasdaran he was stout heavily bearded at the side of his leg he held a long strip of leather the guards lifted her very easily onto the table she gazed around her she was aware that the executioner now crouched beside her and she felt the tightness of the leather strip at her ankles so ridiculous so ridiculous that so many had come to watch the putting to death of so small a person so young a person so ridiculous all of those people in front of her below her so ridiculous that she smiled her face broke into a smile the smile of her youth the smile of her puzzlement she heard the mullahs voice above all the thousand other voices in unison and then suddenly the shouting had gone a great booming quiet around them as the executioner draped round her neck the string that carried the white cardboard sheet on which was spelled out in large characters her crime his fingers fumbled with the noose of the rope he pulled the noose over her head tightened it under her chin he had never known such quiet they would all remember her all of those who watched the handcuffed girl in the white robe standing alone on the table as the executioner jumped down the arm of the crane surged upwards she died painfully struggling but quickly for two hours high above the street her body hung from the arm of the crane the old man made his way along the corridor he was an institution in the building a throwback really to the days before the service had been equipped with consoles software and instant communications in his own way the messenger was something of a celebrity at century house because of the time he had been with the service he almost alone had known intimately the warren of the former offices that spanned queen annes gate and broadway he had been on the payroll under seven director generals and it had become difficult for any of the older people at century to imagine being able to cope without him his approach was slow he had never quite mastered the artificial limb fitted below the right knee cap he had been a young man when he had lost his leg a corporal of infantry on garrison duty in palestine when he had stepped on a crude antipersonnel mine he was paid for a hour week and not a week went by when he was inside century for less than hours across the thames muffled by the sealed windows of the tower block big ben struck nine thirty the steel toe and heel caps of the messengers shoes scraped along the composite tiles there was silence around him office doors locked rooms darkened but he could see the light at the distant finishing post of the corridor this evening every weekday evening the messenger performed a personal service for mr matthew furniss he carried by hand the transcript of the main evening news bulletin on the home service of tehran radio monitored and translated at the bbc premises at caversham relayed by telex to foreign and commonwealth office and thence to century he paused at the door the transcript was gripped between his thumb and a nicotined finger he looked through the dusk of the open plan area and towards the light shaft that was the door into the inner office of mr furniss he knocked come the messenger thought that mr furniss had a lovely voice the sort of voice that would have sounded lovely on the wireless he thought mr furniss with his lovely voice was also a lovely man he thought mr matthew furniss was the best of the old guard at century and a proper gentleman youre so kind harry bless you and you should have been home hours ago it was a sort of a ritual because the messenger brought the transcript every weekday evening and every weekday evening mr furniss seemed so pleasantly surprised and grateful and he thought that evening that mr furniss looked rotten like the world was on top of him the messenger knew enough about the man plenty as much as anybody at century because the messengers wife in the years gone by had babysat minded the girls for mr and mrs furniss the room stank of pipe tobacco and the ash bowl was brimming that was not usual nor was the bottle of grants that was on the desk and had taken a beating no problem sir the messenger handed over the transcript twentyfour hours earlier to the minute the messenger had delivered the previous monitored and translated news bulletin from the home service of tehran radio it was all very clear in the messengers memory mr matthew furniss had given him his chirpy and conspiratorial smile and eased back in his chair to gut the resume and the chair had snapped forward and the paperwork had flaked down from his hands onto the desk top and hed looked as if hed been hit that had been last night the messenger watched he peered through the smoke haze the evenings transcript was on the desk and mr matthew furniss was scanning it taking it line by line he stopped he looked as if he was unwilling to believe what he read the messenger stood by the door he saw the fist over the transcript clench saw the knuckles whiten the bastards the filthy vicious bastards thats not like you mr furniss the wicked fucking bastards not at all like you sir they hanged her hanged who sir the messenger had seen the moment of weakness but it was gone furniss poured a generous measure of the whisky into a fresh glass and offered it to the messenger and the small glass already on the desk was filled splashed to the top the position of the messenger at century was indeed unique no other uniformed servant of the service would have been offered hospitality in the office of a senior desk man the messenger bent and scratched at his knee where the strapping chafed the daughter of a friend of mine harry what you brought me last night told me that it was on their radio that shed been tried found guilty sentenced probably a short ten minutes of play acting at justice and tonight it says that shes been executed same age as our girls roughly a sweet kid if anyone harmed your girls mr furniss id want to kill them yes harry ill drive you home be a good chap find yourself a chair outside just one phone the messenger sat himself down in the outer office he could not help but hear carrying papers post internal memoranda around the corridors of century he knew so much eavesdropped so often he heard mr furniss place through the operator a call to california he heard the calm voice the far side of the partition wall kate thats you kate its mattie im very sorry kate but ive awful news its juliette she died this morning in tabriz put to death im terribly terribly sorry kate and our love to you and charlie youre still going to send him of course well look after charlie whenever you think hes ready to come kate our very sincere sympathy he heard the telephone placed down gently that was awful hanging a girl that was diabolical there was no call for hanging seventeenyearold girls not in harrys book mr furniss was in the doorway coat over his arm time we were going home harry mahmood shabro always invited charlie eshraq when he threw a thrash in his office shabro had known his father and his sister and his uncle the wide windows looked out onto the busy east end of kensington high street there was a teak veneer desk and shelves and cabinets there was a computer console in the corner a pile carpet on the floor with a centrepiece of a good rug brought many years before from home the easy chairs were pushed against the walls that were covered with photographs of a far away country mosques landscapes a bazaar scene a portrait of an officer in full dress uniform and two rows of medals mahmood shabro was somewhat rare among the london exile community he had done well and when he did better when he had clinched a deal he celebrated and he asked the less fortunate of his community to push out the boat with him mahmood shabro was a conduit for electrical goods going down to the gulf not your low life stuff from taiwan and korea but high quality from finland and west germany and italy he didnt do badly he liked to say that the oil rich buggers down in the emirates were putty to him charlie could put up with the cant and boasting of the shabro husband and wife and he could put up with the caviare and the canapes and the champagne a thousand top of the range zanussi washing machines were going down to dubai and some cretin who was happier on a camel was paying the earth for the privilege of doing business with mahmood shabro good enough reason for a party he stood by the window he watched he was amused he was not a part of the cheerful talk that was fake the tinkling laughter that was fraud he knew them all except for the new secretary one man had been a minister in the penultimate government appointed by shah reza pahlavi as the roof was caving in over the peacock throne one was once a para troop major who now drove a minicab nights and he was on orange juice which meant he couldnt afford one evening off to get pissed one was a former judge from esfahan who now collected social security payments and who went to the oxfam shop for shoes one had been a policeman and now went every two weeks to the offices of the antiterrorist branch at new scotland yard to complain that he was not given adequate protection for someone so obviously at risk they had all run away they werent the ones who had ripped off the system and come out with their dollars folded in their wifes underwear if they werent far sighted enough to collect them from banks in switzerland they were all pleased to be asked to mahmood shabros parties and they would eat everything within reach they would drain every bottle charlie always had a good laugh out of mahmood shabro mahmood shabro was a rogue and proud of it charlie liked that the rest of them were pretence talking of home as if they were off to heathrow next week for the flight back talking about the regime as if it were a brief aberration talking about their new world as if they had conquered it they had conquered nothing the regime was in place and they werent going home next week next year mahmood shabro had put the old world behind him and that was what charlie eshraq liked he liked people who faced facts charlie was good on facts good enough on facts last month to have killed two men and made it clear away the talk flowed around him it was all talk of home they had exhausted their congratulation of mahmood shabro home talk all of it the economy in chaos unemployment rising the mullahs and ayatollahs at each others throats the war weariness growing they would have gagged if they had known that charlie eshraq had been home last month and killed two men their contact with home was long range a drink in a hotel bar with the captain of an iran air jumbo who was overnighting in london and who was prepared to gossip out of earshot of his minders a talk on the direct dial phone with a relative who had stayed inside petty talk because if politics were debated then the line would be cut a meeting with a businessman who had travelled out with foreign currency bankers orders to purchase items of importance to the war effort charlie thought they knew nothing he reckoned mahmood shabros new secretary looked good charlie and the girl were younger by years than anyone else at the party he thought she looked bored out of her mind i rang you a few weeks back good party isnt it i rang you twice but you werent there mahmood shabro at his shoulder he had been watching the girls backside when her skirt was tight as she had bent down to pick up a volauvent that had been dropped on the carpet and that was steadily being stamped in the carpet he supposed was worth fifteen thousand i was away you travelling much charlie yes im travelling still the travel courier charlie said easily he looked across at the secretary thats a pretty girl can she type who knows what talent is concealed charlie saw the watchful eyes of mrs shabro across the room you alright charlie never better anything you want if theres anything i cant get by myself ill come to you mahmood shabro let go of charlies arm save me the taxi fare take her home he liked mahmood shabro since cutting loose from his mother and pitching up in london without a family mahmood shabro had been a friend a sort of uncle he knew why he was mahmood shabros friend he never asked the man for anything the secretary had come to his corner of the room taking her bosss place she had a bottle of champagne in her hand he thought it must have been the last bottle and she had come to him first to fill his glass almost to the lip before moving on and pouring out a few drops for everyone else she came back bearing the empty bottle she said that mahmood shabro had told her to put a bottle aside for herself she said with those eyes that had been worked with such care that she would not object to sharing the bottle she told him that she would have to clear up he told her his address and gave her a key and a note to cover the cab and he said that he had to meet a man on his way home that she was please to wait for him he went out into the early summer night it was already dark the headlights of the traffic flow scratched across his features he walked briskly he preferred to walk he could check for a tail he just did the usual things nothing flash round the corner and waiting stopping on a pavement spinning walking back checking the faces just being sensible he went to his meeting he had put out of his mind the gathering of nohopers losers dreamers in mahmood shabros office she was nineteen she was a mainliner the middle of the evening and the darkness spreading she stood in shadow at the side of the toilets in the small park area off the main shopping street she was a mainliner because dragon chasing and mouth organ playing were no longer sufficient to her lucy barnes was a tiny elf girl she felt the cold she had been waiting for two hours and when she had left the squat the sun was still hovering amongst the chimneys of the small terraced homes the sleeves of her blouse were fastened at her wrists the light above the toilet block had been smashed and she was in a black hidden space but she wore a pair of wide dark glasses two weeks ago she had sold the remote control colour channel portable television set that had been her parents birthday present to her she had spent the money she had used up the grammes of scag the sale had bought there was more money in her pocket more notes crumpled into the hip pocket of her trousers that afternoon she had sold a teapot from home georgian silver good price she needed a good price the bastard was bloody late and her legs ached in cramp and she was cold and she was sweating her eyes were watering as if she was crying for him to come mattie furniss would not have shared the conviction with even his closest colleagues but the last fourteen weeks had convinced him that the director general was just not up to the mark and here they were again the meeting of heads of desks middle eastwest asia had kicked off an hour behind schedule it had dragged on for close to three hours and they were bogged down a third of the way down the agenda nothing personal of course simply the gut feeling that the director general should have been left to vegetate in main stream diplomacy at foreign and commonwealth and not been inflicted on the service in the first place mattie furniss was a professional and the new director general was most certainly not and it was equally certain that the secret intelligence service of century house could not be run as if it were merely an offshoot of fco worst of all was the inescapable conclusion that the director general wet behind the ears in intelligence tradition was gunning for iran desk israel desk mid east desk gulf desk and subcontinent pakistan desk were all in his sights but iran desk was taking the bulk of the flak thats the long and the short of it gentlemen we are simply not producing top quality intelligence material i go to jic each week and they say to me what is actually happening in iran perfectly fair question for joint intelligence committee to be asking me i tell them what you gentlemen have provided me with you know what they say they say to me and i cannot disagree that what they are getting from us is in no way different from what is served up by the usual channels along the gulf director general if i may allow me please to finish id appreciate that mattie sagged back in his chair he was the only smoker round the mahogany table that the director general had imported upon arrival he had his matches out every other dg he had worked for had stuck to one on one meetings where a bit of concentration could be applied where speeches would seem inelegant he smoke screened himself i wont be able to defend my budget proposals for the coming year if the service is producing in such a critical international theatre the sort of analysis that is going into fco day in and day out thats the crux of it mattie it was the fourth time mattie had listened to this monologue the three previous sessions he had stood his corner and justified his position he sensed the others round the table praying he wouldnt bite on three previous occasions he had delivered his answer no embassy in tehran as cover for a resident station officer not a hope in hell of recruiting anyone close to the real power bases inside iran less and less chance of persuading british technicians to do any more than decently keep their eyes open while setting up a refinery or whatever three times he had come up with the more significant data that his agents in place had been able to provide all water off a ducks backside including the best stuff he had had last time from the boy and unless they finished soon he would be too late to pay for it i hear you director general the director general hacked a cough through the wreaths of smoke drifting past him what are you going to do about it endeavour to provide material that will give greater satisfaction than the hard won information my desk is currently supplying the director general flapped in front of his face with his agenda paper you should go out there mattie tehran director general first class idea mattie said israel desk was the youngest in the room highflier and still irreverent too long in the field and having to bite on the heel of his hand to stop himself laughing out loud i cannot abide facetiousness where would you suggest i travel to director general the fringes mattie asked quietly to what purpose pretty obvious surely to brief your people on what is now required of them to take the opportunity to get your agents in place out from inside so that they can be advised in exact terms of our needs he bit at his pipe stem you are forgetting director general that desk heads do not travel who says so since ever desk heads do not travel because of the security implications do not travel wrong do not usually travel right if he bit through the stem of his pipe he would at the same time break his teeth is that final yes it is and i think well pause there there was a rapid gathering of papers israel desk was already out of the door when the director general said goodnight gentlemen and thank you for your patience whats worth doing is worth doing right mattie furniss didnt wait for the lift to get up to the th floor he ducked away from his colleagues for the fire escape stairway he went down nine flights at two steps at a time praying that the boy would still be waiting for him and for his present it had been a short road for lucy barnes from home in a mews house in londons belgravia to the attic of a terraced house in the west country town on this cool and early summer evening she was at the end of her financial resources she had gone to london that week she had broken into the family home through a kitchen window she had taken the teapot they would change the locks after that probably they had already changed the locks she couldnt remember now why she had only taken the teapot she had no idea where she would go for more money for more scag after the doses that were on the floor beside her were exhausted a short road cannabis smoking behind the schools sports pavilion an act of adolescent defiance and experimentation she had been through dragon chasing heating the scag powder through tinfoil and inhaling the fumes through a soft drinks tube she had tried mouth organ playing dragging the same heated fumes into her lungs through the cover of a matchbox one and a half years after her expulsion and pretty goddam embarrassing that had been because darling daddy was already signed up to hand over the prizes at next terms speech day she was a mainliner and needing a grand a month to stay with it the pusher had said this was new stuff purer than he had ever had through his hands before the best stuff he had ever been sold none of the usual dilution shit in the cut no talcum or chalk dust or fine sugar real stuff like it had been before the dealers got to be so bloody greedy she loaded the hypodermic she could estimate the dose didnt use fragile weighing scales she sat crosslegged on a square of threadbare carpet the attic was lit by the beam from a street light that pierced the dirty glass of the skylight window she could see what she was doing the arm veins were no longer any good to her the leg veins were failing on her she kicked off her shoes she wore no tights nor socks her feet were dark stained she had not had a bath in more than a month but she knew where the veins ran on the underside of her feet she gritted her teeth as she inserted the needle behind the ball of her right foot she drew back the arm of the hypodermic sucking blood into the container allowing the blood to mix inside the syringe with the scag powder slowly trying to control the trembling of her thumb she pressed down on the syringe she lay back on the bare mattress she anticipated the peace and the dream the boy was where he had said he would be old habits would die hard for mattie furniss the old way of doing things was to meet in a parks open spaces where it was comparatively easy to guard against surveillance and eavesdropping the boy was a shadow under a sycamore tree close to the lake he was almost trotting and the supermarket bag flapped against his trouser leg out in the road that fringed the park a van did a uturn and its headlights played across the open ground with the manoeuvre and the boy was lit tall bearded a fine looking boy mattie had known young eshraq so long that he would always regard him as a boy but charlie did not seem to mattie like any other yearold that he knew not in build and stature not in temperament or attitude a hell of a fine young man but then so had his father been he reached the tree he drew at his breath he had run all the way from century on the other side of the river over the bridge and across whitehall to the park he would have to put in some extra training if he were to finish the half marathon this summer tied up dear boy apologies no problem sir mattie liked the way that charlie addressed him that was his fathers stamp on the young man and his mothers too in fairness to her long time dear boy its a new skill for me learning to write reports sir i hope it will be of use to you charlie reached into his blazer pocket took out a thick envelope handed it to mattie mattie didnt examine it just slid it down into an inner pocket of his suit then drew across a zip fastener at the top of the pocket another old habit wouldnt do for a desk head to get his pocket picked in the underground im looking forward to it heard from your mother n o charlie said it as if it didnt matter to him that his mother never wrote nor telephoned from california as if it was nothing to him that the golf course and the bridge club and the riding school filled his mothers days and evenings that she regarded him as a relic of a former life in iran that was best forgotten that was pain to remember i read about your escapade the good old tehran times carried on the radio as well a slow smile on charlies face you werent compromised there was a search afterwards plenty of roadblocks no they didnt know what they were looking for they put it down to the hypocrites it went quite well mattie could almost have recited the text of the irna communique reproduced in the tehran times in separate incidents in south tehran two islamic revolutionary guards martyred in broad daylight by mko mojahedine khalq organisation counterrevolutionary mustaqqfin hypocrites working in conjunction with american mercenary agents now that harry had retired gone more than four years the irna communiques reached him ahead of the bbcs transcripts he missed the messengers service we came up with a nice one for the next run mattie said he offered the supermarket bag that was taut from the weight of its contents instructions inside thank you ill want another report of course sir mrs furniss is well grand form and the girls youll come down to the country when youre back well round up the girls make a weekend of it id like that you alright for money i could scrape the bucket a bit for you a present in a plastic bag he could manage with ease money was harder money had to go through audit the present in the plastic bag was by his own arrangement with resources equipment on the ninth floor im fine for money sir glad to hear that he saw the boy hesitate the boy looked as though he were framing his request and not certain as to the best face to put on it he felt the first drops of rain and he was sweating now from his run cough it out the target that i want most has an escort and his car is armoured meaning it would be difficult to get close enough and mattie wasnt going to help i need what they call standoff capability do you understand that sir i understand mattie gazed into the boys eyes the hesitation was gone the request had been made there was cool and attractive certainty in the boys eyes you would have to go for longer your reports would have to be regular why not charlie said as if it was a small matter mattie thought of the boys father a generous host a true friend he thought of the boys uncle a mountain of a man a superb stalker of boar and a brilliant shot he thought of the boys sister delicate and winning her arguments with the brilliance of her smile and kissing him when he brought gifts to the villa he thought of charlies mother brittle because she was uncertain brave because she had tried to blend and assimilate her foreignness into that society of the wide and prosperous avenues of north tehran it was a family that had been dismembered that would be very expensive indeed a sharpness in matties voice yes he was a stickler for protocol and procedure no he should never have allowed his service life to meld with the crusade that was the boys i could pay for it mattie furniss was off on his travels and that was no business of the boys and he didnt know his schedule yet he did not know when he would return when they could next meet so much to talk about they should have been talking in comfort of gentler matters relaxed they should have been gossiping not prattling around the subject of standoff capability and armourpiercing weapons under a tree in st jamess park for gods sake with the rain beginning to come down in earnest he took out his pen and a sheet of paper from a leather backed pad he wrote briefly on it a name an address thank you sir charlie said the keen statement in for longer the reports more regular please give my best regards to mrs furniss and to the girls of course i will theyll be glad to know ive seen you he wondered whether the boy had been more than a friend to his daughters either of them theyd been very close down in the country and when his brood were all in london and the boy was their guest it had been in london three years before in their little drawing room the boy on his first trip from california and away from his mother that mattie had told charlie eshraq as straight and as baldly as he could what had happened to his sister and his father and his uncle he had never seen the boy cry since then bottled it all up of course when do you go dear boy pretty soon youll telephone me at home before you go yes youll go steadily yes the rain dribbled over matties face and caught at his trimmed and silver moustache and darkened the front of his shirt the boys face was a blur in front of him and masked by the fullness of his beard if anything happened to you while youre away harriet and i and the girls wed be mattie squeezed the boys shoulders why should it sir they parted he walked home mattie felt dirtied because he encouraged the folly of the boy and yet he did not know how he could have dissuaded him and he had the thick bulk of the envelope in his pocket and the boy had said that he would be going in lor longer and that the reports would be more regular he thought that in a decent world matthew cedric furniss would deserve to be flailed alive he fervently hoped that harriet would still be up and waiting for him he needed to talk to her play a record and be warmed and wanted he had never in three years seen the boy cry and the boy had murdered two revolutionary guards and planned to go back in again with his present in a plastic bag the boy was talking about standoff and armourpiercing he was talking about war dammit and the boy was no less than a son to him mattie said an abbreviated prayer for charlie eshraq as he crossed at the traffic lights outside his london flat and if the boy had bedded his daughters then good luck to him he was soaked his face ran with water his sodden trousers were clinging to his shins and his shoes squelched when he looked up he saw the light behind the curtain welcoming him there could be as many as persons addicted to heroin inside the united kingdom on that night one of them lucy barnes had failed to compensate for the increased purity of the dose with which she injected herself alone in a coma and on a stinking mattress she choked to death on her own vomit the detective had led the way up to the attic during that day he had become familiar enough as familiar as he wanted to be with the cramped space under the slope of the roof he cased back against a wall brushing against the peeling paper below him the stairway protested at the weight of the two that followed him the local detective thought it understandable that the secretary of state would have his own man from protection with him the bodyguard would have lived long enough in the secretary of states pocket to have become a part of the retinue almost family he understood that the secretary of state needed a face to trust the secretary of state emerged into the attic white dust and cobwebs on the collar of his black overcoat the detective had taken to the furthest corner he left the centre ground to the secretary of state and his bodyguard he had seen them all the ones on the breadline and the most powerful in the land they all came bowed and subdued to witness the place the stinking corner where their child had died usually the mothers came too he knew that some would be aggressive some would be broken some crippled with shame their child their future blown away by a hypodermic syringe the room was pitifully bare and even more confused than when the police had first been alerted by the ambulance team because his squad had turned the place over and ransacked every inch of it the mattress had been taken apart the girls clothes had been put into a black plastic sack after examination her papers were collected into a cellophane bag which would go to his office for further examination the bodyguard stood at the top of the stairway he gave the sign with his eyes he told the local man to get on with his talk the secretary of state was known to the policeman only through the television in his living room and the photographs in the newspapers that he never seemed to find time to read but which were kept for lighting the fire before he went to work the secretary of state was not a pretty sight looked like a man who had been kicked hard in the testicles an hour before he could stand but the colour was gone from his face hed done well the local man he had had the name alerted the metropolitan and now had the parent where the parent wanted to be and all this before the ratpack had wind of the excitement drily he thought to himself if nothing else went right on this one then getting the secretary of state into and out of this crap heap before the photographers pitched up was good going he took the lead from the bodyguard lucy had been living here for several weeks sir at least she was here for a month only known means of support the social security preliminary post mortem indicates that she was a serious victim of addiction we dont regard users as criminals sir we tend to refer to them as victims her wrist veins have been used no good anymore and her thigh and shin veins have also been used she had taken to using the smaller veins in her feet as an injection route i am assuming that you were aware that she was addicted sir i mean it must have been pretty obvious obvious that is if you were still in touch with your daughter the secretary of state had his head down made no response just like all the rest of them feeling it a duty to get some feel of where their child had died christ the room stank we cannot yet be certain of the cause of death not in exact terms that will come later when pathology have had their full whack but the first indicators are sir that she took a rather pure dose what she took was just too much for her system that causes a coma and then vomiting blocked windpipe does the rest im sorry sir the secretary of states voice was a flat monotone ive an old chum medic in london i talked to him right at the beginning i said whose child becomes an addict he said your kid he said no one worries when the addict is that nice kiddie from next door but by heavens they worry when its the nice kiddie upstairs we thought that we had done everything for her she went to the best schools when she went onto heroin we sent her to the best withdrawal clinic just a waste of money we cut her allowance so she sold everything wed ever given her she moved out then came back and stole from us can you imagine that officer stealing from her own parents of course you can imagine it you are accustomed to the misery caused by this addiction the last thing we did was have the ministrys own security system in our own house changed i mean thats coming to something isnt it when the secretary of state for defence has to have his own alarm system changed because his own daughter might want to break in her mother will want to know cant hide much from her mother would she have been in pain coma first sir no pain the detective was past shock past sympathy and way past apportioning blame he could be matter of fact she had the stuff its if she hadnt had the stuff that she would have been in pain how much would it have been costing her from what weve seen anything between a hundred and two hundred a week when its got that bad the local detective wondered how the politician would survive it he wondered whether he would shut himself away from public life once the storm blew the headlines tomorrow and the coroners court reporting whether he would carry on as if his public and private lives were separate compartments he wondered if the pursuit of his public life could have so damaged a private life that a lone lost child took to a syringe for companionship for love the secretary of state had a good grip on himself his voice was clear nothing staccato nothing choked a colleague of mine said recently this abuse brings hardened criminals and indulgent users together in a combination that is potentially lethal for good order and civilised values the price of ultimate failure is unthinkable that was before lucy had her problem i didnt take much notice of it then what are you doing about it officer this lethal combination the local detective swallowed his first thoughts not the moment to spit out his gripes about resources and priorities and bans on overtime payment which meant that most of his squad clocked off on the dot of office hours he said gather what evidence we can sir try and move our investigation on from there do you have children officer yes sir what age about half your lucys age sir could it happen to them what happened to her as long as the stuffs coming in sir flooding in like it is yes sir what would you want done officer if she had been yours id want to get to the fuckers excuse me sir to the people who made the stuff available to your lucy youll do what you can bluntly sir thats not a lot yes we will the bodyguard had flicked his fingers a small gesture close to the seam of his trousers the local man had the message he moved around and behind the secretary of state to the head of the staircase the bodyguard was already warily descending there was music playing on a lower floor the detective had had one session with the other residents of this terraced house and he would have another later that afternoon when he had got himself shot of the big man he hadnt been heavy with them the others in the squat not once he had discovered who lucy barnes father was counter productive he would have said to have leaned too hard on them right now he wanted their help he needed all they could give him from the top of the staircase he looked back the secretary of state was staring down at the mattress and the bag of clothes and the junk litter that might the previous week have been important to a nineteenyearold girl he paused at the bottom of the stairs what does he think im going to do about it the bodyguard shrugged two three minutes later they heard the creaking of the stairs the detective thought he saw a redness at the eyes that were distorted by the secretary of states rimless spectacles on the pavement the secretary of state paused beside his car the chauffeur was holding open the back door thank you again officer i am not a complete fool by the way i understand the very real difficulties that you face in your work i can promise you one thing i will quite shamelessly use every vestige of my authority and influence to ensure the apprehension and prosecution of those responsible for lucys death good day to you he ducked down into the car the bodyguard closed the door on him and slipped into the front passenger seat the detective saw the secretary of state lift from a briefcase a portable telephone and the car was gone heading away last he went back upstairs in a confined space he preferred to work alone half an hour later under newspapers under a loosened floor board a long way back in a cavity he found lucys diary this is a great deal better mattie much more what ive been looking for im gratified ill explain to you my assessment of iran theatre mattie studied the ceiling light it was not so much an impertinence more an attempt to avert his eyes so that the impatience could be better disguised we are talking about the regions principal geopolitical and military power sitting astride the most important petroleum trade routes in the world we are talking about the country with the potential for regaining its position as thirteenth in gross national product with the largest army in western asia with no foreign debt with the capacity to blow over every other regime in the area i have specialised director general in iranian matters since i have actually lived there yes yes mattie i know you are close to iran short service commission in the coldstream liaising with the imperial army to station officer to bahrain and ankara after the revolution give me the credit mattie for being able to read a personal file i know you were familiar with iran before your entry to the service and that since entry you have specialised in that country i know your file backwards and ill tell you what i think youre probably too close to your subject my training is as a kremlinologist im a cold war freak and i should think you have a clearer view of how we should be targetting the soviet union and its satellites than i have just as i believe i have a clear idea of whats required from iran its time we understood each other mattie mattie no longer stared at the ceiling he looked straight ahead of him he hadnt his pipe out of his pocket he hadnt his matches on the mahogany table he had his fists clenched he could not remember when he had last felt such anger youre in a rut thats why ive been brought in to run century there are too many of you in a rut going through the motions never questioning the value of material i wont accept paper pushing this is the best material you have supplied me with mattie squinted his gaze across the table across to his rewrite of charlie eshraqs report good but not that good a useful start for something that would get better its crude but its factual in short it is the sort of material that crosses my desk all too infrequently there are live valuable pieces of information one the movement of the th and th battalions of the irg th sanandaj division from ahvaz to saqqez movement by night indicating that this was not simply a tactical readjustment but more the reinforcing of a particular sector prior to using those guards in a new push the iraqis would like to know that youd pass that on to the iraqis a hiss of surprise i might good material earns favours two the german engineer on his way to hamadan and at hamadan is a missile development factory good stuff stuff we can confront our friends in bonn with make them quite uncomfortable ive marked up all of what i consider to be relevant five points in all the training camp at salehabad north of qom thats useful fine stuff the director general had carefully placed his pencil on the table he upturned a glass and filled it with water from a crystal jug and who is going to emerge as the power among the clerics and how long the war is going on and what is the state of disaffection amongst the population am i to presume that is unimportant no mattie not unimportant simply outside your brief analysis is for diplomatic missions and theyre good at it i trust there will be more of this yes who is the source i think ive got your drift director general asked you who is the source i will make sure that a greater flow of similar material reaches you the director general smiled the first time that mattie had seen the flicker of the lines at the side of his mouth please yourself mattie and have a good trip charlie eshraq was personal to mattie and would not be shared with anyone he stood turned and left the room going down in the lift he wondered what the boy was making of his present it was personal and private to mattie that on his last journey inside charlie had killed two men and equally personal and private that on this journey he would kill another they had been colleagues since university since the youth section of the party since sharing an office in the research division headquarters in smith square they had entered parliament at the same election and the cabinet in the same reshuffle when their leader finally determined on retirement they would probably compete in the same dogfight for the top job that time had not yet come they were close friends im dreadfully sorry george once the home secretarys assistant had brought in the coffee placed it on the desk and left they were alone it was rare for two such men to meet without a phalanx of notetakers and agenda minders and appointment keepers the secretary of state sat exhausted in an easy chair the plaster dust and the cobwebs still on his overcoat i want something done about this stinking trade of course you do george the secretary of state looked hard into the home secretarys face i know what you are up against but i want them found and tried and i shall pray you get them convicted and sentenced to very long terms every last one of the bastards that killed lucy very understandable my detective told me that we are stopping one kilo out of ten that comes in we have stepped up recruitment of both police drugs officers and customs weve put a huge resource at the disposal the secretary of state shook his head please not a party political not between us ive got to go back to libby tonight ive to tell her where her our daughter died and then i shall have to leave her and put on a cheerful face for dinner ironically enough with some bigwigs from pakistan from the heart of what i expect you know is the golden crescent i dont think and i mean this i dont think libby will survive lonight if i cannot give her your solemn promise that lucys killers will be found and brought to book ill do what i can george she was a lovely girl lucy before all this everything we can do that is a promise youll give my love to libby im so very sorry oh youd by god be sorry if you had seen how lucy died how she was dead and where she died libby will need the strengh of twenty to survive this in my heart of hearts i have known for almost a year how it might end but i couldnt imagine the depths of it you must see it day in and day out but this time the minuscule statistic on your desk is my dead daughter and i am going to hold you to your promise the detective worked his way steadily through the diary he found an asterisk in red biro on every third or fourth day of the last few weeks the last against the date on which the girl had taken her overdose there were also telephone numbers there was a string of sevenfigure numbers almost certainly london numbers which for the moment he discarded he had wrung from the others in the squat that lucy barnes had not been away from the town in the last days of her life the local numbers were fivefigure numbers there was one number underlined in the same red biro the local detective worked to a formula he would work into the early evening and then lock away the papers on his desk put on his coat and drive home what other way if he and his two juniors worked hours in the they would still make no noticeable dent on the narcotics problems that had spread even to this country town where did the bloody stuff stop the detective went to the area seminars he had heard endlessly of the big city problems and their problems the problems of the major city forces were his if he hadnt shut it away locked it into the drawer of his desk each evening then the scag and coke would do for him too before he put the key back into his pocket he told the better of the two juniors to get onto the telephone exchange and cut all incoming and outgoing calls from the underlined number he wished them well bade them a good evening and left for home the gloves off is that what youre asking for he was a former chief constable he had seen it all and heard it all he wanted the guidelines crystal clear and from the horses mouth he headed the national drugs intelligence unit based on new scotland yard with responsibility for coordinating efforts to stem the flow of narcotics into the country yes i suppose thats it yes that is what i am asking for the home secretary shifted in his seat his own private secretary was busy at his notepad and at the back of the room the policemans aide was scribbling fast then looking up to see whether there was more the home secretary wondered how similar their two notes would be what i could say to you home secretary is that i might be just a little concerned at hardpressed and limited resources being diverted on to one case however tragic merely because the victim happened to be well connected you would understand that i could say that would be entitled to say that its no doubt a straightforward case its nothing that hasnt been successfully dealt with countless times i just want it solved and fast the home secretary said then ill tell you sir whats landed on our desks over the last few days four blacks bullock their way into a house and shoot the mother and her schoolboy son the boys dead thats drugs related a blind widow is beaten up in the west country for a hundred pounds in her pension book thats to pay for drugs twentyeight policemen injured in two months in west london in one street in yards of one street because were trying to put a stop to trafficking in that street what we call designer drugs cocktail amphetamines there are at least wo new laboratories in east london which we havent found a sixyearold kiddie whos hooked on reefers and his mums come in to tell us that he pinched out of her handbag to pay for them thats whats hitting our desks at the moment now do i hear you rightly sir do i correctly hear you say that that type of investigation pretty important to the men and women involved goes on the back burner yes because the daughter of a cabinet minister is dumb enough to squirt herself an overdose dont lets play silly buggers thank you sir ill attend to it and be damn certain you get a result there was a wintry smile on the policemans face a smile that sliced the home secretarys defences he looked away he didnt want to see the mans eyes the message of contempt that a man in his position could break the civilized order of priorities because he had given his word to a colleague youll keep me informed the home secretary told his private secretary and you can ring down for my car charlie eshraq rang harriet furniss said mattie was heaving out of his overcoat did he now reaching to hook it tidily behind the front door and what did he have to say for himself it was matties way that he did not bring his office home he had told his wife nothing of his dealings with the boy nor that charlie whom harriet furniss treated as a son had killed two men on his last journey home they had been married for years and he had spent of them as a member of the secret intelligence service and he had stuck to his rule book and the rule book said that wives were no part of the service he said that he was sorry that he had missed you he was off tonight was he now mattie made a poor fist of unconcern harriet would have noticed but she would not have commented harriet never attempted to draw him out he said that he had a rather good job for a few weeks something about playing courier to tourists in the aegean thatll be nice for him he said thank you for the present ah yes just a little something that i saw and posted to him he said too fast he could lie with the best of them at century and was a miserable failure at home he said it would be very useful thats excellent the country this weekend i think harriet some reading to be done he kissed her on the cheek like it was something that he should have done earlier in all his married life mattie had never looked at another woman perhaps he was old fashioned he thought a little more each day of his advancing years his next birthday would be his rd and happily acknowledged that he was just damned lucky to have met and married harriet nee owens furniss he opened his briefcase took out the black clothbound book that was all of its contents he went to work each morning with a briefcase as if it were a part of his uniform but he never brought it home filled with office papers he showed her the elegant lettering on the spine the urartian civilization of near asia an appraisal she grimaced he opened the book and showed her the receipt from the antiquarian bookseller it had better be your birthday present his birthday was not for another nine weeks she would pay for the book as she paid for most of the extras in their lives as she had paid the girls school fees as she had paid the airfare for charlie eshraq to come over from california to london years before mattie had no money no inherited wealth only his salary from century which looked after essentials rates mortgage housekeeping their way of life would have been a good deal less comfortable without harriets contributions how did charlie sound sounded pretty good very buoyant actually supperll be frizzled they went down the hallway towards the kitchen he was holding his wifes hand he did it more often now that the girls had left home youll have something to get your teeth into for the weekend indeed i will that wretched man whos bought the manor farm hes ploughed up the footpath across ten acre ill have plenty to keep me busy god help the poor bastard mattie thought the newcomer from the big city if he had come down to the countryside and ploughed up a rightofway and made an enemy of harriet furniss she looked into his face the urartians arent they eastern turkey she saw him nod is that where youre going gulf first but i might get up there there were times when he wanted nothing more than to talk through his days to share the frustrations and to celebrate the triumphs but he had never done it and he never would in the kitchen he made himself a weak gin and tonic and gave harriet her schooner of cyprus dry sherry supermarket gin and cheap imported sherry because drinks came out of the housekeeping he was quiet that evening while she washed up the pots and loaded the dishwasher mattie sat in a chair by the window and saw nothing through the opened curtains and wondered how far on his journey charlie eshraq had travelled come on keeper for christs sake get a wiggle on the pub was full getting near to closing time and the swill underway before time was called david park was away from the bar outside the group he stared back at them bloody hell keeper are you in this round or are you not there were six of them up at the bar and some had shed their jackets and all had loosened their ties and their faces were flushed a hell of a good evening for all concerned except for david park he hadnt made his excuses and gone home to ann but he hadnt played much of a part in the pissup that had been inevitable after mr justice kennedys remarks following the sentencing keeper it is your round true it was david parks round he drained his bitter lemon he made his way to the bar in a quiet voice and the barmaid had to heave most of her bosom onto the beer mats to hear him he ordered six pints of yorkshire bitter and a bitter lemon with ice he passed the beers from the bar to the eager waiting hands bloody good keeper cheers old matebout bloody time too keeper my old love you are something of a wet towel tonight he grinned fast as if that were a weakness he did not like to acknowledge weakness im driving he said calmly he slid away from the heart of the group back to the fringe his radio call sign was keeper had been ever since he had been accepted into the investigation division he was park and so some bright creature had labelled him keeper mucking in getting pissedup falling around they werent parks talents he had other talents and mr justice kennedy had remarked on them and commended the april teams dedicated work and to everyone else in april that was reason enough to be on their seventh pint with a cab home at the end of it mr justice kennedy had handed down late that afternoon a fourteen two twelves and a nine mr justice kennedy had called for bill parrish senior investigating officer and in charge of april team to step up into the witness box so that the thanks of a society under threat from these hellish traffickers who deal in wickedness could be expressed bill parrish in a clean white shirt then had looked decently embarrassed at the fulsome praise set out by the old cove parrish earned basic a year david park earned basic a year the bastards who had gone down for fourteen and twelve and nine were looking at a couple of million hidden away in the caymans and not touchable it would take park years to earn what the bastards had waiting for them after their time less remission and by then he would be retired with his indexlinked pension to cuddle he liked the chase cared little about the kill couldnt care less once the cuffs went on parrish would get a great welcome from his wife when he made it home after closing and shed pour him another jug full and sit him down on the settee and roll the video so that he could belch his way through the recordings of the two main news bulletins of the evening and hear the message to the nation that customs and excise was super bloody marvellous and keeping the nation safe etc etc park hoped ann would be asleep april team was iranian heroin park had been four years with april and had an encyclopaedic knowledge of iranian heroin he had been the front man in this investigation deep inside the guts of the organisation that was doing the running of the scag he had even driven for them ann knew sweet nothing about what he had been at best if she were asleep when he reached home he watched the group he thought they looked stupid and very drunk he couldnt remember when he had last been the worse for wear in public one of the reasons he had been selected that he could be relied upon invariably to stay the right side of the bottle to be less than per cent clearheaded on a covert operation would be real bad news like a shotgun barrel in the back of the neck he didnt tell ann what he did he told her the generalities never the details he couldnt have told her that he was insinuated into a gang that if his cover were blown hed be face down in the thames with the back of his skull a bloody remnant he thought one of the guys was going to fall over bill parrish had detached himself from the group at the bar session made his way stiffly to park an arm looped around his shoulders he took the weight mind if i say it when you want you can be awesomely priggish david you can say it aprils a team a shit hot team a shit hot team stands or falls on being together being together doesnt match with one bugger on the edge and looking down his nose park disentangled the arm propped it onto the mantelpiece of the bars fireplace meaning what meaning that this has been a great scene worth celebrating park dragged the breath down into his lungs parrish had asked for it hed get it did you see them in there did you see them when they were being sent down they were laughing at us bill one fourteen two twelves and a nine and they were looking across at us like it was some sort of crack did you see their women in the gallery deep tans from the costa and that wasnt paste on their fingers ears throats hear me bill what we are at is a confidence trick we arent even scratching at these pigs and here we are pretending were winning its a confidence trick the judge plays too and that way the british masses go to their beds tonight thinking everything is hunkydory were kidding ourselves bill were not win ning were not even doing well were drowning in the bloody stuff thats daft talk david hows this for daft talk heroins an explosion cocaines gone through the roof phets are up with cannabis were talking tonnage not kilos were deluding ourselves if we pretend were on top of it were down on the floor bill yes or no bill ive drink taken im not answering sorry out of order you know what i think he saw parrish roll his eyes wouldnt be the first time that keeper had spouted his view of salvation give it me were too defensive bill we should be a more aggressive force we should be abroad more we should be ferreting down the source we shouldnt just be a line of last resort with our backs against the wall we should be out there and after them parrish gazed into the young face in front of him into the coolness of the eyes that were not misted with drink at the determined set of the youngsters chin he swayed and wheres out there out there is the arse end of afghanistan its the happy little villages of iran my darling you go there on your own you dont go there with your old uncle bill then we might just as well give up legalise the stuff for a joker whos going to get a commendation whos just had the judges praises sung up his bum you are mightily hard to please keeper you should go home in the morning a good shit and a good shower and a good shave and youll feel no end better parrish had given up on him headed back for the group he stood a few more minutes on his own the rest had now forgotten him he could not help himself he could not turn it off like they could he was right he knew he was right but none of them came over to join him to hear how right he was he called across to say that he was on his way none of them turned none of them heard him he drove home he observed the speed limit he was stone cold sober it meant nothing to him that the judge had singled him out for praise it only mattered that there was a war and it was not being won home was a twobedroom flat in the southwest suburbs of the city he could afford to live in the flat because of his overtime and anns work in a local architects office he garaged his escort at the back of the block he felt half dead with tiredness he was a long time selecting the right key what made him tired what made him want to throw up had been their looks from the dock as they had heard sentence the bastards had laughed at aprils best effort inside there was a note on the narrow hall table d ive gone to mums for the night might see you tomorrow if youve the time a the detective bright and early thanked the supervisor at the exchange a small country town of course there were easy and unofficially good relations between the exchange and the police the number that had been disconnected last evening had been reported out of order three times during the night one caller had left his name and telephone number and not a name that surprised him young darren was quite well known to the local detective he suggested to the supervisor that it would be quite in order for the telephone to be reconnected in his office he told his subordinates when they came in not to take their coats off and he handed them the address and told them to bring in darren cole for a chat he was whistling to himself gilbert and sullivan he would enjoy talking old times to young master cole and talking about lucy barnes purchases a fine start to the day until his clerical assistant informed him that he was required in the chief superintendents office and that two big shots were down from constabulary headquarters he was dressed as a pasdar in the loosefitting dun khaki uniform of the revolutionary guards and he walked with a limp that would be noticed but which was not ostentatious he had left his motorcycle a hundred yards behind where t he man that he followed had parked his paint scraped hillman hunter he had trailed the man through the alleyways of the closed bazaar past the steel shuttered doors and towards the masjidijomeh he walked on ignoring the pain of the pebble taped under the ball of his right foot he watched as the man passed the guards at the outer doorway of the mosque entering the dark shadow beneath the linked domes when the man was lost to him charlie veered away and crossed between the sparse traffic to the far side of the street for years now there had been heightened security at friday prayers all across the country ever since the bomb hidden beneath a prayer mat had exploded at friday prayers at tehran university charlie watched and waited the guards at the entrance to the mosque had seen the young man who now sat on the cracked pavement across the street from them they had seen his limp and they waved to him and smiled a comrades greeting a veteran they would have supposed of the great marshland battles on the perimeter of basra far to the south maybe a casualty of the fierce fighting around halabja on the mountain road to baghdad charlie knew that men in uniform and with guns in their hands and who were stationed far behind the lines always had respect for a wounded veteran he would cross the street and listen to the mullahs words from the loudspeakers high on the domes of the masjidijomeh and he would talk to the guards charlie had not been brought up to respect the faith of modern iran it had been his fathers concession to his americanborn wife his mother had had no religion charlie had been raised without the teachings of the ayatollahs and without the teachings of the christian priests who had served the expatriate community in iran the children he had played with been taught with before he went to the american school they had taught charlie enough of the moslem faith for him to be able to pass as a believer he would want to talk with the guards talking was what charlie did well and he was better at listening he listened to the guards he let them talk duty rosters hypocrite outrages troop movements to questions about himself he was modestly reticent his wound was a small thing he hoped that soon he would be fit to return to the service of the imam charlie saw the man come out of the mosque at one moment he was listening attentively to their talk at the next he had made his farewells pleading weariness he must rest and he had drifted away he had known the name of the man for two years and he had known his address for seven weeks since he was last home he knew the age of the man and the name of his wife and the number of his children and he knew the mans work he knew by heart the case histories of at least a dozen of those executed by this man since the revolution he knew that depending upon the order of the islamic revolutionary courts sometimes the man made his executions by hanging and sometimes by shooting the man was at peace safe after communication with his god safe in his home city safe in the service of his imam the man had hanged a teenager of the bahai faith who had refused after torture to recant his heresy he had shot the yearold former captain iraj matbui who had been helped to the execution post sentenced for leading the gendarmes against the mullahs in the mashad revolt of in public he had hanged juliette eshraq charlie had known the mans name for two years since he had first returned to iran since he had scraped away at the story of his sisters death it had taken longer to find the names of the two guards who had lifted her on to the table beneath the crane in front of the guards barracks in tabriz these two he had now hunted and killed he knew the name of the investigator who had tortured his sister he knew the name of the mullah who had tried and sentenced his sister he saw the man climb into his old car he rode behind him across the bridge over the broad river that was swollen by the melting mountain snows from the north along the straight road beside the cemetery and the gardens that once had been the citys pride the midday heat trapped in the valley mistered the squat concrete buildings charlie felt the warmth of the air on his face as he rattled in the wake of the hillman hunter bouncing over the coarse paving of the old road the car ahead of him pulled off the road no signal wound up a dry dust lane charlie braked cut his engine dismounted and seemed to be adjusting his chain he watched the children stream out of the house and the man laugh with them reach lor them and lift them he had seen enough charlie remounted and powered the motorcycle away young darren had been left to sit in an interview room watched over by an expressionless policewoman and sweat his two juniors reported to the local detective and in the chief superintendents office sitting back easily feigning the indifference of rank were the big shots from constabulary headquarters the local detective liked what he heard young darren had been lifted outside his address taken on the pavement as his hands were busy with the keys and door handle of his car two arresting officers approaching from different directions and the suspect taken unawares and without the chance to dispose of the evidence the detective heard them out then muttered a lukewarm congratulation he could play politics with the best of them nothing too fulsome because that way he gave the impression that it wasnt a miracle that they had done it right when they had finished and bowed their way out of the presence the detective addressed himself to his seniors he had the file he glossed through the prime detail cole darren victor age years address previous possession fined possession fined possession months commonlaw wife two babies income no visible means upsum hick secondrate villain pusher and user young cole was what would be expected in a country town small time small beer not the sort of chummy who would ever expect to be confronted in the interview room by big shots from headquarters they left the local detective with no doubts he was working to them they were in charge they had taken over he would do as he was told and be thankful for it he didnt complain had never in his police career tried to buck the system he was to go back to darren coles address with his two juniors and a dog relieve the uniformed constable who had been left to watch over the woman and her brats and take the place apart he would not be required for the interview with chummy and god help him if he came out of that house with at least one evidence bag not filled in the interview room they dismissed the policewoman they introduced themselves a superintendent and a chief inspector they sat and tilted their chairs back as if that were more comfortable they looked at darren cole like he was filth like theyd want a good wash after being in the same room with him their chummys eyes flickered hovered from one to the other they let him soak it in they wanted him soft its darren right darren cole is that right the chief inspector said softly their chummy pursed his lips stayed quiet the superintendent said i am going to assume darren that you are not wholly retarded im going to give you the benefit that you are not completely dumb now its not every day that the likes of my colleague and i miss our breakfast to get down here to talk with a shit bag such as yourself darren have you got me young darren nodded nervous and showing it can we start again darren the chief inspector passed his pack of cigarettes across the table and darren cole fished one clear and his hand was shaking as he held the cigarette to his mouth it was lit for him neither of the big shots took a cigarette you are darren cole is that right a feeble reed reply yes good boy darren i said to my colleague that darren cole was cute enough to know whats good for him i said that darren cole would know how to behave you push scag chummy might have done you push it regular maybe the chief inspectors voice hardened regular so i do you pushed to lucy barnes i dont know the names to lucy barnes perhaps getting silly again darren to lucy barnes yes you gave lucy barnes her scag darren shrugged the superintendent said lucy barnes is dead chummy on the slab dont tell me that you didnt know christ is this bloody cow town so bloody slow there was a quiet knock at the door a uniformed policeman came in and handed the superintendent a folded message sheet he read it slowly he smiled slowly then he handed the message sheet to the chief inspector another smile and then the fast look of satisfaction between the two of them darren cole saw the signs he was shrivelling in his chair the dogs been down at your place darren i tell you what when you get through this when youve done whatevers coming your way then id learn to hide things a little better i mean that approximately grammes of what we are presuming to be a prohibited substance namely heroin could be better hidden than under the bloody mattress thats making it easy for the dog darren oh dear oh dear me thats not very clever chummy the superintendent shook his head they had the well oiled routine they had been working in tandem for more than a decade straightforward this one a roll over you are looking at a bad scene darren the chief inspector said it as if it hurt him i didnt know she was dead youve only done an open prison darren closed prison isnt the same the scrubs pentonville winson green long larton parkhurst theyre not the same as where you were they are nasty news darren do you know what youre looking at darren cole did not reply his head was sinking you could be looking at a tenner darren because of who and what miss lucy barnes was gods truth darren a tenner a very hard time in those places darren if we werent speaking up for you the voice was muffled through the hands pathetic what do you want we dont wantyow chummy thats for sure we want up the chain from you wed speak up for you if you gave us the name of the dealer a long silence in the interview room the superintendent said easily just the name of your dealer chummy coles head burst upwards he was actually laughing his shoulders and upper body were convulsed like it was the funniest thing hed ever heard his mouth was frothing you trying to get me blown away i dont get less than a lenner if i grass i get stiffed you get a name and they dont ever forget shove it mister for the next hour darren cole stared fixedly ahead of him his mouth never opened the big shots from constabulary headquarters seethed shouted bribed and won nothing the local detective had a quiet chuckle around lunchtime when he heard how well they had done in cumbersome longhand using a thicknibbed pen in handwriting that only miss duggan could decipher mattie wrote out the signals there were those to the station chiefs around the iranian frontiers and sea boundaries where the watchers of events inside that closed country operated and there were those that would be received inside iran the station chiefs in dubai bahrain and ankara were informed by coded teleprinter messages beamed by the aerials on the roof of century house to a radio farm in shropshire and then on to a booster clinging to the summit point of the troodos mountains in cyprus that codeword dolphin was coming signals to inside iran were drafted for transmission on the evening farsi language commentary as broadcast by the world service of the bbc from bush house those signals would be received by a man who worked in the harbourmasters office at the newly developed port of bandar abbas by a man who had a carpet business in the close and covered alleyways of tehrans bazaar and by a man who repaired heavy goods vehicles in a yard behind the old railway station at tabriz when she had sent down the messages and signals to the basement his pa reverted to form she began to fuss him with detail were mr furniss inoculations up to date when could he manage an appointment with the medical staff for malaria pills stomach pills sleeping pills for the aircraft she would go to the third floor for his travellers cheques but would he sign this authorization and for his tickets please sign here here and here and would he be wanting the car to collect him for the airport directly from home or from century should a final appointment be arranged with the director general and inside the passport was a folded slip of paper as a reminder not to forget the girls nor mrs furniss of course i dont suppose she was taken in for one moment by that cardigan i found in the strand the last time you came back the routine of travel was no longer second nature to him he gave way before the organizational blizzard that was miss duggan he sat on the twoseater sofa in the partitioned office he had the ripple of her keyboard in his ears quietly he read his book he was stocking his mind with detail wonderful people the urartians an extraordinary and flourishing civilization of three hundred years and then gone a thousand years before christs birth this stocky people had made their mark across the wedge that was now divided between turkey iraq and northeastern iran he was already an authority of some stature concerning their artefacts their belts and earrings and bracelets their cuneiform script that he had seen gouged out on the walls of ruins and caves most certainly he would get to the van kalesi the urartian fortress at van safely inside turkey was earmarked as the next stop after tabriz very much indeed he would look forward to being there he summoned up the memory of van kalesi built of dressed stone blocks that weighed up to tons apiece the canal that brought water to van from miles away a civilization reduced by the assyrians to bronze trifles and pottery shards and amusement for men such as mattie furniss the book he now read described the excavation in of a urartian fortress town in present day soviet armenia the first time that he had come across a readable and unabridged translation of the report the purpose of his reading was cover whenever mattie travelled in the gulf and near asia it was as an archaeologist one day he would write his own book on the urartians damned if he knew how he would get it published commercially but if all else failed harriet would probably pay for a private printing of his view of urartian culture miss duggan was locking her papers into the wall safe time for lunch time for the canteen queue he seldom took lunch in his office he enjoyed the chance to spend the time with colleagues at the formica topped tables of the canteen the food was edible the view across the river was always interesting he put a marker in his book and followed her out mattie was a popular figure at century not just because of the long time that he had been with the service but because no man young or old senior or junior could remember the least discourtesy or pomposity from the head of iran desk he had not reached his rank by treading on the prospects of anyone else on the staff he was generous to any colleague in difficulty or who sought his advice many did he would never have claimed to be popular was not even aware of it he went down in the lift with israel desk sorry about what happened the other day up there mattie the dgs no right to speak like that in front of colleagues nor privately i didnt reckon at the time it would have helped you had i stood your corner if it happens again i will chin up eh mattie mattie could summon his fluent smile as if little things like that didnt annoy him at the counter he took a full lunch on to his tray because harriet was out that night a committee on something or other and at home hed be doing for himself percy martins was behind him percy martins ran jordan syria and iraq he had done something worthwhile and quite insane a couple of years back and had himself promoted a light year beyond his ability and the new dg hadnt yet got round to sorting it out thanks for that about the sanandaj units mattie we slid it down to the baghdad chappies by now itll be into the iraqi system very grateful sorry about your run in with the bossman my own view is that hes no background and shouldnt have been let past the front desk if theres any time you need speaking for then im your man a tiny warm smile which said wouldnt be necessary old fellow but thanks all the same he found himself a table he needed to be alone he had his knife into the liver when the seat opposite was taken old henry carter good god thought hed gone in the first reshuffle henry carter bachelor prissy old thing but sharp had been in place when mattie was joining he couldnt imagine what henry carter did round the place these days used to be something about safe houses and debriefs never quite certain and it was the way of the service now that work was specialised that officers were not encouraged to gossip with men and women from unrelated sections such a hell of a quiet voice and it was rude not to listen but so damned hard to hear what the man was trying to say i can see it in your face you thought id gone should have done i was supposed to have been pensioned off last year but i managed twelve months extension they all think im a lunatic still being here but what does a retired spookie get up to i dread retirement its the only thing in my life im actually frightened of handing my id in and walking out of century for the last time sorry about your problems that man needs a brain scan it must be all round the building mattie concluded and that was extremely unprofessional two others came over and muttered at him as if to a bereaved husband before he had finished his treacle tart and custard he felt that he was being set up as a faction leader he would not tolerate that he would refuse most categorically to become a centre of resentment against new management carter asked what are you going to do mattie when you retire write a book the tale of a lost civilization thats very good subtitle a history of the secret intelligence service the news from the national drugs intelligence unit was spring water clear listen my friend i have a powerful breath on my collar if you cant get a dealers name off a pusher in the backwoods just let me know one hour from now and ill send down one of my graduate trainees do i make myself plain old friend the name of the dealer or youre off the case the telephone purred into the ear of the superintendent he was flushed his chief inspector was head down into his notes and not wishing to witness the discomfort our local hero where is he still down at the cole residence get him here the chief inspector gagged youre not going to hand it over to him right now if it would concentrate that little bastards mind id hand it over to the dog the radio transmitters and the teleprinters were in the guts of the building and that was where the decipher clerks worked in a constant airconditioned breeze the signal from london was passed to the junior spook the junior spook had now to walk up two flights of stairs and down a corridor that was shared with the military attaches office before getting to the secure area from which the service worked the original embassy planners had made no allowances for the fall of the shah of iran and the consequent upgrading of the mission that bahrain would become a listening post a base for watchers and analysts of events in the country across the gulf waters had not been foreseen to rebuild the embassy to satisfy the needs of the service was out of the question to have moved the service personnel out of the embassy and into quarters of their own would have increased their running costs and denied them the embassy security umbrella the tea boy had carried cups of tea and soft drinks up the embassy stairs down the embassy corridors for years he had access to any part of the building with his thirst quenching tray except the secure upper corridor beyond the military attaches office the tea boy saw the station officer going down the second flight of concrete stairs his lightweight jacket slung on his shoulders making for the golf course before the fight went he recognised the voice of the junior spook he heard him say half way down the first flight of stairs just through dolphin is on his way here next week what the hell for something about reassessment of aims and means thats bloody inconvenient the junior spook hurried on up past the first floor corridor and towards the secure upper storey an hour later his cups saucers and glasses washed and laid out on a draining board with a tea towel covering them from flies the tea boy left his place of work and walked out into the dry glare heat of the late afternoon the local detective lit a cigarette as an afterthought he tossed one to darren across the width of the cell they were alone the smoke curled between them there was the smell of damp and vomit from last nights drunks lets understand each other darren so that no mistakes are made which might later be regretted weve got you for a miner because you have volunteered the information that you pushed to lucy barnes that and possession of grammes of scag thats all wrapped up trouble is that its gone beyond that you see darren and you have to look at these tilings from our point of view we find grammes of scag tinder the mattress of the bed that you share with your lady love i dont think id find it difficult to persuade any dozen good men and true women would be easier mind you that your lady knew the stuff was there im marching on darren and you must stop me if youre not following me so now we have an accomplice in your trading thats not going to be nice for her darren ill put it another way thats going to he very unpleasant for her i reckon we do her for a fiver see it from our point of view darren you havent helped us and were getting you a tenner you havent helped us and were getting your lady a fiver so what happens to your kids darren they get care they get care orders they get to be scooped up into council care by the time your lady comes out theyll be fostered off nice couple of kids and god knows its not always a disaster fostering but she wont get them back you wont get them back thats looking at it from the bad side darren look at it from the good side you know me you trust me you know im straight what i say ill do i bloody well do straight swap as far as im concerned i get the dealers name and detail you get a great write up from us for the judge and no charge against your lady and no council care order for the kids im leaving you a piece of paper darren and a pencil thats the brown item here with the lead in it and i want you to write that name down and every last thing you know about that man dont think youll be helping me darren think that youll be helping y o u r s e l f half an hour later the detective carried upstairs four sheets ol paper covered by a sprawling hard worked handwriting and a name bloody well done the chief inspector said hoarsely wont be forgotten the superintendent said if you dont mind sir ill be off bit past the time i usually get home he started out of his sleep he heard the latch door close he was awake but there was a long moment when he could not gather where he was when his own sitting room seemed a stranger he heard the footfall beyond the door it was all there in front of him there was the vase on the mantelpiece that his parents had given them for christmas two years back there on the sideboard was the photograph of himself and ann marrying there was her sewing basket beside the fire grate park called out is that you he could hear her shrugging off her coat he heard her voice who else would it be he had his mind clear the wall clock told him it was seven seven what which seven he shook his head christ and he had been so tired the plate on which he had taken his lunch was on the arm of the chair bucking as he moved it must be evening he must have been asleep six hours all of april had a day off courtesy of william parrish and none of the hours lost going through the civil service time sheets he hadnt changed two bulbs he hadnt fixed the washer on the kitchen sink tap he hadnt tacked down the carpet in the hall he hadnt even made their bed she came into the sitting room what are you doing here as if she were astonished i didnt think youd be here we were given a day off he stood he felt ashamed that she should see the plate on the arm of the new chair she had bought the chair he had said they couldnt afford it she had said that she refused to live in a slum and that while she was working she would bloody well spend her money how she pleased why why did you have a day off there was a trial finished yesterday we had a good result we were given a day off she picked up the plate there was no mark on the chairs arm but she flicked it with her fingers anyway there was a trial yesterday that ended at early afternoon i know that because i heard it on the car radio coming home i sat here until past nine i am a dim little thing arent i but i didnt understand how it would take you more than five hours to get from the old bailey central london to here we had a celebration nice for you she headed for the kitchen he followed she spat over her shoulder a pity about the tap i m sorry david if there is a choice between april the lane or your home me i know where the apple falls please dont tell me youre sorry she was a great looking girl she had been a great looker when they had first met when he was on uniform duty at heathrow and a great looking girl in white at their wedding day and a great looking girl when he had come home to tell her all excitement that he had been accepted into the investigation division she was still a great looking girl shovelling his dirty plate into the dishwasher ann had bought the dishwasher david had said they didnt need a dishwasher ann had just gone out and bought it in the sales she was as tall as him in her heels and she had flaxen blond hair that she drew up into a pony and she had fine bones at her cheeks and a mouth that he thought was perfect she worked in the outer office of a prosperous architect and she dressed to impress the clients so you all went off to the pub where there was of course no telephone and i presume you took the opportunity to tell them how they were getting it all wrong i told bill what i thought we should be doing great way to celebrate he flared i said that i thought we werent winning i said that we should be more aggressive work overseas more i said that the men we put away yesterday were laughing at us when they were sent down god they must think youre a bore do you know that last year our cocaine seizures were up by do you know that means that three and a half times as much stuff came in last year as the year before what i care about is that my husband works hours a week that hes paid what a probationer constable in the met gets i care used to care that my husband is never at home when i want him and when i am privileged to see him all he wants to talk about is filthy sleazy nasty drugs his breakfast plate and his breakfast mug followed his lunch plate into the dishwasher its a disease thatll kill this country aids thats nothing in comparison ann theres a billion pounds spent on drugs in this country each year its the principal reason for mugging burglary assault fraud i dont know anyone david who is a junkie no one in our block is that i know of no one in my office i dont see junkies when im shopping drug addiction is not a part of my life except when you bring it into our home its not something you can just turn your back on he said flatly whether its me youre married to or anyone else she turned she came towards him she put out her arms and looped them around his neck her mother had told her to come back and not just to collect her suitcases her mother had told her to try again one last bloody time she had told her mother she would try again are they all like you in april yes all on hours a week seven days a week when its hot yes do all their wives bitch those that have stayed yes i bought some steak and a bottle she kissed him he couldnt remember when she had last kissed him he held on to her and the telephone rang he picked the telephone off the wall bracket yes it is hello bill he felt her arms coming away from his neck he saw the sadness flood her face he was listening he saw her grab inside her bag and slap the meat down on to the kitchen table the lane tomorrow eight sharp look forward to it ann shes great shes in great form thanks bill see you in the morning he could see that she was crying park did not know how to stop his wifes tears he did not know how to tell her of his excitement because the april leader had called him for a meeting eight oclock in the morning at investigation bureaus offices on new fetter lane and promised a good one the teaboys message was carried by a passenger from bahrain to abu dhabi on the gulf and then flown on having been passed to a member of an iranair cabin crew to tehran the message reached the desk of a countersubversion investigator in an office on the fourth floor of a small office block close to bobby sands street once churchill street the block was not identified in any way but was a part of the ministry of information and intelligence to the investigator the transcript of a briefly heard conversation was a source of amazement the investigator had read the message several times he knew dolphin there would have been a dozen men in the section who knew the codename of matthew cedric furniss he had known the codename from far back from times that were not referred to when he had worked for a different master before the revolution he was astonished that the same codename was still maintained over so many years in the islamic republic of iran the british secret intelligence service was hated with a loathing second only to that reserved for the central intelligence agency the spies for the great satan the investigator was not a man to initiate action too great a survivor for that to have survived a career with the sazmane amniyat va attilaate keshvar the organisation of national security and intelligence to have found a safe haven in an organisation dedicated to rooting out all traces of s a v a k that was survival indeed his way was to assemble information and present it to those few people in the regime who had the power to act to many the investigator was a valued tool on his computer ibm stateoftheart he punched up the entry on matthew cedric furniss and composed a brief note on the information that the british head of iran desk was travelling in the region to pass on a reassessment of intelligence aims and means the investigator always worked late in his office he liked the cool and calm of the evening the silent shadows in the corridors he made his decision he lifted his telephone when he talked it was against the distant thunder of an air raid striking the west of the city he travelled on a false passport in his wifes maiden name and with the occupation of academic harriet had seen him off which was unusual but then it was wholly unusual for a desk head to journey abroad they had had their little nuzzles at each others cheeks and he had told her to get back to the bibury cottage and keep on giving that city farmer hell doubletime over the rape of the footpath actually mattie was rather pleased to be airborne in harness again but he hadnt said that to harriet good to be on the road not pushing paper the car had coughed to life and thick fumes poured from the exhaust he let the engine run while he thanked his neighbour for the loan of the charged battery that had been attached to the leads he could ask any small favour of his neighbour and it would be granted his neighbour knew his work most m en in fact who knew his work treated him with respect no man in his company offered him offence or cursed him perhaps no man in tabriz could feel with certainty that he would never look across the space of a cell at the deep brown eyes that would peep from the slits of the tightfitting black mask that he had taken to wearing when he performed his work the highest in the land and the lowest would all walk in the fear that they might one day feel the grip of his thick fingered fist upon their arm it had not been done by himself but he knew the man who had carried out the sentence of the special court of the clergy on mehdi hashemi and hashemi had been the protege of the man named by the imam as his successor likewise he knew the man who had put sadeq ghotzbadeh to death and ghotbzadeh had been the foreign minister of the nation and the favourite of the imam no man in tabriz trifled with the executioner he was adept in hanging and shooting and lashing and organising the casting of stones at women taken in adultery and in the handling of the newly arrived machine that was powered by electricity and that could slice with a guillotine knife through the fingers of a thief he would use it this day a thief who had stolen from a vegetable grower and three executions all in the city a trafficker in narcotics a kurd who had aided the hypocrites a rapist of small children his wife was scrubbing shirts in the yard behind the house she hardly acknowledged his shouted farewell from the back door his children all four of them were playing with a deflated ball around their mothers legs too intent on their game to hear him inside the house from a cupboard beside the bed in the room he shared with his wife he took a mm browning pistol old well cared for accurate he heard the car engine running sweetly beyond the open door he walked out into the morning he tiptoed between the rain puddles because he had earlier shined his shoes he climbed into his car and laid the browning that was loaded but not cocked on the seat beside him and he covered the pistol with yesterdays ettelaat as he drove away he hooted his horn he smiled briefly he did not think that the sound of the horn would interrupt the game of football he tacked up the lane avoiding the deeper holes going slowly so as not to damage the suspension of the old hillman hunter he rolled to a halt at the junction with the main road there was a flow of lorry traffic heading towards the centre of the city he waited for the gap he saw a young man a little down the far side of the main road facing towards the city centre astride his motorcycle the young man was stopped at the side of the road the young man wore a blue tracksuit and was well bearded and bare headed and he carried a satchel bag slung around his neck he saw the gap open for him a small space and he lurched the hillman hunter forward seized his opportunity he heard the high long blast of a horn behind him but the hillman hunter had little acceleration and the lorrys brakes seemed to punch the air as the huge grille closed on his rear view mirror another howling blast on the lorrys horn and then he was under way it was always a difficult manoeuvre getting out of the lane in which he lived and joining the highway into tabriz he was boxed in there was a central reservation to his left there was a dodge pickup to his right filled with construction labourers there was a cattle lorry to his front there was a lorry with refrigerated cargo behind him he could not go slower he could not go faster no matter that he could not pass the livestock lorry he was not late for his work when he looked into his rear view mirror he saw the motorcyclist that was an excellent way to travel the motorcycle was exactly the right transport for going into the city in the early mornings heavy traffic it was the motorcycle that had been parked on the side of the highway the executioner looked ahead then checked in his sidemirror and he saw that the motorcyclist had pulled out from behind him and was now poised to come alongside him and to pass him coming through the narrow gap between the hillman hunter and the dodge pickup that was freedom to be able to weave in and out of the heavy trucks he saw that the young man on the motorcycle had reached inside his bag that hung across his chest that he steered the motorcycle only with his right hand he was aware of the shape beside him looming close to his wound down window he saw that the motorcycle was virtually against the side of his car he saw the grin on the face of the rider the rider grinning at him and the riders arm was outstretched above the roof of his car he heard the thump of an impact on the roof of his car his window was filled by the grinning face of the rider cold sweat sweat racing on his chest in his groin he could not stop he could not pull over if he braked hard he would be swept away by the refrigeration lorry behind him kilometres an hour and constant it never crossed the executioners mind that he might be the victim of an innocent joke he was reaching for his pistol and he was watching the motorcycle power away ahead of him he flicked off the safety but what could he do he couldnt fire through the windscreen there was a moment when the motorcycle rider the young man in the blue tracksuit seemed to swivel in his seat and wave back at the old hillman hunter and then was gone he no longer saw the motorcyclist only the lorry tail he did not know what to do where to turn to he was staring into the mirror above him and he saw the image of his own eyes so many times he had seen staring jolted fear filled eyes charlie had had to turn one last time to wave and to see that the box was held to the roof of the lowslung yellow car the metal box contained two pounds weight of commercial explosive a detonator and a stopwatch athletics clock wired to explode the detonator and the polaramon gelignite seconds after the control switch had been pulled a ninepound strain magnet locked the tool box to the roof of the hillman hunter he waved he saw the tool box stuck like a carbuncle on the cars roof he twisted the accelerator handle then stamped up through the gears great thrust from the motorcycle taking him speeding past a cattle lorry charlie in those stampeding moments could imagine the stench of fear inside the car the same fear smell as the man would have known when he took the arms of those who had been brought to him he swerved in front of the cattle lorry the explosion blew in from behind him buffeted him the thunder was in his ears the hot wind rushing over his back and the motorcycle speeding forward he took a right turning he was off the main highway he accelerated along a lane and scattered some grazing goats that were feeding on the verge he took another right he careered forward full throttle he was on a track parallel to the main highway two hundred yards from it he glanced to his right and could see above the low flatroofed homes the climbing pall of smoke he went fast and he was whistling at the wind on his face and he was blessing the present that had been given him by mr matthew furniss who was his friend so why hasnt it been given straight to us why are the plods involved there was a sort of democracy inside the investigation division a military type of rank structure had never been part of the lanes style the assistant chief investigating officer showed his patience he did not object to the directness of the challenge that was the way of the id the police are involved david because at this stage of the investigation the death of lucy karnes is still a police matter theyll cock it up park said there was quiet laughter mi the room even a wisp of a smile from parrish who sat beside the acio the whole of april team was in the room and they didnt mind the interruptions from keeper when he wasnt hanging round the edges in the pub when he was at work keeper could be good value and he was good at his job the acio rolled his eyes then we will have to sort out what you regard as an inevitable cock up if and when we gain control of our friend it was one of the working assumptions of the investigation division that its members were superior creatures to policemen the senior officers did little to suppress the boast morale was critical to the esprit de corps for the war against the fat cats and the traffickers and the money bags most men in the id would have put their hands on their hearts and sworn that a policeman just wasnt good enough to be recruited into one of their teams unspoken but at the depths of the resentment of policemen was the pay differential the guys on april and the other teams were civil servants and paid at civil servant rates true there were allowances to boost their takehome but they were poor relations there were plenty of stories of the bungling of the plods customs had targeted the czechborn importer and overseen his arrest following a million seizure the plods had been guarding him when he had escaped out of a police cell customs sitting at heathrow and waiting for a courier to come through with all the surveillance teams ready and poised to follow the trail to lead to the real nasties except that the plods had flown over to paris and picked up the creep there and blown all chances of the arrests that mattered near open warfare the police had suggested they should form an elite squad to tackle drugs customs said the elite squad was already in place the investigation division a squad in which no man had a price which is more than you could say of and so on and so on for us to gain control what has to happen they were on the upper floor of the building no selfrespecting policemen would have tolerated such premises there were cracks in the plaster of the walls there were no decorations other than annual leave charts and duty rosters the lukewarm green carpet was scarred from where it had been heaved up for the new wiring and from the latest shift round of the desk complexes they were all on top of each other the desks and half large enough once the terminals and keyboards had been shoved on to them it was home for the april team and at the end tucked away behind a plywood and glass screen was parrishs corner the acio and parrish sat on a table and shared it with a coffee percolator and dangled their legs right if the whinings over lucy barnes was supplied by darren cole same town small time darren cole names as his dealer a mr leroy winston manvers about whom the courts have not yet been told about whom cedric is a mine of happy information for effect that wasnt needed he held up the printout from the customs and excise reference and information computer a good deep shaft of a mine with a quarter of a million names and room for half a million more cedric was their pride they didnt reckon the plods could hold a prayer to it and bitched every time central drugs intelligence unit at the yard wanted a peep at their material leroy winston manvers aged afrocaribbean origin no legit means of support notting hill gate address a real bad bastard i am not going to read the form to you try and manage that for yourselves what has been agreed by cdiu is that we shall mount a surveillance on the address we hold for manvers while our colleagues of the police will be investigating all background leads associates etc it is however important gentlemen that one point remains high in your minds we will be happy to put manvers inside happier still if we can get a conviction which permits seizure of assets but the principal reason for our involvement at this early stage of an investigation is to move beyond manvers the dealer and into the area of the distributor the identity of the distributor is our headache we want the body who is providing heroin to leroy winston manvers do not doubt that this investigation has a high priority questions why park asked goddammit keeper wash your head out parrish snapped facts of life young man the acio said sharply and dont give me shit about it the facts of life are that the only child of the secretary of state for defence dies from a heroin overdose that secretary of state has a good cry on the home secretarys shoulder that home secretary pulls a load of rank and calls the shots thats why more questions no bill will give you all the details last point i have laid down for you the priority adhere to that priority thank you gentlemen after the acio had left parrish sorted out the initial details of the surveillance that would be mounted from late that morning on a third floor council flat in notting hill gate because he had opened his mouth because he had had too much to say and because he never seemed to care what hours he worked it was pretty well inevitable that park would start the surveillance duty he wasnt complaining and he didnt ring ann to tell her that he didnt know when hed be home he did not ring her because he was not thinking of her he was studying a photograph covertly taken and recent of leroy winston manvers just staring at the photograph and absorbing the features our entire land is now engulfed with the bereavement separation death destruction homelessness corruption and despair brought about by the clerics antihuman rule and catastrophic war the clerics have brought ruination on our people do you know ladies gentlemen that because of the chronic economic situation more than factories in iran have had to shut our oil revenues were the envy of the world but we now find that production is down by more than one half because of the war perhaps you are less interested in the cold figures of economics perhaps you are more interested in the fate of human beings i tell you nevertheless that economics have brought poverty unemployment and starvation to millions of our people but i will tell you about the effect on human beings of this cruel war fought with the cynicism of those clerics while they themselves are safe behind the lines do you know that to continue this thirst for blood the clerics now send children to that front line dont take my word take the word of a newspaper a newspaper wrote sometimes the children wrapped themselves in blankets rolling themselves across the minefield so that fragments of their bodies would not scatter so they could be gathered and taken behind the lines to be raised over heads in coffins ladies and gentlemen have you ever heard anything more obscene that is the regime of the clerics a regime of bankruptcy a regime of blood a regime of callousness when he paused when he mopped perspiration from his forehead he was loudly applauded it surprised him that so many had come to listen to him during a lunch time in the city of london it saddened him that he did not see his brother in that audience he had urged his brother at least marginally to involve himself in the political world of the exiles he could not see his brother he accepted that failure he sipped at a beaker of water at the back of the hall was an iranian student enrolled at a bayswater college and taking a detailed note of all that jamil shabro said in his vilification of the reign of clerics jamil shabro spoke on for twenty minutes when finally he sat down he was warmly applauded and his hand was pumped by wellwishers and he was congratulated for his courage for speaking out against tyranny and that afternoon the student in the english language took his written notes to a mosque in west london in which hung a photograph portrait of the imam and upon production of his islamic republic of iran passport was admitted to an inner office in the outer corridor to the cabinet room after the meeting had broken up the secretary of state for defence made the opportunity for a private word in the home secretarys ear im in washington for a week wont be back until the day before the funeral im going home now pick up my bag then the airport what can i tell libby i have to tell her something it is a police investigation george theyve got it going what do i tell libby the home secretary said softly you can tell her that we have the pusher that we have a good line into the dealer you can tell her that the yard the national drugs intelligence unit and regional crime squads are all involved you may also tell her that one of customs and excises rather useful heroin teams is watching developments in the hope that the dealer will lead us on towards the distributor if one word of this got out george one word i would be severely embarrassed that will be a great comfort to her we cannot shake it off the guilt why didnt we notice things at the start its as if the disintegration of a happy child just passed us by libbys taken it all fearfully i hope to have more positive news by the time you come back the conversation was ended the chancellor and energy and education were spilling from the cabinet room full of good humour at the latest opinion poll which gave government a six point lead and in midterm another meeting finishing another conference table in whitehall left with empty cups and filled ashtrays the weekly session of the joint intelligence committee had broken there had been no politicians present the committee was the purlieu of civil servants and permanent officials had a politician been present then the meeting would have been severely constrained amongst these men there was a feeling that those who were reliant on the voters whim were not altogether to be trusted with the nations fortunes present had been the directors general of the secret intelligence service the security service military intelligence and government communications headquarters foreign and commonwealth officials and in the chair had been a deputy under secretary with the formal title of coordinator of intelligence and security this committee decided what the politicians should see what they should not the coordinator had waved back into his chair the director general from century a barely observable gesture to indicate that he should stay behind after the others had gone to their cars and their bodyguards between ourselves and i didnt want to express this thought in front of the others i had no wish to embarrass you i think youve done rather well the coordinator beamed you were put in to do a job of work at century and id like to say that i reckon youre at grips with the problems there from the prime minister downwards we wanted that place shaken out of its complacency and you are achieving that it would be easier to manipulate a brick wall but were getting there the director general said grimly it was time for fundamental changes in attitude and direction we have agreed to get away from the dinosaur belief that the cold war is still the focus agreed im shifting resources from the east european desks and into all mideast areas theres a measure of resistance do you know furniss doesnt everybody know mattie furniss good fellow the director general was hunched over the table hes a very good man and hes seeing the light iran is critical to our interests thats why ive packed mattie off down to the gulf ive told him what i want have you now the coordinator rolled back in his chair you brought some good stuff to the meeting is that mat ties stuff hes running a new agent keeping the fellow tight under his wing the director general chuckled typical of mattie i tell you what i gave him a good kick up the arse and hes been good as gold since hes running a new agent and hes gone down to the gulf to sort out those that he has in place inside and to breathe some fire into our watchers on the perimeter excellent the iranians believe quite literally they can get away with murder these days i think the pentagon taught the libyans a lesson and we have done the same to the syrians theyre both better mannered now in my opinion its time the iranians were given a short sharp shock of their own why dont you stay and have a bite of lunch here in bahrain mattie had met the carpet merchant from tehran the man brought in foreign exchange and his family were left behind and he had two sons conscripted so he could usually get a visa to fly out and back and in bahrain he had talked with his station officer and he had picked up a tail mattie had flown from bahrain to dubai to see the junior in place there and he had been watched on to the aircraft and watched off it he had dealt with the junior in a bit over four hours given him the pep talk told him to chuck out his university essay style and to get himself down to the docks more often to ingratiate himself more with the shipping fraternity had he taken the road from dubai to abu dhabi had he been driven the hundred miles from dubai to abu dhabi past the cars left to rust in the desert because the oil rich could not be bothered to fix another starter motor or whatever then he might have noticed the tail travelling by air watched through an airport watched out of an airport he did not see the tails and little opportunity here in the gulf for him to lay a trail as an archaeologist he found these communities with their airconditioned hiltons their chilled ice rinks that were proofed against the degree outside temperature their communities of taxavoiding british engineers rather tedious van would be different the urartian ruins would be blissful he lost the tail that he did not know he had picked up in abu dhabi he employed his standard procedures he had checked into the hotel been given a room on the th floor of an architectural monstrosity and then slipped down the fire escape service staircase and out through the work force entrance he had entered the hotel wearing his duncoloured linen suit left it in jeans and a sweatshirt and he sweated hugely as he walked the few hundred paces through the city to the small office that was nominally base for a firm of international marine surveyors in a first floor room the venetian blinds down he met the man who worked in the harbourmasters office in the iranian port of bandar abbas mattie had to hug the man that also was standard procedure he was not fond of overt displays of affection but it was the way of these things that a man who had come secretly by dhow across the waters of the gulf must be hugged like a prodigal returned the man kissed him on both cheeks and mattie could smell the mans last meal it must not concern mattie furniss head of the iran desk that the man had perspired his fear of discovery while lying amongst the nets and hawsers of a dhow that had ferried him from bandar abbas to the wharfs of abu dhabi if the dhow had been hoarded if the man had been discovered by the guards if the man had been taken before a revolutionary court then the man would have been tortured would have screamed for the release of execution and yet mattie must as a prolessional keep himself emotionally aloof they sat down they sipped tea the man listened and mat tie gave him the prepared lecture it is detail that we want hard facts i dont just want to know that a portugese or swedish or cypriot registered ship is coming in to bandar abbas with containers on the deck i can get all that from satellite photography i want the contents of the containers i want the markings on the containers he watched the man saw that his fingers were twitching at the string of beads that he held over his lap if over the years he had become emotionally involved with the man then he would have found these demands well nigh impossible to make there is an international arms embargo on iran no weapons of war are supposed to be shipped into bandar abbas or any other port of entry yet we understand that the iranians are spending million dollars a month on hardware we want your country your regime strangled of arms supplies without the arms supplies the war effort will fail and if the war effort fails then the clerics are gone thats the incentive for you not of course for mattie furniss to share with an agent centurys exasperation at the government of the united states of america who had dispatched tubelaunched opticallytracked wireguided missiles to the clerics along with a planeload of spares for their old f phantoms he could have reeled off the roll of honour of countries shipping arms to iran ussr china uk anything from antiaircraft radar to military explosives italy spain greece north and south korea taiwan pakistan syria libya the czechs the east germans the japanese brazil argentina the netherlands israel portugal belgium even the saudis where a buck was to be made fine we know that they are steadily turning to home produced weaponry but for the moment it is not sophisticated enough for modern warfare and must be backed up by essential spares for items such as strike aircraft thats what we have to know about dont shake your head you can walk on water when you set your mind to it any arms shipment is going to be met with security with military vehicles its going straight through the customs checks no formalities those are the ones that we have to know about those who knew mattie furniss down in the cotswolds the other weekenders in bibury the cocktail set of saturday evenings would have described him as a very straight sort of cove a pretty gentle sort of fellow those who talked to him about footpaths and milk yields and the stock market would have been upended to have known that he would drive a volunteer a very brave spy to suicidal risks and seem to think nothing of it he was a hard man he was a desk head in century the following morning while the official from the harbour masters office was returning to bandar abbas once more secreted in a dhow mattie was watched as he boarded the flight to ankara the capital city of turkey he was missing four front teeth and the rest were yellowed stumps the old mans hair was tangled uncared for his lined face was the colour of a walnut it was a tough life that he lived on the lower slopes of the mountain he ran some hardy goats and some thick coated sheep on the side of the iri dagh mountain and in the shadow of the summit always snow capped that rose to feet above the level of the distant sea on a clear day and in the early morning when the sun was rising behind the mountain it was possible for the old man to look down on to the metropolis of tabriz his glance would be cursory he had no interest in that city he was steeled by the roughness of the ground on which his livestock grazed on which he grew vegetables close to his stonewalled tinroofed home and he was tempered by the sadness of his old age majid nazeri closed the wooden plank door and walked towards the building where the animals wintered and where he stored their fodder he walked like an old soldier he had no part of the present world which was why he was happy to live in this isolation alone with his dogs on the slopes of iri dagh away from tabriz which the regime had made their own he inserted into the padlock the key that hung from a leather thong around his neck there was a cut of pain on his face because the new shoes that he had been bought would take weeks to mould their soles around the misshapen outlines of his feet he was not ungrateful for having been bought the shoes but it would be the next winter before they were comfortable for him the nearest habitation was the village of elehred away over the mountain to the north towards the soviet border he had chosen to spend his last days in a wilderness that housed the free soaring eagles and the ravaging wolf packs and the leopard if he was lucky enough to see it and his body smell were not carried on the stiff winds that never forsook the slopes of iri dagh he had not always been a recluse he had once known how to polish boots he had known how to pour and serve a pink gin with the right measure of bitters and he had been familiar with the formation of a platoon sized unit in attack and he had once stood at attention an arms length from the shah of shahs majid nazeri had risen to sergeant in charlie eshraqs grandfathers regiment and he had been batman to charlies father the day that charlies father had been arrested he had started the journey from tehran to tabriz and then travelled on northwards in search of a place where he could shut out the abomination of what happened on the lower ground beneath him it was two years since the young eshraq the quiet man replacing his memory of a noisy boy had reached his home on iri dagh found him always when charlie came to him and then left him he wondered whether he would see the young man again always when charlie left him after they had exchanged their gruff farewells there was a wet rheum in his old eyes it was of small concern to him that his once keen sight was sliding from him his dogs were his sight and as his eyes faded so also disappeared the hazed outline of the city of tabriz charlie had told him that it was in the city of tabriz in front of the headquarters of the revolutionary guards that miss juliette had been hanged he had no more wish to see the grey outline of the minaret towers of tabriz to majid nazeri his life winnowing away charlie was an angel of revenge to the old soldier loyal servant and batman charlie was the last of a line he had worshipped he pulled open the door of the shed he had old rags in his hand the remnant of an army shirt that had rotted on his back he spent all of that afternoon polishing the petrol tank and the wheel spokes and the engine work of the japanese motorcycle that was charlies the motorcycle did not need i leaning and by the time that charlie had next taken it down the stone track to the road running from ahar into tabriz then it would be filthy and after he had cleaned the motorcycle he checked that the blocks on which it was raised to protect the tyres were firmly in position he never knew never asked when charlie would next be hammering at his door shouting lor admission squeezing the breath out of his old body he picked up the discarded two parts of a blue tracksuit and he took them to the stream beside his house for washing the dusk was closing in he did not have to go to his bed of rugs and furs as soon as the darkness came charlie had brought him kerosene for the lamp hanging off the central beam of his main room he could sit on his wooden chair and long after the night had come to the slopes of iri dagh and the dogs outside had started their chorus to keep away the wolves from the animals stockade he would gaze at his most prized possession he would stare at the gilt framed photograph of the army officer and his foreign wife and their two children the joy of majid nazeris life was charlie eshraqs corning his despair was charlie eshraqs going he had reverted to the clothes of a pasdar he was sleeping towards the back of the mercedes bus several times he was jolted awake by the man sitting next to him because the guards had stopped the bus at a block and were checking papers his own papers were in order like every iranian he carried with him at all times his shenassnameh his recognition papers the recognition papers listed a false name a false date of birth a false record of military service in the guards the papers aroused no suspicion he was unarmed he had nothing to fear from a search of his one small bag he had been wounded in the service of his country he had been home on convalescent leave to the home of his parents in the fine city of tabriz he was returning to tehran where his unit was to be reformed he was greeted with friendship by the guards who searched the bus the bus stopped at a cafe charlie dozed on he had no wish to queue for food he had eaten well at the home of majid nazeri early in the morning to be hungry was to be alert and it was sensible of him to sleep because in the morning the bus would arrive in tehran he had the signature of the mullah on his proposals for action the investigator only proposed the mullah whose signature and office stamp were on the document had been chosen with care by the investigator he knew his man he knew which cleric could be trusted to rise a trout in a waterway in the elborz hills it was late in the night the room in which the investigator worked was without decoration save for the portrait of the imam so different from the office he had occupied when he had been the trusted servant of a plucked peacock no carpet now no drinks cabinet no easy chairs no colour television in the struggles waged amongst the ayatollahs and the mullahs in the twilight months of the imams life the investigator did not believe the dice would fall for those who were described as the pragmatists the realists the moderates he believed that the victors would be men such as the mullah whose signature he had on the two proposals the city was quiet below him he telephoned to the manzarieh camp on the northern outskirts of the capital he waited for the telephone to be answered in the building that was once the hostel of the empress farah university of girls and was now the revolutionary centre of the volunteers for martyrdom she was different but she was the only girl amongst them he had been given short shrift by the boys she wore no makeup and her dark hair was combed away from a centre parting and she had discarded the headscarf that would have been obligatory out on the street and she wore the jeans and the blouse that would have to be covered by a chador i might have been away ok ive been away but that wasnt my decision i was taken away now i am able to make my own choice and that choice is to come back and live my life inside iran they had all been his friends the boys and the girl at the american school the name of the girl was laayya charlie sat on a straightbacked chair and the girl lounged on the wide sofa this was the reception room of the villa of her parents before the revolution there would have been framed photographs of laayyas father about his official business and with minor members of the first family the images of the other life were gone along with the servants and gardeners her parents were taking the last of the snow on the ski slopes above the caspian sea the girl was alone in the villa that was set back from the wide street where the cherry blossom was starting to bloom and she was amused and not frightened as the boys had been i went with my mother to california i loathed it i was sent to london where we have friends i live there but i hate that city too i am iranian and i want to make my life in the country that is my home he had said the same to the boys none of them had wanted to hear him out he had been given little chance to talk in any one of the boys homes before being shown the door but the girl was in no hurry to expel him she had always had more guts than any of the boys in his class now she smiled frankly at him you dont believe me im not a fanatic charlie i dont pray for the eternal life of khomeini i just exist here if anyone tells me that they want to live here when they have the chance to live in california or london then i think that either they are addled in the head or they are lying but you havent thrown me out the madman or the liar the others were fast enough your father was killed and your sister and you talk about coming back as if it were the matter of crossing a street let me tell you why the boys are frightened of you when you left there were of us in the fourth grade the boys that you have been to see and me we are the only ones still living in tehran there are eight in exile and eight have been killed a war doesnt last for ever not for ever a war finishes the imam finishes there is a new country to be built there will be a new iran and that will be my country her eyebrows flickered you believe that it is why i am coming home and then the keenness of the girl and what part in your new order would i play or the boys who rejected you he was thinking that he needed a place to store the weapons that he would carry back on his next journey which would be the last journey that he might need a driver or a minder at his back he said i would want someone who will share my vision she laughed she sounded as though she mocked him you know nothing of iran i know that i want to live out my life in my own country she stood she played the hostess she walked towards the door i am in love with life charlie i too have friends relations who were taken to the evin gaol and to the qezel hesar gaol and to the gohar dasht gaol and i dont wish to follow them nor charlie do i believe a single word not one that you have told me she had been leggy and spindly when he had last seen her he thought that now she was beautiful when i come back i will come here to see you to show you my truth she grimaced and we could go for a drink in the cocktail lounge of the hilton trouble is charlie that the hilton is now the independence hotel oppressed area base three of the mobilisation volunteers of beitolmoqaddar it is now the property of the deprived peoples organisation goodbye charlie it was amusing to see you but not sensible i did not believe you would be afraid there was the first moment of bitterness in her tongue her voice was sharp thats california talk or london talk you insult me you know nothing of my iran you know nothing of my life you come here and you tease me you laugh at me and for whatever reason you also lie to me what would you like me to bring you if you contact me then you put me at risk just tell me what you would like soap she said simply she let him out of the house he thought she was very pretty very sad she closed the door before he had reached the pavement he walked away down the street and his feet trampled the early fall of the cherry blossom the first time he had come to the manzarieh camp in niavaran the statue of lord baden powell chief scout had been at the gate and he had been employed in the secret police of the former monarchy he had been sent to the empress farah university for girls to arrest a student who was believed to be a member of a tudeh cell the hostel for the college girls was now sealed from the outside by heavy coils of barbed wire guarded by troops of the mobilisation of the deprived volunteers separated from the main expanse of open ground by electrified fences and much that was different in the appearance of the investigator and his transport the dark grey suit and the bmw coupe had given way to plain grey trousers and sandals on his feet and a long shirt outside his waist band his cheeks were laced in stubble and he drove a humble renault it was not quite necessary for him to have renounced all of his previous life the savak trappings but the investigator was a cautious man in what had once been the dean of studies office the investigator was made welcome and given tea each time that he came to this room it was to seek advice on the suitability of a candidate for operations overseas it was the responsibility of the director of the revolutionary centre to consider the target the location the method of attack and then to recommend a volunteer the investigator had been many times to manzarieh because the regime was often anxious to exercise the long arm of its discipline against traitors in exile the students at manzarieh were trained in the teachings of the quran the ideology of the imam and close quarters killing prayers at dawn noon and dusk learning the trade of killing for the rest of the day to brief the director he took from his attache case his notebook the imam glowered down from the wall at him he tried never to think about it but he had been at the meeting where the assassination of the imam in exile had been discussed if the investigator had a nightmare in his life it was that a minute of that meeting should have survived a minute with a list of those attending his voice was a forgettable monotone the exile is jamil shabro in spite of warnings telephoned to his home in london he has continued to vilify the imam and the islamic government of iran i will leave with you a resume of his most recent speech it is our suggestion that explosives be used one restive tongue is cut out but a hundred others are silenced by fear the director gazed down at the photograph of jamil shabro london london is so very open to us there is another matter the investigator reached again into his attache case he produced a second file on the outside written large in the investigators hand in the farsi language was a single word which if translated back to the english would have been written as dolphin he saw the high steel gates open and he saw the cars bonnet pushing into the narrow space and he saw the guard who had opened the gate duck his head in respect the width of the street was paces the traffic was solid the mercedes could not nudge into the flow it was as it had been the last time that he had stood on that pavement the building behind him was abandoned its garden was overgrown and the oleander bushes had been allowed to grow wild and provide a screen of evergreen cover he had been in the garden and he had seen the place where he could stand on the wall of the old and demolished conservatory and see over the outer wall of the derelict building the driver of the mercedes hammered at his horn and made space he saw the mullah he saw a man who was still young the face of an academic charlie saw the thin glasses and the sallow face the clean turban and the shoulders of his camel hair cape the mullah sat alone in the back of the long mercedes and charlie noted once more that the car windows distorted the width of the face inside he noted also that the carriage of the mercedes was low over its tyres the mercedes was armourplated along its sides and its windows were of reinforced glass the gates creaked shut the guard was again positioned outside them his rifle slung on his shoulder the mercedes had moved on charlie drifted away he walked for a long time he liked to walk because when he walked he could rehearse what he had learned in the previous hours he had that morning found the investigator he had not seen him but he had discovered his place of work charlie was staying in a small hotel in london it would have been a guest house behind paddington station in tehran it was down an alleyway crowded from dawn and beyond dusk with food stalls and metal craftsmen a well scrubbed little establishment and cheap there was a telephone in the hallway of the hotel all morning he had telephoned different numbers at the ministry of information and intelligence he had been passed from one number to another fifteen calls and always the same question he had asked to be put through to the man fourteen times he had been denied the fifteenth time he had been told to hold he had heard the extension ringing out he had been told that the man was not in his office and he had rung off an hour later more depth disguising his voice he rang again he had said that he had an appointment at the building but had lost the address now he knew the procession passed him students marching goosestepping boy children striding and overstepping uniforms too large women shuffling their feet under the full flow of their chadors the widows of the war men carrying buckets and money being thrown from the pavement into the buckets screwed up bank notes portraits of the imam carried high the streets filled with the shouting of the slogans charlie put some notes into the bucket when it reached him not to have contributed would have attracted attention he found a taxi an age it took to wind through the clogged streets through the drab and smogblanketed mass of the city he would never be at ease in the south of tehran it was the shrine of the imam the working class ghetto of those who shouted loudest lor the war for the death of their enemies south tehran was the bedrock of the revolution he kept his peace in the taxi until he was dropped he stood outside the main entrance to the beheshtizahra cemetary it was a pilgrimage for charlie eshraq each time he came to tehran he came to the cemetery he had to wait at the gate as a line of taxis drove through there was a coffin on the roof of each taxi martyrs were being brought back from the front line with a horde of family mourners alongside them for an escort he followed for hundreds of yards charlie walked amongst the graves a rippling sea of flags small wooden and glassfronted box shapes on stilts in which were placed photographs of the dead he saw a bulldozer excavating the yellow earth from a pit the size of a swimming pool waiting for the dead from the next battle he saw the raven women and old men and small children threading between the death markers he hurried on his countrys youth was laid to rest here amidst the keening cries of women the drone of the bulldozer and the coughing of old taxi engines the gateway to heaven cemetary and there was a queue to get there deep inside the gateway was the fountain of blood the water spouting from the fountain ran red charlie thought that was sick he thought it was as sick to colour the cemetery fountain water as it was to issue young soldiers going to the front with plastic keys made in taiwan so that if they were killed in battle they could get through the gates make it to paradise on his first journey here he had given a bribe to a clerk in the administration office a hundred dollars in small notes and that had produced the burial charts the names against the numbers he could not forget the way to this outer plot far beyond the flags and the stilted boxes and their photographs were the bare concrete slabs on which while they were still wet a number had been scratched he would not forget the number of his fathers grave his father had said that a professional soldier a soldier who foreswore politics had nothing to fear from the revolution and his father lay in a grave marked only by a scratched number he had no idea where his sister was buried or his uncle who had been clubbed butchered shot on the roof of the refah school where the imam had made his first headquarters after his return from exile this was the only grave that he knew of and each time in tehran he was drawn to it mattie furniss could not abide sloppiness it bred complacency and complacency was fatal to field operatives he was not good at delivering an oldfashioned dressing down but he felt it time to let the ankara station officer know that he was quite dissatisfied with what he had seen the ankara station was not located in the embassy building the service had several years before taken a long lease on the third floor of an office building in the government sector of the turkish capital where the highrise blocks seem to stretch without end the cover of the office was that the service staff working there were employees of a british firm of structural engineers they had an hour before an appointment at the turkish national intelligence agency the only occasion on this trip when mattie went official an hour and he intended to use it well dont interrupt me terence thats a good fellow and do not imagine for a single moment that i get pleasure from what i am about to tell you its the oldest scenario in the book a chap gets abroad and all that hes absorbed when he was on courses at home goes out of the window well start at the beginning the car that picked me up and brought me here the driver he was not alert we were cut up by a car full of men and your driver just sat there never considered the prospect of kidnapping of having to take evasive action your driver was dead from the neck up it is the third time i have been to this office and each time your driver has taken the same route your car is not fitted with a rearseat passenger mirror as it should be your driver came into the hotel this morning to wait at reception for me and when he had met me taken me out to the vehicle he made no effort to check for an ied mr furniss this is turkey not beirut we dont have improvised explosive devices on every street corner hear me out terence your car is not armourplated your tyres are not run flats and i would hazard a guess that the petrol tank is not selfsealing the station officer said run flat tyres cost three thousand pounds each mr furniss i dont have a budget for that sort of carry on i will take it up with london this room has been furnished by someone who has ignored every precaution in the book windows without the blinds drawn anyone from that building that one over there can see you inside could shoot you that painting is that shatterproof glass an elegant cocktail cabinet but glassfronted has no one told you that glass splinters and flies when explosives are detonated this is not a highrisk posting mr furniss neither is athens nor is brussels we were scraping chaps off the walls there who a few moments before would have happily said those cities were not highrisk ill get them fixed sir very wise now id like to turn to matters iranian mattie furniss set out in detail the kind of information he would be requiring in future from the station officer on the iranian theatre he painted a picture that filled the young and fast promoted terence snow with bleak despair he required minutely recorded and frequent debriefs of iranian refugees who had successfully legged it through the mountains and the river gorges past the patrols and into northeast turkey he had no use for the opiate dreaming of the exiles in istanbul he wanted fresh raw intelligence they walked down the staircase together mattie said that the next morning he planned to head off towards the world war one battlefield at gallipoli he said that his father had been there a gunner never talked much about it and then his voice lit up and he said that they would follow that visit with a couple of days pottering amongst the excavated ruins of troy did terence know that all of the finest examples of trojan jewellery had been lodged in the berlin museum and then pillaged by the soviets in no he did not and then i think well go up to van together good grief three days nonstop tutorial terences spirits sank ill enjoy that mr furniss the council flat was home to leroy winston manvers and his wife and his four children the door was sledgehammered off its hinges and the wind brought the rain in from the walkway outside it was three in the morning and the dog had failed the dog was a decent enough looking spaniel and the handler was quite a goodlooking girl a bit butch in her dark slacks and the tightness of her navy regulation sweater park hadnt noticed her great while the dog was still searching the dog had kept the adrenalin moving for them all but the dog had failed and was sitting quietly at the feet of the handler and all the rest of the team were looking at park because he was the case officer and the decisions were his couldnt talk in the living room leroy had the sofa with the children in blankets beside him and his wife hugging her knees in the only other easy chair park was in the corridor standing over the dog and the team were milling around him still hanging on to the pickaxe handles and the sledgehammers that had taken the door off what they called the keys pretty calm leroy looked to park vest and underpants hair dreadlocked and the composure that keeper could best have wiped with a pickaxe handle parrish was there but out on the walkway aprils team leader was taking a side seat leaving the tactics to the case officer keeper did not believe that the stuff was not there the flat had been under hour surveillance for a full week the flat had had the works check on all movements and photographic record each pusher visit logged each movement out by leroy tailed each meeting listed eighteen hours a bloody day keeper had done in one or other of the surveillance vans he could have kicked the tail off the dog because the stuff had to be there are you sure a venom when he spoke to the handler like it was her fault not me dearie im not sure the handler said and shes not saying theres nothing there shes just saying she cant find anything thats different to being sure its clean the straight search had already been done leroy and family in the main bedroom while the living room and the kitchen and the kids rooms were gone over leroy and family in the living room while the bathroom and the main bedroom were gone over all the beds stripped drawers out cupboards opened everything gone through but that shouldnt have been necessary because the dog should have led them to it what to do to start again to begin from the front door again the two constables were watching him customs had their own search warrants and their writs of assistance that meant they could do just about anything short of shoving a broom handle up leroys backside but they were obliged to lake the constables with them supercilious creatures both of them they were armed the april team were not the constables were there to see there was no breach of the peace that april didnt get shot up he could pack it in he could take parrish into the kitchen and he could tell him that in his humble opinion leroy winston manvers just happened to be clean and they could all go home to bed it didnt cross davids mind that he should do any such thing back at the lane they had a photographic record of the nine known smalltime pushers visiting manvers within the last seven days no way the place was clean take the place apart he said he showed them how down on his hands and knees in the hall both hands on the carpet and the carpet ripping off the holding tacks crowbar between the floor boards and the scream of the nails being prised up and the boards splintering parrish in the doorway looked away like he was contemplating a cash register of claims for compensation if the search didnt turn something up plus racial harassment and the rest of the book all coming his way but he didnt intervene the sounds of a demolition job inside the flat one of the team watched leroy every moment watched his face tried to read apprehension tried to find a clue from his face as to whether the search was warming and not just lifting boards there was the shout a coarse whoop of celebration and duggie williams codename harlech was lifting out from under the kitchen floor an insulated picnic box the top came off there were at least a dozen cold bags and there were the packets at the bottom the dog handler said its not her fault dearie dont go blaming her ive always told you that she cant cope with frozen stuff by the time they had finished and sealed the flat and taken leroy off down to the lane and dumped his wife and kids on the councils night duty housing officer going home didnt seem worth it to park the last two nights shed left the spare bed made up for him not worth going home anyway because he wanted to be up early and talking with leroy winston manvers bill parrish always went home whatever time he finished whatever time he had to start again he went home for a snuggle with his wife a clean shirt and a cooked breakfast park reckoned he couldnt have been in his house above an hour he would have taken the early train from charing cross down into kent walked from the station to his modern estate semidetached had his snuggle and his shirt change and his shave and his breakfast and walked back to the station to be amongst the first of the mornings commuters back to charing cross david had changed his shirt in the gents and he had shaved he had gone without breakfast and he hadnt thought about ann and he hadnt slept he lolled back in his chair he didnt stand when parrish came in reeking of aftershave lotion the clerical assistants wouldnt be in for another half an hour and the rest of april would come straggling back to the lane over the next two hours parrish wasnt fussed that his keeper didnt stand for him customs and excise had their own esprit de corps and it wasnt based on a military or a police force discipline he saw that the coffee percolator was bubbling gently and he rinsed out his own mug that was still on the tray beside the coffee machine tidelined from the briefing before they had gone out to bust leroy winston manvers been to see leroy n o whats in the other cells nothing empty better not let him sleep too long wouldnt have been worth coming in early if he had not been able to guarantee that keeper would be sitting back in his chair at his desk in the april office youve told the acio weve got him certainly hes impatient a result is what matters very much david a result matters hes got the cio on his back the cio has cdiu standing over his shoulder the cdiu is under pressure from the politician they want to hear what leroy has to say and they want it in a hurry and im covered keeper asked like it never happened it went against parrishs grain to parrish years in customs and excise years in the investigation division it was out of order for an investigation to take priority because of connections but he was a part of a system he was a cog he didnt argue then wed better get on with it keeper led him down the stairs didnt use the lift because the lift would be getting busy with the early risers coming to work all the squeamish ones would be in early the secretaries and the accountants and those from the value added tax sinecures and the computer boffins didnt want to see them down the stairs to the basement of the new fetter lane building they came to the reinforced door of the lanes cell block park pressed the bell and stood aside for parrish to come forward a short chat parrish would be taking charge of the prisoner the guard could go and take a cup of tea and some pieces of toast in the canteen and have a cigarette and chat up the girls there and not hurry himself the guard looked from parrish to park and saw the expression on parks face and said that he would be pretty happy to have a cup of tea and some toast park went inside the cell parrish leaned against the wall in the corridor and thought that he might throw up his cooked breakfast the dealer wasnt that often on his feet before midday and he had made the mistake of sleeping naked he came warily off the cell bed when park tore the blankets away from him my lawyer the man said well deal with him next you first with a short left arm punch park hit leroy winston manvers in the pit of his stomach the mans body bent and as it uncoiled the man gasping for breath parks knee jerked into leroy winston manvers groin the man collapsed folding himself into and over the pain park pulled him upright by his hair one violent heave and then very calmly punched him again and again all the blows were to the body those parts of the body that were hard to bruise except for the testicles the punches belted into the flab body of the big man when he was on the tiled cell floor when he was whimpering when he thought his body would break in the pain then the questions came through the running pain leroy winston manvers could hear the question who is the chummie he could hear the question but before he could focus on it he was once more flung upright crashed into the corner bent protecting his groin you supplied darren cole what is the name of the chummie who supplied you and his eyes were filled with streaming tears and he could hardly breathe and he thought that if he didnt kill this fucker then he was going to be dead and he threw a flailing blind hook with his right fist and a huge explosion of pain landed and blossomed in his guts and his head struck the floor and the voice came to him again the same as before the chummie that supplies you who is he hes charlie park stood back he was sweating he stared down at the demolished man on the cell floor im listening leroy the voice was whispered wheezed i know him as charlie charlie persia the stuff is from iran keep rolling leroy hes from london charlie persia but he goes to get it himself and he is iranian but he lives here what age your age less maybe ah jesus man it was a minute since he had been hit another fear winnowing in the mind of leroy winston manvers you get me killed thats ok leroy youre quite safe here charliell be dead long before you get out of here dont you tell that i grassed the dealer crawled to the bunk against the cell wall and he lifted himself on to it and his back was to park he said nothing more the guard was hovering by the door to the cell block corridor park told him that the prisoner was tired and should be allowed a good sleep park took the lift up to the april office with parrish whitefaced beside him his fist locked on the notebook the lights were on the girls were at the keyboards and answering telephones and harlech in his shirtsleeves was massaging the shoulders of the redhead as she worked go home now keeper just go off home parrish said hiss pasdar uniform was folded into charlies rucksack he had travelled by bus from tehran to qazvin from qazvin after a long wait under the plane trees of the sabzimeidan he had joined another bus heading for resht on the caspian sea he got off by the river near manjil and had hitched his way along the track beside the fiercely running water he had no fear his papers were good as they ought to have been at the price he had paid for them in istanbul he had a ride from a local official on the pillion of an ancient usa for fifteen painful miles and he had been thankful to have been able to spend two hours mostly asleep in a donkey cart he had reached the village shortly before noon the stone dwellings too few too insignificant to be marked on any map of the region nestled at the base of hills and alongside the river once every decade on average when the spring came following a particularly heavy snowfall in the mountains the river would overspill and leave a deposit of loam soil across the washed down fields the plain beside the village was an excellent area for all crops because of its isolation and because of the quality of the fields beside it the village was a place of quite startling prosperity there was no outward sign of that wealth the american dollars and the iranian rials that the headman had accumulated he kept buried it was his persistent fear that the village would one day attract attention that the wealth of his community would be discovered and that he would be taken by the guards to qazvin and put to death in the yard of the ali qapu charlie had never been able to prise from the headman how he planned to use the cash that he risked his life to amass he had eaten with the headman and the headmans sons and brothers they had slaughtered and roasted a goat in his honour he sat now on the carpet that covered the dirt floor of the principal room of the headmans house they would be good shia moslems in the village they would follow the teaching of the quran he looked for the fault in the pattern the mistake of the craftsman weaver there was always a mistake in even the most precious carpet only god could make what was perfect for a human creature to attempt perfection to try to imitate god was heresy he could see no flaw he had eaten too much he had allowed the rich meat of the goat to blunt his wits in the evening he would need to be at his sharpest he would negotiate with the headman then the village was condemned to sleep for the afternoon the sun belted into the tin roofs of the houses and scorched the alleys between there was a corner of the room where he had been told to leave his rucksack and where blankets had been laid out he stood in the doorway of the headmans house and gazed out towards the grey brown of the flowing river across the rich fields over the shimmering scarlet of the poppies in flower the packets taken from the picnic cold box in leroy winston manvers council flat had been sent to the scotland yard forensic laboratory in lambeth for analysis and with the packets had gone the instruction of the acio that absolute priority was to be attached to the first if superficial study there were only scientists at lambeth who specialized in drugsrelated investigations and their backlog was soaring a cocaine possession charge had just a month earlier been thrown out by an inner city magistrate after he had been told at five remand hearings that forensic had not yet come through with its results simple analysis was now subject to a nine week delay so the acio had demanded that all else be dropped this was a matter for the best and the brightest he could do that once in a while heaven help him if he made a habit of it when he was bawling down a phone line when he was trying to extract blood from men and women already drained dry it was inevitable that the acio would ask himself whether they were all all of them at the lane wasting their bloody time was government parliament authority really serious when they confronted the drugs epidemic with just scientists buggered if he knew whether they were serious buggered if he cared he was long enough in customs and excise to realise the absurdity of getting steamed under the collar about resources in the last week he had been up before the national audit office to justify the way he ran the drugs teams and the week before that he had had to defend a paper to the staff inspection and evaluation board he had talked to bill parrish he knew what had happened in the cell early in the morning after the door had closed behind his case officer typical of parrish that he had gone straight into the acios office and shared the dirt spread the load up the ladder so that if the shit was flying then it would be the acio fielding it and not dear old bill when he was alone in his office when he was not spitting about the delays in forensic analysis and the scrutiny of the national audit office and the nitpick ways of the staff inspection and evaluation board the acio could understand the way the system worked the system was pretty bloody rotten the system said that if a cabinet ministers daughter took an overdose because she didnt know that the heroin was of a purer quality than she was used to then her disgusting self inflicted death took priority over the very similar deaths of the ordinary and the humble it was a surprise to him that young men like park ever chose to get themselves involved or stay involved and he thanked the good lord that they did the acio had his preliminary report brought over the river by courier just as his secretary was bringing him his afternoon pot of tea and a buttered scone he read initial study showed that the probable origin of the packets total weight at kilos and grammes was northern iran attention was drawn to a stencilled marking on each plastic packet a small symbol of a dagger the symbol had been observed on other hauls over the past six years the quality of heroin in packets stamped with the symbol of the curved blade dagger was invariably high he rang parrishs office on the floor below dont you worry love just leave him to me park pushed himself up from his chair the front door was already open ann was putting the key back into her handbag her head was down and his father was standing behind her he was all puffed up chest out back straight as if he was going on duty maybe he was because he wore his navy blue trousers and a white shirt and black tie and his old anorak in which he was always dressed when he was either on his way to the station or when he had just clocked off his father was a big man and park reckoned that because he sat all day either in a panda or in the station canteen he had a gut on him since his father was a policeman david had gone into customs and excise a sort of bloodymindedness and he had had a bellyful as a kid of hearing his father moaning about the force he led them into the living room and closed the file that he had been reading inside the room he could see clearly into anns face she was redeyed his lip pursed she had no business taking their marriage into his parents home and crying in front of them very nice to see you dad mum well is she i was catching up on a bit of reading we had a late night up in town and they sent us all back with a day off its freezing in here ann strode forward snapped on both bars of the electric fire he paid the electricity bill the last bill had been he remembered that he had had to pay the electricity in the same week as the telephone that had been and the car service that had been he had gone overdrawn he looked steadily at his father as i said i was catching up on a bit of reading im doing a paper for the acio what i really want is to get out of heroin and join a team who do cocaine this paper is to persuade the acio to put a man into bogota he wondered if his father knew where bogota was bogota is the capital of colombia dad weve got a drugs liaison officer in caracas which is the capital of venezuela but i reckon that caracas is too far from the action we need much more hard intelligence on the ground colombia exports of the worlds cocaine i rate heroin as peaked but i ocaine is really growing up i mean last years heroin figures were just about the same as the previous year but cocaine was going through the roof there could have been half a billion pounds worth going through the uk system last year do you know theres a place called medellin in colombia where the big traffickers live quite openly weve got to get in there after them having a dlo in caracas means that too much of our intelligence is secondhand do you know dad that last year the drugs enforcement agency made a seizure in florida of ten tons of coke thats worth fifty million dollars on the street thats where the action is what do you think dad what i think is that youre getting to be the biggest bore ive ever met thats not called for and the biggest prick then get out of my house im here at anns invitation and im staying until ive done some talking a flush was in his fathers face big veins leaping in his neck and his forehead is that all you do when you get home bore on about drugs it matters do you think ann cares two pins about drugs shes made her feelings plain theres nothing else in your life its getting to be an obsession what do you want me to do chat up bloody geraniums in a bloody greenhouse look after your wife try that for a change dont lecture me on how to look after ann if someone doesnt have a go at you you wont have a marriage to worry about you dont deserve ann youre out of order not as out of order as the way you treat your wife he exploded something you never learned dad but if you dont do a job with commitment then its not worth doing at all in id we dont just clock watch were in the front line were not just handing out parking tickets and checking shotgun licences and taking down the details of peoples bloody cats that have got lost were in the front fucking line if we all go home when the bell rings then theres no line left and all that filth is swimming in here got me have you the wit to comprehend that you know what i did this morning when you were watering your bloody geraniums before another second rate day what i did while she was painting her face before getting into her posh little office you know what i did i beat shit out of a man i hit leroy winston man vers every place where the bruises dont show i kicked him punched him till i was fucking tired until he gave me a name isnt that what you old fashioned coppers used to do hand out a bit of a belting in the good old days i smashed up leroy winston manvers because hes a heroin dealer and he fixed up the pusher and the pusher sold to some government crap artists daughter i hit shit out of leroy winston manvers because i hated him i hated him as much as i wanted the name of his distributor thats what it does to you thats the fucking filth you get into when youre hunting the distributors you dont have an idea do you not a fucking idea i could go to gaol for five years for what i did this morning i tell you i enjoyed hitting the black bastard i loved hitting him you know what he gave me the name he was such filth hes a pig he makes more money in one month probably than i can make in ten years hes a rat from a sewer they dont ask you to do that do they dad they dont ask an old fashioned constable to be case officer when were talking heroin do they dad like you said david out of order his father stood ann said im sorry pop for asking you i cant walk away from it david said you can follow me if you want to if you dont want to then i go on by myself thats fair warning you do what you like im not quitting do you want to come with me love david saw his wife shake her head she was muttering on about getting some supper and she was gone out of the room and heading for the kitchen we love that girl david your mother and i we love her like shes ours i dont hold that against you dad im glad of it but dont turn her against me theres enough to contend with without that its a war were in do you see that goddammit a war but his fathers face was set astonishment fear disgust and then he was gone it was a game to them he thought at the end he would get what he wanted and they would concede he played the game he even rose off the carpet and walked out of the house and into the dirt street stood in the moonlight and listened to the dogs yelping and the distant wolf howl all part of a game because they were all tired and looking for sleep then they would give him the whole of the seventh kilo they could have taken charlies money and put him down an old well or dug him into a field the thought was in charlies mind but not uppermost he reckoned on their greed he believed the squirrel mentality of the headman preserved him they would want him back it was his protection that the headman had no notion that this was charlies last shipment late in the evening the headmans hand snaked out grasped charlies hand charlie reckoned that the headman was tired or that he wanted his wife and bed the strong dry hand caught charlies held it shook it sealed the bargain a game was at an end the cash was in wads of fifty notes fastened with elastic bands charlie fetched the rucksack and put the ten bundles carefully on to the carpet in front of him he sat cross legged that was awkward to him and his back ached from the stretching of muscles that were unused when his hand was shaken then he knew that his safety was guaranteed never in much doubt but that was certainty charlie left the village before dawn in his rucksack were seven kilos weight of pure heroin powder in sealed plastic bags and on the bags was the stamp of the drugs pedigree he had watched them stencil on to the plastic the symbol of the curved dagger that early in the morning there was no cart to carry him alongside the river he strode out on the dirt trail this was the currency that would buy him armourpiercing missiles he was in a hell of a good humour and whistling to himself and he was alone in the mountains of his homeland keeper restless fretting pacing the ragged and worn carpet in aprils office he was a bloody pain and even parrish didnt have the spirit to tell him that to his face and harlech who was the nearest that park had to a friend just cursed him and stayed quiet charlie persia the great silent stomach of the computer had no entry on charlie persia nothing under the name and nothing like it from the scores hundreds of cross referenced suspicious movements reports that were daily fed into cedrics system it was keepers opinion that leroy winston manvers had come clean in his pain had told all charlie persia was the name that the distributor traded under he believed that the face and the gasping admissions of leroy winston manvers had a truth about them he knew from forensics analysis that the packets found in the notting hill council flat were of iranian origin he took as his base position that charlie persia was iranian had carried the good hard stuff to london he waited on a phone call to take him forward now that the computer had come up blank he needed a break he needed luck and he was pacing because his phone call had not been returned and because he did not know where else the break would come from it had been luck that had heaved park out of uniform at heathrow airport and into the id on the lane he would never have argued with that he had spotted the girl coming off the varig from rio and she looked like a towrope and her accent was an east london slur and her clothes werent good enough for a return ticket to rio and she had been the only passenger he had stopped all that morning off the overnight intercontinentals she had had an airline ticket and for couriering a kilo of cocaine fastened in a sanitary towel between her legs that was a break that was noticed luck was different luck could only be taken advantage of a slack half hour between the clearing of the customs hall and the arrival of the next jumbo and he had gone out into the concourse to get himself an afternoon paper and he had seen the man waiting at the barrier in position to meet a passenger off the incoming flight at heathrow they had the police mugshots of all convicted pushers and dealers not everyone looked at them but the young david park had made a point of studying them every week he recognised the face eighteen months at isleworth court and he could only have been out a few weeks that was luck recognising the chummie he had tipped off the local id based at the airport the greeter had been watched the meeting had been observed the passenger had been challenged and asked to return to the customs area a few grammes more than a kilo stuffed into the cavities in a pair of platform shoes and back to isleworth court for the greeter and seven years for the courier luck but there were those in the id command who said that a man earned his luck and his luck had been noticed noticed enough for his application to join the investigation division to be processed at speed when the telephone on his desk rang out park was at the far end of the room and he charged for it god and he needed the break and the luck when cedric had gone down on him ann would he be in for supper he didnt know should she cook for two probably best not did he know what time he would be home could she clear the line he was waiting on a call he pounded on over the carpet the carpet was a disgrace and so were the blinds that sagged unevenly across the windows and so was the crack on the upper wall behind his desk that had been there for a year and not repaired without luck he was going to stay grounded the telephone call when it came left him flattened the antiterrorist branch at scotland yard had the most complete records on iranians living in london a chief inspector told him that they had no record of any exile who went under the name of charlie persia sorry not to be of help the folder on his desk contained a single typed sheet which was the preliminary report from forensic another sheet was his own handwritten record of the interview with leroy winston manvers he was certain that his man took the name of charlie he thought the man was most probably an iranian he had written tango one on the outside of the folder tango was ids word for a targeted suspect for the moment he was damned if he knew how he would put a face into the tango one folder the investigator worked iate into the evening he had no family he had no call to go back to the cramped onebedroomed flat that had been his home since his former life beneath his window the tehran streets had emptied the recruit from manzarieh park would be flying out in the morning that part was simple but the arrangement of the detail of the collections that he would make upon his arrival and the backup that he would receive on the ground all of that required care it was of course his intention that no smoking pistol would remain behind he was working at long range and great distances always posed problems when he had finished with the matter of jamil shabro traitor and collaborationist he switched his attention to the business of the british intelligence officer dolphinmatthew furniss in the city of van he had on his desk all the sightings marking furniss progress across turkey just as he had them for his journey around the gulf the man came like a lamb to him to within reach as the crow flies the ebony scavenging crow the city of van was sixty miles from the nearest crossing point into iranian territory the watch on furniss had been kept to a bare minimum he had been shadowed from airport to hotel from hotel to airport away from his hotel in between his flights he had been free of his tail that was of no matter to the investigator not at this moment he worked late because early in the morning he would fly to tabriz to put in place the final pieces of a mosaic of which he was proud the fascinating thing about this region terence is that it was never touched by the european civilizations here what you have are the unadulterated remnants of the hittites and the urartians and the armenians as far as the station officer from ankara was concerned van was one of the most forgettable cities it had been his misfortune to visit his eyes streamed and he had an aggravating catarrh from the street dust thrown up by the traffic to terence snow van was quite stunningly ordinary its all lying around here to be picked up get a spade dig in the right place and youll find the artefacts of old sarduri king here in ninth century bc fascinating the station officers chief preoccupation was how to attract the attention of a taxi that would stop where they stood a hundred yards down the street from the hotel where the orderly tourists waited in line and his second anxiety was how he was going to extricate himself altogether from this cultural excursion and get back to ankara do you know terence that within half an hours drive of here there are cave paintings made years ago i cherish that sort of knowledge i believe it gives a man a sense of his own mortality which is absolutely healthy yes sir the morale of the station officer had been on the wane almost since their flight out of ankara had been airborne they had flown over the huge bleak wilderness of the interior never mind the history he reckoned that van was a quarter of an hour beyond the outside rim of civilization ancient or modern no car at the airport though it had been booked from ankara no rooms for them at the akdamar hotel booked and confirmed by telephone true he had the car now and he had two singles in the akdamar but they had taken sweat and fury and the last iota of his patience when he was back in ankara hed dine out on the baroque excrescence where they had laid their heads in their first night in the city warmly commended by the hall porter in the akdamar but unlisted by any of the guide books no hot water no breakfast no toilet paper and these people thought they were ready to sign on for the european economic community what really pissed him off was the certainty that his desk head was completely at ease in this godforsaken town he was angry just being there he was frustrated by his inability to wave down a taxi he was careless he was playing host to the man from london and he was not running his checks he had not seen the man who had followed them from the hotel steps and who now lounged against a wall behind them have you ever bought jet here terence its really quite excellent you can alter the stones make a very pleasant necklace with the local stuff the station officers wife might well have thrown him out of their flat if he had come home to her with a peace offering of van jet he smiled he couldnt help liking mattie everyone in the service liked the man but christ you had to wonder whether he wasnt just a wee bit soft in the head no sir i never have they had spent two days talking to refugees from iran the station officer would have had to hand it to mattie that the old blighter was ever so casual ever so easy in his approaches and he had them eating from his hand as he milked them the station officer appreciated that the talk was for his benefit that he was being shown what was expected of him in the future the desk head had been talking about him coming up to van or hakkari or dogubeyezit at least once a month henceforward to where the refugees crossed the station officer wasnt good with the refugees frankly they embarrassed him they were young they were still in shock they were exhausted from their hike across the mountains and from the long nights of fear from the iranian and the turkish military patrols bloody unpleasant as it was the station officer would have to admit that the turkish authorities had no choice but to police their frontier and turn back those trying to cross out of iran they had three quarters of a million iranians draft dodgers and riffraff settled in their country they had problems of gang crime and heroin trafficking from the refugees they had every right to turn the refugees round and send them back whence they came bit bloody stark though when he thought of the young exhausted faces he had seen these past two days thats our boy mattie the taxi had swerved over to them from afar there was a chorus of protest reaching out from in front of the hotel mattie didnt seem to hear they went fast the station officer damn near cracked his head open on the taxis roof when they flew over the potholes they skirted the huge inland sea of lake van azure blue with a ferry boat on it making a postcard and they rattled north through caldiran and on to the dogubeyezit road and the surface worse and the driver not attempting evasive action the station officer was rubbing his forehead and saw that mattie had his eyes closed as if he were catnapping he lit a cigarette he thought he understood why mattie furniss was a desk head and why he had no enemies in century they were on their way to meet a field agent a man from inside a guy who was taking one hell of a risk to travel outside and mattie had his eyes closed and was beginning to snore the station officer reckoned that was true class he had been fussing about a taxi and mattie hadnt given a damn because he would have believed that a field agent who had crossed out of iran wasnt going to be going home when his contact was a quarter of an hour late he was being given a lesson in how to soak up the punishment of getting to the sharp end and meeting up with agents whose necks were on the line sit back and let it happen and dont bother if you start to snore well done mattie he checked behind no tail should have done it earlier should have checked when he was still hot from not being able to find a taxi he could see a long way back down the road and the road was clear after two days with his desk head he could have drafted a tourist pamphlet on vans history he knew that xenophon had led his ten thousand in battle at van that alexander had been there and pompey and the mongols of tamerlane that van had not come into the ottoman empire until sultan selim the grim had done the necessary butchering in ad he wondered if in years time he would be able to sleep in the back of a taxi on the way to brief a field agent and seem as antediluvian to a young station officer when mattie started awake and looked around him and had his bearings and had apologised with a shrug as if it were rude to sleep then the station officer invented an important meeting in ankara the next day and asked whether it would be alright for him to catch the morning flight no problem he hadnt the spunk to tell mattie outright that it was his wifes birthday and that they were throwing a thrash for her at his flat they stopped the taxi at the front of the coffee shop there was a repair yard at the back and a shed of rusted corrugated iron the yard was a cemetery for disabled vehicles some cannibalised all defunct the station officer saw the lorry with iranian registration plates it was a good place for a meeting any longdistance iranian driver might have cause to stop at the yard he thought the agent must be an old friend of matties the station officer stood back and watched the beaming welocome of the man who pumped matties hand and then held his arm the station officer had joined the service straight from cambridge he was well thought of and young for the ankara post but by now he thought that he knew nothing he saw a field man take hold of a desk heads arm and cling to it as if matties arm were a talisman of safety he saw the controlled affection in the way mattie tapped with the palm of his hand at the knuckle of his agent the close gesture of warmth he could not have told his wife but the station officer fancied that if he ever faced a crisis of his own then he could be certain of mattie furniss support he had no agents of his own behind lines he was an analyst he had men in place inherited of course in the ministry of the interior and the army and the jandarma and the ministry of foreign affairs but that was in ankara not behind the lines and in iran mattie had his arm around the agents shoulder and he was walking him round the lorry out of sight from the road and from the mechanics who laboured in the shed with their oxyacetylene cutters he knew nothing he would not have known of the perpetual grey fog fear that blanketed a field agent and he would not have known of the kind strength that was given the field agent by his controller he was not included he was left for an hour to kick his heels he was sitting on an old upturned oil drum when mattie came back to him did you get all you wanted sir stiffened his backbone told him what we need usual carrot and stick job your meeting in ankara tomorrow wont go on too long i hope shouldnt think so sir dont want it to interfere with your party mattie was walking away and the station officer had seen the dry vestige of the smile the bus churned through the miles as the road climbed towards zanjan through the dusted window charlie could see the small oases surrounded by poplar trees and the mud brick villages on either side of the route it had been night when he had travelled from tabriz to tehran but high sunshine now and he could see into the spreading distance there was no heat haze the altitude of the road was too great for mists he was looking south of the road he wanted to see the ruins that when he was still a child mr furniss had first told him about the mausoleum of sultan oljaitukhocabandeh in the sprawl of ruins near soltanieh charlie eight years old and meeting the friend of his father at their villa mr furniss always had good stories to tell the boy the mausoleum of sultan oljaitukhocabandeh had stayed in charlies mind a man a sultan of the mongols had died years before and he had sought immortality and his resting place was a monument that reached feet above the ground that was the ultimate folly there would be no photographs of charlie eshraq ever raised on a wall none of his sayings ever daubed on high banners when he died whenever charlie wanted a grave like his fathers a corner of a cemetery with a number scratched into the wet cement slab and weeds at the edge he thought that made him his own man when they passed it the mausoleum was clear from the windows of the coach and charlie wiped hard at the window although most of the dirt was on the outside of the tinted glass he saw the great octagon shape of the building and the cupola dome he saw the goats grazing at its base the sight of the mausoleum was only of a few seconds no other passenger on the bus bothered to look at it he thought that he hated men who built mausoleums to their memory and who had their photographs overlooking public squares and who demanded that their sayings be scrawled on banners the hate was active in his heart but did not show on his face he appeared relaxed dozing he was leaning on his rucksack on the seat next to him he had no fear that the rucksack of a pasdar would be searched at a road block he had the correct papers the guards would be friendly to a pasdar returning to tabriz they would not search him he hated the men who built mausoleums and despised them he remembered what mr furniss had said to him when he was eight years old a man who is afraid of death dear boy does not have the courage to live in the car taking him from the airport to the guards corps headquarters in tabriz the investigator listened to the radio the pasdaran operating from speedboats had rocketed a singapore flagged tanker en route to kuwait and crippled it many soldiers had been martyred after the iraqi enemy had once again dropped mustard gas on their trenches and of course there had been no condemnation from the united nations security council that was in the pocket of the great satan spies belonging to the zionist regime of baghdad had been arrested in tehran mojahedinekhalq counterrevolutionaries had been captured at the western borders carrying kilos of explosive the islamic revolution committees guards had carried out exercises in zahedan and displayed their everincreasing readiness to destroy outlaws and smugglers a bomb had exploded in tehrans safariyeh bazaar no casualties reported a grenade and machinegun attack on the guards corps headquarters in resselat square in tehran had been repulsed the speaker of the majlis had spoken at a military meeting of the success of the republics homeproduced groundtoair missile in bringing down an enemy mig over esfahan thirteen foreign cargo ships inspected at sea and allowed to continue the war was endless he had been at war all of his adult life he had worked ten years for the s a v a k and ten years for the ministry of information and intelligence all his time at the s a v a k reading the files assessing the statistics of opposition he had known the certainty of ultimate defeat so he had built the bridges covertly prepared for the transfer of power avoided the firing squads that had been the fate of most of his colleagues he had changed sides and he could not now predict the shape of things after this next defeat military defeat seemed to him most probable but would it alter the power structure in tehran and if so how the investigator could read between the lines of a news bulletin ever increasing references to battles losses insurrections threats from outside the country they were all to prepare a crushed people for even greater sacrifices to himself he would wonder how many more sacrifices the people however willing could sustain there had been a time when he had believed in the ultimate victory when the mko had shown their naivety and attacked in force and been thwarted beetles under hobnails then he had thought that victory was close but the war went on and the bombs went on he had chosen the radicals he had banked on their success over the moderates the man from manzarieh park who flew to london that morning iranair he would strengthen the hand of the radicals and the matter of the englishman furniss if that were successfully accomplished that would be muscle in their arm coming into the city of tabriz the driver had slapped a police light on the roof of the car and had hammered the vehicles siren they came to the square outside the guards corps headquarters there was heavy security at the gate even the instructor travelling in an official car was asked to produce identification there had always been security at this building since a bitch girl had thrown a grenade at the gate and the guards an office had been prepared for the investigator direct telephone lines had been installed and a telex link with tehran he at once examined again the arrangements for the movement of the transport and he summoned the men who would travel for their final briefing later he would oversee the preparations at the villa youll be alright sir of course ill be alright terence and do stop nannying me i will not drink the water i will eat only in the restaurant i forswear salads and yes thank you before you ask i do have ample loo paper all in all even without you as nanny guardian or devoted student i shall be in bliss i will be pottering on the battlements of the van kalesi i will be climbing the stone steps on which the feet of sardur the second stood i will stand in the rooms that were his home years before the birth of christ i dont know when i shall have that chance again not now that you are trained to undreamed of heights terence i fancy i am redundant here what do you say the station officer smiled wanly and slapped the inside pocket of his jacket ill get your report off as soon as im in the office yes it will give them something to chew on it is a perpetual source of amazement to me how much a field man can provide if he is directed in the right way i mean you might not suppose that running a repair depot in tabriz gives you the chance to observe much that is important to us and you would be wrong theyll be pleased with that they would be pleased with what they had because they were now beggars searching for crumbs sad but true that the desk head iran had been able to sprint round the gulf and up to northeastern turkey and brief his three field men without the anxiety of knowing that he had missed an opportunity of meeting other operatives working inside iran desk had access to the reports of only three agents in place not the sort of thing he would have discussed with master snow of course and the young man was left most probably in cheerful ignorance of the poverty of information from iran mattie knew he knew that iran desk was damn near dead eight years after the revolution eight years after the purges had started mattie furniss was wafer thin on the ground no question not in the land of the mullahs of volunteers queueing up to offer their services to the secret intelligence service of the united kingdom looked at logically he was rather lucky to have had a single agent remaining the americans never told him much about their operations inside iran and what they did tell him he took with a fistful of scepticism for all the money they had to spend which he did not himself have he doubted they had many more agents than he the wear and tear of terror of arrests firing squads had left him short handed he was down to three agents and to charlie eshraq thank the good lord for charlie eshraq ill meet you off your plane sir thats kind of you terence run along now and give your lovely wife the excellent evening she deserves mattie watched the station officer slip away into his taxi he thought terence snow had much to learn but at least he was capable of learning it more than could be said for the buffoons in bahrain his report was gone a weight off his mind he would write a fuller report when he was back at century he had sat up half the night writing it and sipping sweetened yoghurt alternately with water bottled and the substance of the report pleased him in matties experience the preliminary report was the one that would do the business his longer paper would circulate wonderfully swiftly and be back in the files within hours at the reception desk he ordered a hire car in the lounge he introduced himself to a group of tourists and chatted easily with them to pass the time before the car arrived americans of course such stamina for travel it always impressed him from milwaukee and boise idaho and nashville they were going to lake van in the afternoon in the hope of seeing pelican and flamingo and they told mattie that if they were lucky and if their tour literature was to be believed then they might also see greater reed warblers and redshanks and potchards he was mightily impressed with the power of their field glasses and camera lenses and humbly suggested that it would be prudent not to point these implements at anything military in the morning they would be heading on for ararat they gave mattie a catalogue of their expectations and he did not disabuse them it seemed only too possible that they would indeed light upon noahs ark such very pleasant people it was the pity of matties life that he so rarely mixed with the likes of them and it was an immediate pity that they would be off to capture mount ararat first thing in the morning and would not be able to share with mattie the glory of the van kalesi fortress of sardur the second in good humour and thinking well of terence mattie furniss bought a card to post home georges wife was out of earshot being wonderfully brave as they would afterwards say a thoroughbred performance shaking hands and thanking other mourners for coming four of the secretary of states staff had come to the service showed support and a pretty impressive turnout altogether the photographers and reporters were kept back from the porch of the building by police and a crash barrier george walked away with the home secretary at his side are you backing off most certainly not i expected results by now were working very hard the secretary of state snorted there have been no charges there will be very soon she was just a child destroyed by scum typical of the man the home secretary thought that he should pick a fight outside the chapel in which his only child had just been cremated the home secretary would not tell him what he deserved to be told not at this moment nobody had made little lucy take the damn stuff she was a volunteer she hadnt had to be pressganged if that pompous sod had spent less of his time working the constituencies burnishing his image if he had spent a little more time at home if that poor suffering mother hadnt been so mountainously selfobsessed they certainly wouldnt be here now i can tell you george that in addition to the pusher of the heroin your daughter used we now also have in custody the dealer thats the next step up in the chain and we have the beginnings of a line to the distributor the distributor i know what a distributor is for heavens sake no ill tell you george what the distributor is the distributor is bringing into the united kingdom anything upwards of half a million sterling street value of heroin he is a practised criminal with too much to lose to make the sort of mistakes that enable us to pick him up the instant you flick your fingers and call for action are you with me george but youre going to get to him if you wouldnt do it make it happen as a simple duty you will by god surely do it whatever it costs your vast empire as an act of friendship it will be done i will hold you to that the secretary of state turned and stalked back to his wifes side seeming impatient now to be away the home secretary was breathing hard god and hed been very close to losing his temper he thought that if that man ever became prime minister then he might just as well pack up the black car and return to his farm he thought that mucking with pigs would be preferable to sitting in cabinet with an elevated secretary of state for defence he watched them go sitting back in the limousine with their faces lit by flashbulbs the border was a small stream knee deep and a bodys length across and cutting through a gully of smoothed rocks the water was ice cold biting at his feet sloshing in his boots the crossing point was at the apex of a salient of iran territory to the west of the village of lura shirin each time he had taken this route he had travelled alone he was north of the sector through which the refugees usually tried to escape with the help of kurdish villagers who would lead them to the frontier if the money were right with his life charlie eshraq trusted no other person he had heard from the exile community in istanbul many stories about the crossing of the frontier in the cafes in the bars he had spoken with those who had come through stripped of their money by the guides their nerves shredded by the patrols on either side he knew that the guards corps regularly patrolled the iranian side and were committed to hunting down those that they hated most the draft dodgers he knew that turkish paratroopers were set out in strength on the west of the border with night vision equipment and with helicopter gunships he knew that a boy running from conscription running from a place in the trenches outside basra could evade the guards corps patrols only to be caught by the turks and handed back the first time he had crossed he had chosen a route that was well away from the paths used by the kurdish guides when he had forded the stream he felt a small sense of sadness he remembered the wetness in majid nazeris eyes and he thought of him polishing the motorcycle he thought of the girl he knew he would not be happy until he was back he moved forward as quickly as he dared it was a steep rock climb up a feeder gully the rucksack was heavy on his back his hands were cold and slippery and he worked hard to get away up out of the stream bed he wanted to be over the line of the ridge before the sun had risen behind him before he could be silhouetted on its back araqi flew to london on a jumbo of iranair during the flight and on disembarkation he wore the blue livery of a cabin steward by chance he was known to one of the guard corps who travelled the route as a sky marshal they silently acknowledged each other and made no occasion to exchange greeting araqi knew the skymarshal one of four on the aircraft because they had been together at manzarieh park he would not see the skymarshal after the crew had left the aircraft because it was the job of the guards to stay with their charge at all times the skymarshal would sleep on board while araqi travelled with the incoming and outgoing crews to the hotel in west london where there was a permanent block booking for iranair personnel araqi rode in the airline bus to the hotel whereas many of the crew excepting the captain and second officer would double up he had been allocated a room to himself it was a small point but it should have been noted by the antiterrorist squad personnel that watched over matters iranian in the british capital a number of factors led to this oversight there was intelligence on the movement of an active service unit from west belfast there had been a diversion of manpower following the planting of incendiary devices in two oxford street department stores by the animal liberation front the squads guard was perhaps a degree down since there had been no iranian terrorist action in the united kingdom for eleven months and to cap it there were casualties from the virulent influenza sweeping the city later there would be an inquiry as to how that small point had been missed but that would be the familiar if painstaking slamming of the stable door the materials would be delivered to araqi he would manufacture the bomb he would put it in the killing place and hen he would get himself back to the hotel and leave the country in the same way as he had arrived those were his concerns the provision of the explosives and the reconnaissance of the target would be handled by others they were not his concern araqi was a dedicated man he had brought with him the map of the world from the aircrafts inflight magazine and he had in his case a small compass so when he knelt in prayer he could be certain that he faced the shrine of the black kaaba building at mecca after his prayers behind his locked door waiting to be contacted he read verses from the quran he recognised the wide sweep of the shoulders and the wisping hair that ranged over the collar of the old linen jacket and the voice was unmistakable ancient britons nearly always shouted when they spoke to a person whose native tongue was other than english the whole of the reception area was aware that mr furniss was visiting one more fortress would be handing over the car at noon the next day and would then be checking out to charlie eshraq tired and dirty himself it was quite wonderful to have walked into the akdamar in search of a hot bath and found mr furniss he stood back there were mud stains on the trousers of mr matthew furniss as if he had been kneeling in the earth and his shoes were mudcaked he waited until mr furniss had finished at his desk and slung his camera bag on his shoulder and had headed for the staircase he thought that he knew which camera would be in the bag it would be the old pentax everything manual that had photographed him on the grass lawn behind the cottage his mother in california had a picture of her son taken on the lawn at bibury with that camera he followed his fathers friend up the stairs and on to the first floor when mr furniss had stopped outside a door when he was scrabbling in his pocket for his room key charlie spoke hello mr furniss he saw the man swivel im dr owens he said charlie saw the astonishment and the recognition good god it is a real surprise fantastic dear boy quite amazing what on earth are you doing here looking for a bath mr furniss youll be extraordinarily lucky to find some hot water but youre very welcome to the bath and you mr furniss what are you doing here he should not have asked that question the question was cheek he saw the fun streak in mr furniss eyes mr furniss had long ago told charlie that he could make an old man feel young turning over some old stones what else so natural the door was opened charlie was hugged like a son and his back was slapped as if he were a large dog the room was chaos the only patch of order was the bed which had been made no one had tidied the clothes clean or dirty and the guide books and the handwritten notes and the drawings of sections of the van kalesi lay scattered on and about the dressing table an extreme form of liberation dear boy a man staying in a hotel on his own good heavens charlie youve just walked out today forgive me meandering on you must be done in can i send for something for you to eat and drink meantime run a bath what would you like most after a stonecold bath and a trolley of food charlie set out to tell mr furniss all that he was clearly impatient to hear charlie told him first of his crossing of the frontier the bus ride from tabriz around the shores of lake urmia to rezaiyeh moving at night on foot into the hills and then on into the mountains crossing slipping the turkish army patrols getting to the main road hitching to van and then he talked of unit movements between tehran and tabriz he talked of a meeting on the bus with a sergeant in artillery who complained that on the front line dezful sector the mm howitzers were restricted to seven shells a day he talked of the mullah that he had shadowed and how the bazaar gossip had told him that the mullah was climbing high in the faction that was radical he talked of a mechanic in the engineers who had told him in a cafe that an armoured regiment positioned at susangerd was about to be mothballed because every one of the britishbuilt chieftain tanks had a mechanical failure and the unit was without spare parts he talked of the feelings that had been expressed to him about the mojahedine khalq and their operations into iran from behind the shelter of the enemy iraqi army theyre dead they cannot exist inside the country they do nothing outside the border areas believe me there is no resistance inside the country the resistance has been crushed for two and a half hours charlie talked and mr furniss covered every sheet of the hotel notepaper that was left in the room the interruptions were few when they came they were nudgings of charlies memory prompting him to recall further what he had seen what he had heard first class dear boy what are your own movements now mr furniss tragic but true business has overtaken recreation ive fixed myself a military pass into the toprakkale army zone quite pleased about that its a closed area but theres a fort inside the perimeter i meant to go this afternoon but itll have to wait until tomorrow always work first eh is that why you are in van to visit ruins charlie smiled at mr furniss frown then the grin as if the mischief were shared he believed he could see a glow of happiness in the older mans face did you use my little cracker i did it just as the instructions told me tell me charlie the motorcycle the drawing up alongside slamming it on the roof i saw his face before i drew away from him he didnt know what it was but he had fear there was nothing he could do because he was boxed around by lorries he couldnt stop he couldnt get out he had nowhere to go i will never forget what a fine child was your sister when i go back again inside i have to have armourpiercing one step at a time dear boy what else sir well just remember what a fine girl juliette was put the rest of it out of your mind youve done enough with armourpiercing weapons i can take out the mullah who sentenced her and i think that i can get also to the investigator who tortured her i have identified both of them he saw that mr furniss was staring out of the window he thought he understood why mr furniss had turned his head away the view from the hotel room window was nothing more than a mass of different improvised roof tops it had been mr furniss who had told him the detail of his fathers execution and the hanging of his sister each time then mr furniss had turned away his face but if i dont have the armourpiercing it would be much harder in fact i dont know how it could be done i think it would be better charlie if you didnt come down to bibury again more professional that way is that going to be a problem that sort of weapon dear boy ive told you where to go you can buy anything if you have the money do you have the money the money is no problem mr furniss parrish wasnt surprised to find that keeper had beaten him into the lane he poured himself coffee from the percolator nothing park shook his head what have we got surveillance on manvers place the name and type at ports airports nothings showing somethingll show it always does well not yet it hasnt what i always say fortune favours the patient its bloody hard park snapped i dont think i was cut out for fortune mattie was tired he had slept badly because the young man with a blanket bed on the floor had tossed rolled right through the night and then been gone at first light he was elated this visit to the ruins in toprakkale military was the zenith of his whole journey but he was running late that was inevitable given the fascination of the ruins and he had to get the car back to van pack up his bags settle his hotel bill and catch the flight to ankara because he was exhausted excited and in a hurry he was not aware of the dodge pickup closing on him from behind he had not thought twice about the tractor hauling a trailer from a sheep pen by the roadside ahead of him he had not planned his route from van to toprakkale merely followed the map he did not react well the tutors at portsmouth would have been disgusted all those hours teaching him aopr awareness observation planning reaction if it had been matties class and a youngster had let himself into that mess at the training centre mattie would have roasted him in front of all the others a straight stretch of road was all he saw the road ahead empty except for the tractor and its long trailer stacked high with bales of fodder it was empty behind him and he wasnt checking except for the pickup mattie should have been in a performance car he should have been using a professional driver he should have seen the block ahead and the block behind the tractor stopped and that should have triggered the alarm bell for mattie he should have gone off the road risked a soft verge he should have tried the bootlegger turn hand brake on and wheel spin to throw him round he was like a lamb to the slaughter he pumped the brake gently he brought the fiat to a stop he pressed the horn once politely there was a violent shuddering crash as the dodge pickup smashed against the boot of the fiat mattie was flung back skull against the head rest he twisted heartracing sickening fright welling into him to look behind men running from the pickup towards him one from either side and a man coming at him in front charging towards the car he saw the handguns and the machine pistol three men coming at him all armed his engine had cut when he had been rammed the door beside him surged open christ and he hadnt even locked his door he shouted loudly in english i havent got much money ill give you he was pulled out thrown onto the road surface a boot went into his face his wrists were heaved to the small of his back and he felt plastic ties going sharply into his flesh he was dragged towards the rear door of the pickup mattie understood he would have been a bloody fool not to have understood he was lifted and thrown hard into the back of the truck the doors slammed light died the immigration officer gazed from the young man standing in front of his desk back down to the travel document stateless person the government of iran does not recognize my old passport i hope soon to have british citizenship and a british passport the immigration officer squinted down at the writing and you are charles eshraq the eyeline at measured speed moved again from the travel document to the young man who wore a smart navy blazer with a travel companys logo over the breast pocket sorry i am charles eshraq when he worked fast at the desk top that was out of sight of the man standing in front of him the immigration officer could still maintain an air of impenetrable boredom his fingers were flicking at the pages of the book with the printout of entries it was sharp in his mind he and the rest of his shift had had the briefing when they had come on duty in the late afternoon the queue was stretching out behind the man that was alright too they could all wait he had the iranian he had charlescharlie born august and he had a customs id call the name in the suspects index was charlie persia probably a nickname followed by the reference letter o o was customs referral the immigration officer pressed the hidden button on his desk top the supervisor hovered behind him the immigration officer pointed to the travel document charles eshraq place of birth tehran his finger slid across to the suspects index charlie persia assumed iranian date of birth early middle s would you mind stepping this way sir the supervisor asked and his hand rested easily on charlies sleeve is there a problem shouldnt think so sir just routine this way please sir we put the dog onto his bag hung on like it was marrowbone the room was crowded there were men from the immigration control and from the uniformed customs strength and park stood dead centre parrish and harlech were hanging back by the door park listened carefully he had learned long before that the initial brief was the important one and he would make his case officer decisions from that first information weve him sat in a room now he thinks theres something wrong with his documentation i tell you what he doesnt look fussed not like id be if i had the sort of quantity in my case to make the dog go clean off its whistle ok your airport dog will get a good sniff every so often so theyre not as you might say blase but jesus ive seen nothing like it parrish had not yet recovered his sanity from the style of the journey down from the lane to heathrow he still looked like a man clutching a spar in a high sea harlech was pale from sitting in the passenger seat where he could not escape from the swerving and the overtaking and the raw speed harlech would tell the rest of them later that keepers drive down was the worst experience in his life harlech had been the late duty parrish had been clearing his desk and checking the overtime sheets and keeper had just been using up time polishing his shoes for the third time that day when the telephone call had come through from the airport we got his ticket off him and the baggage tag was stapled we collected the bag off the trailer and let the dog close damn near pulled the handler off his feet the senior uniformed officer had been parks guvnor at the airport he didnt like the boy but hed seen his quality and he had written a fulsome recommendation for transfer to id the bag is a rucksack the ticket is from istanbul listen the dog tells you a fair amount when it gets going the way that dog went then our chummie is carrying one hell of a load we havent opened anything up we havent touched anything so its your baby parrish wasnt saying anything still shaking his head like he were trying to get rid of the bad dream of the escorts wheel caps touching the wheel caps of a taxi park would not have been able to remember when he had last been so elated at the contact with a suspect he was the case officer like the man said his baby id let him run he knew that there were two other cars on the way to heathrow april team members summoned without apology from home just as soon as weve the backup the lift of bill parrishs eyebrows told him of the concern normal practice would have been to bust the chummie and if the chummie wasnt to be busted then the second most obvious procedure would have been to open the rucksack empty the contents and substitute dross for the real thing parrishs raised eyebrows were a warning to him sorry bill but what im saying is to let him run it was parrishs style to trust to the flair of the young men in the id if he had a deep disliking inside the civil service office where he worked it was for those of his contemporaries the old lags who believed that only age and experience counted when decisions were taken parrish backed his youngsters he gave them their heads and he sweated blood over it he went to a telephone he leafed through his diary he dialled the home number of the acio he was brief he didnt tell the acio that the dog had gone berserk when confronted with the rucksack that they were sitting on a major haul he reported that there were thought to be traces of narcotics in the suspects baggage he said that a man of iranian birth and travelling on a ukissued stateless persons document the right sort of age would now be carrying the april teams tag of tango one he said that tango one would be released from the airport as soon as he was satisfied that a sufficient number of personnel had gathered for effective surveillance perspiration on his forehead not blood by christ there would be blood if keeper fouled up nothing in this world surprised him not since an archbishop had been stopped by his customs colleagues at rome and waved his arms about in protest and thereby dislodged three packets of heroin that had been stuck in his belt under his cassock nothing surprised him not even that a young man should try to walk through heathrow with a heavy load of stuff in a rucksack most of them tried the clever way most of them used carefully hollowed out samsonite cases or chess pieces fashioned from solidified cocaine or they stuffed it up their backsides or they swallowed it in cellophane packets theyd try any bloody thing it did not surprise parrish that tango one had it loaded in a rucksack where even the most casual search would have found it and yet what did they stop they stopped one pax in a hundred or one in two hundred a fair risk a chance worth taking its okayed david you can let him run he took keeper out into the corridor out of range of the men in the room only harlech heard the ferocity of his whisper into parks car if you screw up david im gone and the acio who has backed you will be gone with me and well bloody well hang on to your legs to make sure damned sure that you go down with us i hear you bill too right youd better hear me the telephone rang and it was passed to parrish and he listened and then told park that the two other april cars had arrived were outside terminal vaiting for instructions they set off down the corridor the man from immigration and parrish and keeper and harlech and a uniformed customs man caught them up carrying a khaki rucksack parrish would have sworn that he could see flecks of the dogs saliva on the rucksacks flap the rucksack was grimed with dried mud they didnt open it that sort of bag was much harder to unpack and repack than a suitcase no need really because the dog had told them what they would find they transferred from customs and excise territory to immigration a new set of corridors another set of duty rosters pinned to notice boards in the door of the room where tango one had been sat and where he was watched there was a one way window keeper went close to it nose against it stared through the glass there was the slightest quickening of his breath he had the break and he had the luck and he had not really believed in either he looked through the window at charlie persia charles eshraq now tango one he saw a wellbuilt young man with a strong head of dark hair and a beard of a couple of months and he saw that the man sat quietly and flicked ash from his cigarette into the tinfoil ashtray he saw that the man was calm he wouldnt go in himself he motioned harlech to the window wrong for either of them to show their faces he gave a wry smile to parrish better we hang together than hang separately bill parrish wasnt in the mood for banter he shouldered past harlech opened the door park stood close to the door he could hear everything something massively reassuring about old parrishs competence when it came to keeping the suspect at ease i am really sorry about the delay mr eshraq what was the difficulty no real difficulty other than you happened to hit a desk man who was less than knowledgeable about stateless persons documentation is that all theyre changing the form of the documentation and that young fellow had it in his head that the change had already taken place you know what it is late at night no one to set him right until they called me its taken a long time im very sorry if youve been inconvenienced can i just have the details mr eshraq everything that happens in civil service work there has to be a report name charles eshraq date of birth and place of birth august tehran it is in the document never mind address in the uk flat beaufort street sw very nice too occupation mr eshraq freelance travel courier get all the sunshine do you eastern mediterranean mostly yes weve delayed you horribly were you being met no i have my wheels in long stay parking christ i wouldnt leave anything decent in there i hope its alright its only a little suzuki jeep can we give you a lift over thanks but ill take the bus im not in a hurry well its quite a fine night again my apologies i suppose youve some luggage just a rucksack lets go back to baggage reclaim then mr eshraq harlech and park ducked away and into an empty office through the door he saw parrish leading the tango one out into the corridor he told harlech for christs sake not to let himself be seen but to watch chummie on to the bus and then wait to be collected by corinthian by the bus stop then he sprinted to get to the escort in the customs parking lot keeper found the others detailed corinthian to collect harlech and then join statesman at the gates of the long stay parking lot one a hundred yards to the west and the other a hundred yards to the east target in a suzuki jeep keepers escort not far behind take nothing for granted he says he lives in beaufort street in chelsea but hes so fucking cool this one he may just fancy his chances at windsor castle as soon as the line of flight is established usual procedures to apply then he hammered under the tunnel to get to long stay parking to give himself time to locate the suzuki before his tango one he had been held up at immigration before but never for so long it was not a surprise to him the immigration men always took a hard look at stateless persons documentation he had learned in britain that foreigners were always given a hard time at the airport almost part of an immigration policy what had been a surprise was the courtesy of the senior man who cleared the matter up that man was one in a thousand and not a well man by the look of him wouldnt last that was certain he checked his mirror and saw that a dark coloured ford possibly a new escort was immediately behind him he had lived in london for four years but it had never felt like home to him he did not think that any of the exiles who had come first to london would have thought of the city as anything other than a temporary refuge but it had effectively swallowed them all they would still all dream of going home they would dream but charlie was going and he realized that this was his last journey back from the airport get all the sunshine do you oh yes he would be getting all the sunshine he was off the motorway and heading past the old lucozade building temperature he looked up into his mirror and saw that he was followed by a vauxhall almost certainly a vauxhall there was no tension in his driving he was controlled at ease it had not crossed his mind that he could be busted at heathrow he was charles eshraq stateless person but he would not be stateless for long charlie eshraq had taken out two guards with a handgun he had blown away the executioner of tabriz he was the friend of mr matthew furniss he was going home with just two more items of business to deal with and then then he would be charles eshraq iranian citizen probably no longer the friend of mr furniss certainly no longer the very close friend of the misses furniss he thought of laayya and he patted the rucksack and made a wild calculation of what in perfumes and soap seven kilos of first grade heroin would buy after the small matter of the armourpiercing missiles of course he was on the kings road he looked up into the mirror as he changed through his gears as his foot eased on the brake there was a maestro behind him if he was quick with a shower he would be in time to get to the pub before closing charlie eshraq would get a great welcome before last orders he would tell some good stories about dumb tourists losing passports or knickers in the turkish resorts and hed get a good laugh and a good welcome he parked he didnt look at the car on the other side of the road he didnt see the couple clinching he didnt hear amanda codename token and the only woman of aprils team bitching that codename corinthian who this year had failed to complete the eighth mile of the london marathon could keep his bloody hand out from under her blouse and he didnt hear token issue a violent warning when corinthian whispered that it was just play acting in a good cause charlie humped his rucksack up the stairs to his flat he threw street value more than a million pounds sterling of heroin down on to the floor he went to the window and looked out on to the street below a girl got out of a car opposite slammed the door furiously and then got into the back seat charlie smiled to himself he thought that laayya would have liked the kings road and he didnt suppose shed ever see it he ran his shower mattie was trussed tight he had lost the feeling below the ankles and the pain was cutting at his wrists he was very alert now old training was surfacing things that he had been taught ten years before and twenty years for christs sake he had even lectured on it back at the fort at portsmouth he had been a student more than once on the escape and evasion courses and he had been the instructor he knew it all he was lying on the hard and hurting steel ribbing floor of the pickup his captors had put a gag of thick leather in his mouth and lashed the thongs at the ends of the gag behind his neck the training had told him that the optimum escape moment was at the very moment of capture thats what he had told his students right he had been looking for the optimum moment been looking at it from the start right into the barrel of an automatic pistol the optimum moment was also the time of the maximum danger that also he had told his students the time of the lift was the time that the hit squad were most highly stressed most irrational he had looked up the barrel of the automatic pistol and been kicked in the head his ear had bled was now congealed he rationalised that his bleeding ear would have been shot off with half his head if he had struggled at the roadside he was an old man and there were four of them and none of them looked half his age two of them were in the back section with him and both now wore cotton hoods with eye slits and both kept handguns trained on him and neither had spoken he was aware that at first the truck had travelled several miles and that then the engine had been stopped for what might have been three hours he knew that when they had stopped they had been in a garage or a farm shed because he had heard the doors being shut and he had heard the echo as the engine was cut and later restarted which told him that the vehicle was in a confined space he lay alone the pain had come and gone and reached point after point that he thought would be unendurable he weighed pain against anxiety he worked to restore the circulation in his hands and feet told himself over and over that another opportunity to escape would present itself the truck doors opened his bonds were examined by torchlight and then the outer doors were opened and the truck headed off again a long drive over those awful bloody roads it was part of his training to remember everything possible about his journey after capture basic stuff that easy enough in the new forest or the back terrace streets of portsmouth damn sight harder after the shock of capture after being kicked in the head and when there were two handguns a couple of feet from his ear a weekly game of squash did not leave a yearold in ideal shape for kidnapping but he understood that they had driven a good distance he had been aware first that the pace of the truck had slowed and he could hear other vehicle engines around him he heard voices turkish spoken and then the truck was accelerating he thought they were back on a decent road surface the truck lurched to a stop mattie slid forward and into the bulkhead and scraped his scalp he heard the driver shout asalaam aleikum he heard a voice outside aleikum asalaam the truck gathered speed the words were revolving in his mind peace be on you on you be peace mattie had lived in iran as a military liaison officer and he had lived there as the station officer second nature to mattie to recognise the greeting and the response he was sagged on the floor of the truck he was inside iran beyond the reach of help from the customs post a telephone call was routed through the office that had been made available in tabriz to the investigator the message was terse the investigator was told that a dodge pickup had just passed through the frontier and had begun the mile journey to tabriz in his former life the news would have been cause enough to break out a bottle of french champagne much that was missed from the former life the investigator instead in his turn made a telephone call to the tehran office of the mullah who was his protector to the man who had authorised the kidnapping unable to celebrate with champagne the investigator curled up on his camp bed tried to catch a few hours of sleep no dr owens had not checked out and that was an embarrassment to reception because they had been promised he was going and they had a client for the room and it was still occupied with dr owens possessions no dr owens had not brought back his car and the hall porter had twice been phoned by the rental company from the airport after the van flight arrived without mr furniss it had taken the station officer a full hour to get through on a payphone from ankara to van it took him another hour to reach the embassys air attache no of course he had confirmed there were no flights to van that night no for crying out loud this was not a trivial matter he wanted a light aircraft and he wanted the air attache to pilot it soon as possible like an hour ago i was half into bed terence this is on the level sadly yes right on the level it had been a ghastly flight in a light cessna across a great expanse of raw countryside buffeted by gale force winds the station officer was a poor air traveller at the best of times but now he noticed not at all the yawing progress of the aircraft the air attache didnt speak to him had his hands full he took his cue from the furrowed anxiety of the young man strapped in beside him when theyd landed the station officer asked the air attache to go directly to the akdamar to make sure that the room in the name of dr owens stayed sealed he went to the local offices of the jandarma he said that he was from the british embassy he knew the registration number of the hired fiat it was close to dawn when the report came in car discovered abandoned indications of an accident he was taken to the scene he said that dr owens the driver of the damaged car was a distinguished archaeologist and the guest of the ambassador he tried to minimize the concern that had brought him at night across the country and a poor job he made of it the headlights of the jeep had picked out the fiats rear reflectors it was on the verge off balance it seemed both right hand wheels sunk into the soft mud they gave him a flashlight and let him make his own examination to them it was a small matter no big deal death on the roads not in eastern turkey and this wasnt death this was just a missing person true there was nothing inside the car to suggest that mr furniss was hurt no blood stain that he could see no broken glass but outside he saw the fiats skid tracks on the tarmacadam and he saw the dirt trail across what would have been the path of the fiat he saw the broken shields of the brake lights and the indicators and the stovedin bumper pretty straightforward a vehicle coming off the open fields in front wide tracks probably a tractor or farm lorry a vehicle ramming from behind and the unaccompanied desk head in between the jandarma officer said it is possible that he has been concussed that he has wandered off the road no chance there is no other explanation the officer drove him to the akdamar he gutted the room clothes everywhere books and papers too and many pages of scribbled notes not in english certainly must be some sort of code he looked carefully at the disorder and decided that it was as mr furniss had left it that it had not been searched he packed everything into mr furniss suitcase the station officer paid dr owens bill he woke the air attache from a deep sleep in an unlit corner of the lobby sorted out your little problem terence knickers all untwisted eh no i am afraid the news is all bad anything i can do just fly us home no jokes no japes no funny faces just dont say anything at all please standing on the hotel steps waiting once more for a taxi the station officer felt an aching anxiety whatever else mattie furniss was not gone walkabout in eastern turkey nursing a concussion he had been thinking how would it have been if he had been there too would he be alive now where would he be come what may hed be crucified he knew that for leaving a desk head alone probably finished altogether they took off with the dawn rising behind them a blustering wet early summer morning in london the traffic clogged the thames bridges the commuters below the high windows of century house swarmed in ant columns along the pavements the first report from the ankara station officer was deciphered then passed marked urgent to the desk of the night duty officer the night duty officer was ready to clock off and he was enjoying his last cup of coffee when the message reached him he signed for it he read it and he spluttered coffee over the morning newspapers there was a procedure for catastrophe telephone the director generals pa the pa would alert the director general wherever he was the night duty officer would then ring the director general on a scrambled line the night duty officer read over the message in a clear and firm voice that was a sham his throat had dried his fingers drummed on his desk he knew mattie everyone at century knew mattie furniss he listened to the silence at the other end of the distorted connection did you get that sir a clipped voice yes i did what can i do sir a longer silence what could anyone do and what the hell was old mattie a desk head doing in turkey last hed heard of him he was in bahrain and god knows what he was doing there not the night duty officers place to question the night duty officer had cause to think well of mattie furniss his son had had pretty serious problems with his teeth came up one day at lunch in the canteen and mattie had taken a note and a week later he had the name of a specialist in wimpole street and the specialist had sorted out the problem over the following nine months and the bills hadnt been bad the night duty officers wife always spoke well of mr furniss and when the night duty officer went home that morning he would not be able to tell her that mattie furniss was posted missing and in a country hed no business being in the voice jolted him all the west asia desk heads and the ddg in my office at nine inform downing street that ill be there in half an hour i shall require to see the p m the telephone clicked went dead the truck had slowed and there were the sounds of a citys traffic flow around him he thought that they were close to a commercial area he could hear the hawkers shouts and whenever the truck stopped he could smell the pavement food stalls they had come down a fast road for two or more hours that could only be the tehran road from the border if they were now in a city then they had reached tabriz a lifetime ago since he had been in tabriz that was wrong a lifetime ago was being trapped and kidnapped on the road from toprakkale that was more than a lifetime ago in the hours that he had lain in the truck no word had been spoken to him his head where he had been kicked was not hurting any longer his gag was constantly painful his mouth was parched his feet were dead below the binding the truck stopped lurched forward and then swung to the right revving in low gears stopped again the engine was cut he heard everything the click of the door the squeaking of the drivers seat as the driver left it and then it slammed shut the same at the passenger side he heard a low conversation beside the drivers cab but too quiet for him to understand what was said he saw his captors in the back of the truck move towards him he didnt flinch he was not afraid not yet their hands came at his face he could smell their breath through the masks they wore he did not try to wriggle away from them because he thought that would have invited a beating they fastened a strip of cloth around his eyes mattie was lifted down from the truck he felt a warm wind on his cheeks the binding on his ankles was freed the blood was pounding at the base of his shins and squeezing down again into his feet hands held him upright he could not have walked by himself and he was half carried half dragged up some steps and then manoeuvred into a doorway they went up a full flight of stairs and they crossed a small landing and a door was opened the strip of cloth was removed from his eyes he stood in the centre of the room the gag was taken from his mouth the strap was released from his wrists the door closed behind him he heard a key turn he stared around him the window was barred on the inside had no glass and beyond the bars the space had been boarded up with plywood there was an iron bed frame like the ones used by the junior boys in the dormitories of his old school there was a flush lavatory in one corner and beside it a table on which was a plain ceramic water pitcher and a steel bowl there was no other furniture in the room he turned the door was heavy wood there was a spy hole at eye level the walls were freshly whitewashed over plaster the floor was tiled if he had been planning a custody cell for a prisoner such as himself he would have created a very similar room the kidnapping the lack of any form of communication the cell they were all much as he would have planned them himself mattie furniss desk head at century long time officer of the service was a professional and he could recognise the professionalism of his captors he sat on the bed he massaged his ankles and his wrists he forced his mind to work at the detail of his cover his cover was his only protection the prime minister sat rigid at the edge of the sitting room chair the coffee was untouched the toast had cooled and hes just disappeared off the face of the earth not disappeared prime minister the signs all point to his having been kidnapped but to have been there at all that tells me hes not very important in that theatre of operations furniss is of the utmost importance then you had better tell me what he was doing all by himself i suppose he was all by himself you havent lost a whole department have you in such an obviously risky enterprise in my opinion prime minister the performance of the service on iran had been second rate upon taking up my position at century i determined to get that desk back on course i told mattie furniss who is incidentally a quite outstanding servant of his country what i wanted obviously affairs inside iran are at a crucial point we need to know very precisely who is going to come out as top dog in the new iran we are talking about a sophisticated and very capable regional superpower one that controls huge resources of oil inside its own borders and one which has the capacity to destabilize every smaller state on its frontiers possibly excepting iraq we earn very considerable sums of monies from the gulf states from the kuwaitis from the saudis all of those earnings are potentially at risk in the barely disguised warfare between moderate and radical factions for ultimate power in tehran the american government has wished to put its markers down in that battle we more prudently want only to have a better perspective on the end result for the time being at any rate obviously if the radical faction wins out we may have to kiss goodbye to billions invested in that region billions of future sales we are talking about the possible perversion of one of the great economic markets currently open to us along with the loss of great numbers of jobs if the radicals win and continue to export revolution and islamic fundamentalism i dont need a foreign office tract director general i just want to know what the devil this obviously senior man is doing all by himself in a very dangerous part of the world it was i who made the decision that furniss should travel to the gulf and turkey you made that decision to the gulf and turkey to visit our watchers and also to hold meetings with some of our principal operatives inside iran i suppose this decision flies in the face of long established practice at century this is symptomatic of your new broom is it director general in order that those with daytoday responsibility for iranian intelligence should know more fully what was required of them daytoday iranian intelligence yes well you havent said so in so many words but i take it we may assume that iranian intelligence will be exactly what mr furniss will be dealing with even now it hardly bears thinking about prime minister you sent him youd better think about it youre running a tight ship director general do all your people go overseas with a union jack sewn on the breast pocket does his passport say iran desk century the director general said and his eyes gazed back into the prime ministers sarcasm naturally he is travelling under a wellestablished alias he is an archaeologist rather a distinguished one i gather a specialist on an early turkish civilization i believe i dare say he is but archaeologists do not ordinarily disappear an hours driving time from the iranian border or do they director general i have very little information on archaeologists it sounds to me as though furniss cover was blown as i think you put it long before he got anywhere near turkey you wouldnt have to be terribly bright to wonder what a specialist in an early turkish civilization was doing hopping round the gulf in his olympic blazer and if he is inside iran if he is identified then he is going to have a difficult time yes prime minister well thank you director general i think thats enough excitement for this morning keep me posted please and kindly resist the temptation to send in a team of israeli snipers to se o e if they can find him i think you have enough of a mess on your hands as it is the car drove away down the lane harriet furniss watched the car drove away down the lane harriet furniss watched it go the wind was up and a gale was forecast and she thought that the blossom would not be much longer on the trees he had been very nice to her the young man and he had emphasized at least three times that it was the director general who had personally sent him not that it mattered whether the young man was pleasant or unpleasant the message would have been the same mattie was missing it was believed that mattie had been kidnapped mattie was an archaeologist so pathetic a woman could have run century better and still had time for the housework she was very deliberate in her movements she bent down to her garden kneeler and went on with the weeding of the border that she had been at when the young man had arrived there was a surprising amount of groundsel in the border this year she was numbed cleaning the groundsel out of the bed was her safety she was crying softly she loved that man she loved the calmness and the kindness and the patience of mattie and she loved his gentleness no he was not as clever as she was no he could not paint as she could he did not enjoy the theatre or music as she and the girls did but she loved that massive and reassuring strength he was the man she had depended on throughout her adult life she could not remember the last time that he had raised his voice to her those fools in london fools for what they had done to her mattie she spent the whole morning on the border she filled a wheelbarrow with weeds she cried her heart out for the whole morning khalil araqi walked yards from the hotels rank flagged down a taxi and asked for the mcdonalds in the strand he then walked back up the hay market and all along the length of regent street and to any casual observer he would have been seen to spend a long time looking in shop windows the stops in the windows and doorways of the stores enabled him to check frequently that he was not tailed he followed exactly the instructions that he had been given in tehran he did not expect to be followed and he could detect no one following him on the corner of brook street and bond street after he had waited at the kerb side for three four minutes he was picked up by car he was taken by the student of the english language south and west across the city araqi had been to london before but that was many years earlier he gazed around him he was at ease his confidence in the planning behind his mission was complete they parked yards beyond the mews the student followed araqi back up the road well behind him there was a narrow entrance to the mews culdesac and araqis eyes roved to find the lighting above so that he could estimate the fall of shadows at night inside the cobbled entry briskly araqi walked the length of the culdesac keeping to the right hand side keeping away from the series bmw there were cars parked outside each of the brightly painted front doors he was satisfied when he had driven back to within ten minutes walk of the hotel the student gave araqi a brown paper package the student did not know what was in the package nor that it had been brought by a courier from west germany passing the previous evening through the port of felixstowe the student was told at what time outside the garage on park lane he should collect araqi that night for the rest of the day araqi worked on the assembly of an explosive device by which a mercury tilt system would detonate one kilo weight of military explosive the pa stood in front of the desk you wont shoot the messenger sir the director general winced his head dropped tell me weve got mr furniss bag back from turkey all his kit that the station officer ankara collected from his hotel theres a report which i couldnt make head or tail of but which miss duggan has typed up for you youd better read it sadly it gets worse mr furniss passport was with his things thats the passport in his wifes maiden name what it would appear is that mr furniss does not have supporting documentation of his cover that just about caps it the director general had served half a lifetime in the foreign and commonwealth with benjamin houghtons father he and houghtons father were golfing partners of old and they had once courted the same girl shed turned them both down he had made certain when he came to century that young benjamin would be his personal assistant the boy was cheeky and casual and very good he would go a long way if he cared to stay the course just thought you should know sir and houghton was gone almost indecent haste just the same at the meeting with the deputy director general and the desk heads theyd all been exasperatingly aloof distinctly themselves bastards the director general began to read furniss report apparently based on the observations of an agent travelling quite widely inside iran very recently too not world shaking but good incisive stuff his pa came through on the internal phone a meeting with the permanent under secretary foreign and commonwealth at two a meeting with the joint intelligence committee at three a meeting of the services crisis management committee at four with the possibility of a teleprinter link to ankara the prime minister at six would you like me to raffle the ballet tickets sir no dammit call angela and ask her to take one of the children and you can too cancel anything you had planned for this evening he didnt notice the builders van parked opposite the block of flats across the playground from the concrete entrance way he stared up at the side windows of the flat there were no lights on and it was a damp clouded morning there should have been lights on in the flat he knew the children did not go to a preschool and he knew that the flat should have been occupied at that time in the morning he did not hear the click of the camera shutter and he did not hear the suppressed whisper of harlech as he reported tango ones arrival into a lip microphone to have heard the camera noise and the voice whisper charlie would have to have been hard up against the grubby side of the builders van charlie stood in the centre of the playground kids played on the swings and larked in the sand pit their mothers sitting and nudging their pushchairs and pulling on their cigarettes huddled in conversation there was a corporation cleaner out with a broom and a bin on wheels rounding up the swirl of crisp packets and fag wrappers and coke tins there was a soccer kickabout and the goal posts were snapped off young trees he climbed three flights of concrete stairs charlie saw the plywood hammered across the door of the flat he ran down the stairs fighting a fierce anxiety all around him was the normality of the estate the young mothers heaving their lung smoke into their kiddies faces the cleaner whose work would never be completed the kids who played their eternal soccer the flat of leroy winston manvers seemed to charlie as dead as the broken goal post trees he was irresolute inside iran inside his own country closing with the silenced pistol on two guards riding behind the executioner of tabriz he would not have known the feeling of sudden apprehension that was his own ground the estate in notting hill in west london was a foreign country to him he looked around him there were the parked cars and the builders van and the people there was a stunning ordinariness about the estate on a grey morning he snapped his back straight he walked forward he went to a group of young mothers he pointed up to the flat with no lights a snort of rich laughter they were the women who would have been at the front for a public hanging in tabriz they would have thought that a good show bright laughter enough to make them choke on their fags a cigarette was thrown down not stamped out got busted didnt he old bill took away plenty he wont be back charlie felt winded the control ripped from him he took off and he had the hoots of their mirth behind him half an hour later when the mothers had retrieved their young and scattered the builders van pulled lethargically away from the estate what he is not going to do is dig a hole in the ground and bury his stuff he is going to find another dealer hes sitting on a pile hes got to find somewhere else to drop it parrish thought he agreed he thought keeper had taken a good attitude where is he now he asked quietly top end of kensington high street his motors on double yellows harlech says hes looking pretty pissed off the sign on the door where hes gone says its an importexport company havent any more yet tally ho keeper park grinned for the moment its fine but its just a beginning home office files a stateless person has to have a guarantor nice one bill what would not be nice would be for you to lose track of a load of stuff got me that would not be nice the load of stuff was still in the flat in beaufort street park would have sworn to that the suzuki had the canvas back off and the stuff wasnt in the cab there was a watch on the front and back of the flat hours and the tail was solid on the jeep when it went out just as it had been solid when tango one had come out earlier in the morning and gone down to the delicatessen for a pastry and a coffee park would be going down to the home office parrish would be linking the radios that was the way parrish liked it best left in the lane with just the typists and clerical assistants to spoil him and share their lunches with him and keep him fuelled up with coffee the youngsters all out raring to go and gone it took a fair amount to wind up old parrish it took the whole of his team out and hunting to wind him right up he was in one hell of a great mood that morning and thumping out on two fingers his progress report for the acio of course he was excited of course it had been one hell of a risk to let eshraq and the stuff loose youre very kind i thank you for nothing mahmood shabro walked through the outer office with charlie he was no fool he saw the way his new secretary glanced up from her desk at the boy he saw the trace of the smile at charlies lips he took charlie to the outer door you pass to jamil my best wishes i will mr shabro i will see him tomorrow if he can manage that he had not asked why charlie should wish an introduction to his brother the renegade and the fly one from whom he kept a secure distance look after yourself my boy the outer door closed on charlies back he stood in the centre of the outer office for a moment i think charlie has disappointed you my dear she shrugged he might have rung he should have rung i mean i dont just go go out with anyone im not that type she was efficient she had his outer office organised she was starting to learn the detail of his work he wanted to keep polly venables it was a peculiar request that charlie had made to him that morning for an introduction to his brother his brother was involved in politics and his brother had no visible means of financial support nevertheless he had arranged the meeting it would not be wise for you polly to concern yourself too greatly with charlie park strode out of the home office building it had taken only an hour he had in his briefcase a photocopy of the paperwork completed at the time of issue of a stateless persons travel document to charles eshraq refugee from iran the name of the guarantor was matthew furniss foreign and commonwealth office good morning mr furniss the voice was a wind whisper in trees mattie started up from the tiled floor he had been doing his pressups it is excellent to stay in good health mr furniss his jacket and his shirt were on the bed his shoes were placed neatly under the bed he was sweating under his vest and his hair was dishevelled of course they had watched him through the spyhole in the door they would have waited until he was stripped down for his exercises before making the entry the fitting of the plywood screen on the window had tiny gaps in it and he had known hours before that it was daylight he did not know how many hours because his watch had been taken from his wrist when he was still semiconcussed in the truck he had sat for what he reckoned had been hours on his bed sometimes he lay and tried to sleep waiting for them to come and when the hours had drifted away he had decided to do his exercises of course they had watched him it is my great pleasure to meet you mr furniss mattie spoke fluent farsi but the man spoke almost unaccented english it was another tiny shaft into the shell of his spirit he was stumbling to his feet and breathing hard he would have liked to have stood his ground in the centre of the room but his muscles were blood alive and his lungs heaved he sat down heavily on the bed and he started to pull his shirt over his shoulders you are i am the investigator in your case mr furniss do you have a name a name would be a small courtesy and let me tell you my name i am not your mr furniss i dont need an investigator thank you i am dr owens university of london and i insist on being released immediately and on transport at once to my hotel this has gone on long enough excuse me the man glided across the room and bent down close to mattie and with sure movements he threaded the laces from matties shoes and pocketed them and then his hands came to matties waist and he unbuckled the belt from the trousers and pulled it clear there was a small expression of regret in the hazel eyes mattie read him not regret that he had to take away his prisoners laces and belt but irritation that it had not already been done it was the first time that he had been spoken to since his capture the tray on which food had been brought to his room was on the floor beside his shoes neither of the men had spoken when the food was brought the door unlocked the tray put down just inside the door a second man standing behind the one who had carried the tray it was as mattie would have done it himself he had his shirt buttoned he had his shoes loose over his socks he smoothed down his hair he supposed that he was surprised that the investigator was not wearing a suit and tie he noted the american jeans faded and the long tailed shirt out of the trouser waist and the sandals no socks he saw the harsh short cut of the mans hair he thought the man was a little younger than himself he had spotted the grey pepper pot flecks over the temples of his head and care lines below his eyes pretty horrible eyes eyes without life i should explain you are in the islamic republic of iran mr furniss you are of interest to the struggling masses of our people in their fight to rid themselves of american and zionist and british domination that is why you are here he straightened his back he drew the deep breath down i am an archaeologist i am not very interesting to anybody and i am no part of what you call british domination the words hung fell mattie saw the smile curl at the mouth of the investigator but no humour in those awful eyes he said nothing i can only suggest that you have made whoever employs you has made a mistake of which i am the victim if a scholar cannot go about his work then the world has come to a pretty pass i have devoted my adult life to the study of the urartians to their culture to their architecture to their disappearance you have people in london i presume you can check what i say with the curator of near eastern antiquities at the british museum no doubt mr furniss the smile had gone from the investigators face i would be most grateful if you could make such checks as speedily as possible so that this ridiculous business can be concluded i have no quarrel with the people of iran with their revolution i am not a politician i am a scholar i am engaged on work that is purely historical in its nature and before i lose my patience will you kindly get it into your head that my name is owen s owens i am not quite obviously who you think i am mr furniss i came this morning to see you to establish that you were well that you had not been injured i did not come to discuss the cover story that you have manufactured for yourself cover this is preposterous go away now i have had enough of this go away and check before you get yourself into serious trouble mr furniss later today you will be brought some sheets of paper and a pencil you may begin to write down your reasons for travelling to that area of turkey which has a common border with our country you should write of your activities most fully i will most gladly youll have a full account and by the time i am finished i shall expect you back with a handsome apology but i must warn you i shall take this matter up at the british embassy in ankara apology or no apology the hazel eyes hovered over matties body seemed to weigh him explore him the voice was softer than before mr furniss let me remind you between and you were the station officer in tehran representing the british secret intelligence service there was a day in february a morning as i remember when you came to the headquarters of the savak i remember it clearly because it was i who brought in the coffee for you and the officers with whom you met myself mr furniss i handed you the coffee i do not recall a discussion of urartian fortifications like a punch to the stomach im afraid you have a case of mistaken identity when the paper comes mr furniss it is advisable that you fill it matties head dropped he heard the shuffle of the sandals on the tiles and the door opening on oiled hinges and the turning of a key a pale body sinew under the skin park never wore a vest in his chest of drawers at home he had vests that ann had bought him the first january sales after they were married and they had never been worn the girls in the april office didnt look up because none of them was that interested in park a cold creature and anyway they were pretty used to seeing men with their shirts off strapping on the canvas harnesses for radio transmitterreceivers it was a harness that could support a smith and wesson but the id never carried pumps if the guns were thought necessary then the marksmen were supplied by the police park had the microphone on a cord around his neck and he shrugged back into his shirt and put the clear plastic earpiece in place there would be two cars and a van in place that morning they could follow tango one wherever he cared to lead them the van had a miserable clutch and wouldnt be able to keep up with the cars but it would get there eventually corinthian would be on the pentax with the mm lens keeper would be telling him what was wanted on the celluloid what wasnt worth it parrish had wandered out of his office still in his pit is he he came out for his bun and coffee went back in well be there in half an hour anything on his phone he hasnt used it what about the profile im going to do half day in the van then have harlech take over then im going down to shake up the fco chappies a bit ah yes the best and the brightest said parrish park grinned the military and the foreign office were the officers the police and the id were the poor bloody infantry that was parrishs unchangeable view parrish would never take a sixbedroom farmhouse in tuscany for his holidays he was in a caravan at salcombe for that matter park didnt take any holidays at all i was actually quite polite last night i asked for their personnel officer i explained that i needed to talk to a mr matthew furniss and the guy went off bloody supercilious but perfectly nice and came back twenty minutes later and just shut a real heavy door in my face didnt say he was abroad nor on holiday just that he wasnt available i sprang about a bit got absolutely nowhere he looked at me like id come in with the cat upshot is im back there at four i promise you bill ill have an answer then ill come down with you parrish said frightened i might thump someone to hold your delicate hand keeper now get yourself moving parrish thought his squad were the pick of the world and he was buggered if he was going to have them messed around by some creep in the foreign and commonwealth hed be an interesting fellow mr matthew furniss guarantor of a bigtime heroin distributor the director general showed himself that morning he saw himself as the captain of a stormshaken ship not that he would have cared to voice that feeling he believed passionately in the responsibilities of leadership and so he wandered the corridors and rode the lifts he even took his coffee in the canteen he took houghton with him the only fairly anonymous courtier to whisper the name of any officer he didnt know and his job in the service century was compartmentalized the north american desk was not supposed to know of the daytoday successes or failures of east european desk east european desk was supposed to be insulated from far east desk no other desk would know of the abduction of mattie furniss that was the system and it was bust wide open the director general found his whole building riddled with rumour and anxiety he was asked to his face if there was any news of mattie furniss whether it was true about mattie furniss he sought to deflect all but the most persistent to reassure them and to switch talk whenever possible to other matters the new computer the cricket match against the security service on gordon streets ground the rewiring of the building that was scheduled to begin in the autumn he decided to call it a day long before he reached iran desks office back in his office he sent for his deputy director general the man was just back from three weeks in bermuda and paid for no doubt with family money the sun had tanned the deputys face darkened it to the roots of his full head of blond hair and accentuated his youth the director general would finish his career in public service when he left century and it was assumed throughout the nineteen floors that the deputy would follow him into the dgs job their relationship twenty years apart as they were had been at best strained since the arrival of the director general from foreign and commonwealth because the deputy had narrowly missed the nod for the job himself said to be too young and to have time in the bank the ddg regarded himself as the expert and the dg as the amateur they worked best when they had clearly distinct spheres within which to operate but on that morning the director general was not in any way combative he needed movement he would have to suffer a third meeting in two days with the prime minister in the late afternoon it was agreed that field agents inside iran should be warned of a possible compromising of their security but not at this moment advised to flee the country it was agreed that the world service of the bbc english language should report and without comment that a dr matthew owens an english archaeologist was reported missing while on an expedition to northeastern turkey little thing but could be a boost to matties cover it was agreed the turkish authorities should not for the time being be informed of matties true identity they might in limited circles know from his meetings in ankara but it would not go at a government to government level station officer ankara to hack that into place it was agreed that central intelligence agency should not be informed at this stage it was agreed that the crisis management committee should be kept in session for the duration iran desk to report directly to the ddg until further notice the ddg to select a senior officer to go to ankara and work with the station officer to prepare a minutely detailed report on furniss time in turkey precious little to take to the prime minister but until they had some indication of who had abducted furniss and god alone knew where that was going to come from there was nothing else that could sensibly be done the director general ticked off the points agreed did you know that furniss was running a new agent some very useful material i had library run through a check on him this morning nothing there no case history no biography that is most peculiar i mean furniss is steeped in procedure furniss cant even type the deputy director general said coldly that woman his pa is like a mother hen to him flossie duggan she types everything for him shell have the case and biography on the floppies shell have them in matties safe dg youll have to fight your way past her but thats hardly top concern now thats just one agent thats now vulnerable one of several the director general cut in he was hunched forward over his table whats the scuttlebutt downstairs i mean on this news its clearly not a secret you want to know of course i want to know theyre saying that mattie warned against it that he was pressured into going that the security of a senior member of the service was put in jeopardy perhaps thats the black side an explosion across the table for christs sake with what he knows theyre going to torture it out of him they may already have started and we stand to lose the whole of our iran network because its all in matties head theyll torture him for those names do you know about torture dg the dg leaned back and swivelled his chair to face the grey morning beyond the windows is he a brave man its nothing to do with being brave dont you understand that its about torture there was a light knock at the door the director general swung to face it bloody little houghton and not waiting to be called in i dont know why you bother to knock ben what the hell is it sorry to interrupt sir something rather puzzling has come up personnel are asking for guidance fcos been on theyve had a little cretin from the customs round asking to see matthew furniss customs i dont believe it what in heavens name for its someone from the investigation division sir quite a serious outfit i gather they have established that mattie was guarantor to a young iranian exile now resident in the uk so what is he out of date with his renewal there was a blandness about benjamin houghton that could infuriate the most high and the most mighty not as serious as that sir just that hes been trafficking in heroin quite a lot of heroin by the sound of it parrishs voice crackled into parks ear april one for april five april one for april five april five to april one come in april five to april one come in whats moving april five april five to april one be busier in highgate bone yard tango one is still inside the location weve done well were just inside the mews entry weve got a great lens view on the front door harlech is in the street hes squared the meter maid theres a back entrance to the house just an alley tokens on that tango ones jeep is in the alley sounds fine you ready for the goodies ready april one o k april five the series is registered in the name of jamil shabro iranian born age address as per your location but hes choice vehicle registration has a cut out on that number we had to go through the met got the bums rush from the plods referred to antiterrorist tango four is on their list for security guidance what does that mean it means that tango four has got up the ayatollahs nose getting interesting eh tango four has security briefings from the antiterrorist mob varying his routes that sort of chat they say tango four is a devious crap artist but hes got guts because he stands up at the drop of a hat and pitches the old aggro back at the ayatollah so we just sit tight you just sit tight april five it took more than one hour for the news to seep from heathrow airport to the offices of the antiterrorist squad on the fifth floor of new scotland yard the iranair flight nonstop from london to tehran had taken off more than minutes ahead of schedule at minutes before noon the news came via the british airports authority to the armed police officers stationed at the airport and who watched over all incoming and outgoing flights of that airline from them the information was passed to the special branch officers on duty at heathrow and they in turn filed their report which was after processing sent on the internal fax to the antiterrorist squad the fax finally landed on the desk of a detective sergeant it was bald factual related to nothing else he thought of an aircraft taking to the skies leaving behind more than a handful he supposed of furious passengers still theyd mostly be iranians no one else would be fool enough to fly iranair that made him smile but he was a thorough man he rang through to the authority and asked if they had been given a reason for the new flight plan operational reasons what else he asked if the plane were now actually airborne the detective sergeant hurried down the corridor to the office of his superior the bloody things in french airspace now id have ordered it held if it were still on the ground if theyre going early for operational reasons then that says to me that theyre carrying someone out someone whos got to get clear were sitting on a bang sir there were the usual photographs silverframed of the old soldiers with their shah of shahs there were gold embossed invitation cards to functions all exile binges most of them on which the hosts requiring the pleasure listed all their decorations and titles there were volumes of persian poetry bound in calves leather on a walnut side table the interior could have been lifted straight from north tehran save for the picture window from knee height to the ceiling looking down on to the mews the daughter was upstairs and charlie could hear the rattle of her cassette music from the floor above and the wife was out shopping charlie was alone in the living room with jamil shabro whats it for charlie does it matter too double damned right you ask for a contact you tell me why pretty obvious i have stuff i want to dump it dont be insolent boy why what anyone trades for money what do you want the money for i think thats my business mr shabro wrong my business you come to me you want me involved and i am involved if i send you to a dealer i dont fuck about charlie you give me some answers or you go away empty i hear you charlie youre a nice boy and i knew your father i would have bet good money that you would not have begun to think about running heroin and you end up at an old fucker like me this old fucker wants to know why you want the money charlie said i want the money to buy armourpiercing missiles he saw jamil shabros jaw fall that way i can destroy those who murdered my family he saw the widening of the mans eyes when i was in iran last week and the week before i killed the executioner of tabriz on my previous visit i killed two guards there is still unfinished business he saw the blood run from jamil shabros face when i have the money when i have the armourpiercing missiles i will go back inside iran and i will dedicate my life to the future of our country charlie you must be in love with death i love my country mr shabro jamil shabros hands flexed together there was the sweet smile of reason i know about your family charlie your father and your sister and your uncle we all know about that we understand your outrage but you are talking like a fool its you who talk mr shabro and its you who left the communists and the democrats and the monarchy party they all fucked up they dont have the right to demand another chance i do my generation does i risk my life for what i believe i have been told that by the police while i am inside iran mr shabro jamil shabro walked the length of his living room he disliked the boy for his arrogance he admired the boy for his guts for the first time in many years jamil shabro felt a small sense of humility humility before the courage of charlie eshraq i help you you have my name you go back inside you are taken when they interrogate you they will have my name what happens to me youre in london mr shabro and i have many names that are more precious to the mullahs than yours he went to his desk he flipped open the notepad beside the telephone he wrote a name and a london telephone number he tore the sheet of paper from the pad he held it tantalisingly in front of him i get ten per cent thats fair there was no handshake just the passing of the paper and the sound below of the front door opening jamil shabro went to the doorway and he shouted into the music upstairs that he was going out and that her mother was home she had struggled up the stairs cloaked in a fur coat and weighed down by two plastic harrods bags and a third from harvey nichols perfunctorily as if he did it because there was a stranger watching he kissed his wife this is colonel eshraqs boy charlie dear he needs a drink charlie my wife very pleased to meet you mrs shabro i dont know when ill be back the bags were dumped on to the carpet the fur coat draped over them what would you like mr eshraq scotch would be excellent a weak one please he heard the front door shut he thought that jamil shabro hadnt been able to get out of the house fast enough not once his wife had returned it amused charlie the way she punished him spending his money she brought him the drink in a crystal tumbler and there wasnt much water and then she was back to the sideboard lacing vodka with tonic he sipped his whisky from the window he could see jamil shabro bending to unlock the door of his car the door was pulled open and he saw the mans glance flash up to the window and his wife waved vaguely to him cheers cheers mrs shabro she stood beside him he wondered how much money she spent on clothes each month im exhausted shopping is so tiring in london charlie watched the threepoint turn he heard the scratch of the gears he saw a battered van parked at the top end of the mews the turn was complete im sorry shes rather a noisy child my daughter the car burst forward he saw the light the light came first the light was orange fire the series bmw was moving lifting the passenger door separating from the body and the boot hatch rising the windscreen blowing out the van alongside rocking the body emerging a rising puppet through the windscreen hole he felt the blast charlie cringing away and trying to shelter mrs shabro the full length window cracking slowly splintering into the half drawn curtains and the hot air blast on his face on his chest the same hot air blast as had hammered his back on the wide road leading into tabriz he heard the thunder the thrashing of an empty oil drum the dead hammer blow of military explosive detonating he was on the carpet there were the first small blood dribbles on his face in his beard and his hands were resting on glass shards and the woman was behind him charlie crawled on his knees to the open window to beside the ripped curtain shrouds the sound had gone the series bmw no longer moved there was the first mushroom of the smoke pall the body of jamil shabro was on the cobbles of the mews his right leg was severed above the knee and the front of his face was gone his trousers seemed scissored at his groin charlie saw the back doors of the van opening a man spilling out with a camera and a long lens hanging from his neck and the man was reeling drunk a second man coming the second man clutched like it was for his life a pair of binoculars two drunks neither able to stand without the other holding each other up pulling each other down two men and they had a camera with a long lens and binoculars charlie heard the shout the shouting was above the screaming of the woman on the carpet behind him the woman was nothing to charlie the shout was everything april five to april one april five to april one for fucks sake come in this is april five police fire ambulance immediately to april five location bill theres a bloody bomb gone off charlie understood there are casualties bill tango fours been taken out by an explosion just get the fuckers here bill there was a girl running into the mews running for dear life towards the two men and she had a personal radio in her hand surveillance his meeting with jamil shabro had been under surveillance he went fast he went down the stairs he went out through the garage door at the back into a small garden and he went over the high trellis wood fence at the back because he could see that the gate was bolted he sprinted the length of the alleyway to the jeep the body had not been moved but it was covered now with a groundsheet the leg was in a plastic bag holding down a corner of the groundsheet harlechs traffic warden hardly a stitch of clothing left on her had been tenderly loaded into the first ambulance and driven slowly out of the mews too slowly park thought for survival the scene of crime photographer went about his work the mews was sealed off but there was a great melee of men round the car there were men from the local force uniformed and plain clothes there were special branch there were antiterrorist squad and two who stood right back and didnt seem to park to know quite what they were doing there he had those two as security service there were a couple of wpcs in the house and all of them out in the street could hear the crying there were ambulance crews still in four other houses in the mews two cars close to the blast had been wrecked corinthian had gone to hospital hed been taking a photograph of tango four as the bmw had driven towards them hed had the body of the camera heaved into his nose cheekbone and eyebrow hed have some stitches and a technicolour eye he had seen quite a deal in his time but he had never seen anything remotely like the havoc in the mews he was on the outside so was token they were the id and they had strayed into police territory of course the local force had not been informed that april were on their patch of course the antiterrorist squad had not been informed that an iranian exile on their files as at risk was being targetted so naturally keeper and token were getting the cold shoulder theyd be caught up with later theyd be interviewed when the mess was cleared park was still dazed he had the noise in his ears he had the ache in his shoulder from when he had been pitched across the dark interior of the van he was lucky to be alive parrish arrived he strode past the constable who held out an ineffectual hand to stop him and into the mews he walked straight to park no rubbernecking no preamble where did he go tango one hes not in the house now park said you were round the back amanda did he come out of the back she was looking at the cobbles she had her handkerchief tight in her hand i heard the bang i came running they could have been killed parrish snarled next time you want to play lady with the lamp for christs sake get a relief first parrish had his personal radio in his hand there was a tight anger in his snapped words alpha control this is april one if any of april team are not doing good works could they be got soonest if it does not interfere with visiting hours to tango ones home location and report back on whether tango one is in residence out they walked out of the mews park thought half the plods were looking at him like it was his fault like it had happened because the id had nosed in the muzzy haze in his ears was clearing he hadnt done it before but he took amandas hand in his and gave it a squeeze the message came back into parrishs earphone when they were close to the lane he heard it he didnt take his eyes away from the traffic in front he turned to park all phlegmatic tango ones done a bunk he went off in a hell of a hurry didnt even close his front door well done florence nightingale weve lost the bastard that hurts it hurts rather more that weve lost a heap of scag leave off it bill she did what anyone would have done that wasnt a firework another thirty paces and wed have been gone rotten old world keeper you can quote me you going to be fit for the foreign office yes park said when the body had been moved when the widow had left with her daughter to go to the home of the dead mans brother a team of detectives went inside the mews house there was no point at that time in trying to interview the widow and her daughter both hysterical and about to be tranquillized i regret mr parrish that mr furniss will simply not be able to contribute to your investigation we would like to establish that for ourselves you misunderstand me there is no question of mr furniss being able to talk to you park thought that if he had been a yobbo and lost his passport in benidorm then theyd have treated him better he and parrish were in iron framed chairs in a foreign and commonwealth office interview room there were two men on the other side of the polished table one of whom didnt speak the one who spoke wore a threepiece suit a stiff collar in this day and age would you believe it and a brigade of guards tie puffed out and his voice was a drawl as if it were almost as much as he could manage having to speak to the likes of park and parrish park felt a pillock anyway because at the lane the duty nurse had put an elastoplast over a dressing soaked in witch hazel across a ridge of bruise on his forehead we usually find that we are the best judges of who can and who cannot help us with our inquiries let me try it out on you mr parrish with words of one syllable you will not see him i am a senior investigation officer in the investigation division of customs and excise i am working on a case involving the importation from iran of several hundred thousand pounds worth street value of heroin my principal suspect the importer was issued with a stateless persons travel papers naming matthew furniss as a guarantor i hope i havent gone too fast for you that makes mr furniss necessary to my investigation as i build up a profile of a resourceful and dangerous criminal you should exclude mr furniss from your investigations mr parrish we are getting dangerously close i must warn you to obstruction obstruction is a criminal offence i doubt it in this case in some quarters the importation of heroin is regarded as a very serious matter quite rightly but mr furniss will not be able to help you ill go over your head thats your privilege but you will be wasting your time my advice would be to stay with the essentials youll eat those words well see good luck with your investigation gentlemen they drove back to the lane marooned in traffic parrish turned on park you were a lot of help stood out a mile tell me clever clogs what stood out a mile hes a spook enlighten me secret intelligence service the jokers over the thames in the tower block he was telling you to piss off bill if a spook is sent over to tell us to go away then it stands to reason that matthew furniss is an intelligence wallah presumably pretty big otherwise they wouldnt try that sort of high and mighty shit sickening but youre probably right i want a promise bill shoot theyre going to try and block us i bet you right now the phones are purring weve got iranian heroin iranian exiles weve got car bombs and weve got a big boy spook they dont want grubby little customs sniffing into that whats the promise that we dont back off bill just because a stiff white collar tells us to promise screw them bill too right young keeper screw them he started to sing jerusalem parrish was in full flood by the time they made it back to the lane in the evening when his food was brought to the door mattie gave his guard three sheets of paper filled with his handwriting the text detailed his study over many years of the urartian civilization that had been based around the present day turkish city of van there was a good term he used when he gave the lectures it was one that he had heard himself when he had first attended a kidnap briefing emotional rape it was a good enough description for mattie to be going on with he was without his watch and the belt for his trousers and the laces for his shoes he was without contact the breakfast tray had been brought to his room left inside the door taken away an hour later nothing said no eye contact his father had been a regular soldier his father had been a hard and austere man with no gift for conversation living his life to high standards mattie had followed him into the army mattie had been the young officer in the brigade of guards and brought up to the same standards perhaps he had rebelled against those standards his fathers rigid code perhaps that was why he had left the military and gone to century and yet the standards and the code remained his bedrock the pure soldiering had appealed to him less and less he had spent too much time as a young officer as liaison in iran wearing his own clothes and mixing with civilians but the deep base of disciplines had stayed with him he had been lectured and he had himself lectured on personal standards as a weapon against the despair that came after the shame of the emotional rape had it been possible to speak with his guards then he would have spoken with courtesy but hard to be courteous to a pair of sods who never caught his eye never acknowledged his thanks he had already done his exercises and that was important always important to stay mentally and physically fit he went to the wash basin beside the lavatory there was no brush to clean the pan of the lavatory and that was a small wound to him because he thought he would have benefitted from being able to set a standard of a clean lavatory he went to the wash basin there was no cloth to wipe clean the basin but he could make something of that with his fingers only one tap he was denied hot water well mattie furniss could live without hot water he turned the tap a few moments of pressure and then the spurt was reduced to a dribble the water ran ochre brown god alone knew what filth was in the water but the rules demanded that he wash his hands were cupped to take the soiled water and he closed his eyes tight and splashed the water on his face he took off his shirt cupped his hands again and washed underneath his arms he could not shave of course and the growth on his cheeks was an irritation when he had finished washing he began to wipe the basin clean to peel away the grime tomorrow if there was a tomorrow he would wash his shirt today he rinsed his socks he could wear his shoes without socks christ harriet how do i dry my bloody socks harriet who would have been to see her he had once been to visit a century wife in crisis just her own crisis not the services crisis just that the ladys husband had piled in with his car on a road out of sharjah he hadnt made much of a job of telling her the news but he and harriet still received a christmas card from her every year he wondered how they would be with harriet harriet always washed his socks at home and she knew how to dry them even when it was too wet for them to go outside and in the days before they had a proper heating system in the cottage at bibury the poor darling who washed his socks and knew how to dry them he had never ever talked to her about the risk never not when he was station officer in tehran not when he was running the show down in the gulf not when he was packing the clothes as she passed them to him from the wardrobe for this trip if harriet had ever said to him that gods truth old boy this life really pisses me off this life is for kiddies this life is not for us old boy then mattie would have been shaken to the roots but he would have packed it in he hoped they would have sent a good man to see her after he had hung his socks on the bedframe he had cleaned the basin again good lord made in the uk he could see the manufacturers emblem and the symbol of the queens award to industry must have been a good little export order purveyors of bathroom ceramics to his magnificence christ harriet i am so afraid his lips mouthed the words these charming domestic scenes will surely end my darling survive old boy thats what she would say and that was the name of the game survival survival was going back to harriet one day going home and the price of going home at any rate going home in a skin she would recognize well that price was unthinkable dont think it old boy you cant afford to think it because you know so much so many lives depend on your silence youll tell the girls wont you get them to come and take care of you until this is all over oh yes it will be over sooner or later most probably later it will be over i rather fancy therell be a debriefing of sorts and then theyll drive me to bibury and you will be at the door it will be summer still oh yes he wiped the underside of the basin with his hands and saw the beetles small black beetles on the floor they had an entry point where the tiles were poorly fitted against the wall he started to count the beetles they were difficult to count because the little blighters were meandering all over the floor under the basin he had not heard the footfall nor the bolt being drawn back nor the key being turned he was counting beetles and there were three men in the room there was a moment of annoyance when he lost his place among the beetles the men came fast he was dragged upright his arms were twisted behind his back one of the men buried a fist in matties hair and pulled him across the room pain on his scalp and pain at his shoulders from his bent back arms and his shoes flapping loose and his trousers dribbling down over his hips he was trying to remember the rules at all times courtesy and good manners bloody important bad mouth them back and hed get a kicking fight them and hed get a beating thats what he used to tell his students at the fort no future in getting a good hammering if the only witnesses to your pride are a gang of lowlife thugs the one who had hold of matties hair kept his head bowed he could only see the floor he could only see the steps down he was propelled forward they were going fast down the stairs and then across the entrance hall of the building and towards the back of the hall and into a narrow doorway down a flight of breeze block steps into the cellar a room of white bright light he saw the zinc bathtub he saw the hose pipe that was attached to a wall tap he saw the heavy hooks protruding at different heights from the wall he saw the plank bed with the leather thongs fastened at each end he saw the lengths of insulated cable lying casually on the floor he saw the table and the two chairs and the white bright light was facing one of the chairs that chair was empty in the other his back to the light was the investigator he was put down on to the empty chair he wriggled on the hard seat to get the waist of his trousers back up from his hips the men who had brought him down the two flights of steps were all behind him he could hear their breathing but he could not see them he could only see the face of the investigator and if he looked past the face of the investigator then there was only the ferocity of the white bright light he could feel the tremble in his thighs and in his fingers he could feel the sinking of his stomach and the looseness he heard the creaking turn of a taperecorders spools he thought the machine was on the floor beside the feet of the investigator he could not see the microphone the investigator put a small attache case on the table and opened it he took out the sheets of paper mattie had written and a single cardboard file holder he closed the attache case put it back on the floor the investigator pushed the file halfway across the table the light fell on it the title of the file was d o l p h i n the investigator took the handwritten sheets of paper and held them in front of matties face and tore them into small pieces he saw them flake to the floor i am not stupid mr furniss and i had not expected that you would be stupid either as soon as he was out from under the railway bridge the rain streamed down over his face he turned but no one stirred or watched him go because charlie had brought a bottle of sherry he was good news amongst the dossers who used the pavement under the bridge he hadnt had more than one swig himself the bottle had passed from hand to hand and he had even been lent a sheet of cardboard packing to use as a blanket good guys didnt bother with questions guys who had accepted him because hed passed round the bottle the rain was dribbling off his nose he might be back and he might not he was another of the citys flotsam footloose for the day and congregating for the night where there was shelter from the rain he could have gone to a hotel or to a boarding house but charlie had reckoned that was risk he had felt safer in the dossers sleeping place he had been aware of the light of a policemans torch on his face past three in the morning they wouldnt be looking for him amongst the dossers no way at the underground entrance he ducked out of the rain he bought a newspaper scanned it fast he saw the photograph of i the burned out blown up car and he saw a picture of jamil shabro and the caption dedicated monarchist three dead shabro the traffic warden doa and an old lady who lived right above the blast five seriously injured the old ladys sister among them blinded in both eyes no mention of a surveillance operation he had not dreamed it and he had no means even now of gauging what was the scale of the hunt theyd pick him up sure as hell because theyd mounted surveillance on his meeting theyd have him held at the airport whenever he flew back and then the jigsaw pieces started tumbling they had spotted him at heathrow on the way in that was what the performance at the airport was all about hed been under surveillance ever since they could have lifted him and the rucksack at any time why had they not what were they waiting for maybe they would think jamil shabro was his dealer if so that gave him a tiny breathing space one less hand at his throat inside the ticket hall he dialled the number that mr furniss had given him in st jamess park he was answered by a secretary he asked for mr stone he said he wouldnt give his own name yes who is speaking i am a friend of mr matthew furniss of matties he said i should call you did he now in what connection to discuss business with you he heard the hesitation mattie said that he told me to come to you whats the name no name no meeting charlie hang on shant be a second flossie duggan responded to the winking light lifted her telephone neither of her telephones had a bell mr furniss did not like telephones ringing all day around him she was still redeyed and her waste paper basket was a quarter filled with screwed up kleenex hes not here at the moment mr stone yes he knows charlie old friend of mr furniss family is there anything else mr stone and best wishes to you too he fed more coins into the machine he wrote down the address and the time of his appointment then rang off inside the station he paid for a key to a left luggage box and at the box and masked by its open door he lifted a sainsburys bag from his rucksack before squeezing it into the locker he wound the top of the plastic bag round his wrist he went back to the telephones another call another meeting set up charlie carried away from the underground station one packet containing a full kilo of pure and uncut heroin good god what are you doing here park didnt think too tired to think just opened his mouth bill told me to get home she had a super mouth except when it was twisted when she was bloody furious marvellous you came home because the philanthropic mr parrish said it was alright remind me to grovel to him whats that on your head his hand went up he felt the elastoplast and it was curling at the edges there was a car bomb the iranian she must have just come back from work she had an apron over her work dress and the vacuum cleaner was out of the cupboard and plugged in he said we were on a surveillance the car went up about yards away we got chucked about a bit its today afternoon that was yesterday morning he hadnt kissed her yet he was still in the doorway and so hellishly tired and it was an old script we had a panic on all the telephones down were they he didnt know whether she was picking an argument or whether she was concerned that he had been close to a car bomb her cheeks were flushed he reckoned she wanted the fight he could remember holding tokens hand the previous day never understood why token didnt have a steady fellow he just wanted cocoa hot in his throat and his head cool on the pillow i said a panic we picked up a target the other night at the airport i dont know how much but hes got a substantial amount of stuff yesterday morning he visited shabro the iranian who died the target got away we dont know where hes gone it was my decision to let him run and weve lost him plus a hell of a load thats what i mean by a panic thats why i didnt think of ringing you david what the hell is happening to us im just pretty tired when are we going to talk about it when right now i want to go to sleep she flounced aside made a way for him she snapped the switch on the vacuum cleaner and he had to step over the cable to get to the bedroom at least the suitcase was back on top of the wardrobe he didnt register that the vacuum cleaner had gone off she came into the room she sat on the bed beside him is it really bad for you if i foul up yes how bad kiss goodbye to a liaison officer posting in bogota yes well thats the best news ive had all week it sounds like hell on earth does bogota it just seems important to me more important than anything im very tired ann im sorry i didnt ring she went to the dressing table she took off it an opened envelope and picked an invitation card out from the envelope what is it his eyes were hardly open invitation she laughed a brittle ring the id midsummer ball are we going david itll be awful i want to meet all of those wonderful people who are so important to your life i am going to talk to all those fantastic people who have the power to send us to bogota well go you stand me up i said that well go and were dead im just so tired ann i dont want us to be dead then do something about it she had the apron off and her shoes and her dress was half undressed when she saw that he was asleep at the airport he had worn a blazer with the badge of a travel company sewn on to his breast pocket the travel company knew nothing of a charlie eshraq had employed no courier in turkey during the period of charlies last trip out of the united kingdom in his flat they found a receipt from a bucket shop followed up blood out of a stone and the threat of a v a t inquiry before the blood started to trickle three return tickets to istanbul no address book no cheque stubs the place was eerily clean fingerprints yes they had all that but that wasnt going anywhere not a single photograph to build on nothing to say whether eshraq was his real name the coffee shop and the laundromat knew him had never seen him with anyone if you know what i mean the owner of the flat had never met him and an estate agent who blushed rather prettily statesman thought said he paid always in cash always on the nail there were three possible leads manvers who may have known nothing about him at all the man in the importexport business in kensington who turned out to be the brother wouldnt you just have guessed it of the iranian in the car so his office was shut very tight and the family scarpered and the antiterrorist people were taking the line that if the id were going into the film business and if mr park thought he was mr david puttnam that was all very well thanks for the tipoff and do us a favour son dont ask us to tell you where mr shabros brother is because you people are bad news and anyway youre so clever that you can surely find him without assistance from antiterrorist branch mr corinthians film no it was still being examined no the met would probably want it for a couple of days expect it in a week or so and there was furniss of the fco as harlech called him the acio said that leroy winston manvers was now on remand at brixton prison and out of reach and that theyd had their chance with him and no way were they going back there now that the dealer was in the hands of a legal aid solicitor so parrish had said to the acio that this matthew furniss was the key and the acio had not been able to contradict him three of them went to the home office the acio had roped in the head of the national drugs intelligence unit theyd gone round to new scotland yard and picked him up theyd leaned on him so that he couldnt excuse himself into the home secretarys office the acio did the talking bill parrish did the prompting the head of the ndiu was the weight behind them what it comes down to home secretary is that we are being denied access to this matthew furniss now weve played this very straight we have not i repeat not chased this man and sought him out we accept that he may be a sensitively placed government servant and we have gone through the correct channels and weve been blown off lets not beat about the bush we were instructed to carry out an investigation into the supply of the heroin that ultimately killed lucy barnes quite disproportionate resources have been deployed and were being blocked its right that we should be frank with each other home secretary you wanted a priority made of this case youve lost this man eshraq and youve lost his heroin correct home secretary we lost him in freak circumstances you will agree if we are to get him back and get his stuff back without wasting an immense amount of time then we have to have matthew furniss ill look into it either that or the investigation has to go into the trashcan sir i said that i would look into it mr parrish thank you gentlemen good day to you parrish not a vindictive man thought that the home secretary looked like a cornered rabbit not his to reason why but he didnt mind taking a small jolt of consolation from the mans discomfiture it was a well arranged meeting no chances taken charlie liked that he had been under surveillance and he was pretty sure that he had busted the surveillance but he liked the style of the greek and the meeting he had been picked up in chiswick in west london by an anonymous little bastard with a sallow face and bad eyes that had been arranged on the telephone he was pretty sure that the rendezvous was checked out that they were watched by the greeks payroll he was told to take the underground to the end of the district line in wimbledon his description must have been telephoned on because after he had kicked his heels and had a couple of coffees at the station cafeteria he was met again they put him in the back of a van and they drove him round for an hour and a half and when the van stopped and he hadnt an idea where he was then the back doors had opened and the greek had climbed in beside him the greek was thorough he had charlie stripped down in the van to his underpants no way he was going to be stung that charlie was going to get away with a microphone in his clothes that was the preamble then there was the business a quarter of a kilo of pure heroin on display the greek was no baby in the game and the greek knew the stamp on the wrapping enough of the stuff to have covered a teaspoon was taken out of the packet and was passed in a small seethrough sachet through the slightly opened back of the van going for analysis running a fast check good style charlie liked it more thorough than manvers had ever been the check came back the sachet was passed again into the interior of the van there was an anonymous raised thumb theyd talked business while the analysis was being done cash is hard cash or no deal you brought it in yourself from the qazvin district i collected it myself and theres going to be more charlie lied yes itll be regular and top grade and youre looking for a quarter of a million for seven kilos two hundred two fifty if its tomorrow in cash two hundred thousand is top whack for seven kilos ill call tomorrow for a meeting they shook hands there was a clinging oiled sweat on the greeks hands charlie thought it was a good deal the greek would get double what he was paying charlie but charlie didnt cough at that whats it for what the hell does that mean the greek smiled a twisted smile he had a deep scar at the side of his chin from far back from a school playground fight with stanley knives just that this isnt your scene so whats it for something you wont ever hear about what on earth does he want benjamin houghton could see the nervousness in miss duggans face the likes of flossie duggan were never called to the nineteenth floor she was a few years short of retirement less than mr furniss had left to him but she had had his promise that he would get an extension for her she would go when he went it was her whole life being the personal assistant to mr furniss more than anything else she dreaded the day when she must hand in her polaroid cards and try and pick up old age away from century she had joined the service in after she had read an advertisement in a smart magazine in an opticians waiting room that called for applications from girls of good education for position in london with good prospects and possibility of service abroad aged to she would be going when she handed in her polaroid card to westonsupermare where her sister kept a guest house open only in the summer season she would have her debrief a day or two of counselling and she would be out on her neck with her memories to flossie duggan genteel and poor and loyal mr furniss was the finest gentleman that it had been her privilege to work for he just wants a little talk with you hes already stolen mr furniss floppies thats not fair flossie miss duggan the boy would never have been so impertinent if mr furniss had been there the director general is entitled to see the computer records of a desk head even when those records are stored in the desk heads personal safe and not where they belong in library so can we go please he saw the neatness of matties desk his ashtray had been cleaned ready for his return his pencils were in a holder sharpened his in tray and out tray were empty he thought that the photograph on the shelf behind the desk mrs furniss had been polished there were some late daffodils in a vase beside the photograph she was registering her defiance taking her time to cover up her keyboard with its plastic shroud and then she was riffling in her handbag for her lipstick again he could see her nervousness because the effect of the vivid lipstick against her pale and puffed skin was appalling i hold him responsible tell the director general that miss duggan and he might just chuck you down the lift shaft he held the door open for her she gripped the hand rail in the lift he led her down the corridor and made way for her so that she could go first into the outer office he knocked miss duggan sir she walked in she hesitated she heard the door shut behind her she hated the tall and thinboned man who rose from his chair a leather backed chair and beamed at her and waved her to a sofa he was certainly responsible good of you to call by miss duggan distressing times for all of us would you like sherry she shook her head i am sure that even with mr furniss away you are extremely busy miss duggan ill come straight to the point the director general had come in front of his desk and he perched himself on the edge of it presumably miss duggan you are pretty well up in mr furniss activities for the service she nodded her head emphatically that was one of mr furniss little jokes the worst time of the year was when she took her holiday at westonsupermare just one week and she wasnt there to run his office first of all miss duggan we are all every one of us doing our best to get mr furniss back that goes without saying she glowered at him he should never have been sent desk heads were never sent abroad all of the very considerable resources of the service are engaged in that now she blurted it was a folly sending him in the first place this is not a kindergarten miss duggan the service is an active arm in the defence of this country if the risks are too great for individuals then they are at all times entitled to transfer wherever they wish she might have slapped his face there was a haggardness at his eyes there was a thinness at his lips we have been through the discs from mr furniss personal computer and we can find no record of an individual with whom we believe mr furniss to be associated to maintain private files is in breach of all standing instructions it is a sufficient misdemeanour to have you summarily dismissed do you hear me miss duggan she nodded miss duggan who is charlie eshraq she told him it is the age of light speed communications but the tit pushers and the button thumpers still rule the information was first gathered by the antiterrorist squad they in their turn fed the information into the central computer of criminal records a lead from criminal records and that same information was passed to the national drugs intelligence unit for further detail the national drugs intelligence unit punched into the jointly operated cedric computer what followed started the sprint down the corridors the raw excitement she was jolted out of her sleep by the ringing of the telephone he wasnt going to wake an earthquake wouldnt have moved him the curtains were still open but the darkness had come down outside and she could see the rain pelting the window panes the telephone was on his side but he wasnt going to pick it up ann leaned across him her breast out of her slip was crushed into his face and he didnt stir she wriggled she kissed her man he looked ten years younger at peace she reached for the telephone softly yes david this is ann park bill parrish could i speak to him she looked down she saw the calm in his sleep and she saw the livid bruise on his forehead he came home injured why wasnt i told because im not a nanny mrs park please get him to the phone damn you hes asleep tickle his toes whatever you do wake him up mr parrish have you any idea what life is like for me because you cant manage your bloody office for ten minutes without my david i went to your wedding and im not daft just wake him up hes exhausted and hes hurt and he needs the rest dont accuse me young lady of not caring have you forgotten aberystwyth she would never forget aberystwyth they hadnt been married then a stakeout on the welsh coast waiting for a yacht to come in from the mediterranean and drop a load off on a beach a ruined cottage had been the base camp for the april team and david was the new boy just selected and the wedding had been postponed until after the knock bill parrish had broken every rule in the c amp es book parrish had told his keeper to get his fiancee up to a camp site four miles from the cottage and hed made damned sure that david slipped away to the tent where his ann was every single night she had cooked their supper over a calor gas burner cuddled him and the rest in her sleeping bag and sent him back to the stakeout each dawn it had been heaven for her and bill parrish had fixed it and it had never happened again he wouldnt do it now she said why cant you get someone else were all in the same boat and its the way we work and if we dont work like that then the job doesnt get done oh boy have i heard that before do me a favour wake him up her voice was breaking she was across david and she could hear the constant rhythm of his breathing youre destroying us youre breaking us apart hell be collected in half an hour tell him theres movement on the target she put the phone down she woke him she saw the flare in his eyes when she told him what parrish had said she watched him dress fast she fed him some scrambled egg and toast in the kitchen and all the time he was looking out of the window waiting for a cars headlamps when she saw the lights she could have cried she cleared away the plate she heard the doorbell he grabbed for his anorak shrugged into it opened the door ann still wore her slip she stood in the kitchen and she could see through to the front door there was a girl standing there a boyish stocky girl with her hair cut short and a windcheater like a sleeping bag she saw her husband go out they walked across to the car she could see them when the tail lights had gone then ann park cried token talked keeper listened its the oldest one i know there was a notepad beside the telephone in shabros flat the antiterrorist people had a look at it and there was an indent a name and a number they checked theres quite a bit on the name at criminal records all drugsrelated so they fed it over to cedric hes hot hes been busted for possession and went inside but that was years back more important just a couple of years ago he was in the slammer and went to the bailey he should have got a fifteen for dealing but the bastard had a nobble four of the jurors came out for him the trial had cost nearly a million had run for four months public prosecutions didnt go back for another bite his name was written on the notepad in shabros house its shabros writing the top note wasnt in shabros pockets if that doesnt add up to tango one finding himself a dealer in lieu of manvers ill do a streak round the lane cheer up david its going to work out weve got taps on him and weve got surveillance on him your missus david what was up with her two guards carried mattie back up the two flights from the cellar he was not unconscious that had been before many times he was conscious and the water dripped from his head to himself he was now detached from the pain in his feet and he was aware of what went on around him he could hear no traffic in the street outside he thought that it must be very late in the night he had no sense of how many hours he had been in the basement nor could he remember how many times he had lost consciousness and how many times he had been dunked in the zinc bathtub he thought that he was still in control of himself he could understand that there was no longer any more point in them beating him because the pain had begun to cancel itself out he was carried because he could not stand on his feet his head was sagging and he could see his feet his shoes were gone his feet were grotesque bloody and swollen he could not count how many times in that long day they had thrashed the soles of his feet with the heavy electrical flex and how many times he had lapsed thank the good lord into unconsciousness they took him into his room and they let him fall from their arms and on to his bed he lay on his bed and the pain came out of the numbness of his feet the pain came like maggots tunnelling from rotting meat the pain spread from the soft ripped flesh at the soles of his feet and into his ankles and into his shins and calves and into his thighs and into his guts it was just their beginning through the long day into the long night the investigator had not asked mattie a single question softening him beating him and hurting him just the start unless he would scream for the pain to stop the questions would follow when they thought it opportune when they judged it best to peel from his mind the names held there the pain throbbed in him welled in him he lay on the bed and he writhed to escape from the pain and with his eyes clenched tight he could see all the time the sweat forehead the exertion of the man who swung the electrical flex back over his shoulder and then whipped it back on to the soles of his feet they had given him nothing not even the dignity of refusing their questions how are we this morning mr furniss nothing to say mattie took in the greater heat in the airless cellar the doctor came yes nothing to say it was a ritual of course the investigator knew that the doctor had been to examine him because he had sent the doctor the doctor had been sent to make certain that no serious damage had been done to the prisoner a slob of a man the doctor and his eyes had never met matties because the bastard had betrayed his oath the doctor had glanced at the feet taken the pulse above all checked that his heart would last stretched up the eyelids to see the pupils and checked with a stethoscope for matties breathing pattern how are your feet mr furniss nothing to say he could stand just he had leaned on the shoulders of the guards who had brought him down but his feet could take some weight please mr furniss sit down he sat and the pain sang into his legs as the weight came off the feet mr furniss it has been broadcast on the world service of the bbc that dr matthew owens an archaeologist is missing in turkey the smile was winter water the voice was powder snow soft they are trying to protect you and they cannot do you understand that mr furniss nothing to say they cannot protect you stating the bloody obvious dear sir tell me something i dont know through all his mind was the memory of the pain and the memory of the dying that seemed to come each time he had lapsed towards unconsciousness that was yesterday the art of resistance to interrogation as taught by professor furniss was to take it one day at a time one step at a time yesterday had been endured survived but they had not questioned him yesterday was gone so forget yesterdays pain yesterdays pain was what they wanted mattie to remember the old school had been put through the full works on the resistance to interrogation courses at the fort the old school in the service reckoned that they were a tougher breed than the new intake resist at all costs never crack hang on to the bitter bloody end and some fearful disasters there had been on simulated interrogation sessions queen and country thats what the old school believed in if he cut the pain from his memory then the mind was voided then filled with other matter the other matter was the names he tried to find the guards beyond the brilliance of the light in his eyes what were you doing in van mr furniss ive told you repeatedly i was visiting the fortress of sardur the second that is particularly idiotic mr furniss i cannot help the truth it is idiotic mr furniss because you deny reality reality is this cellar reality is the power at my disposal yesterday was amusement mr furniss today is the beginning of reality if you go on with this fabrication then it will go badly for you mr furniss stick to the cover cling to the cover at all costs a long time ago yes it is possible that you saw me in tehran ive been out of that sort of thing for years i am an academic now i am an authority on the urartian civilization that is your sole interest the urartians yes in turkey the urartian civilization was based in northeastern turkey and across the frontier of modern iran as far as the western shore of lake urmia that was the scope did the urartians mr furniss travel to dubai abu dhabi bahrain is it necessary for an academic an authority in this rather limited field to be escorted around the gulf by the various station officers of the secret intelligence service the light was in his face the guards were behind him he could just make out the rhythm of their breathing they would have been told to be still to offer to the prisoner no distraction from the questions of the investigator i am an academic i think not mr furniss i think you are dolphin desk head for iran at century house in london you were a regular soldier and posted to iran to liaise over arms sales to the former regime you were the station officer in tehran from to in and you were the senior station officer in bahrain with responsibility only for iranian affairs in you spent four months in ankara you were promoted to desk head on january st you are a senior intelligence officer mr furniss understand me i do not want to hear any more about your hobby one day perhaps i shall have the pleasure of reading your published work for today we shall put away hobbies mr furniss and just talk about what you were doing on this journey around our borders the names were in his head swirling he was a man under water and trying to hold his breath and his breath was the names in time as night follows day the lungs would force out the breath the pain would spit out the names even the old school knew that it was a question simply of how many nights how many days the agents should have been warned by now but was it known who held him would century flush out its best men before they had confirmation that mattie was in iran what would he have done himself in their place he thought of the complications of the structure for getting the necessary signals inside iran he knew how complicated it was he had set the system up far more complex than bringing the agents out to the prearranged rendezvous meetings that he had just had oh a lifetime of complications if the agents were to be aborted and no going back london would not be hurrying to destroy its network he swept the names from his mind he lifted his head there was escape from the white bright light only in the face of the investigator it is quite scandalous that an innocent scholar the investigator gestured with his arm the guards came forward ripped mattie up from his chair charlie made his call the same telephone box after the same nights sleep under a cardboard blanket after the call after he had helped the dossers pile away the packing cases he went to the left luggage inside the ticket hall of the underground station and he took out his rucksack they had a fine view of the greeks house parrish had smoothed it keeper reckoned that parrish was goldplated when it came down to sweet talking for window space it was a great window the early summer foliage was not yet thick enough on the trees to obstruct the vision across the garden and across the road and across the greeks garden and on to the front porch of his house it was an old victorian house that parrish had fixed weathered brick three stories high with an ivy creeper thick enough to have held the walls together they had chosen the top floor for the camera position and from there their sight fine went well clear of the high paling fence opposite keeper and token knew her life history by now she came upstairs on the hour every hour with a pot of tea and biscuits she was a widow her late husband had been a brigadier general she had lived alone in the house for nineteen years and every year she resisted another try by the developers to put a cheque in her hand this year it was for three quarters of a million pounds so that they could bulldoze her property and replace it with a block of flats she didnt think her cats would want to move she had no love for her neighbour across the road his dogs were a threat to her cats anything that threatened the owner of the dogs was fine by this lady from the upper window they could see the dogs dobermanns lean and restless wandering and cocking their legs against the wheels of the midnight blue jaguar outside the front porch she was an artful old girl the generals widow keeper had seen her giving them both the coy look and checking the ring on his finger and observing that tokens finger was bare he was comfortable with token she let him talk about colombia about targetting the problem at its source there had been other cars come and go at the house across the road they had photographed all the movements but they hadnt seen the greek they had the mug shots done by the plods of when he was last in custody it was a hell of a house that the bastard lived in half an acre heated swimming pool hard tennis court five maybe six bedrooms the generals widow was telling them that when her husband had first purchased the briars they had been able to look across fields real countryside the radio crackled to life april one to april five april one to april five april five come in april one tango one has been on the telephone to your location text of call coming tango one its charlie here your location same place as yesterday same pickup bring it all tango one right did you get that april five april five to april one received understood out his head shook and his knees token said keeper is back from the dead whats keeper mean the generals widow asked its a very solid person maam and very vulnerable token smiled those brutes got out once they killed one of my cats they tore disraeli to shreds george a word in your ear the secretary of state for defence paused in the corridor outside the cabinet room the distributor a strange thing has happened and i may need your help what on earth do you mean customs and excise have a suspect he has a vague profile they are trying to get into that profile and they reckon that a chap called matthew furniss listed as fco but in reality sis could help them the spooks wont wear it mr furniss is being kept under wraps the customs investigation officers i ant get at him the look of pure rage on georges face was worth all the humiliations of the past weeks as he slipped into the doorway he said just thought youd like to know parrish sat hunched forward at the console on the top floor of the lane coordinating a raft of radio signals competing for attention this was big enough for the investigation of which harlech was case officer to be sidelined and for corinthians to be relegated out of sight big enough to soak up all of aprils resources parrish to keeper april five just keep remembering that your single responsibility is tango one our brothers look after every other tango but tango one harlech to corinthian april seven to april eleven heh ugly nose this is just fantastic this is just brilliant what theyre doing is this theyve tango one in the white van and theres another van about yards behind thats the green one theyre taking tango ones stuff from the white to the green that must be where theyre running the spot checks you got me theyre doing it all on site the jags parked between the two the jag tango is in the white van with tango one this has to be christmas its the best ive ever seen keeper to token april five to april nine try another walk past you got the canvassing board do another run down those houses you missed out the first time i want to know if the tango one van has the engine running i have to know when those wheels are about to go corinthian to keeper april eleven to april five just to keep your knickers dry keeper this is the layout tango one is in the white van plus the greek the stuff is taken from the white van to the green van probably running the checks on it the guy who takes it to the green van then comes back empty and reports through the rear doors dangerous looking creep in blue overalls so the stuff is in the green van the green van is for the plods are you clear april five parrish talking to all april call signs keep it going very cool very calm any bugger shows out hes in uniform for the rest of his natural tango one is to run that is confirmed tango one will run we are only concerned with tango one a quiet road running beside the brick perimeter wall of richmond park two vans parked in the road and a jaguar car separating them and a girl calling at the houses on the park side and asking questions on the doorsteps about which washing powder the occupants used a mm lens in an upper room yards north of the green van three more cars parked in the road two of them facing the direction that the white van would come if it didnt do a three point this is great stuff i watched it packed myself and theres more the greek could not hide the greed ill be coming back with more a couple of months charlie said the hand of the greek rested lightly on charlies arm you get lifted and you talk and you get the knife wherever you wont know how to hide charlie said my friend you get lifted and you talk and you get the bullet your head blown take it as a promise ill find you charlie flicked his fingers through the wads of notes they went into his rucksack there was a handshake of sorts you be careful there when you go back watch yourself across the road charlie said there was a flash of light as the van door opened the greek gave him his mirthless twisted smile and stooped out as the van pulled away charlie heard the big thunder cough of the jaguars engine in a side street in hammersmith near the river a police landrover rammed the white van front offside wing crashed it and jammed the drivers door tight in shepherds bush detectives of the drugs squad boxed the green van an hour later across the city in the essex suburb of chigwell the greek had been back in his house three minutes a police marksman put down his cup of tea in the house opposite asked the generals widow please to stand well back and shot both dobermanns clean through the heart four seconds between shots the marksman spoke briefly into his radio and shut the window and was very much surprised to be kissed just under his ear by the old lady they were still at the window when a landrover with a ramming guard attached drove fast into the high wooden gates smashing them a few seconds later the pseudogeorgian front door splintered open at the second massive blow of a policemans sledgehammer on the underground starting at wimbledon station keeper and token and harlech tracked their tango one and above them through the traffic corinthian drove as if his life depended on it to stay in touch he was dropped with his bodyguard as always at the door of the cabinet office and he walked through that building and down steps and then through the deep corridor linking the cabinet office to downing street at the final door the security check before entry to downing street he was greeted like an old friend by the armed policeman he had known that policeman since forever god alone knew how the man had wangled the posting but he seemed never to have been more than yards from whitehall all his working life always the sort of greeting that put him in a better mind frame his bodyguard peeled away from him hed be in the waiting room and hed be brought a cup of coffee by one of those haughty leggy kids who hit the word processors down the corridor a good life his bodyguard had nearly as cushy as the policemans on the tunnel door the director general was shown into the prime ministers office gerald seymour for a moment he wondered whether a previous meeting had overrun he nodded coolly to the secretary of state for defence theyd met a few times but the secretary of state was too flashy by half for his taste thank you for coming so promptly director general as if he had the choice it is much appreciated you know each other yes i am sorry to say that a most serious complaint has been brought to me by my colleague he couldnt help but notice the unease of the prime minister nor the hostility of the secretary of state im sorry to hear that prime minister georges daughter lucy died a short time ago following a narcotics accident the director general stared back he read the newspapers the girl was an addict a n investigation is in process by the police and customs and excise to try to identify the importer of the narcotics concerned and then he saw what was coming their very strenuous work as i gather leads them to a foreign national currently holding a stateless persons document which was issued on the guarantee of good character provided by a member of the service customs and excise quite properly wish to interview that member of the service but the service have pulled down the shutters had the prime minister been told who it was couldnt have been would surely have made the connection its outrageous the secretary of state chimed i think we can get this sorted out quite quickly dont you director general before it gets out of hand no obviously hadnt a clue in front of a third party prime minister i am not free to discuss this matter you damn well will the secretary of states voice rose and his jowls were purple the director general looked the man up and down hed learned that from his classics master at marlborough a cutting stare from ankle to adams apple i am answerable to the prime minister sir and to the foreign secretary matters affecting the service are beyond the remit of defence just lets have this crystal clear you are saying that the importing of heroin is a matter which affects the service is that it what the devil is the service coming to i should like to know are you importing heroin director general is that it is it your secret service that i must hold responsible for the death of my only child george i believe thats enough no prime minister it most assuredly is not enough i demand that the director general produce this matthew furniss and straight away and stop wasting valuable police time customs peoples time or tell us without all this waffle about matters affecting the service why he wont we all know how precious is police time george i dont think you of anyone need labour that but did you say matthew furniss was that the name yes prime minister that is the service mans name the home secretary tells me that the importer is an iranian called charles eshraq well director general what will you say to all this and there seemed to have evaporated from the prime minister the anxiety he had detected earlier i would say this prime minister i might in different circumstances simply explain to you in what way the service is affected and in what milliontoone chance lies its connection to the death through narcotics addiction of the secretary of states daughter but i have just observed the hysterical speculations and accusations of a man with whom unless ordered to do so i shall share not one iota of information relating to this case or any other furthermore it is quite outrageous that a dedicated public servant should be vilified when as the prime minister well knows he is in no position to defend his good name ill see you broken your privilege sir to try prime minister are you going to tolerate that impertinence i hope prime minister that i may count upon your support a reeded and hesitant voice i am going to think about it there were many thoughts cavorting through the director generals mind as he marched back through the tunnel he thought of mattie furniss prisoner facing torture he thought of three quarters of an hour with miss duggan a woman whose loyalty he could only admire and two glasses of barley water to keep her talking and the story of charlie eshraq he thought of a girl hanged from a crane and he thought of the value that eshraq could be to the service so long as he wasnt named by furniss under torture so long as he wasnt caught by customs and excise first april five to april one april five to april one april one come in april five just a sitrep bill hes in the pub apparently killing time hes had one half pint in front of him for an hour not had anything since we last called you what did the boss say had his arm twisted half out of its socket thats what acio said sold him my line a good line and i say it myself we want to see where tango one leads us clean up the whole network bossmand be happier if he was in cuffs but he can stand it because weve the stuff how much was it around seven kilos thats one hell of a load keeper you know what its the same markings on the packets as manvers load that sweetened the boss pill thats the bastard isnt it not knowing the deputy director general sat in the easy chair the more noise we make then the worse it can be for him i mean we can hardly ask the swedes to trot round to the foreign ministry and ask the night duty chappie if theyre interrogating a british desk head who we have reason to believe theyve kidnapped across an international frontier no weve got to sweat on it and youve to make a decision aborting the agents ill decide in the morning you owe it to them to give them time to abort field agents are brave people if theyre lifted they will be lucky to be hanged the director general seemed to miss his stride his eyes closed as if he was in pain didnt you know that when you took the job ill decide in the morning we may have hours hours director general mattie is going to be having their names tortured out of him hes going to be hung up by the fingernails until the names come tumbling out willy nilly it is only a question of when not a question of if or if not in the morning ill make that decision poor old mattie all day he had been suspended from the wall hook he had read about it often enough everyone who studied the affairs of iran knew of this method of extracting confessions he thought it must be a day but he had gone insensible three times he had no track of time the pain in his back his shoulders his ribs was more sharp than had been the pain in the soles of his feet it was a pain as if he were snapping as if he were the dry kindling that he put across his thigh at bibury his left arm was above his left shoulder and then twisted down towards the small of his back his right arm was below the shoulder and then turned up to meet his left arm his wrists were tied with leather thongs knotted tight the thongs were on the wall hook looped over the carcase hook only the toes of his feet were able to touch the floor when the strength of his toes collapsed and he sagged down then the pain was excruciating in his shoulders and his ribs burst it had been better at first his feet swollen bruised had been able to take most of his weight through the day however long the day had been the strength had seeped from his feet the pressure had built upon the contortion of his arms he had gone three times sunk into the foulsmelling heat unconscious they hadnt taken him down they had just thrown water into his face no respite from the hook on the wall ever increasing pain that hacked into his back and his shoulders and his ribs god god couldnt know how his muscles how his body survived the weight or his mind the pain mr furniss what is the point of your obstinacy for what answer in not less than words bloody good question mr furniss the most resolute of the fighters amongst the hypocrites the mko they appear on television and they denounce to the world all of their former comrades all of their former activities how does that happen mr furniss i havent the least idea its not the sort of thing an archaeologist would know about he heard the scratchy hoarseness of his voice the bravest of the hypocrites betray their comrades and their ideals because of pain mr furniss he had seen the photographs he knew what they did to their enemies he had seen videotapes of the confessions ravenrobed women tracksuited men sitting on a dais and lit by the cameras in a gymnasium at the evin gaol and competing with each other to slag off their comrades and their cause and still not escaping the firing squad or the hangman it hurt him to talk getting air down into his lungs so that he could speak brought more pain stabs in his back and shoulders and ribs he mouthed the words no voice in his throat only the twist of his hps he was an academic and his research was concerned with the turkish city of van he remembered one lecturer at the fort he had been an elderly man and his back was bent as though he suffered from curvature of the spine and the fingernails had never grown back over the sheer pink pastel skin he had talked in a thick proud central european accent guttural there had been brave pride in the speakers eyes and above a faded and shined suit he wore the collar of a lutheran pastor they had been told that the speaker had spent the last two years of the second world war in dachau he talked faith he talked about his god he talked about prayer and of the strength that his religion had been to him mattie was not a regular churchgoer not in the way that harriet was when he was in church he bent his knee with the rest of the congregation and he sang in a good voice but he would not have called himself close to his god what a wonderful arm faith had given that speaker in the dreadfulness of dachau mattie was alone as the speaker had been alone in his dachau cell as the disciples had been alone in the face of persecution mattie would have said that his religion was based on a knowledge of what was right what was wrong and he would have said that he was afraid of death because he did not believe himself yet ready to face his maker he wished that he could pray he could not pray because the pain diverted his mind he wondered how that speaker had prayed while the fingernails were ripped off while his spine was damaged mr furniss you are a gentleman this should not be happening to you mr furniss this is the treatment that is proper for the hypocrite scum it does not have to happen for you mr furniss help me help yourself why were you travelling who were you meeting so very simple mr furniss in truth mattie did not think that at that moment he could have spoken the names the names were gone there was only pain in his mind the light was in his face the pain soared when he tried to turn his head away from the light and away from the face of the investigator the investigator sat on a stool not more than four feet from matties cracked dry lips he thought the pain was good he thought that the pain squeezed out of his mind the names of his agents he could smell the cigarettes of the guards they seemed to smoke continuously abruptly the investigator flicked his fingers he slid off his stool and went to the table and began to push his notepads into his case to mattie the expression of the investigator was neither that of annoyance nor was it of pleasure a job of work done mr furniss there is tomorrow and after tomorrow there is another day and after that day there is another each day is worse for you for obstinacy you will pay a high price no mother there is no crisis its just that mattie is a little overdue i am not prepared to discuss matties work with you mother there is no need for you to come mother you cannot come anyway because you would be missing your bridge on friday i am perfectly alright mother im sorry but i really am much too busy to have you come here if there was something wrong then i would have the girls here the girls are not here mother i really do not want to have you come to stay will you listen to me i dont want you here i dont want anyone here i am not crying mother i am just trying to get on with my life she put the telephone down she thought that she had been miserably rude she turned back to the minutes of the previous evenings meeting of the conservation society she tried not to think where he was how he was her mattie at century they would not be expecting a fuss from harriet furniss it would have been she thought in matties file that his wife was psychologically sound it would have been noted that her two children had been born in tehran because she hadnt thought it necessary to come home for the births and there had never been trouble from her when they were in the gulf nor when they were in ankara on short stay it would have been entered in the file that she was a good sort and did well on the embassy circuit the right stuff to be a desk heads consort even so to go these last days without a call from anyone at century was very very hard april one to april five april one to april five april five to april one o k keeper your location the occupier is listed as mr brian venables christ knows what tango one is there for venables works middle rank for thames water understood when do you want relief bill im going nowhere dont argue bill youll have to burn me off him in my locker bill theres a battery razor and some socks i wouldnt mind them what about the others well want backup at dawn were all staying bill token says that in her locker she has a change of kit in a green plastic bag sweet dreams champions april one to april five out the gale from the rotor blades flattened the robes of the mullah against his chest buried the material into the crotch valley between his legs with one hand he clung to the brilliant white onion shape of his turban with the other he steadied the spectacles on his nose there wasafull loadfor the helicopter there was a divisional commander and two staff officers there were casualties and there was the mullah and his bodyguards the light was up on the landing zone harsh and clear and it would be several hours later and when the sun had climbed that the pastel haze would settle over the battlefield by then the sentences would have been carried out they lifted off it was a french helicopter and new and mounts had been welded on at the open doorways to take heavy machine guns to avoid groundtoair missiles from their enemy the helicopter pilot flew low over the rear area of the battlefield it was a killing zone to the east of the iraqi town of basra much fought over the mullah strapped in his canvas seat his back against the hull was a young man in anguish there had been that morning as the red sun had slipped above the flat horizon an artillery barrage some of the worst of the casualties were on the deck of the helicopter their stretchers against his feet and medical orderlies holding drips but the casualties were only those who had been hit close to the landing zone the fortunate few when he twisted his head the mullah could see through the dustsmeared portholes of the helicopter and when he looked straight ahead he could see past the torso of the machinegunner in the open doorway they hugged the flat and featureless ground he saw the old trench lines that had been disputed four five six years before where that dawns shells had burst he saw the angular dead and he saw the stricken faces of the wounded and he saw the stretcher parties running towards them he could see the tanks hull down sheltered in revetments that would stay hull down until there were spare parts nothing grew upon this battlefield where there had been fields there were now just the patterns of the armour tracks where there had been trees there were now only the shellbroken stumps where there had been marsh weed there was now only a yellow mat because the weed had been sprayed with herbicides to kill potential cover for an enemy the helicopter scurried over a rear camp tents and bombproof bunkers and it flew sufficiently low for the mullah to see the faces of the troops who squatted on the ground and stared up they were the same faces that he had seen further forward at the front the night before the sullen gaze that had greeted his speech of exhortation pressed troops afraid to ask with their voices bold enough to demand with their eyes where is the air support where are the tank parts where is the victory when is the end that same morning he had sat in judgment of fifteen recruits who had held back in the last assault on enemy lines young men eyes downcast denounced in monotone by their officers and sentenced by the mullah to field execution there could be no tolerating cowardice the mullah had won his spurs in the service of the imam as one of the investigators of the coup attempted by air force officers of the nouzeh barracks at hamadan he had seen the tears and the pleading of the pilots and he had not been diverted he had achieved good results satisfactory enough results for him to be chosen above many to unravel the plot woven around the great satans attempt to fly a commando force into the country for the release of prisoners from the nest of spies so many traitors to be found and he had found so many he had found those who would have driven the lorries and those who would have made the airbase available and those who had switched off the defensive radar for himself he thought the plan of the great satan was an absurd plan bound to fail the mullah was a devotee of the revolution a child of the ferocity of the revolution he knew no other way when they were out of range of the iraqi groundtoair missiles the helicopter climbed it would fly first to a field hospital after that with two further stops for refuelling the helicopter would fly on to tabriz at the front close to the artillery exchanges he had slept badly on the way to tabriz he dozed fitfully and the straggling thoughts in his mind were of a man known as dolphin brian venables was late leaving home he was late because the guest had been in the bathroom when it should have been clear for him and he was late because his wife had forgotten his breakfast too busy scrambling eggs for the guest and to top it all the look on his pollys face across the kitchen table had been shameless damn near brazen brian venables had not brought up his daughter to have her bring home a foreigner and then have that foreigner creep in the small hours across the landing into his pollys room that was clean out of court and they would talk it out this evening oh yes he went down his neat front path to the newlypainted wrougtiron gate the last of the blossom was still on the trees in the road once wellington street had been a quiet and respectable street but the riffraff were closing in he slammed the gate shut behind him he walked down the pavement he saw the two scruffs inside the car brian venables was a founder member of neighbourhood watch in his road two scruffs sitting in a car and watching the houses he had listened to every word that the wpc had told them when the neighbourhood watch had been introduced they wait for the man to go to work for the children to go to school for the wife to go shopping well those two youngsters were in for a shock he swung on his heel they were watching the house they had seen the man come out on to the pavement with his raincoat and his briefcase then stop turn to go back inside corinthian had said that he had probably forgotten his sandwich box the patrol car came up fast alongside them from behind park swore softly there was the rap on the drivers window driving licence piss off corinthian mouthed o k laddie out corinthian just reached inside his anorak and lifted clear his customs and excise id card he held it up to the uniformed constables face do get lost the constable stiffened full height full authority of his uniform down at our division have they been informed you are on our patch please just go back to your canteen corinthian said the constable tried for a long hard stare didnt find it easy but he went back to his patrol car park had his radio against his mouth his voice was terse april five to april nine and april seven i dont know how bad it is we may have shown out may not on your bloody toes for christs sake out what do you reckon corinthian asked keeper was thinking what bill parrish would have to say to his little keeper if they were blown by the plods he wasnt liking what he was thinking charlie came down the stairs he had heard the telephone ring while he was packing the rucksack he felt pretty good not having slept too well that didnt matter she was a great girl and her mum was good and the breakfast had been brilliant not as brilliant as polly polly was marvellous and her father was a pig he hesitated at the bottom of the stairs because hed thought pollys father had left and now he could hear his voice on the telephone ending a conversation he heard pollys mother querying pollys father he put down the rucksack and listened pollys father said n o the police were not complaining and they had no cause to complain thats what theyre there lor thats what crime prevention is all about two men sitting in a car watching our street that certainly entitles me to know what is going on they have our street under surveillance thats what the police said the health and social security have our street under surveillance looking for those loafers who work on the black cleaning windows and such and then draw unemployment thats what the police said im off then and i trust that your gentleman friend will be gone by this evening charlie beamed at pollys father as they passed in the hall he thought the man was pretty shaken when he knew hed been overheard the door banged pollys mother starting to wash up said thats quite ridiculous you cant get a window cleaner round here for love nor money the smile was gone from charlies face pollys father had said surveillance he felt he had been kicked in the stomach she came into the hall and she had a happy light in her face he felt the shiver in his legs and the sweat on his stomach surveillance he heard the clatter of the dishes whats at the back the garden and the garage and theres another road has to be another road dumb head or there wouldnt be a garage why do you want to know she was owed it and she wouldnt get it an explanation he carried the rucksack into the kitchen formally because that was the way he had been taught as a child he thanked pollys mother for her hospitality he opened the kitchen door and walked through into the garden she followed him she caught him down by the small vegetable patch her fathers joy are they watching for you charlie it doesnt help you to know it is for you why charlie its a long story and there isnt enough time he should have been gone if they were watching the front then they might have the back covered she had hold of his hand what have you done wrong nothing everything mr shabro told me what had been done to your family he said that you werent capable of friendship gently he took away his hand from her perhaps one night well go dancing dance till its morning you have to believe that id like that is that a lie charlie no its not sweet polly the more you tell someone the more you involve someone the more you involve them then the more you open them to hurt its best left unsaid will i see you again charlie caressed her cheek well dance all night promised am i not old enough to know is that it a bitterness a choke in her voice it would hurt you to know he kissed her he felt the sweetness of her perhaps one night they would go dancing he ran out of the back of the garden there was a grim satisfaction in it for keeper theyd all sweated each of them on the track that had lost the tango then found him again token had done well when hed come out of the garage and gone fast to the right and then turned in midstride token had done well to keep walking and go straight past him token said shed been close enough to rub the sleepy dust out of the tangos eye and shed said that she found him quite dishy harlech had done well because the tango had climbed on a bus and then hopped off at the lights and doubled back harlech had done a terrific job because hed been fast enough on the radio for the car to pick the tango up corinthian had tracked the tango down on to the underground and stayed with him for the train jump predictable but tricky then tokens turn again in her reversible anorak with headscarf and the glasses with no power in the lenses between them theyd held on to him all the way to kings cross main line station it was keepers opinion that the tango was trying what he thought were good evasion tactics and keeper reckoned he was a rank amateur good instinct and poor training but he wasnt complaining he sat on the intercity he could see the back of the tangos head harlech was way down the carriage and he would be able to see the top of the tangos forehead and token was in the carriage behind keeper and corinthian was in the carriage ahead going very smooth hammering at a hundred miles an hour plus on the rails heading north david reckoned that the tango might have nodded off his pillow the rucksack which had to hold the best part of a quarter of a million pounds in cash unless mr venables had it and that didnt seem likely not if he was tipping off the constabulary better get statesman in to give the gnomes the once over after dark mattie furniss knew it was late at night it seemed an age since they had carried away the tray on which his supper plate had been and the glass of water they came for him when he was lying on his bed when he had taken off his trousers and he had pulled the blanket over his body to hide his nakedness from the peephole his underpants were hanging over the bottom of the bedframe to dry it had been a hideous day he had been waiting for the rattle of the door and the sight of the men come to take him down to the cellar there had only been the tray with his food in the early morning and the tray for his food in the early evening he had heard a car come in what he had judged to be the middle of the day and he had heard voices outside and he thought that he had heard the voice of the investigator but they had not come for him he could walk just about on his own the soles of his feet were heavily swollen but he had learned a rolling gait that would take him over a short distance he was hunched from the strain that had been put on his shoulders when at last they came they had not allowed him time to put on his trousers nor the pants nor his socks between his guards mattie furniss went down the stairs he wore only his shirt he was hobbling and bent he was beyond reach of help he was going towards pain down the stairs and into the hallway and his instinctive turn was to the left towards the doorway to the cellar he was pulled to the right he stumbled and fell they let him go down and his knees felt the coolness of the tiled floor they jerked him up and on to his feet and the pain shivered through him they took him through a kitchen there were moths arcing around the light bulb that had no shade there were two large metal pots on an electric cooker and on the table there were plates laid out with salads at the side he saw the food that was unlike anything that was brought on the trays to his prison room he was frogmarched through the kitchen and out into the glare of the lights in what he thought must be the yard at the back of the house the light came from the headlamps of a mercedes car the lights threw a bright wash across the yard and against the wall of concrete blocks he thought the height of the wall was a foot or so above the height of his own head had he been standing erect and not been bent by the pain in his shoulders and ribs that too was instinctive that he checked the height of the wall many scenes now all fast in his mind he saw the pockmarks where bullets had struck the wall and the holes were in a group that was only three four feet across he saw the guard who cradled a rifle probably a soviet ak across his elbow he saw the investigator standing with his hands deep in the pockets of his trousers he saw a young cleric with the turban of brilliant white and the camel hair cape and the thinrimmed spectacles it was done as if it were a routine in which the only character who didnt know his part was mattie and he was learning so fast no talk the sounds of the engine of the mercedes tilling and of the scrape of matties feet across the hard earth yard the feet scraped because he was losing the power to walk going jelly in the legs across the yard to the place in the wall with the bullet holes they had to drag him the use was gone from his legs thinking of harriet who was his wife thinking of the cottage that was his home wanting to plead and wanting to cry and the voices strangled in his throat against the wall the guards loosed his arms he collapsed the dirt was on his knees and on his arms and on his chest death was grovelling in the dirt yard of a villa on the outskirts of tabriz death was choking in the night air beyond the reach of help death was feeling the slackening of the gut muscles death was the metallic crack as a soviet rifle was cocked there was a hand in his hair and his head was wrenched upwards and his body weight was taken so that he was left in a kneeling position and the cold damp dirt of the yard cloyed on his privates too frightened to pray like that lutheran pastor would have prayed thinking of all those who were too far from him to help him but closer than the god he hadnt troubled to know thinking of the men at century and flossie duggan thinking of harriet alone in the cottage at bibury where the spring was over and the summer was coming and of will who would be coming soon to cut the grass around the apple trees thinking of the agents in tehran and tabriz and the harbourmasters office in bandar abbas thinking of char he who should have been his son they would all see the morning they would all know the freshness of another day the morning and another day they were beyond his reach against the back of his neck where his hair thinned out was the pressure of the barrel of the rifle there was a pain prick from the foresight no questions no demand for names he opened his eyes he saw the face of the investigator and the face of the cleric expressionless he was shaking and as his neck rolled so the muzzle of the weapon followed there was the firing click his ears exploded his stomach failed he rolled fell collapsed he was on the dirt in the yard and his mouth gaped and bit at the filth mattie heard the low chuckle of the investigator his eyes opened he gazed into the clerics face he saw a silently mirthless smile he was pulled to his feet his urine had run down the length of his thighs and had stained the dirt he couldnt speak couldnt help himself up he made no attempt to cover himself as they took him back into the kitchen and past the cooker where a meal was in preparation and up the stairs and back to his prison room he was their toy on his bed he wept the names were in his mind in his mind were the names of the agents and the name of charlie eshraq mattie could recognise it all the shredding of his will to light from his room he could see the west face of the clock big lien showing a couple of minutes past midnight he had slept on the decision and he had killed a whole day on the decision he had taken advice but the decision was his he could keep his options open no longer he went down to the thirteenth floor he didnt knock he went straight into the room a very strange noise in the room stopped him in his tracks past midnight in central london and the sounds were of the countryside at dawn theyd put old henry carter on night duty finding a job for henry in the twilight of his service at century was putting him on night duty in the room used by the crisis management committee there was a camp bed over by the window the man wore long combination underpants and a woollen vest with short sleeves and buttons at the throat typical of whitehall typical of government service that a crisis management committee should wind up once it was past midnight as a solitary individual past retirement if he wasnt mistaken sitting in ancient underclothes and listening to god knew what the man was quick off the bed and was straight into his suit trousers and was hooking on the braces over his vest didnt bother with his shirt there was an expensive radio on the floor and a cassette was playing through it a sharp note on the track amongst what to the director general was a clatter of noise and he saw the attention of henry carter waver then disappear a moment of bliss on his face he switched off the machine sorry sir bless you for your patience phylloscopus inornatus thats the yellowbrowed warbler a little beauty i did the tape in norfolk last weekend i thought i had her never can be sure very intense very penetrating call did you hear it sir just off to siberia for the summer remarkable little lady apologies you didnt come in here to listen to a yellowbrowed warbler the director general handed over a single sheet of paper in his own hand his own signature carter read it he hadnt his close work glasses on and he had to hold his spectacles away from his face to get a clear focus youll not mind me saying it sir but its a wee bit late you dont have a drink in here do you henry took a bottle of scotch from a cupboard and two glasses and he poured two liberal scoops the director general drank deep i know weve warned them sir but weve taken an awful time to tell them to run big step carter dismantling a network a bigger step when that network is down to three agents and will take years to rebuild i just pray to god theyve got time furniss hes trained to withstand pressure interesting usage pressure sir for christs sake we are talking about the dismantling of a network no sir if youll excuse me we are talking about pressure hes been trained please ill have the other half the glass was taken filled handed back oh yes sir hes been trained he was very good at the fort one of the best lecturers theyve had there but my experience is that training and the real thing are wholly different the director general shuddered his hands were tight on the glass how long can he hold out thats what i need to be sure of hes a man ive been proud to know for more than twenty years but if hes in iran its asking rather a lot of him that he hold out this long the director general headed for the lift and his car home he left henry carter to the business of sending the messages that would instruct the three agents to take flight i am matthew furniss i am the iran desk head at century house it was said it was as if they were all exhausted as if a birth had taken place and mattie was the mother and the investigator was the midwife and the confession was the child he could see into the investigators face and there was running sweat on the mans face and red blotches from his exertion and the breath came hard to the investigator mattie lay strapped on the bed he could see into the face of the investigator as the man reeled away as if hed run more distance than he could cope with and the heavy duty flex sagged from the mans hand he could not take any more of the heavy duty flex on the soles of his feet the pain ran up from his feet and into his knees and into his thighs and up into his stomach in his stomach the pain spread out and burst into every particle of him the pain was in his mind and his mind could take nothing more it was done matthew furniss it was as if they had all been on a great journey together there was mattie who had endured he no longer knew how many days there were the guards who had started the day playing football with him blindfolded punching and kicking him from one to the other and heaving him against the damp scrape of the cellar walls there was the investigator who sweated because of the force he had used to beat the soles of matties feet all on a great journey together and the guards and the investigator had broken mattie and mattie was strapped to the bed and needing to talk to save himself from the pain the investigator gripped the side of his table for support then steadied himself and breathed in a gulp of the cellars foul hot air all the body smells were trapped in the cellar he levered himself along the side of the table and threw the switch on the tape recorder that morning had been different as if everything else that had gone before had been childs play no breakfast brought down to the cellar while it was still dark outside a long age hanging from the wall hook until the pain in his shoulders had given way to agony then the football then the beating with the heavy duty flex as if they were now bored with him as if they had other business to be about and could spare mattie no more time so simple to speak the words the hammering of new pain had ceased and the taperecorder was turning and the investigator was sitting at the table and the guards had pulled back to the wall and there was the rank sweet smoke of their cigarettes at that moment there was no thought in the mind of mattie furniss other than the killing of the rising pain the pain stayed where it was the guards came from behind and they unstrapped the thongs that held down his legs and his wrists they let him he free on the bed he must be a pitiful sight not mattie furniss at all he had not washed not after having been brought back from the yard the previous evening his hair was unkempt and filthy his lips were parched grey and cracked his eyes were big and starring and racing they had broken him he curled his knees to his chest and tried to control the pain that was all over his body broken but free from the beating well done mr furniss that was the hardest mr furniss mid the worst is now past mattie talked about century he could see from the eyes of the man that little that he said was not previously known he spoke in a slow wheezing monotone there was no character no wit he was a tour guide at the end of a long season the investigator had pulled up his chair close to mattie and he was hunched forward so that his face dominated mattie sometimes the investigator repeated what mattie had said as if that way he ensured that the microphone picked up the words with greater clarity the investigator took no notes to have written on a notepad would have deflected the concentration that now settled over mattie he talked about the budget that was given to iran desk and he talked about the resources that could be made available to iran desk from the station officers in ankara and baghdad and dubai and abu dhabi and bahrain all the old loyalties all he stood for beaten from him he heard the drone of his own voice hed done them well hed stayed silent longer than they could have counted on there was nothing that he should be ashamed of hed given them time to save the field men he was given a glass of water he held it in his two hands and the water slopped down his shirt front when he tried to drink and his lips were rigid like plastic sheeting hed won them time they should be thankful for what that precious time had cost him mattie gave the name his business is on bazar e abbas abad he could see him clearly he was hugely fat sat on a reinforced chair in the back office behind a cave of merchandise and held court over cigars and coffee he was a connoisseur of carpets and a collector of gossip and he was a field agent of century from far back mattie had known the merchant for twenty years and it was matties joke each time they met that he couldnt get his arms round his old friend when they hugged a greeting there was gossip to be had from the merchant about the rivalries of the army colonels about the interfactional fighting amongst the mullahs about the industrialists squabbling for foreign exchange with which to buy overseas plant every time they met then mattie laughed and sometimes the choicest of the gossip if it were of matters sexual could even bring a smile to those witheringly dull fellows from the agency across the ocean he had known the merchant since he had been a liaison officer in tehran and there was a rug in front of the fire in the cottage at bibury that had cost him an arm and a leg and the last time he had been seriously angry with harriet had been when she had put a wet pine log on that fire that had spat a knot on to the rug mattie named the merchant and they brought a damp towel to put across the soles of his feet to quieten the anger of the pain another name he works in the harbourmasters office at bandar abbas when he was station officer in tehran he had once made the long road journey south and he had been sure that he had thrown off the tail of the s a v a k agents that was supposed to be with him and he had gone to the home of the official from the harbourmasters office the man had been recruited by a previous station officer and until the revolution had been of minimal importance and maintained only because he did not want money he was pure gold now a field agent in the office which observed the comings and goings of merchant shipping in and out of the countrys chief port he had gone to the mans small brick house he had sweated and sat on a floor rug and wondered why the ventilation chimney seemed so inadequate in the blasting gulf heat on that occasion after the wife had scurried in with a tray and glasses holding diluted lime juice and scurried out the official had told mattie that he was a democrat and therefore opposed to the regime of the shah of shahs the revolution had come the official had found no democracy from the clerics he had stayed on the list of active agents and he had begun to grow in importance a small frightened man who believed that the work he carried out for mattie was a short step in the long road to bring parliamentary rule to his country a sandwich with sweet cheese was brought for the prisoner another name given he runs a repair workshop in tabriz for lorries and he also has contracts to keep the revolutionary guards vehicles on the road a basic and human individual a man who might have been in matties eyes almost a european the engineer was the sort of fellow who was always popular perpetually in demand and he worked all the hours that his god gave him the engineer had been recruited in turkey a good and active station officer long before this academic boy in the job now had sought him out in a cafe and talked to him when he was over for the collection of a brokendown lorry that would need a new gear box that station officer had been lucky the son of the engineers close friend had been shot in the old gaol in tabriz after a cursory trial by the komiteh the engineer had been ready for recruitment the engineers pay went into an account at the etibank in van and it was matties business to know that the credit mounted and was never reduced perhaps there was a day on some far horizon in his mind when the engineer would drive out his truck with his family hidden amongst a cargo it was useful the information provided by the engineer in any time that approached normality it would have been second grade but they were not normal times and iran desk were pretty damn thankful to have anything coming out of iran mattie had been given a glass of water and a damp towel again soothed the soles of his feet it was a good hotel charlie could sleep on the pavements with the dossers when he had to not for the sake of it the room was a night and the best that leeds could provide he locked the door behind him he went along the landing he was carrying his rucksack by the straps the two straps twisted around his wrist he wore his cleanest slacks a clean shirt and a navy blazer there was a man at the end of the corridor in jeans and a sweatshirt polishing hard at the muzzle of a fire hose he didnt look at charlie and went on with his polishing pretty damn obvious charlie understood what could be so compelling about getting a shine on to a fire hose nozzle a lift was waiting for him he came out into the hotel lobby too crowded for him to spot the watchers and he wasnt hanging around to search them out he knew what he was at he strode across the lobby not looking right and not looking left went as though he belonged and hadnt a care in the world he pushed his way through the revolving doors then hesitated it was colder up in the north than in london there were taxis waiting in line engines off he paused on the pavement he moved sharply he ducked back through the swing doors and across the lobby to the staircase he went up the stairs three at a time six flights to climb he went up the stairs like there was no tomorrow and took the last flight that was to the roof and he put his shoulder against the stiffness of the fire escape door he stepped out on to the flat roof he skirted the air conditioning machinery he had no interest in a fine view over factories or the brick terraces or the munificence of the victorian civic buildings and churches he went to the edge of the roof he looked down on to the street below he could see the line of parked taxis his eyes roved he saw a green saloon that was behind the taxis he could see that there were two people in the front seats and there was the exhaust showing that the engine was idling he saw that the man who had been polishing the nozzle of the fire hose was now across the street and his lips were moving and there was no one close enough to hear him in his bath charlie had remembered that he was a friend of mr furniss he was going to piss on them where the hell is he went back up the fire stairs i know he went up the bloody stairs where did he go he was coming out and he just turned round ive got eyes myself where is he now harlech was across the road from the front of the hotel corinthian was stranded in the hotel lobby token was round the back not a whistle of him here there was the local joker in the sierra to drive keeper thought he was going to be a disaster because he was v a t and v a t investigators were the pits when the head office came up from the big city they had to put up with whatever they could get and they needed a local man for the driving the v a t man said not a bad start to the day the repartee insult was rising in keeper the interruption the insult never spoken corinthian into keepers earpiece april eleven to april five our tango one is in the lobby heading for the front door going through the front door you should be picking him up your lucky day the vat man said keeper saw charlie come through the swing doors he felt the relief jar through him he saw the target walk towards the first taxi on the rank holding the rucksack it had been keepers opinion that tango one was a rank amateur but he didnt know why the target had gone back into the hotel and he didnt know what he had done there and he didnt know whether they had all shown out and he was no longer sure how amateur the target was they followed the taxi out of the rank he told the v a t man that he didnt need a running commentary on the splendours of leeds thank you and he had to shout at the joker to let token through with the backup car and neither token nor harlech acknowledged them as they went by and took up prime station behind the taxi they had the message too perhaps the target was not such a rank amateur after all herbert stone was used to dealing with middle trade businessmen and government representatives the boy fitted no pattern that he was used to middle trade businessmen came to him from hamburg or rotterdam or barcelona because he had earned a reputation for discretion and efficiency for putting paperwork into place with speed government representatives arrived at his office once a vicarage because they depended on his discretion in placing hardware in the hands of people they could not acknowledge he dealt with corporations and institutions not with bearded young men who wore yellow socks and who sauntered in with rucksacks for heavens sake and the kid seemed relaxed as if it were the most normal thing in life to take an intercity north and then come and chat about taking delivery of armourpiercing hardware herbert stone followed the principles of the shavian andrew undershaft he would do business with anyone offer a realistic price not trouble himself with principles or politics and the young man had given mattie furniss name and furnisss office had confirmed the connection century put quite a bit of business his way matters too delicate for public knowledge there had not been as many belfast produced blowpipe shoulderfired groundtoair missiles in the mountain valleys of afghanistan as there had been californian built stingers but the british had been there their warheads had joined the fireworks and stone had been the conduit used by century to get the missiles into the hands of the mujahidin never mind that they generally made a hash of them he would be wary cautious but never dismissive in a neat hand in pencil he wrote down the detail of charlie eshraqs order it was a pleasant airy office there was no illustration of any matter military on the walls just watercolour originals of the yorkshire dales he might have been noting the necessary information prior to the issuing of a personal accident policy if im to help you and im not at this stage saying that i can if im to help you then there has to be a degree of frankness between us yes if you lie to me then i might just lie to you your problem you have to trust me but i am recommended by mr furniss thats your guarantee true that was on the youngsters side and a surety for him too what country do you mean to operate in where will the weaponry be used iran no whistle in the teeth no pursing of the lips and the delivery point past turkish customs i collect in turkey what targets for armourpiercing first target is an armoured mercedes series after that i do not at the moment know not all to be fired in one engagement charlie paused considered each one different perhaps more vehicles not tanks perhaps buildings the scratching of stones pencil i see so what should i have for the first time stone was shaken a small puzzled frown escaped him you dont know what you want im not a soldier what should i have everyone who came and sat in stones office knew what they wanted problem was could they get it they wanted howitzers or mm mortars they wanted white phosphorus shells or groundtoair they wanted attack helicopters or a claymore system of ground defence none of them his clients ever asked his advice on what they should have do you have any military experience mr eshraq none the pencil stopped hovered but it was none of his business light antitank weapon its called law how many are we talking about charlie said three maybe four stone looked up from his notes i see we are talking about a relatively ah small order yes there was a crocodile of barges going down the thames and seagulls hovering in chaos over the cargo the deputy director general was concise you wont know this man this stone but hes used by us hes an arms dealer reliable sort of fellow right now charlie eshraq is sitting in his office and trying to place an order for a handful of law missiles i was never in the forces what do they do they bust tanks stone rang through two or three days ago to check on furniss reference miss duggan told me this and i asked stone to ring me as soon as eshraq uppeared hes trying to buy these missiles to take back with him into iran does he get them or not the seagulls swirled in aerial combat over the barges it would be an illegal exportation no doubt yes but were not squeamish presumably he brought buck heroin in order to pay for these weapons as soon as he has the weapons hell be going back inside shows extraordinary courage the director general had a son at university studying philosophy and allergic to the lawn mower i like young people with purpose and guts thats eshraq in full give them to him give him this antitank whatever the deputy director general grimaced quite but it ignores the problem what problem the problem of mattie furniss the problem of mattie talking spilling under torture what he knows about his agents and about his young protege got me the director general swung away from the window swivelled his chair i tell you what i think i think mattie is a very experienced and dedicated officer i think hes of the old school i think hed go to his grave rather than betray his network the deputy director general murmured thats just not realistic sir i am afraid all we know today about interrogation techniques tells us that he will inevitably brave as he unquestionably is talk would it help you to meet with our own interrogators have them to tell you what exactly is being done to mattie it would not it is simply that i have a greater faith in the resilience of an old dog and furthermore you stand there lecturing me as though you know for certain that furniss is in an iranian torture chamber well you dont we dont we havent the least idea where he is he may have been kidnapped by turkish thugs who havent the slightest notion who he is he may be with some freelance outfit who simply want to ransom him tell me if you would how long it has generally taken for any of the extremist sects in beirut to announce the capture of hostages theyre on to a telephone to reuter before you can count to ten or there is no word for months there is no pattern about which we can be definite so well just play it my way if you dont mind so what is your instruction the director general said eshraq is to have his missiles he is to be encouraged to return to iran give him any help he needs without tripping over the customs people if you can the deputy director general swearing silently flushed at the cheeks went back to his office and spoke to herbert stone parrish pounded down the fifth floor corridor of the lane those who saw him through open office doors and those who flattened themselves against the corridor walls to give him room wondered whether hed got the trots or whether hed heard the four minute warning he charged into the acios office and the acio had an audit team with him and none of the audit team complained just packed their briefcases and left the door closed behind bill parrish he didnt wait to collect his thoughts gather in his breath just had park on from leeds right park is with eshraq right eshraq is currently sitting in the office of one herbert stone mr stone sells weapons eshraq is buying weapons thats the strength of it hes using heroin money to buy weapons this is going too far eshraqs run enough its time to knock the bugger over the acio rang through to the cio and while he was talking parrish loosened his tie and thought he was too old for this sort of caper far too bloody old the voice was in her ear im terribly sorry mrs furniss i really am sorry but i just cannot talk about it on the telephone its an open line you see they havent been in touch with you its a scandal i know i shouldnt say this mrs furniss but the day of the gentleman is past here mrs furniss please dont ever say to anyone that i spoke to you they dont know what to do they know that mr furniss was kidnapped in turkey they believe that he was then taken into iran after that they dont know anything theyve set up a committee to watch developments but theyve staffed it with fools people like that old idiot carter i mean mrs furniss those sort of people are not competent enough i was taken up to see the director general he had me in his office he is not a gentleman mrs furniss i hold him responsible what he was interested in was all i knew about charlie you see mr furniss kept all his files on charlie in his personal safe didnt let them go down to library and didnt iet me put them on any computer roll which anyone else could plug into they were very concerned about charlie to tell you the truth mrs furniss they seemed more concerned about charlie than they were about mr furniss mrs furniss i dont know what it is his trouble but charlie is in some sort of trouble very deep id swear on that its disgraceful mrs furniss them not being in touch with you every day should be in touch with you two or three times a day i have to ring off goodbye mrs furniss mr furniss has a great many friends here and they are all thinking of you goodbye she was grateful to kind miss duggan when she was a child before she had been sent away to school her parents had employed a flossie duggan as a nanny a nice soft woman with a big bosom and a well of loyalty mattie used to say that at century life would not be worth living if he didnt have flossie duggan to take care of him harriet furniss would not have called herself a service wife rather described herself as a service widow the service had no room for wives in more than twenty years since mattie had come out of the coldstreams and joined the service she had never set foot inside century how could she have done she had never even been allowed to drive to the corner on the embankment and wait to collect him after work she had never been to a social function that involved century people the only person that she knew at century was flossie duggan because flossie would once or twice a year come down to bibury and type up a report over a weekend if it had to be on the dgs desk or the ddgs desk first thing on a monday morning the life of the service was a closed book to her little boys playing secretive games but dangerous games so hideously dangerous that mattie was a prisoner in iran and she had good memories of iran she remembered when they had been young and together there when she had been the young mother of two small girls the swimming trips to the caspian in the summer and the skiing trips to the elborz in the winter when the future was stable and set to last for a millennium it had been a lovely country kind and welcoming and comfortable infuriating too because it had aped europe and of course she couldnt get a plumber or an electrician never for love and rarely for money endless dinners by candlelight because as night followed day it was inevitable her social calendar would be dogged by power failures she looked out into her garden it was time to strip the wallflowers from the beds but the rain was beating on the windowpanes she loved her garden in summer she could picture mattie pacing the lawn and then coming inside to tell her bluff and stiff because he could never handle matters that were emotional that juliette eshraq had been hanged from a crane in a square in tabriz she would never forget that how he had walked backwards and forwards past the lupins and pinks and stocks before he had come inside to tell her of the execution of the girl she had known as a cheeky and darling child perched on her knee and what could miss duggan have meant about charlie being in trouble and why did the service know anything about charlie he was bound to call when he came back from his trip overseas she would get him down to the cottage and ask him straight out she wasnt going to let charlie get himself mixed up with century that would be unbearable she thought of her man darling mattie everybodys friend her husband later she would go down to the post office for some stamps and if she were asked then she would put on a smile and say that mattie was fine just abroad for a few days and before she went to the post office there were more circulars to send about the footpath she was a service widow and she would be good at it mattie would expect that herbert stone had the brochure on the desk in front of him its just what you want mr eshraq and its the best of british technology very much up to date only been in service with our own forces for a few months provides an exceptional hit and kill capability for its size and weight outstanding accuracy against both fixed and moving targets is achieved using a builtin spotting rifle high technology warhead provides excellent kill probabilities from all angles of attack not complicated to teach zero maintenance sounds pretty good and it is itll get through mm of armour it has an effective range of metres and the whole thing weighs only ten kilos the beauty of law mr eshraq is in the spotting rifle you fire a tracer round you get a hit you depress the main firing button and away you go if this is designed to take out a main battle tank then it goes without saying mr eshraq that it will make a frightful mess of an armoured mercedes what is it going to cost me lets have a drink youd like a drink mr eshraq what will it cost expensive how much right mr eshraq no drink just the figures were talking about a round half dozen correct no four herbert stones voice did not waver there was no apology im quoting you for four what does that include herbert stone had seen that the young man hadnt blinked hadnt gagged each missile would cost the army thats for ordinary bulk dealing you are not ordinary and you are not bulk and if i had not just spoken to a colleague of mr furniss you and i would not be dealing at all you have a good friend young man but even with friends there are complications you dont want all the seamy details do you you just want delivery through customs at istanbul for that money you get four missiles dont worry yourself with the details mr eshraq four missiles at fifty thousand pounds right said stone and made a swift note charlie bent over and he lifted his rucksack on to his knee he delved into it he laid on the edge of the desk a dirty shirt and two pairs of dirty socks and then his washing bag from the bottom of the rucksack he drew out a plastic bag he pushed the washing bag and the socks and the dirty shirt to one side and from the plastic bag he took the first wad of notes wrapped by an elastic band other wads followed a less experienced businessman might have showed surprise hut stone had the first wad in his hand and was counting twentypound notes one hundred notes in each wad the heaps of notes moved from the side of the desk where charlie sat with his laundry across to stones side twentyfive wads of notes on the desk top and charlie lifted the bag back into the bottom of his rucksack and covered it with his clothes and his washing bag thats it thank you the money was shovelled fast into stones safe mr stone what are the complications that cost so much extra please it was a reasonable question and that was how stone treated it youre better off without details mr eshraq details tend to get messy in the wrong hands i have to have a cut they have to come off the tail of a truck and someone has to put them on a truck and someone has to make the paperwork right and someone has to find a bit of room on a lorry one or two palms to be crossed at frontiers on the way to turkey and someone has to make sure istanbul doesnt look that closely at whats coming through there are quite a lot of people who would go to prison for quite a long time that adds up to the difference as you think of it above per weapon charlie said in that price in the load id like there to be included three wholesale cartons of bath soap the best there is whatever mrs stone would recommend can you manage that yes i believe we can manage that ill give you my number in london youll call as soon as you are ready charlies eyes narrowed if they were tampered with if they didnt work i think we can let mr furniss be our mutual surety dont you mr eshraq park said if we dont get into colombia and start to hit the bastards in their own backyard then were going to lose its the americans who are at the sharp end at the moment but our turns coming we wont avoid the really big cocaine traffic if we dont act much more positively the demands here for the lunch time snort and that demandll grow in london just as its grown in new york do you know that theres a guy in medellin thats in colombia who has a fortune estimated at two billion dollars thats cocaine money we have to go in get stuck in on the ground we cant just be sitting at southampton and dover and heathrow the vat investigator chewed gum and said myself i never reckoned to change the world between nine and five five days a week we have to beat the power of these bastards did you know that there was a justice minister of colombia and when he quit he was given the job of ambassador to hungary and he was shot there in hungary thats the power of the bastards thats whats got to be beaten good luck the vat investigator took the gum from his mouth put it in the ashtray so youre off to bogota if i can get there me im looking forward to staying in leeds and sorting out the fiddles of mr gupta and the corner shop park said havent you ever wanted to do anything that mattered smart talk makes a change we dont get much smart talk up here terrorism thats crap compared with the drugs threat and thats not recognised are you married what of it the v a t man settled comfortably in his seat and peeled another strip of gum he said airily your good lady is she going to bogota he didnt answer park had the camera at the window he photographed charlie leaving through the front door and when he had the photographs then he was on the radio and alerting his team corinthian passed them on foot and in the mirror he saw harlech and token in the backup motor tango one was walking back towards the centre of the city and the rucksack was trailing from his hand and the tail was on him david park had them all keyed they couldnt let the target run much more not now that he was into weaponry and too damn right he was going to get himself to bogota when this target was knocked been right to let him run up to now but all changed once hed started talking hardware too damn right he didnt know if ann would be with him you asked to be kept informed the acio said so i am informing you that it is our intention to arrest eshraq when will this be tomorrow at four am the home secretary lowered his eyes you could do me a favour what sort of favour sir you could allow me to consult consult home secretary the case is per cent rock solid no no i dont mean on a point of law youve run a splendid show ive nothing but admiration for the way its been handled no its not that its its well frankly its odd but its turned political and i need to consult upwards theres nothing odd about that sir it started out political turn the country upside down chaps bring in the pusher bring in the dealer spare no expense bring the distributor to book scrap every other investigation and we did and i rather think my job was on the line if we didnt well home secretary we did weve got him this heroin importer this degenerate killer the man who carried in the stuff which miss lucy barnes killed herself with or are the political fortunes of mr barnes so wonderfully on the wane that heroin has been struck from the political agenda commissioner i am totally sympathetic to your point of view believe me ill believe you home secretary if and only if you fight our corner youve got well i am in danger of revising that because you are a politician and you have nothing the country you are elected to serve has got a dedicated a passionately dedicated investigation division they earn peanuts they work twice as hard as you do they get no perks hardly any holidays and they deliver they deliver and you want to consult i take in what you say the acio took out his small notepad he wrote down his home telephone number four am sir you can reach me at home this evening but well be rooting fpr you sir dont let us down it was a slow process getting the messages to the field agents some messages could be sent over coded inserts into broadcasts of the bbcs world service but an order to close shop abandon ship must be delivered by hand terence snow was to send a low level but reliable man to tabriz the station officer in bahrain had to find someone to fly to tehran the station officer in abu dhabi had to find a dhow owner to ferry the message across the treacherous gulf waters to bandar abbas of course it would have been quicker to have enlisted the help of the agency but then it would also have had to be explained that mr matthew furniss desk head iran had been lost and that was news that century were unwilling to share with the americans a matter of dirty linen made public charlie slept in his hotel the plastic bag under his pillow the green ford sierra was outside the hotel the vat investigator had gone home and keeper was asleep across the back seat with the vodaphone cradled in his arms harlech and corinthian and token had the room across the corridor from the target and would be on twohour shifts watching the door keeper was well asleep when the vodaphone warbled in his ear that you keeper bill yes its me are you sitting comfortably no knock tomorrow got that no lift in the morning for christs sake bill i said no knock tomorrow why not david the tablets just come flying off the mountain and i pass on the messages i dont fucking believe it what more do they want what they do not want is for the target to be lifted i hear you you cuddled up with token i am bloody not good thing do us all a favour give your missus a bell will you i gave her my promise that youd be back for the dance sweet dreams keeper just ring your missus in the morning and you do not lift the target the boot went in and the fist there was a hand snaking into matties hair in order to pull up his head so that it was easier to punch him kick him so that it was harder for him to protect himself he was trying to tell them the name but his lungs were emptied by the beatings into his stomach pit and he had not the breath to shout the name his throat was too raw to speak the name if he told them the name then the beating and the kicking would stop the man was too good to have been fobbed off with three names mattie had known why the beating had started again he had shown the flicker of success he thought he had won small victories with three names the investigator had read him buying off the pain of a beating with three names but three names was the sliding slope it was what mattie would have taught at the fort once the names start then the walls come tumbling in he had no more defence he had used all the tricks that he knew of the last trick had been the feigning of unconsciousness and the cigarette end lit on the skin under his armpit tender had blown away the deceit in a scream of pain he knelt on the floor his arms hung at his side there was the taste of his blood in his mouth and there was a tooth socket for his tongue to rest in he hated the men that he had named the pain and the shame had been brought down on him because he had known their names the fist in his hair held his head upright and they punched and slapped his face and they buffeted the bridge of his nose so that there were tears in his eyes and they kicked his stomach and his groin for mattie the only way of ending the pain was to surrender the name he had thought he could satisfy them with three names and he had failed his arms flailed around him as if he tried to drive them back if he did not drive them back away from him then he could not draw the breath into his lungs and the saliva down into his throat and he could not name the name he did not see the flick finger gesture of the investigator he was not aware that the hand was no longer in his hair and that his body had buckled he saw only the investigators face his chest heaved the breath flooded into his body you killed his sister did i mr furniss you tortured her you killed her who did i torture who did i kill his sister hes going to get you for his sister where is he going to come from to get to me coming from u k coming through turkey coming through the dogubeyezit frontier post how is he going to get to me for what i did to his sister armourpiercing missile for you and the mullah who sentenced his sister who is the mullah who sentenced his sister i dont know how will he come here to get to me papers papers of the pasdaran where do the papers come from istanbul where in istanbul from a hairdressing shop in the aksaray district it is just to the right of the mirelaon church it is the only hairdresser there when is he coming with his papers from the hairdressing shop very soon would he be known to me my hopeful assassin you knew his sister you tortured her there were two guards that took her to the execution he shot them in tehran the executioner of tabriz he blew him up bomb on a car roof youll know him mr furniss what is his name he knelt at the feet of the investigator his head was bowed down to his knees from his clothes there was the smell of vomit in his nose was the smell god forgive me what is his name harriet please harriet forgive me his name mr furniss charlie you cant know what theyve done to me the pain charlie the name hes coming to get to you for what you did to his sister hes charlie his name is charlie eshraq well get the doctor to you thank you mr furniss it was morning there was enough of a knife line of light at the edge of the plywood over the window to tell mattie that it was morning another day he rolled a little on the bed and his knees were hunched against his stomach as if he still needed to protect himself from the boots and the fists he could feel the tightness of the bandages around his feet and there was the irritation of the stitch that the doctor had put into his lower lip at first he was too frightened to move because he believed that any movement any slight movement would hurt him with the movements of his muscles and his limbs he was like a man walking in a darkened room hesitating and testing he went from his side to his back and he lay on his back and looked at the ceiling light the ceiling light was always brilliant bright enough for him to have to sleep with the blanket pulled over his head from his back he manoeuvred himself across to his other side all of his concentration his determination had gone into those movements he had managed the movements he rolled back until his spine was against the mattress he gazed at the light bulb that was recessed into the ceiling and that threw a trellis of faint shadows through the mesh that protected it he closed his eyes not bloody much to show for it a couple of bandages and a single stitch and aches all over his body not bloody much for cracking for talking his eyes were squeezed shut he tried to shut out all that was around him pretty damn easily hed talked more easily than hed have believed less hurt than hed have thought possible he could move from his side to his back and to his other side and on to his stomach the pain was to have cracked and not been hurt that was agony what had he said a hazed memory the memory was of the face of the investigator and with the eyes of the investigator seeming to plead with him for the telling of it the memory was of the haircovered hands of one guard and the nicotine stains of another guards fingers and of the stale sweat smell of their fatigues and of the rough dirt of their bootcaps what had he said there were sounds in his mind the sounds were of his own voice speaking names good names the names of old friends god the shame of i t god the bloody disgrace of it it was faint he could not be sure that he heard the voice the voice seemed to say the name of charlie eshraq couldnt be certain but the voice amongst the confusion seemed to be the voice of mattie furniss his name is charlie eshraq no no couldnt be certain and the memory was misted his name is charlie eshraq for years in the service he had used them they were almost friends to him almost family and hed named them and they hadnt even hurt him so that it lasted he had his fingernails and a back he could straighten he had not been hurt as the gestapo gaolers had hurt that lutheran pastor who had come to the fort and talked of his faith shame and disgrace and failure he rolled off the bed gently as if he were frightened he lowered his feet to the tile floor he put the weight of his body on his feet it was as if he wanted to feel pain as if the pain in his feet would justify his having talked of course there was pain but not enough pain the pain was sustainable when he put his weight on to the soles of his feet they wouldnt understand in century they had a routine in century for those who came back if he ever came back those whod talked under interrogation a debrief and a goodbye no one wanted to know about a man who had talked all the successes forgotten and the irony was that it had been mattie who had contradicted the embassys reports in the late s mattie who had said the peacock throne was on shifting sand and would sink good reporting and all for nothing a debrief for damage limitation and then a goodbye that was cold and without emotion he heard an engine revving outside he struggled to get up from the bed and he pressed his ear against the plywood at the window the engine dulled the voices but he recognised the voice of the investigator there was a place in hell for that man mattie furniss would never forget the voice of the investigator then the scrape of the tyres on chip stones and the squealing of a gate mattie understood the investigator would be setting up the surveillance on the field agents he would return mattie tried to calculate how long it would have taken to abort the field agents he knew the system because he had drawn it up himself he couldnt keep track of the days any more should have done should have scratched a marking for each day on the wall beside his bed he didnt know whether hed given them enough time what hed been through that would be a suite at the ritz compared with what the field agents would suffer in the interrogation rooms at evin mattie would have whetted the appetite of the investigator he knew that hed be back they would strip him and gut him of all he knew and then they would kill him stood to reason they would take their fill of him and they would dispose of him they would take him through the kitchen and across the yard and they would put him against the concrete block wall where the other poor bastards had been put in his life he had never known such agony of failure if he didnt make it b a c k in time theyd hear at century that their man had cracked just as the agency had heard that hill buckley good guy and brave guy had cracked the bastards had tortured buckley and then they sent the tapes of buckley screaming to langley the shit pigs had made sport with bill buckleys pain he went to the wash basin and he ran the tap and when the water came it did not matter to mattie that it was foultasting and ditchwater brown while the water still dripped from his beard growth he sat on his bed he waited for them to bring him his breakfast he would watch each movement of the guards when they brought him his breakfast past six and charlie sang in his shower he felt good he knew what was the source of his soaring spirits it was his meeting with mr stone gun runner by appointment stone had taken charlies money and would deliver because charlie was the friend of mr furniss he began to realize that the friendship of mr furniss was a protective shield to him he dressed and packed his rucksack he came out of his room quickly he walked on the corridor carpet on the balls of his feet and he went quietly and he could hear the scramble of movement behind the door across the corridor and he heard the static and the squeal of a radio hurriedly activated he ran down the fire stairs in the lobby he went briskly to the swing doors he drifted into the street charlie turned and he went past the line of taxis at the end of the line was the green sierra the call on the radio fed into his earpiece had battered keeper awake still in the back of the car he was wrenching the sleep out of his eyes and shaking his head clear harlech telling him that tango one had come out of his room corinthian telling him that tango one had crossed the lobby he sat upright he saw tango one coming down the line of taxis and behind tango one was corinthian spilling out through the swing doors and then behind corinthian was token fumbling to get her blouse into her jeans why the hell was token tucking her blouse in why the hell did it ever get untucked when she was mounting night surveillance in a hotel room with harlech harlech would be at the back in the car park getting the backup on to the street of course token had to sleep like hed slept silly thought and fast because the target was closing on his car striding up past the taxis it happened it wasnt desirable but it sometimes happened that a target would walk right past the surveillance position within spitting distance the routine was to look away get your face out of his field of vision make it look like there was nothing there out of the ordinary this was just about the closest that he had been to tango one just closer than the oneway window at heathrow he turned away he had yesterdays newspaper in his hands and his head was away from the pavement and his body was low in the back seat all standard procedure the car lurched the front of the car bucked down his eyes opened keepers eyes coming half out of his head he gazed through the front windscreen at the back of tango one tango one sat on the bonnet of the green sierra and his feet swung close to the nearside front wheel and he was grinning as he looked down and through the windscreen the fucking tango was sitting on the bonnet of keepers car no standard procedure for that one keeper looked into the amused face past tango one he could see token stop dead in her tracks and corinthian behind her excuse me he wound down the rear window would uou mind getting off my car he heard the voice that mimicked his accent excuse me excuse me would you mind getting off my back all the training said that in a showout then the surveillance team backed off and fast keeper couldnt back off he was half lying in the back of his car and the target was comfortable on the bonnet token was twenty yards from the car and hesitating and not knowing what was expected of her and harlech had stalled his engine and there was a frustrated horn hammering behind him and corinthian was cutting through the traffic to get to the far side of the road which was right a bitter raw anger in keeper would you mind getting off my car please again the mimicking of his voice but this time shouted april five to april one april five to april one for fucks sake come in please what a funny little name april five get off get off my back the words were clear in keepers memory there was room for discretion when there had not been an order but there had been an order you do not repeat not pull in tango one bill had not said you do not repeat not put your fist in the targets grin he climbed out of the car he felt awkward stiff from sleeping in the back seat and out with him came an empty soft drink can that clattered into the gutter beside him get the hell off my car eshraq didnt you hear me april five get off my back im going to stay on your back until they close the door on you i dont think so april five ill put you off my car t r y dont think eshraq that furniss can protect you and charlie eshraq laughed at him the flash of wide white teeth out of your depth april five heh april five can you swim and he was left he stood beside the car and he had to put his hand on the roof of the car to steady himself and it was not the tiredness that had weakened his legs he was trembling with rage they went through the routine they watched the target in his seat throughout the journey as if they hadnt shown out as if he hadnt sat on the bonnet of the case officers car as if they knew what they were doing as if it hadnt been the biggest foulup any of them could remember no one actually asked keeper what had been said at the green sierra saloon because none of them dared the april team went back to london and half a dozen rows in front of them charlie eshraq slept keeper went forward matching the motion of the train he caught at the seat heads to balance himself his hand brushed the ear of charlie eshraq when he went past that seat and he saw the annoyance curl on the mans face didnt give a damn he was whistling cheerful he went to the buffet twelve cans of newcastle brown four whisky minatures eight packets of crisps eight packets of roasted peanuts he spilled them down on to the table harlech looked like he couldnt remember when keeper had last volunteered his shout corinthian looked like it was christmas morning token was grinning he sang big voice might have had a trace of baritone but he didnt know about such things eshraq has only got one ball his dad had two but they were very small khomeini has something similar but the shah had no balls at all heads turned business men dropping their pocket calculators and their financial reports and eshraq twisting his head to look back at them one more time keeper shouted charlie has only got one ball his dad had two but they were very small khomeini has something similar but the shah had no balls at all and into the decibel joke competition loudest laughter wins tokens was filthy harlechs was rugby corinthians was subtle which meant he couldnt win keepers was irish filth rules a miniature emptied into tokens second can they were all laughing all rating it a hell of a good morning and token had her arm looped up and over davids shoulder and she tousled the hair at the back of his neck well done big boy he looked forward to what he could see of the shoulder six rows in front of him he looked past the dark suits and the starched shirts and the disapproval just to let him know that ill take his legs off at the knees go home david i will go home when i know what is happening what makes you think that i know whats happening thats not an answer bill and you know it its the answer youll have to make do with we could have knocked him and you blocked it i told you david it was up the mountain from me the frustration showed park thwacked his right fist into the palm of his left hand parrish didnt look as though he were impressed it was the first time that park had ever shouted at bill parrish because parrish was a cuddly old sponge and shouting at him was blowing bubbles out of the window too nice a man to shout at for fucks sake bill we are talking about a heroin trafficker we are talking about a heroin distributor we are talking about a joker who is walking away from major dealing since when did that sort of track get a block on it the instructions to me the instructions that i passed on to you were that eshraq should not be lifted its criminal bill and you know it me i know nothing and i do what i am told you should do what youre told and go home david park went to the door he turned he spat and i thought this was supposed to be a serious outfit not a comic strip dont give me that shit keeper and id have thought youd have honoured your promise listen dont pull the old holy number with me listen the acio went to see the home secretary last night said we were ready for a lift the home secretary called him in his beauty sleep i shouldnt be telling you but the home secretary gave the instruction thats how high it came from you want to know whats happening i want to know whats happening what i know is that on the top floor the acio and the cio are not available to me i will be told what is happening when they are ready to tell me and you will be told when i am ready to tell you so do me that favour and bugger off home did you ring your missus hes just a filthy little trafficker i hear he saw you off what the hell merely making an observation did you ring your missus hes a cocky little swine and you showed out to him so go home and take your missus out and buy her a pretty dancing frock are you going to let them walk right over you thats a slogan and thats not worthy of you just go home a few minutes later from his window bill parrish saw david park on the street below walking through the traffic like it wasnt there he thought that he might have destroyed one of his best young men and he hadnt known how to stem the rot he called up on the radio he was told that tango one was back at his flat he had two of the april team on the flat but the soul had gone out of the surveillance and the investigation and the bugger of it was that no one had felt it necessary to tell parrish why the block had gone down why take it seriously it was only heroin it was only kids lives being chucked on the garbage heap it was only evil bastards getting rich off misery why worry only bloody fools would worry bloody old fools like parrish and bloody young fools like park he knew that park hadnt taken any leave for two years and he hadnt put in for holiday time for the coming summer he might just book a couple of weeks for the two of them on the algarve and handcuff keeper to his ann and kick him on to the plane could be sentimental bill parrish when he wanted to be it was a crying shame that couple was another day of course there would be another day one step at a time sweet jesus it was the favourite hymn of bill parrish who was a rare christian once a year late at night and christmas eve one step at a time sweet jesus the hymn that he liked to hear on the radio when he was in his car one step at a time and he ought to teach the words to park if the youngster hadnt gotten himself run over crossing holborn and not looking he rang the acios extension and was told he was in a meeting he rang the bossmans extension and was told he was in conference one step at a time sweet jesus it was only heroin he sat on the floor of his prison room beside the door he had worked out the angles of vision from the peephole in the door and he believed that where he sat he was hidden if his guards checked at the peephole before entering he sat on the floor in his underpants and his vest and his socks he had used the pillow on his bed and his rolled up shirt and his bunched together trousers to make a shape under the blanket he always slept with the blanket over his head to shut out the ceiling light he had put his shoes at the end of the bed and half covered them with the blanket a long time he had listened at the door before making the preparations long enough to satisfy himself that he was not watched they had shamed mattie furniss humiliated him to break that shame he would kill he would try damned hard to kill eventually the mullah remembered juliette eshraq not well of course but he remembered her he had to remember her if he had not remembered her then he would have been the only living being amongst close to two thousand present at the hanging who had forgotten juliette eshraq the investigator thought it a great spur to memory his information that the brother of juliette eshraq was coming to iran with an armourpiercing missile on his shoulder and revenge in his mind but you are assured excellency of my best endeavours it is in my interests also that the brother of juliette eshraq be found if he is not found then it is me that he will come lor after he has gone to you when he left the mullah now very clear in his recollection of juliette eshraq who had smiled at the crowd who had come to see her lifted high on the cranes arm he went to his own office in the capital and there he made the arrangements for the watching of an official in the harbourmasters office at bandar abbas and of a merchant in carpets and of an engineer who repaired broken lorries it would be late in the evening before he could catch a military flight back from tehran to tabriz go for it that was the majors oftrepealed injunction at the fort go for it you go for it gentlemen because if youre going to be all nambypamby then youll fail and after youve failed then youll wish to christ that youd never tried if you like living then you go for it because if you dont go for it then you wont be living mattie sat on the floor behind the door and he gazed at his made up bed and he listened for the footfall of the guards bringing him his evening food the major was from hereford the major had grown tired of lying on his belly in ditches in northern ireland and branched into consultancy which paid better and which was safer it was said of the major that he had once spent two clear weeks living rough on the fringe of the creggan estate in derry and that was not a friendly place the major advised multinational companies in the security of their overseas executives and he came down to the fort to let the service know the current thinking on escape and evasion he said that a prisoner must look for the opportunity of escape from the moment of capture he said that it didnt matter how often the circumstances of imprisonment changed the captive must be prepared to rip up his plan and start again and there was another story about the major a new highsecurity gaol in worcestershire and the first convicts due to arrive on a monday morning the friday before there had been an escape prevention drill the major had been the guinea pig and hed been out by the evening problem was the major said hed been paid to get out not to tell how hed done it never did tell them mattie thought of the major and scratched his memory for every last nugget of what he had been told there were low voices on the stairs and the soft shuffle of sandals the bolt was withdrawn the key was in the door there was the numbing shock spreading from the heel of his hand and the body was at his feet there was his food tray on the table go for it mattie went fast and cold just as the major had told them he went out through the heavy door he went straight at the second guard standing back from the doorway he saw the surprise wheeling across the face of the second guard and matties hands were at his throat and his knee rose sharply with all the force mattie had into the mans groin no going back because the body of the guard who had carried the food tray was on the tiled floor behind him the second guard crumpled to his knees mattie let go of his throat and brought his knee swinging back into the mans face his head flew back struck the wall one more jerk with the knee to the head now slumped against the wall and he was almost gone mattie dragged him into the prison room and then his hands were closing on the mans throat the guard picked feebly at matties wrists and his eyes bulged and his tongue arced and his voice choked and his breath died the major had always said it would be easy if they went for it nothing easier than chopping the heel of the hand on to the nape of a mans neck nothing simpler than locking the fingers around a mans throat and taking the pressure on to his windpipe so that it sealed his fingers were a tourniquet and the voice and the breath and the life of the second guard were dying he felt no fear he felt only a determination to carry out all that he had been told the second guard was sinking to the tiled floor and all the time he looked up and into the face of his killer wrong place dear boy to come looking for mercy it had been the second guard who had always smoked and seemed so casual and so indifferent when the real pain was being worked into matties body down in the cellar never any mercy in the cellar from you dear boy the second guard had his hands on matties wrists and the stupid pathetic creature had not had the wit to let go of the hands and to go for the pistol in the holster at his belt bad mistake dear boy mattie heard the last choke shudder and his fingers on the second guards throat had the weight of the mans corpse he dragged the body of the second guard across the tiles and towards the bed a hell of a weight and the tiredness was flooding into mattie with his foot he pushed them both under the iron framed bed he took the tunic and plimsoll shoes off the bigger of the two guards the man was taller than mattie and had the bigger feet and his plimsolls went on to matties feet over the bandages and he took the holster belt and when he had retrieved his own trousers from under the blanket then he threaded the belt through the loops and put on the tunic he had the pistol he checked the breech and the magazine it was east bloc manufacture and it was a hell of a time since he had last seen a pistol made in czechoslovakia he took bread from the food tray forced it into his trouser pocket along with a chicken piece and a fistful of rice mattie stepped out on to the landing he listened there was a radio playing he recognized a news bulletin on the radio the tehran home service and he could hear low voices there was no other way the way out was down the stairs the pistol stayed in his holster if he had taken it out then he would have had to spend time learning its mechanisms he had not that time the major had always said that the initial movement was what gave you the chance of escape he went down the stairs he stopped at the bottom of the stairs it was a good house for him the house had concrete floors under the tiles and a concrete staircase no sound as he came down the stairs the hallway ran the length of the villa from the front door and into the kitchen at the back he paused again he kept himself flat against the hall wall ridiculous but he was actually listening to the news broadcast something about the price of longgrained rice come on mattie get on with it he saw the poster of khomeini in front of him across the width of the hallway sellotaped to the wall up yours dear boy the voices that he heard were low relaxed and came with the radio from behind a nearly closed door that was opposite to him the major had said that the guards who most mattered were the guards that had never been seen by the prisoner there could be guards outside mattie had to accept that there might be guards outside the villa and that he had no idea of their positioning he was listening but his ears were filled with the radio broadcast and the words of the men inside the room he pushed himself away from the wall and walked past the door trying to make himself upright he should have brought the tray either as disguise or something to throw he undid the catch on the holster put one hand on the butt of the pistol and went into the kitchen no one there they had already eaten his own food would have been the last to be prepared the sink was stacked with plates and with cooking dishes theyd come soon perhaps when the radio broadcast was over theyd wash the dishes and then theyd wonder where were the two guards who had taken the food tray to the prisoner mattie told himself that he was going for the wall in the back yard he was going and he wasnt stopping if they were going to stop him then they were going to have to shoot him the kitchen was behind him he had passed through the door and he would have been silhouetted in the doorway he didnt know a way of going through a doorway from a lit room and out into darkness without throwing shadows the back yard beyond the kitchen was the only area outside the villa that he had seen and he knew there was a high wall if there was one guard outside then the likelihood was that he would be at the front by the gate but that was the area of chance he went on tiptoe across the yard he had never heard a dog and he didnt think there was a dog there the major had said that dogs were the nightmare of the escaper but he hadnt heard a dog not a guard dog nor a pet dog he went for the wall he went for the wall where there were the bullet marks in the concrete blocks if they caught him if they brought him back then it would be at the wall that his life would end he reached up the palms of his hands and his fingers could just reach the top of the wall a terrible pain when he pulled himself up in his shoulders and his upper back and down to the cage of his ribs the hurt was from the times that he had been on the hook in the cellar he struggled to get his feet off the ground and he scrambled with his knees to give him purchase up the wall there was a moment when he had his head and his shoulders above the summit of the wall and then he was balancing on his chest and the pain was excruciating he could see into a street and he could see low bungalows there were the headlights of an approaching car the lights played on the centre of the road and lit up the walls of the buildings and the lights were rushing closer to the wall of the villa surging towards mattie who was high on the wall and working to swing his legs on to the top of the concrete blocks behind him through the open kitchen door came the signature music of the end of the news broadcast he knew the music because most days at century he listened to the recording picked up at caversham he thought that if he fell back from the wall then he would never find the strength again that had carried him to the top of the wall and the music at the end of the broadcast told him there would in a few moments be guards in the kitchen he had his elbows over the top of the wall and he ducked his head as low as was possible and his legs dangled and the blood and the pain roared in his feet he waited for the lights to pass and it seemed to him impossible that the lights would not search him out for the driver so bloody long he seemed to hear the shouting in the kitchen and the stampeding of feet and he seemed to feel the hands grabbing at his knees and at his ankles and dragging him down the lights passed quiet behind him grey shadow ahead of him he heaved himself up and on to the wall he levered one leg across he rolled he slid and fell mattie tumbled eight feet from the top of the wall and down on to the weed verge at the side of the road and he was winded go for it it would have taken more than the breath being knocked from his lungs to hold him he was up and he ran he did not know where he was running distance was the name of the game he hobbled down the street away from the prison gate mattie ran for survival and running was risk he did not know whether there was a curfew in tabriz and if there was a curfew then at what time it started he didnt know where in the city he had been held he only thought he was in tabriz he ran until the stitch cut into his belly lining when he aaw a cafe benches outside chairs and plastic topped tables inside he had slowed and crossed to the far side of the road where there was a shadow he tried to find it and he had to skin his eyes to peer ahead of him hard because his head was shaking from the exertion of running because it would be fatal to be running and not looking and to barge into a patrol of the revolutionary guards he ran for a full five minutes he was years old and he thought that he had run a mile he had run on back streets and he had heard laughter and shouting from inside small homes and he had heard the voice of a radio announcer inciting verses from the quran when he rested when his legs and his wind had died he crouched in a concrete storm drain grab any luck that begs to be taken the major had said at the fort luck is earned luck doesnt show itself that often and if its not grabbed then its gone he thought of harriet and he thought of his girls the first time this day that he thought of his women tribe at home they would have expected it of him and its for you my darlings that i run no other beacon for mattie a car pulled up in the street ten paces from him the driver took a parcel from the back seat of the car and carried it into a house the engine was left running the driver made a gift of a car to mattie out of the storm drain into the car at first very gently away hardly changing the beat of the motor and once round the first corner then he really went at it he had not driven so fast since the year before he was married since he had owned the austin healey sprite no sports car this but the bloody thing went and he drove like there was no tomorrow and probably there wasnt he drove away out of the town until he was surrounded by darkness and then he stopped and axed the lights he found a map in the glove compartment he was by his best calculation between and miles from the turkish frontier and by the grace of god the stars were clear and bright and he was on the northwest edge of the town that he thought must be tabriz the three guards who had been in the house placed the blame in entirety on those two men who had taken no precautions to defend themselves the investigator would have done the same in their position in his position he would do the same the investigator was told that there had been a period of fifteen minutes between the time that the food had been carried upstairs and the discovery of two comrades dead in the prisoners cell furniss had a start more important was the fear of the guards who had survived while they had searched the villa a full hour had passed and only then had they summoned an ambulance the police had not yet been informed neither had the army neither had the headquarters of the islamic revolutionary guards they had waited for the investigator to return it crossed his mind that he could do worse himself than make tracks for the turkish frontier but there was too much blood on his hands for him to be welcomed into asylum by the western agencies it was like a wound to him the escape of matthew furniss he had the names of three agents and the name of an infiltrator nothing more he had no detail yet on the running of centurys iran desk on the collaboration between century and langley on the gathering of intelligence from the british listening posts on the frontiers and the american satellites he should have had hard information on the passing of information from the americans and the british to baghdad and on the battle engagement instructions to royal navy warships on the armilla patrol he had taken so little and he had promised so much to the mullah and the mullah would no doubt have repeated these promises to his own patrons well he would start again when furniss was recaptured as he must be no one would shelter an english spy in tabriz deep in his gut was the tremor of insecurity the ripple of the sensation of his own vulnerability when he had pieced together the story he had himself driven to the irg headquarters in the centre of the city he gave the commander photographs of matthew furniss he described what he knew him to be wearing when he escaped from the gaol warned him that furniss was armed with a pistol he wrote out the messages to be sent by radio he sent a terse report to the mullah in tehran he sent a description of matthew furniss to the army command of the northwest region there was no choice but to broadcast his failure over the airwaves mattie had driven out on the marand road he had the map and he reckoned the petrol tank had a minimum of a hundred miles perhaps more he would draw attention to himself if he speeded and if he dawdled then he faced the greater risk of being trapped inside the gun net when the alarm was raised he took the wide bridge across the meydan chay he rattled past factories that had been idle for years now that the war had soaked the resources of the nation huge unlit ghost buildings just after the road crossed the old railway track that had once carried passengers and exports into the soviet union he swung left off the main road any time on the main road had been risk and he was sure that at marand the high oasis town and at khvoy that was a centre of agricultural production there would be road blocks the road blocks would not necessarily be for him but he could not afford to be stopped when he had no papers for the car and no papers for himself the road that he chose was metalled for a dozen miles then petered out into dirt and stone the car took a hammering but he would not have need of it for long when he was high above the northern shore of lake urmia when he could see the lights of the villages where before the revolution a good wine had been produced he saw the road block ahead mattie recognized the block because on the road in front there was a line of tail lights red queueing and he could see a torch being waved there was a queue it must be half a mile ahead of him he was slowing going down through his gears he killed his lights he pulled up to a halt he had used his luck to make good ground away from tabriz n o choice now it was time to walk no way of knowing whether this was a block in position to halt him or just there for routine he swung the wheel hard to turn in the road he hadnt reckoned they would have read the manuals he hadnt rated that there would be a guard stumbling up from the tree thicket at the side of the road probably been dozing probably awakened by the scrape of the tyres on the gravel hard shoulder of the tarmac road he switched his headlights back on and saw the guard lumbering into the centre of the road the lights blinded the guard the guard was old and under his forage cap there were locks of silvered hair and his beard was down to his throat he seemed to wave at mattie while the car was twenty yards from him only realized at the last moment in time to raise his rifle aim the barrel into the heart of the light mattie drove straight at the guard he felt the shudder blow of the impact he felt the heave of the bouncing wheels for what felt many seconds matties heart stopped he drove every second expecting a machine gun to sweep his life away no that was absurd not on this back road and the odds were that the old man was alone should have stayed where he was fired first no questions perhaps the old man had children or grandchildren who had run from the guards past the next corner he saw a track into the trees he turned on to it and followed it far enough to be hidden from the road and pulled the wheel hard to the left and sank the car into scrub out mattie out he was drained he would gladly rest in this wood out mattie the guards in the road right major be right with you mattie took the pistol and the map and got out he let the dark flood into his eyes he searched in the car and then in the boot but there was nothing he could use he thought of harriets boot first aid kit blanket shovel mattie get on with it coming major just checking there was no sign of lights approaching he walked cautiously towards the dark shadow in the road the body was still he suppressed a little jolt of regret for the old man who had not stayed in hiding and shot him as he turned its alright major matties not going soft on you this was a good guard he may be a dead guard but he did me a favour costly favour oh yes and he hauled the body into the trees five yards in rest a minute ten yards in fifteen will do he found the rifle the bolt mechanism was crushed and there were no rounds in the magazine and not one in the spout he carried the rifle to where the guard lay poor defenceless old man if hed had a round you stupid cunt furniss youd be dead now get the hell out of here his stomach was empty he had not yet touched the bread and the chicken and the rice squashed into his pocket damp on his thigh on his feet were plimsoll shoes the mountains were ahead of him dark against the night sky he reckoned he had four or five hours of darkness left to him he walked out of the treeline took his bearings from the stars and began to climb she had had the family row and forgotten it her case was at the foot of the bed and her dress was on the floor polly didnt care that she had stormed out of the house with her father shouting and her mother crying and she didnt care that the dress that had cost her was crumpled on the floor his head was across her stomach and his beard tickled at her skin and her fingers played patterns across his shoulders he had loved her and hed slept and he had given her the best evening she had ever had before he took her to his flat he was a dream when he danced polly had never learned to dance not properly not until that night when she had been shown the magic of the tango and the rumba she knew a bit of quickstep and she could waltz if she wasnt watched too closely she hadnt known that she could dance as she had danced with charlie and the meal had been amazing and the drink had only been champagne and his attention had been total she had forgotten the family row she had forgotten what mr shabro had told her must have been jealous the old goat have you traced it corinthian asked of his radio the reply was in his ear as far as we can go but theres a problem vehicle registration say they are not permitted to give out any details on ownership of that registration thats all so what do we do try pretending it isnt there thats daft and thats the best youre getting he shivered he hadnt the engine running so there was no heating in the passenger seat token was asleep and shed forgotten herself or she was so hellish tired because she had let her head slide down on to his shoulder but he didnt rate his chances he didnt rate them because all the skirt seemed to want to talk about was goddam almighty keeper in the considered view of peter foster codename corinthian keeper was not long of their world stood to reason he could not be long with them because the guy was too intense too tied down by all the shit about winning the narcowar in bogota in the golden crescent that sort of shit keeper might be the best they had but it couldnt last the guy ran too hard himself he paced himself he wasnt in a hurry he did his job and he clocked up the overtime and he thought that he might just grow old in customs and excise keeper wouldnt keeper was a shooting star bloody brilliant and then gone it didnt bother corinthian that the light was going out of the investigation had been on the slide ever since the order had come through from the lane that tango one was not to be knocked no one from parrish downwards seemed to know what the fuck was going on and the target was cocky enough to have gone back to his address like there had never been a problem like importing heroin and being under id surveillance didnt spoil his day one bit great looking fanny hed with him and a great looking bill hed have run up at the swish joint hed taken her the light had gone so far down the hill over the other side that keeper had gone home been sent home and they werent told when hed be back she started she awoke and then she realized where her head was and he gave her the evil eye and she gave him the daggers she straightened in her seat bugger i was just about to rape you he said oh do piss off quite the lady is it still there she turned to look back down the street at the other car whats the news on it no news is permitted on that registration she shook her head tried to get the sleep out of her eyes what does that mean when its at home its what they tell you when the vehicle is used by either the security service or the secret intelligence service what confuses me is are they watching the target or are they watching us the radio messages relayed from tehran went to military and irg bases on the western side of lake urmia and to the north but this was wild and mountain country an area through which a fugitive could with luck pass undetected and over which no security screen could guarantee success the lake lies as a huge natural barrier between the iranian hinterland and the mountain ranges that peak at the turkish frontier the messages were in simple codes it was not possible to send complicated enciphering to outposts such as mahabad and oshnoviyeh and rezaiyeh and dilman and khvoy the messages were plucked from the airwaves by antennae at the government communications headquarters outpost at dhekelia on the island of cyprus he was south of dilman too far south to see the lights of the town ahead of him were the mountains his sights were set on mer dag immediately across the border his ft beacon he had long ago wolfed down the food that he had taken from the prison now he was famished his shoes were disintegrating he had torn off the sleeves of his shirt and the sleeves were now bound around the plimsoll shoes to hold them together he had walked through two complete nights and when the sun was high when the lake shore was at siesta he had walked in the haze heat all through the daylight hours he could see the summit point of mer dag it was his target there was the ache of hunger in his stomach there was a numbed death in the muscles of his legs there was throbbing pain behind his forehead stick to the goat tracks mattie and find water very well major he would find water the mountain summit floated in the moonlight ahead of him he thought that it was too late now to fail the director general was taking breakfast at his desk his appetite sharpened by the brisk walk over hungerford bridge the door flew open the coffee slurped over the rim of his cup to the director general henry carter was a most incredible sight he wore no tie or jacket no shoes even henry carter had barged into his office practically brought the door in with him and now stood panting obviously unshaven in front of the desk the director general could see the top of the mans vest at his open shirt front hes on the run sir splendid isnt it dolphins running it was the third consecutive day that park had been at home and all of them weekdays ann was dressing for work and late she hadnt an idea why he had stayed at home and since he was as tight as a soup tin she didnt dare ask he had begun redecorating their spare bedroom god alone knew why they werent awash with overnight visitors they hardly had any visitors she thought it was a peace move on his part and in the evenings she had cooked his meals and tried to remember what he liked and shed ironed his shirts and shed hidden her feelings in concentration on one television programme after the other she had known there was a target and he had told her that the target was not to be arrested she didnt know any more than that and small mercies not a squeak about colombia he was still in bed they had a sort of routine in bed she went to bed earlier than him and shed pretend that she was asleep when he came in and he pretended that he acknowledged that she was asleep the pretence worked until he was asleep and he wasnt ever long going she thought that she had never seen him so deeply exhausted when he was asleep shed lie half the night on her back with her eyes open and she could have screamed he was still in bed and she was dressing in front of the wardrobe she hadnt shown it to him yet the dress had cost her what she earned in a week it was black full skirt bare back a halter at the neck the dress was as bold as anything she had bought since they had been married it was an impulse she took the dress from the wardrobe she held it against her body she saw that he was watching her for the dance david is it o k he said its super you mean that really mean it a quiet voice as if the strength had been taken from him its a terrific dress i really mean that i hoped youd like it youll look wonderful we are

entry to the club is when you dont fucking care that a heroin trafficker is running round central london like he owns the fucking place yes were going were going to have a hell of an evening ann that dress its really brilliant she went on with her dressing things will get better youll see and she blew him a kiss as she hurried to be at work mattie had walked until he could not put one leg in front of the other he had crawled until he no longer knew where he was going where he was the sun beat down on him he had no food and he had no water the track was of hot sharp rock and he had no more strength and he could not walk on rock and the plimsolls were ripped from his feet he lay on the path dont panic major just getting the old head down just leave me in peace ill be better when its cooler for a moment harriet had forgotten her husband she put down the telephone he was a sweet man who lived out on the cirencester road from bibury and one of the few people that she knew who lived in the community for seven days in each week didnt just commute down at weekends he had some pull and he could get things done he had rung to say that the farmer was bending and was going to agree to roll a strip across the middle of the ploughed field so that the right of way was intact it was a little triumph for all of them who had contested the ploughing up of the track actually there was no good reason why the old route should not have been redrawn round the outside of the field but that would have surrendered the principle the principle said that the footpath ran across the middle of the field and it had run there for more than a century and the principle said that if only one person wanted to walk that path a year then the route should stay unploughed she revelled in her small triumph mattie would have enjoyed if mattie had been there then he would have enjoyed her moment so many times they had been separated and she had never felt such loneliness she seemed to shake herself it was a gesture that was all her own as if she were shrugging away dust from her shoulders as if she were hardening her resolve she hadnt even told the girls the phone rang the bell was in the hall recessed into a rafter and the ringing burst throughout the whole cottage it was a loud bell so that it could be heard if she and mattie were out in the garden each time the telephone rang she expected the worst there was a couple in bibury who had lost an only son a paratrooper at goose green five years ago and in the final push on the argentine machinegun nests theyd sent an officer down from the depot to break the news she didnt think theyd send anyone down from century immediately but she had supposed that the director general would at least speak to her on the telephone she had shaken herself she was prepared mrs furniss she recognized the voice it is flossie duggan mrs furniss from mr furniss office ive only a moment have you heard anything i have not dreadful they are mrs furniss theres some wonderful news well its nearly wonderful old carter that idiot he told me hes escaped mr furniss i mean hed been night watch in the committees room and he was so up in the air that he went into the dgs office without his shoes on apparently he doesnt wear his shoes at night when hes on duty how extraordinary indeed thats rather the tenor of things here nowadays oh dear sorry sorry whatll you be thinking of me what i meant to say was yes that hes escaped mrs furniss hes on the run thats what carter went to tell the dg its been picked up by the monitoring people abroad they listen to everything theyve heard the messages on the radios inside iran mr furniss has escaped theyre all searching for him of course but the main thing is hes free but hes still inside but hes not in his prison mrs furniss thats wonderful news isnt it miss duggan you are very kind to call i am so grateful what would we do without you harriet put down the telephone she closed the front door behind her she didnt remember to lock the front door nor to take with her a raincoat she walked down to the church old and lichencoated stone he came out of his stupor because a boot was in his rib cage and was pushing him over from his stomach to his back the boot was in his ribs as if he were a dog dead in the road mattie saw the gallery of faces above him they were all young faces except for one the one face was cold without sympathy a tribesmans face heavily bearded and the man wore the loose shirt and the all embracing leather waistcoat and the baggy trousers of the kurdish mountain people there was an ancient lee enfield on his shoulder the look on his face seemed to say that if the body had not been on the path in the way it would have been ignored eight young faces they were all boys early twenties late teenagers they gazed down on him they carried packs on their back or there were sports bags in their hands he lay on his back then struggled to push himself upright he understood mattie knew who had found him a young smooth hand ducked down and pulled the pistol from his waist he did not try to stop it because he knew who had found him he had no fear of them not even of the tribesman who would have been their guide on the last stage towards the frontier mattie spoke in farsi would they have the kindness in the name of humanity to take him with them would they help him because he had no footwear would they share food with him because it was more than two days since he had last eaten they were nice enough the boys they were tense as if it were an adventure but they welcomed mattie amongst them and the guide just spat and grunted in the kurdish patois that mattie had never mastered the guide now had the pistol mattie was given bread and sweet cheese and he was allowed to sip from a water bottle before the impatience of the guide overwhelmed the anxious care of the boys two of them helped him to his feet and supported him his arm across their shoulders damn good kids and heavy going for the kids with mattie as their burden and the track was wild difficult damn bloody awful he saw butterflies beautiful and vivid beside the path on flowers that he did not know from england he saw high above them the winter snow that was still not melted they passed through thick forest that had taken root where there seemed to be only rock and no soil they went down into gullies and waded through ice cold torrents and they climbed razor rocks out of the gullies mattie was no skeleton they were struggling all of them and particularly those two who supported mattie the guide didnt help them the guide was always ahead scouting the route sometimes whistling for them to come forward faster without them he would have been finished probably would have frozen to death carrion for beasts of the mountain they wanted to know who he was of course and at first he had made a joke of it and told them that he was in iran to sell tickets for the world cup finals and then he had said quietly and between the spurts of pain when his feet hit the rocks on the track that he was like them that he was a refugee from the regime some of them spoke english some came from the sort of household in tehran where english could be taught with discretion they were dodging the draft he knew that long before they told him they were the kids from rich families who couldnt bear to give their offspring up to the butchery in the trenches outside basra theyd have paid through the nose for the guide and some would have more money in belts around their waists for after they had an entry visa to california or paris from turkey theyd learn mattie thought theyd join the wretched flotsam in the refugee camps and theyd learn the hard way that turkey didnt want them that america and france didnt want them one thing was pretty damn certain in matties mind the two boys who had manhandled him up the rock slope levered him down the track carried him across the fast streams hed do his uttermost to get them visas into the united kingdom they told him those who carried him that they were going to make for hakkari that they had heard there was a refugee centre at hakkari administered by the united nations they said that once they had reached the camp there they could send telegrams to relatives who were already living in the united states they thought that their relatives would be able to fix the visas had their friend ever been to america they came to a ridge the snowpeaked summit of mer dag was away to their right the guide had stopped was crouched down they struggled the last paces to reach him and mattie had swung his arms off the shoulders of the two boys the sun was crisp in an azure sky above them the bandages mud brown trailed from matties feet no pain now in his feet the guide pointed below there was a path snaking down from the ridge and in the far distance was the sprawl of a small town and running further away from the town was a twisting road it was turkey and the guide was gone he gave them no farewells there was no hugging no slapping of hands oh the back of the guide he was just gone loping away down the path that they had just climbed mattie felt the moistness in his eyes he had taken his luck and he was within sight of home the tears came rolled on his bearded cheeks and around him the elation bubbled wait wait wait his arms were around the shoulders of two of the boys and they had his weight between them he spoke slowly so that he could be translated by those who understood him too important he didnt trust himself in farsi how are you going from here we are going down the hill we are going to the refugee centre mattie said you must you must absolutely go down the hill by night we have nothing to be worried of mister mattie said you must wait until nightfall he tried to summon his authority and you different ill get down on my own now be good lads mattie said mister you cannot even walk ill roll down if i have to but you should go by night let me go ahead and prepare the people on the other side to expect you their army patrols they were all giggling at him and they were no longer listening to him they were the children that he knew so well from his own house and from the homes of every one of his contemporaries children who thought their parents were halfwitted he was hoisted up i really do urge you but they had no patience for him they were too happy they went down the slope the wind cut at their clothes deadened their ears the pain welled in his legs but he shrugged away the hands that offered to help him he had started on his own and he would damn well finish on his own there you are major we made it and we will have a long nights carousing over this adventure you and i they were coming down the slope fast darling he thought he heard harriet cry out darling they were strung out in a line dur the shout in the clear air mattie saw them dur he thought they were paratroops toughened hard men weapons that were aimed as if their use was second nature he saw five at first blocking the track down the slope he knew a little turkish and the word to halt would have been clear enough if he had known nothing he didnt have to be a linguist there were more of the patrol at the flanks now guns covering them mattie raised his hands his hands were high above his head his mind was clear there might be officials of the united nations at hakkari but there would be no officials of the united nations high commission for refugees on the upper slopes of mer dag he looked for the officer he pushed his way past a rifle barrel he had the authority now he was filthy and he could barely hobble without support but he had been commissioned in the coldstream guards and for a few weeks in his life he had been a junior commander of the sovereigns guard at buckingham palace he knew how to deal with soldiers he saw the tabs on the officers shoulder the americanstyle bars he would understand english if it were spoken slowly and loudly good afternoon lieutenant my name is furniss i am an official of the government of great britain i am in flight from iran and i ask for your help should you wish to confirm my identity then you should radio back to your headquarters and tell them to contact my embassy in ankara mr snow he was waved forward he was trying to walk upright with dignity he thought the officer had a good bearing might have been on a nato exchange course he passed each of the young men the draft dodgers the refugees the flotsam now most important any help that you can afford these boys lieutenant my government will be grateful for it without their assistance i would not have been able to cross your frontier i ask you to treat them with compassion the officer looked through him he gave orders sharp and clear commands a corporal was at matties arm and leading him further down the slope when he looked back he saw that the boys had been corralled by rifle barrels and were sitting hunched on the track mattie was taken forward whether he wanted to go or not at the edge of the track mattie stopped he resisted the tug of the corporals hand on his sleeve what are you going to do with them the officer gestured in annoyance to his corporal mattie was forced off the track and into thorn scrub he had been taken from sight he sat on the earth and his head was buried between his knees he saw the officer take from his belt a very pistol he saw the burst of colour high above him afterwards he heard the officer shouting on the radio it might have been fifteen minutes later it might have been half an hour it might have been his lifetime and between the foliage and sprigs of the thorn mattie saw the patrol of revolutionary guards approach carefully down the slope the refugees were prisoners they were given into the custody of their own people they didnt struggle no one broke away and ran they went meekly they are scum the lieutenant said and they bring into my country drugs and crime they saved my life goddammit mattie said you could have gone back with them he had not argued he had not jeopardized his own safety he thought that it would be a long time before he forgot the laughter of the boys at the warnings of an old man and he thought that the major would have wondered what all the fuss was about an hour later the radio crackled to life orders from headquarters the biggest man in the patrol a giant of a man lifted mattie on to his shoulders and tucked matties thighs over his arms and carried him like a child under the sinking sun away down the slopes of the mer dag houghton did the opening not that successfully and the first cork careered into the ceiling of the director generals office and chipped the plasterwork champagne and a good vintage the pa had been sent out with a wad of notes from the director generals wallet must have run all the way back with it the occasion called for the best i said hed surprise us all not quite true i said hed surprise a lot of people i had faith in him always the way yes just when life seems darkest the sun blesses us i tell you what furniss is a real hero you can have your soldiers doing daft things and getting medals for what theyve achieved in the heat of battle no harm in that but furniss has done it on his own can you just imagine how the chaps are going to be feeling back in tehran all of those unshaven baskets theyll be slitting each others throats a toast to mattie furniss ill bet he feels like a million dollars right now the deputy director general muttered he hasnt been on a fun run director general ben houghton said i cant get a link through to him we expect that the turkish military will have taken him down to yuksekova theyve a base there crisis management have been trying to patch through a fine but they cant make it through pretty soon now hell be airlifted to ankara the director general beamed theres a hand that i am much looking forward to shaking the debrief comes first the deputy director general said hell be sanitized until his debrief is complete thats the way things are done so when do i get to congratulate him when hes debriefed and after the debrief therell be the inquest you are one hell of a killjoy you know that youre a real damp rag its no more or less than mattie would expect we debrief him on whats happened who held him and then we hold the inquest as to how he was in a position that left him so vulnerable mattiell know the form my view hes likely to be scarred for rather a long time thats just my personal opinion hes done bloody well of course he has and ill not have him harassed no question of him being harassed director general just debriefed the deputy director general proffered his glass to young houghton he refilled his own glass and then the director generals and the ddg had the last of the bottle if the director general ever stumbled under a number nineteen omnibus and the deputy director general moved into this office that young man would be out on his neck damn fast the ddg knew the answer but he still asked the question have we spoken to mrs furniss ben houghton said shes been out ever since the news came through no answer on either of her phones she hasnt been forgotten well done furniss this calls for a second bottle i think ben damned shame that we aborted the network but at least we can move eshraq the deputy director general frowned then the smile caught his face forgive me i may have sounded churlish good old mattie hes been terrific i dont think it would be out of order for you to meet him off the plane if thats what youd like director general again forgive me but i want you to understand that labelling furniss a hero may well will almost certainly be somewhat misplaced he will have talked and this whole expedition has cost us a network realistically it all adds up to dunkirk not to the normandy landings im wagering that hell have surprised you also we may not have aborted our people in time i can show you the photographs from kermanshah when the m k o moved out and the mullahs came back in if you would like to see them the hangings were photographed mattie getting himself captured was only one inevitable step away from a death sentence for our field agents even you may console yourself if the signals to bring them out had been sent without delay they may well come out and mattie may well not have talked in which case perhaps who knows they can go back in again were not talking about bond or biggies director general we are talking about one man against a very sophisticated team of torturers we are talking about a regime that will do unspeakable things to their own people and who wont have cared a toss what is done to a foreigner the director general said i am at a loss to know what you want i would want to know whether eshraq is compromised before we let him go back my money is on mattie and ill drink to him and between the three of them they killed the second bottle it might have been the sense of guilt that had dogged the station officer ever since he had left mattie furniss unprotected in van but he most certainly made wheels turn now from the moment that the military attache at the embassy had passed on the news of the refugee furniss falling into the hands of a patrol near the border in hakkari province terence snow had wheedled facilities from his contacts an official in the national intelligence agency had earned a handsome gift mattie sat beside the road he had a paratroopers smock draped over his shoulders and a medic had cleaned his feet and then bandaged them and a colonel had loaned him a stick to help himself along the road was the airstrip it ran along a shallow valley between yuksekova and semdinli the road was widened and reinforced and provided a facility for fixed wing to land in all weathers night and day and had been built to further military operations against guerillas of the kurdish workers party there were lights laid out fired by portable generators and the area where mattie sat was illuminated by the headlights of military jeeps and trucks he sat on an old ammunition box he was a source of interest to the soldiers they were crowded behind his back silent and watchful they gazed at him with a fascination because they knew that he was an englishman and they knew that he had walked out of iran and they knew from the medic that the soles of his feet were cut and horribly swollen from beatings he had lost that sense of exhilaration that had gripped him when he had stood on the ridge looking down into turkey he was overcome with exhaustion of course he was he could still see in his mind the picture cruelly sharp of the revolutionary guards coming down the slope and the boys being escorted at gunpoint up the slope and there was charlie and there were his agents he wanted only to sleep and he declined food the last food he had eaten before the ridge had been the boys food freely shared with him the hercules c came down on to the road a noisy and jolting landing and the reverse thrust was on from the moment the wheels touched the aircraft taxied towards the knot of soldiers and when it turned mattie had to shield his face from the flying grit thrown up from the hard shoulder by the four sets of propellors the pilot kept the engines idling while mattie was helped up the rear loading ramp it was only when the aircrew had fastened his seatbelt for him that he realized that he had forgotten to thank the paratroop officers for their hospitality he waved as the loading ramp was raised but he couldnt tell whether they would have seen on full power the hercules lifted off then banked heavily to avoid a shoulder of the samdi dag then climbed for cruising altitude they were three hours in the air he was offered orange juice from a paper carton and a boiled sweet to help his ears during the descent to ankara otherwise the aircrew ignored him they were taking him back from a nightmare returning him to the world that he knew they were on a military airfield they were parked beside an executive eight seat jet on the jet were the roundels of red and white and blue the station officer made no secret of his emotion he hugged mattie god mr furniss youve done magnificently well and the director general said for me to tell you h e recited warmest personal congratulations on your epic triumph very decent of him you came through mr furniss i cant tell you how pleased i am how proud i am to know you steady terence youre a hero mr furniss is that what they think of course they had the whole army out trying to catch you and you got clean through them you beat the bastards yes what about my agents all i know is that the abort signals were sent but are they out that i dont know im very sorry mr furniss but ive been ordered not to attempt any sort of debrief on you thats the usual form i suppose snow took matties arm and led him to the steps of the executive jet and a nurse came down them and took over and grabbed firmly at his arm and hoisted him on board and when he ducked into the interior there was an r a f corporal to salute him and through the open door of the cockpit he saw the pilot leaning sideways so that he could wink at mattie and give him the thumbsup he was strapped into a seat back to the driver always the way of r a f flights and snow was opposite him and the nurse was peeling off the bandages from his feet even before they took off and there was a look on her face that suggested that no one could be trusted with medical hygiene but herself the plane had come from cyprus from the sovereign base at akrotiri they roared away into the night lifted sharply as if the pilot would have preferred to be at the controls of a tornado strike plane terence snow kept his silence that was the way of things when a service man came back from captivity nothing should interfere with the debrief standard operating procedure when the nurse had unwound the bandages of the turkish army medic when she had examined the puffed welted soles of matties feet then he saw the frown settle on her already stern forehead and he saw the station officer wince the nurse took off his shirt tugged it off him and her lips pursed when she saw the bruising at the base of his shoulders the swollen feet and the bruised shoulders brought a gentleness to the nurses fingers and a gaze of youthful worship from the boy he could have wiped the gentleness out of her fingers and the adulation from his eyes he could have told them that he was a fraud he could have shouted inside that small aircraft cabin going home at surface miles per hour that the services hero had cracked and talked they put down at the royal air force base at brize norton in the small hours of the morning he was helped down from the aircraft and into a waiting ambulance a lone vehicle on the huge airfield he was driven to the base hospital the director general was waiting for him and his hand was pumped bloody good show furniss welcome home its a red letter day for all of us they ran an electrocardiogram test they asked him for a urine sample and then put him in the lavatory where there was a bag under the seat because they required his stool to check for typhoid or dysentery they xrayed his feet and his chest and his shoulders they did blood tests on him for signs of vitamin deficiency they were brisk and methodical and quick and mattie saw that the form they filled in with the results of the examination and the tests was blank at the top at the space provided for the patients name over the new bandages on his feet they gently fitted plastic slippers and they told him he should see his dentist within the next week the director general was waiting for him in the reception area he beamed at him mattie grinned back ruefully like a man embarrassed by all the attention well furniss i dont know what the devil youve been up to since we last saw you i expect it will make a superlative story and one which the prime minister will not want to see published dear me no but youll dine with us when youre up to snuff i do look forward to that messages of deep esteem from downing street should have said so at once and mrs furniss i expect youd like to put through a call before you leave here snow arrange that will you then youll be off to albury for a day or so furniss just to get it all off your chest but you know all about that my field agents steady down old chap you worry about yourself leave the others to us carters coming down hell tell you what you need to know about your agents its been a wonderful show furniss i said you would surprise us all but i mustnt keep you from the telephone well done furniss first class the service is very proud from the road outside they could hear the telephone ringing the telephone had rung three times while parrish and park had sat in the car it was ringing again as the woman drove past them and then swung sharply to pull into the drive at the side of the cottage and as soon as she had her door open she was hearing the telephone ringing because she was out of her car like a rabbit and she hadnt bothered to close the car door and shed left her keys in the front door park started to move but parrishs hand rested lightly on his arm give her a moment it had been parrishs initiative the drive to bibury no warning just pitching up at parks address waiting for ann to leave then coming to the door park had already started on the spare bedroom ceiling and he hadnt been given time to clean the paint off his fingers well just give her time to answer im out of line but i might just be past caring its all too ambiguous for a simple soul like me i have a direct order that tango one is not to be lifted and yet i am ordered to maintain a low level surveillance on him i dont know what that adds to i am told that we will get no help in locating mr matthew furniss but the acio is not telling me that i cannot approach furniss if it adds up to anything it is that on the top floor of the lane they havent a clue what were supposed to be doing im pushing my luck david because i dont appreciate being pissed on so if i get my wrist slapped and you get your butt kicked then its all in a good cause come on they stepped from the car ill do the talking parrish said you can give her the keys he smiled a real hangmans smile he reached for his wallet in his inside pocket when he knocked on the door he had the wallet open so that his identification card was visible she came to the door she was radiant park handed her the keys and parrish showed the id and she grinned at the keys like a small girl mrs furniss thrilling isnt it do come in its quite wonderful i suppose they sent you down when i wasnt answering the phone ive been at my elder daughters youve come all the way from century a wasted journey youll have a cup of coffee before you go of course you will i suppose really i should be opening the champagne the dg said that he opened champagne last night he said the whole service was proud of mattie thats a splendid thing to have said of your husband when will mr furniss be home you will have coffee im so excited do come inside she had stepped aside then stopped spun you should know when hes coming home parrish asked calmly did you look at my id youre from century yes customs and excise maam investigation division her voice whispered not century my name is william parrish and i am investigating heroin trafficking from iran my colleague here is mr park her hand was across her mouth i thought you were from my husbands office she stiffened what did you say you want id like to know when i can interview your husband what about in connection with a guarantee given by your husband to a man now under investigation she barred their path we dont know anyone like that your husband knows a charles eshraq mrs furniss its about eshraq and your husband standing guarantee to him that weve called she stared up from her eyeline that was level with the knot of parrishs tie have you been through century i dont have to go through anyone mrs furniss do you know who my husband is park could have smiled parrish wasnt smiling he would be later right now he had his undertakers calm your husband is the guarantor of a heroin trafficker mrs furniss my husband is a senior civil servant and i serve my country too mrs furniss by fighting the importers of heroin i dont know what threat your husband safeguards us from but where i work the threat of heroin coming into the uk is taken pretty seriously she was shrill you come here you barge into my house you make preposterous allegations about a boy who is virtually a son to us on the morning that my husband has just returned home after breaking out of an iranian torture gaol so hes not here at present no he isnt here i should think he will be in hospital for a long time but if he were here mr parrish you would be terribly sorry you had had the disgraceful manners to break into this house parrish said maybe its not the best time she went to the hall table she picked up the telephone she dialled fast her voice was clear brittle this is harriet furniss matthew furniss wife i want to speak to the director general park said come on you disgraceful person time we barged out they left her when they were at the gate they heard her voice rise in anguished complaint they reached the car shall i serve my country and drive i tell you what keeper that wasnt one of my happiest initiatives but we did shake the nest he had spoken to the prime minister and the prime minister had asked after mattie furniss and said he must be a quite remarkable man and the dg bathed in reflected glory he looked forward rather keenly to the first of the debrief papers that would be coming through in a couple of days and he would certainly send a digest across to downing street now he was making a tour being seen as he put it to houghton they were in that section of the third floor occupied by assistance photographic when he was passed a telephone by ben houghton for a moment he was puzzled he had spoken to the woman at breakfast time he listened no no mrs furniss you were quite right to reach me intolerable behaviour rest assured mrs furniss you wont be troubled again the four wooden packing cases and the two cardboard boxes were the first items to be loaded into the container the lorry had backed into herbert stones driveway he gave the driver a manifest for the packing cases that listed machine parts for agricultural equipment later the container would be filled with more machine parts for tractors and refrigeration units the haulage company was a regular carrier of machine parts to turkey when the lorry had left he went inside his house and into the quiet of his work room he telephoned the number charlie eshraq had left him and told him that the soap was on its way and he gave him the name of a contact and where he should go and when i tell you bill it wasnt sensible behaviour if you want london to become like amsterdam chief then sensible behaviour would be the order of the day and i dont want a press office handout my guys have worked their balls off we just dont like to see it go down the plug hole parrish had been at the lane for one and a half years longer than the chief investigation officer and for two and a half years longer than the acio he rarely spoke his mind when he did he could get away with murder the acio said if youd come to us first bill cleared it with us you wouldnt have let me go the cio was hunched forward in his chair elbows on his desk theres another way of looking at it bill we are stretched so damn thin that in effect we are a fraud we intercept a minute proportion of whats brought in i know that you know that when you are losing the battle as we are then we need friends where friends matter you have to go for the throats of the bastards and hang on its a great world that you live in bill and its not a world i see much of across this desk so who are the friends we need theyre the high and the mighty and right now theyre peeved with you i just gave the nest a little shake very selfindulgent of you bill and no help to me because i am summoned to a meeting this afternoon with the faceless wonders at century house what do i tell them bill to get fucked but my world isnt your world mores the pity and im looking for friends i have one man in karachi one dlo on his ownsome and when he goes up to the northwest frontier who escorts him the spook escorts him and drives the landrover why does my d l o ride in the spooks landrover he rides in it because i dont have the funds to provide a landrover of our own i have one dlo in cyprus and how does one man get to know whats coming out of jounieh how does he know whats sailing from any lebanese port cyprus is awash with spooks i am trying to cultivate friends bill not shake the nest and telling them to get fucked i promised park and hes the best i have that i wouldnt let your friends the faceless wonders stand in our way then you opened your big mouth too wide tell us about your keeper bill we begin to hear quite a lot about master park is he ready for a move upwards do you think were going to have a celebrity on our hands the director general mused how so i anticipate great mileage out of furniss theyll want him at langley the germansll want him and i dare say even the french will recognize that they could learn a thing or two the deputy director general said coolly id put that out of your mind for a start if i were in this office i would make double damn certain that no one outside this building gets to know that we allowed a desk head to plod about on a hostile frontier without a semblance of security itll get out sooner or later of course as like as not tehran will be drafting a press release even as we sit here why we let british spy go and by the way not a few people will be wondering already the director general scowled i dont mind telling you that i told furniss that the whole service was proud of him not clever im going to run a fine toothcomb over terence snow the report on how mattie came to get himself kidnapped is pretty conclusive indeed i doubt that he has any sort of future here hell have to go back to ankara in the short term there may just be a way he can be useful to us in the short term youre a hard man i am what the job requires the snort of the director general and furniss has he a future very probably not i am afraid the deputy director general reported that a man had been sent down to bibury with the instruction to break the bones of any customs investigation creature who came within a hundred yards of the furniss cottage and he said that he would be at the director generals side at the meeting with the customs hierarchy what sort of people will they be i expect youll be able to charm them director general think of them as glorified traffic wardens he had no doubt that his life depended upon the success with which he stood his ground against the inquisition of the clerics ranged on the far side of the table to him were four of them they were the power and the glory of the revolution of today and once he would have called them fanatics and bigots they were the ones who had been to maktab where the mullahs taught the quran to boys aged four and then they had become the talabeh who were the seekers after truth as handed down from the wisdom of the ayatollahs they had taken child brides because it stated in the book that a girl should not experience her first bleeding at her parents home they had spent time in the holy city of qom it was the failure of the s a v a k that these creatures still existed they were his masters he claimed that he had already bled the british spymaster dry before his escape he told them of the young eshraq and they were quiet as he explained the mission of eshraq heading back towards iran and they heard of the precautions that were in hand to prevent the traitor crossing over the frontier with armourpiercing missiles he said that eshraqs first target was the mullah who sat immediately in front of him he saw the way that the others turned sharply to the one amongst them who had been singled for attack and he told them that he himself was the target that would follow for more than an hour and a half he defended himself and at the end he told them of his arrangements to prevent eshraq crosssing the border it was implicit in his argument that if he were removed if he were sent to evin then the shield in front of his masters would have been dismantled the life of charlie eshraq would safeguard the investigators life nothing more nothing less he had flown back to tehran from the gulf that morning to resume work at the new power station to the west of the city he browsed in the bazaar he was on the bazar e abbas abad amongst the carpet shops he paused he could not linger for more than a few seconds in front of him were the heavy steel shutters and fastening them to the concrete paving was a powerful padlock his eye caught that of the man who stood in front of the next cavern of carpets open and the man ducked back into his shop there was no sign no explanation of why this one business should be shut if there had been illness if there had been bereavement then he would have expected an explanation from the merchants neighbour he walked on he walked into the warmth of the sunlight beyond the bazaars alleys he took a taxi back to his hotel and in his basin he burned the message that he had been paid to carry henry was late getting down to albury everyone who knew henry carter which wasnt many had told him that he should dump the morris estate on the nearest corporation tip and failing that at the side of any road and buy something reliable trouble again with the carburettor he was late getting down to albury and mattie had already arrived and the men who had brought him from brize norton were fretting to be on their way he ignored the show of annoyance as he struggled through the front door with his bag and his wellington boots and two weatherproof coats binoculars camera with a long lens and taperecorder typical of the sort of youngster they recruited into the service now neither of them offered to help and they scarcely bothered to report that mattie was in one piece sound asleep now before they were off there werent many of them the old brigade left at century these days and it was obvious that the director general would have wanted one of the long servers to be down at albury to take matties debrief he would not have called himself a friend of mattie furniss rather a colleague he looked back through the front door he had heard the call he was festooned with his gear he saw the bird picus viridis the green woodpecker was halfway up a dead elm across the lawn there would be gaps in the debrief for him to set his camera on a tripod and to rig his microphone he went inside it would be something of a reunion for him coming back to the country house in the woodland of the surrey hills mrs ferguson greeted him she was rather a dear woman the housekeeper and there had been a time when he had actually thought of making a proposal of marriage to her but that was quite a long time ago and he had been at the house for weeks on end it was her cooking that had settled it it was awful she pecked his cheek he saw george behind her hovering at the kitchen door george touched his cap he wore a cap always now since the baldness had set in wore it even in the house a loyal fellow george but lazy and why not with so little to do through the kitchen he could see that the outside door was closed and the door shook and there was ferocious scratching from the far side of it am i not to be greeted by old rotten george grinned your gentleman doesnt like dogs and he certainly doesnt like rottweilers not many did henry had a fear of some men and of most women but of no animal not even an animal that weighed more than a hundred pounds and was famously unpredictable then make sure the brutes kept clear of him he had to smile wouldnt do for mattie furniss to have fought his way out of an iranian prison only to find himself savaged by the safe house rottweiler he looked around him he could see the glimmer of fresh paint on the woodwork and the carpet in the hall had been cleaned things were looking up where is he hes just come down been asleep ever since he got here hes in the library he left george to carry the bag and his kit upstairs he hoped that he would have his usual room the one that overlooked the vegetable garden where the songbirds gathered to feed off the groundsel and dandelion seeds he walked through to the library his feet echoed on the bare board floor it had been a bare board floor since the pipes had burst in the freeze of three winters before and the carpets had been ruined and not replaced he opened the door he was almost obsequious he went on tiptoe into the room to call the room the library was somewhat overstating the case of course there were books on the shelves but not many and few of them would have held anyones interest the books had been a job lot when a local house had been cleared out on the death of a maiden lady without surviving relations mattie was in a chair by the empty hearth please dont get up mattie must have just nodded off you deserve a very long rest i mean what a change where were you mattie hours ago walking out of iran i suppose its pretty strange youve spoken to mrs furniss had a few words with her thank you woke her up at first light poor thing but she was in good form flapping a bit but dont they all theres grand news through from the medics a very good bill of health no bugs i just feel a bit shaken henry looked into matties face the man was completely shattered ill tell you something for nothing mattie in twenty years time when the dgs been forgotten when no one at century will know my name theyll still talk about dolphins run dolphins run out of iran is going to go into the history of the service thats very decent of you henry dont thank me you did it the fact is that the service is buzzing with collective pride you have given us all down to the tea ladies one hell of a lift he saw mattie drop his eyes perhaps he had been over the top but he knew the psychology of the debrief and the psychology said that an agent back from abroad where hed had a rough time needed praise reassurance a colleague of henrys with a brood of children had once likened the trauma of return to a womans postnatal depression henry couldnt comment on that but he thought he knew what the colleague had meant he had told the deputy director general when he had been given his marching orders before finding that his carburettor was playing up that he would take it gently it would have been scandalous to have taken it otherwise after a man had been tortured and broken oh yes the ddg had been most sure that mattie would have been broken thanks henry well you know the form well hammer through this over the next few days and then well get you back home what youve been through is going to be the basis of study and teaching no doubt at the fort for the next decade shall we get down to things some time this evening mattie were all very very excited by what you achieved i think id like to be outside for a bit cant walk too comfortably just yet perhaps ill sit in the garden can you keep that ghastly dog at bay by all means ill ask george to put him in the kennel and ill see if mrs ferguson can find us something rather special to drink this evening i dont think we can hold out much hope for the meal itself a good early start because henry carter thought that mattie would feel stronger at the beginning of the day they ate breakfast of tepid scrambled eggs and cold toast they discussed the possible makeup of the team for the first test they had a chuckle over the new switch in the socialists defence policy henry told mattie about stephen dugdale from library who had been laid low last week with thrombosis it was a good room the old dining room fine sideboards and a glasses cabinet and a carving table and the main table could have seated twelve in comfort the worst thing about eating in the dining room and at the big table in carters opinion was that mrs ferguson having polished the table then insisted that it be covered with a sea of clear polythene shall we make a start then mattie why not he settled in the chair by the fireplace across the hearth rug from him carter was fiddling with a cassette player it was the sort of cassette player that harriet had bought the girls when they were teenagers he saw the spools begin to move on the cassette player he could see the investigator he could see the cellar walls he could see the bed and the leather thongs he could see the hook on the wall he could see the length of electrical flex wire how long is this going to take hard to say mattie depends on what youve got to tell me my immediate target is to get home goes without saying where shall we begin shall we start in van mattie told the taperecorder everything about the way the attack on his car had been carried out he felt uncomfortable describing his carelessness henry looked rather schoolmarmish but didnt interrupt matties account was perfectly lucid he seemed to henry to take pleasure in the clarity of the narrative in the orderly compilation of details that would one day be of value at the fort at eleven mrs ferguson knocked and came in with coffee and a packet of chocolate digestives mattie stood at the window until henry said this house they drove you to i was blindfolded when we got there i didnt see it when i went out of it then it was dark tell me what you can about the house they didnt take me on a tour they werent trying to sell it me he saw the puzzle at henrys forehead stupid thing to have said is there a problem mattie im sorry of course theres a problem you are asking me to recall a house where i was tortured where others have been put to death well just take it slowly that way it wont be so painful youve nothing to be ashamed of mattie ashamed he spoke in henrys soft voice he rolled the word ashamed mattie spat the word back at him the conciliatory raising of the hands dont misunderstand me mattie why should i be ashamed well weve been working on the assumption what assumption we had to assume that you had been taken by agents of the iranian regime and that of course you would be interrogated and in due course that you would be well broken or killed that was a reasonable assumption mattie reasonable youd have made the same assumption mattie of course you would and at what stage did you decide that mattie furniss would have been broken henry squirmed i dont know anything about pain how could you myself i wouldnt have lasted a day perhaps not even a morning i think just the knowledge of what was going to be done to me would have been enough to tip me into the confessional you shouldnt feel bad about it mattie so i was written off not by the director general i am afraid almost everyone else did most touching faith you had in me and did you shake the dust off my obituary had you booked st martins for a memorial tell me henry who was going to give the address come on mattie this isnt like you youve been on this side of the fence you know what the form is its just abominable henry to realize that century believes a senior officer of the service will cave in at the end of the first day like some damn girl guide im flattered we made our assumption we aborted the field agents a sharpness in matties voice theyre out we aborted them theyre not out yet mattie sat upright in his chair his chest heaved there were still the pain pangs deep in his chest you assumed that i would be broken within hours can i assume that you aborted as soon as i went missing how can it be that two weeks later the agents are not out it was felt i believe that aborting a very precious network was a big step takes years to rebuild it took them a little time to get to the sticking point part of it was that the dg convinced himself that you would never talk all sorts of waffle about furniss of the old school frankly i dont think he knows the first thing about interrogation anyway wiser heads prevailed as they say and the messages were sent but the agents are not yet out christ mattie stood dreadful pain in his face pain from his feet that were bandaged and inside bedroom slippers that would otherwise have been three sizes too large it wasnt easy knowing nothing hearing nothing a cold whip in matties voice i clung on i went through hell yes hell henry and at century you couldnt get your fucking act together it makes me sick to think of it i have the impression that there was more interest more interest even than in the safety of the field agents in whether eshraq was compromised mattie swung his shoulders his eyes fixed on henry what do you know about eshraq that he is of very considerable importance while i was away my safe was rifled yes rifled no mattie that is unreasonable of course we went through your safe we had to know about eshraq henry paused the silence weighed he looked up at mattie there was the attempt at kindness and understanding and friendship i gather that charlie eshraq is not just important for his potential in the field but also that he is very close to your family so my safe was gutted mattie please we had to know everything about the boy and now we have to know whether he is compromised so you burrow about in my private files and you find that he is close to my family is that it thats right here you assumed that i would talk to my torturers about a young man who is like a son to me im sorry mattie that has been our assumption your assumption but not the director generals correct but all the rest of you the director general said he thought that you would go to the grave before you named names you henry what do you think ive seen the medical reports i know the extent of your injuries i have an idea of what was done to you to have escaped after all that argues a phenomenal constitution phenomenal courage i killed three men getting away i broke the neck of one i strangled one i drove one down if there were doubters mattie they will obviously keep their doubts to themselves i didnt know that of course and i am horrified to hear it one has no idea what one may be capable of in extremis am i capable of betraying charlie thats what you are asking yourself to me mattie gods truth you are one of the finest men that i have known in my lifetime with the service but no one no one in the world is capable of withstanding torture indefinitely you know that and nobody in the service is holding it against you everyone thinks it was wrong to send you my god i hope the dg doesnt listen to this tape and well to tell you the truth quite a few people think you were a fair old chump to be gallivanting about on your own near the border thats what comes of being an archaeologist i suppose mattie smiled at the irony he walked to the window he did not need to hold on to the chair backs he walked as if there were no pain in his feet as if he could straighten his back and there was no pain in his chest he stared out there was a brisk sunshine lighting the lawn i may have named the field agents i cant be certain there were times that i was unconscious i might have been delirious there were times when i thought i was dead and certainly prayed i would be but that was oh christ after days of agony if the agents were not aborted immediately then i wont accept the blame for that and eshraq did you name eshraq the dog was barking in the kitchen frustrated at being denied the run of the house mattie turned stared levelly across the hearth rug at henry no henry i couldnt have done that id much sooner be dead than have done that mattie truly i take my hat off to you the lorry began the journey from the north of england to the port of dover midday saturday and the lorry observed strictly the speed limits set for it the driver would not approach the customs checks at dover until the evening of the following day lorry movement through the port of dover was always heaviest on a sunday night when the drivers were jockeying to get a good start on the monday morning on the through routes across europe the volume of traffic on the sunday night sailings dictated that the customs checks on outgoing cargo were lightest and the early summer was a good time also for the sale of machine parts the ferries vehicle decks would be jammed with both commercial and holiday traffic the chances of the lorrys cargo being searched of the containers being stripped out right down to the four wooden packing cases were very slight the haulage company also took care to check whether there was any form of tail on the consignment the lorry had been followed away from the warehouse at the loading depot by a car that checked to see whether it was under surveillance the car varied the distance between itself and the lorry at times it was a mile back and then it would speed up and catch the lorry the purpose of this was to pass the cars travelling in the wake of the lorry and to look for the telltale evidence of men using radios in the cars or vehicles that were too long in the slow lanes it was a wasted exercise the investigation division had no tail on the lorry not yet six oclock and she had already had her bath she was at her dressing table she could hear him in the next room working at the final touches it was the trip out with bill parrish that had set him behind he hadnt told her where they had gone and she hadnt asked he might not have told her where hed been what hed done with bill parrish but at least when he had returned he had peeled out of his work clothes and put on the old jeans and the sweatshirt and headed back to his decorating he was pretty quiet had been ever since hed come back from the north of england and she was almost sorry for him more vulnerable than shed ever known him she thought he must have been wanting to please her because he had set out to decorate the spare bedroom not that david would ever have admitted to a living soul let alone his wife that his case was up the river and no punt she didnt care what he said shed liked coming home from work and finding the flat smelling of paint and wallpaper paste it was a big change in her experience that her husband had gone down to the diy and had managed the best part of a week without referring to bogota or the medellin cartel who am i going to meet there she called out a gang of complete morons she yelled and she was laughing will it all be shop talk absolutely blokes all up at the bar wives sitting down by the band youll dance with me then youd better wear boots he came into the bedroom she could scent the paint on his hands that were on her shoulders christ and she wanted them to be happy why couldnt they be happy in the mirror his face looked as though the light had gone from him her david the lanes keeper so crushed it was a fast thought she won dered if she didnt prefer him when he was bloody minded and confident and putting the world into its proper order he bent and he kissed her neck and he was hesitant she took his hands from her shoulders and she put them inside her dressing gown and she held them tight against her i love you and im just going to dance with you she felt his body shaking against her back and the trembling of his hands past six oclock and a saturday evening and the magistrate sat at his bench in a yellow pullover and his check trousers were hidden under the desk top the convening of the court on that day of the week and at that time of day guaranteed that the public gallery and the press seats would be empty parrish in his work suit stood in the witness box i understand you correctly mr parrish you have no objection to bail bootfaced bootvoiced no objection sir in spite of the nature of the charges i have no objections to bail sir and the application for the return of the passport i have no objection to the passport being returned sir you have no fear of the defendant going abroad and not surrendering his bail no fears sir what sort of figure of bail are you suggesting mr parrish two sureties sir two thousand pounds each would be my suggestion sir the magistrate shook his head it was as though he had now seen everything heard everything day in and day out the police sniped at the magistrates for their willingness to grant bail there could be many reasons and he was not going to waste time speculating on them if thats what the investigation division wanted thats what they wanted what he wanted was to get back to the golf club he granted bail on two sureties of the flight had been delayed technical problems the problems were resolved a few minutes after leroy winston manvers and his commonlaw wife and children boarded the british airways to jamaica when hed seen the bird up then bill parrish drove home to change for the dance the detective thought that darren cole was very pale and his fingers were nicotine stained because that was the only fix he was getting on remand he resented being pulled from home on a saturday evening and told to drive halfway across the county he wasnt in the mood for hanging about youre coming out darren tomorrow morning eight oclock youre walking out the charges against you will not be pressed but they will be held in reserve the charges can be reactivated if you should be so silly as to open your dumb little mouth to any scribbler anyone else for that matter i wouldnt come home if i were you you should stay away from my patch there are people who know that you grassed and if they know where to find you then they will most certainly come looking take the wife and the kids and take a very long bus ride darren and stay safe have you got me young un the detective left the necessary paperwork with the assistant governor he could be phlegmatic he reckoned that letting out young darren cole would save three four days of court time he was not concerned with the morality of letting out a proven narcotics pusher if his chief constable could cope with the morality then there was no way that a detective was going to get out his worry beads he would have liked to know why cole was being given the heave but he doubted if he ever would who was it george libby barnes called from her dressing room she sat in front of the mirror in her underclothes and housecoat and she worked with the brush at applying the eye shadow it was piper mother on a saturday evening is it something serious called about lucy im not supposed to tell you this but youve the right to know ive lost dear i wouldnt want you to think that i lost without a fight but ive lost and thats the long and the short of it the photograph was in front of his wife at the right side of the dressing table mirror a photograph of when lucy was sixteen and sweet a happy teenager in a corfu cafe the photograph had been taken the last time they had been together as a family before lucy had started her problem what do you mean you lost the boy who pushed to lucy has been freed from remand in prison he will not go to trial the man who supplied the pusher will also not face charges and has been allowed to leave the country the importer of those drugs who has been under intense customs and excise investigation will not be arrested and youve swallowed that not lying down its for the best libby a trial would have been awful three trials would have been quite hideous all those bloody journalists at the front door perhaps its best to forget libby barnes whispered and best for your career she held the photograph tight against her chest and her tears made a mockery of the work at her eyes piper mother did say that yes charlie watched her go and he was left on the pavement where the streets merged into piccadilly he watched her through the traffic and he saw the hips swing and he saw that her shoulders were well back and once he saw her shake the long hair free of her collar and the hair tossed and caught in the last of the sun first he lost her behind a bus that was caught at the lights and then she was gone she had been carrying her bag loosely against her knee she was going home with her new dress because polly venables and charlie eshraq were going nowhere shed go back to mahmood shabro on monday morning and shed try to forget charlie eshraq because he had told her that he was going back to iran he turned the other girl was still close to him she was leaning against the shop doorway and she wasnt even bothering to pretend the car was behind her all the time that he had been walking with polly the girl had been close to him and the car had been hugging the kerb she was a dumpy little thing and he thought they must have cut her hair with garden clippers and he didnt understand why she wore an anorak when it was almost summer he walked up to her im going to have a drink april lady would you join me token snarled back at him piss off the truck driver was turkish and he drove his daf vehicle with the choke out so that the engine seemed to race as if on its last legs he manoeuvred into the narrow culdesac and then killed the engine in front of the battered sheet metal gates when the engine was off when he could look around him there came to him the curious quiet of the repair yard from his cab he could see over the wall and into the yard no work there no activity he had been told they worked late into the evening there was a child watching him from against the wall chewing at an apple the turk called to the child he asked where was the engineer the child scowled at him the child shouted back the one word pasdaran choke in the engine running smoothly the driver backed his truck out of the culdesac he drove at speed out of tabriz chewing and chewing and eventually swallowing the message that had been taped against the skin of his belly she had heard of all of them heard their names but she had never before been able to put faces to the names she knew them by their actual names and by their codenames too because sometimes david referred to them at home by one and sometimes by the other if she had been honest and she might be honest later when they were home and that depended on how much she had drunk then she might have said that she didnt think that much of them there wasnt much that was special about any of them on anns table were some of the names she knew best there was dear old bill unusually quiet and his wife who had not yet closed her mouth there was peter foster whose collar was too tight and whose wife hadnt stopped talking about the standard of teaching at infant and primary school level since they sat down there was duggie williams who was harlech and he was in a foul mood because according to david he had been stood up mrs parrish was talking about the holiday they were going to take in lanzarote bill wasnt saying much and looked as though he had had a death in the family and foster seemed as if he might choke but she rather liked harlech she thought that harlech might just be the pick of them and she thought that the girl who had stood him up must be just a bit dumb the music had started the band had begun but the floor was still empty and there was no way she would get david on to his feet before there was quite a throng the glasses were filling the table the raffle tickets had been round and they would be drawn and then there would be the buffet supper and after that she might get david on to the floor duggie williams brought her a drink and changed places with maureen foster to sit next to her you must be half bored out of your knickers i beg your pardon how did keeper get you to come along it was i that said we were coming you must be off your pretty head perhaps i just wanted to have a look at you all then its a bloody miracle you havent run away already im harlech i know im ann bill had started talking ann couldnt hear what he was saying but david was leaning away from her to listen were not in the best of form she said drily i gathered weve lost a nice juicy one he told me a bit we got fucked up excuse me your man trouble with him is that he cares dont you he had strong eyes when she looked at harlech then it was into his eyes she had nowhere else to look it was only from the side of her eye that she saw bills empty chair not a lot bothers me thats because of where i used to work i used to be at heathrow so was david he was front of house me i was back stage i was on the stuffers and swallowers drill you know what that is course you dont nobody tells a nice girl about swallowers and stuffers i used to be on the duty that checks the daily in from lagos i never found anything else that the nigerians were good at but christ they can stuff and swallow do you want to know all this you do well the women stuff the scag up their fannies and the men stuff it up their arses and they both swallow it are you with me they put it in condoms and they stuff it up and they swallow it down we have a special block for the suspects and thats where i used to work before i came to id we shove them in a cell and we sit and watch them and we feed them on good old baked beans and we wait god do we wait has to go through law of nature everything has to come out except from where the women stuff theirs but thats a job for the ladies you have to be like a hawk watching them and every time they go in then its out with the plastic bag and on with the rubber gloves and time for a good old search around they train by swallowing grapes and they dip the condoms in syrup so they travel more comfortably and they use something called lomotil because thats a binder you know once we had a flight in from lagos and we pulled in thirteen and we had every bog in action that we could lay our hands on we were swamped and just as well because half of them were positive when youve sat hours and hours watching guys crap after that not a lot seems to bother you got me he doesnt tell me things like that complaining she didnt answer bill was back talking urgently into davids ear she heard her man swear quiet then he turned to her im sorry ive got to go with bill it may take an hour or two duggie will you look after ann will you get her home youre joking she didnt believe it bill shrugged he was standing at davids shoulder im sorry love ill see you when i do he was gone and bill was trailing after him no she didnt believe it d o you like dancing harlech asked the investigator reported to the mullah a veteran in survival the investigator had determined the necessity of reporting in person twice every day to the mullah twice every day he drove through the traffic jams to the expropriated villa where the mullah held court he held the cards in his hand not as high cards as he had hoped but cards of value he had in those cells at evin that were reserved for political prisoners of great sensitivity an engineer from tabriz and a carpet merchant from tehran he had a tail on an official of the harbourmasters office in bandar abbas to see where the man would run what else could be trawled he had the plan in his mind of the show trial at which confessions would be made confessions their extraction and their presentation in court were the great pride of the investigator a confession was the closing of a book it was the finishing of the weaving of a carpet it was orderliness the confessions of the engineer and the carpet merchant were near to being in place and that of the official in the harbourmasters office would follow when he was ready to receive it on that evening late in the office of the mullah he reported on all these matters and he received permission to continue the surveillance in bandar abbas later sipping freshly pressed fruit juice he talked of charlie eshraq he was very frank he kept back nothing mattie i dont want to go on about this not all night but you are quite sure im getting very tired henry the investigator was a professional yes old s a v a k man knew what he was at and it went on being pretty violent henry if you knew how ridiculous you sounded pretty violent for christs sake if youve got any heavy duty flex in the garage here well see if you like if we can elaborate the distinctions violent pretty violent or well try twelve hours of continuous violence and see what that becomes or havent we been through this all before yes mattie yes we have its so important that we are absolutely clear on this your investigator is a savak man the worst of the breed and violence was used against you quite horrifying violence on and on how many times do you have to be told henry i did not name charlie eshraq easy old chap it is not easy to break out of iran and then to come home to an inquisition quite right point taken mattie there were times that you fainted other times when you were semiconscious when you were really groggy could you have named him then the room was shadowed and dingy the light came from a ceiling triple but one of the bulbs had popped early in the evening and george had stated that he had no replacements and would not be able to buy more bulbs until monday the furniture was old but lacking in quality a sothebys man wouldnt have given the room a second glance not as good a room as the dining room when youre in a place like that henry you cling to anything thats sacred you hold on to your family to your service your country your god if you have one any damned thing that is important in your life you hold on to when the pains so bloody awful the only things you can hold to are the kernels of your life you have that feeling that if you broke you would be giving them all that is sacred to you i just have to be sure that i understand you and it was such a damn shame he thought that old henry tatty old henry carter who wouldnt have known a thumb screw from a bottle opener might just be a better interrogator than the investigator in tabriz park drove and parrish was beside him with the directions written on a sheet of paper hed asked where they were going and bill had said that the building was called century house hed asked why they were going there and bill said it was because the chief had told him to present himself with keeper in tow no point in any more questions because bill hadnt any more answers they came down the albert embankment and the tower blocks loomed against the night skyline there was only one block alive with light parrish waved for park to pull into the forecourt the chief investigation officer was on the steps and looking at his watch and the acio was beside him and then coming forward to organize the parking space they climbed from the car and park locked the doors they walked towards the main entrance he saw a small brass plate for century house the chief investigation officer nodded curtly at parrish then moved to stand in front of park inside your opinion isnt wanted you just listen they were offered drinks and on behalf of all of them the chief declined not an evening for social pleasantries park thought just an evening for learning the realities of power he stood in front of the desk and the chief investigation officer was beside him and the acio was on the other side and a half pace behind and parrish was out in the secretarys office with a young twerp watching over him parrish hadnt even made it inside the lesson was delivered by two men one sat in an armchair and did the talking and was called ddg and the other sat on the front of the desk the one in the armchair drawled and the one on the desk with his socks held up by suspenders had a voice that was silk and honey he heard it from the armchair you dont have a right to the detail park but i will tell you what i can and you should understand that everything i propose has been considered and approved by your immediate superiors in your work for customs and excise investigation division you are a signatory to the official secrets act that signature of yours is an obligation to lifelong confidentiality whatever recent events may have suggested to the contrary what you hear in this room is covered by the act between your superiors and ourselves park there is a deal you are being volunteered thats nice what have i done to deserve this just button it park the chief said side of mouth charlie eshraq runs heroin he is also a field agent of some value to the service mr matthew furniss is one of the finest professional officers to have been reared by this service in the last two decades thats all fact eshraq for reasons that are not your business is about to return to iran and he will be taking across the frontier a certain amount of hardware purchased as i am sure you will have deduced with the proceeds of the sale of his last load of heroin he is going back into iran and he will be staying there he will be told tomorrow that should he renege on an agreement with us should he ever return to the united kingdom then he will face prosecution on the basis of the evidence that you and your colleagues have collected against him you will join eshraq on monday you will accompany him to turkey and you will satisfy yourself and your superiors that he has indeed travelled back into iran following your return to the u k it has been decided by your superiors that you will then be posted as dlo to bogota in colombia i can assure you that it will be my intention to make certain that you have there the full cooperation of service personnel in that region thats the deal all neatly wrapped up between you no loose ends and if i tell you that it stinks that i dont believe it he doesnt belong to your outfit and if he does id like to know whats the point of my going to bogota if you lot are running the stuff in the back door from iran watch it park no chief i wont just to get mr furniss young friend off the hook and just to get me out of the way thats it isnt it quite right park we may just have to get you out of the way do you remember a leroy winston man vers an early morning interrogation unsupervised quite outside the book you do i gather the file isnt closed yet some ugly first shots across the divisions bows from his solicitor isnt that so chief i think youre shit sir five years imprisonment minimum you could bet money that wed know the judge for the beating of a helpless black prisoner it could be a bit more than five goodnight park youll enjoy bogota its full of your type goodnight gentlemen park went for the door if he had looked into the face of the chief investigation officer then he might just have put his fist into the mans teeth and if he had looked at the acio then he might just have kneed the bugger by the by park a little note of warning the voice drawled behind him an incoming tide over shingle dont play any clever games with eshraq i think hed give you more of a run for your money than man vers did the dog slept in a wicker basket beside the aga in the kitchen on its back with its legs in the air and wheezed like a drayman the sound of snoring filled the night quiet of the house he thought that a burglar would have to have kicked over the kitchen table to have woken the brute but it was not the rottweilers growled breathing that kept henry carter awake he would have been asleep by now well asleep because it had been a hard enough day and rounded off with a good malt if it had not been for the nagging worry the descriptions of the torture had been so wretchedly vivid the telling of the brutality had been so cruelly sharp never not ever would henry have accused mattie of telling war stories nothing was volunteered everything had to be chiselled for but in his own laconic way mattie had transported henry into a world that was deeply desperately frightening he understood why he had been chosen for the debrief quite impossible that the director general would have permitted any of those aggressive youngsters that now seemed to fill the building to be let loose on a man of matties stature perhaps the director general had been wrong perhaps one of the young men brash and cocksure would have been better able to understand how mattie had survived the pain had survived and kept eshraqs name safe god forbid that he should be selling mattie short but henry coward that he was and without shame of it could not understand it sunday morning and the light catching the east side of the lane empty streets around the building no rubbish wagons no commuters no office workers the buses were few and far between there were taxis cruising without hope the bin beside parks desk was half filled with cardboard drinking beakers he had long before exhausted the dispenser which would not be filled again until early on the monday and he had been reduced to making his own coffee no milk left over the weekend stiff black coffee to sustain him some of it he had read before but through the night he had punched up on to his console screen everything that the ids computer had to offer on turkey and iran that was his way and a hell of an amount there was and he read again what little had been fed into cedric on charlie eshraq it was his way to arm himself with information and it was also his way to dig himself a pit when circumstances seemed about to crush him he couldnt have gone home not after the visit to century better to get himself back to the lane and to get his head in front of the screen hed been alone until dawn until token had shown shed shown and then shed gone heaven knew where and come back with bacon rolls she sat at the desk opposite him he was latching the plastic sheet over the console i spoke to bill last night when hed got home did you now he said youd had a pretty rotten evening and he was right he said that duggie took your wife home i asked him to he said that you might be in need of looking after she didnt wear makeup and she hadnt combed her short hair and her anorak was slung on the hook on the wall between the windows that looked down on to new fetter lane she wore a sweatshirt that was tight over her radio transmitter he thought that he knew what she was saying what parrish had said to her have you finished ive finished with the computer i dont know what else ive finished with another day another dime david you know what last night they walked all over us we were the little chappies who had stepped out of their depth and we were being told how to behave and the chief took it i still feel sick like i said another day do you want to come home with me what for dont be a cretin im going home got to change might be best to give home a miss she was the girl he ought to have married thats what he thought he knew why she offered her place her bed he knew why she was on offer if she had spoken to bill parrish on the phone thanks he said he came round the desk and when she stood he put his arms around her shoulders and he kissed her forehead it was a soft kiss as if she was his sister as if she could only ever be a friend dont let the bastards hurt you david he slung his suit jacket over his shoulder still in the buttonhole was the red rose that ann had said he should wear for the dance he walked out on token who would have taken him home to her bed he started up the car it was a fast drive through the desert that was the city and it took him little more than an hour to reach home and hed bought flowers at a railway station stall shed left the lights on the lights were on in the hall and in the bedroom and in the bathroom she had left the wardrobe door open and inside the wardrobe there was a chasm her dresses gone the bed wasnt made and the envelope was on the pillow the pillow for gods sake he went into the bathroom because he thought that he was going to throw up and her dressing gown was on the bathmat and her bath towel and beside her bath towel was his perhaps that was the way it always was that a marriage ended the flowers were in the kitchen sink and he didnt know how to make a display of them there was a light knock at the door mrs ferguson beckoning carter out he went and smiled an apology at mattie if there was a way back then mattie did not know it he paced in the room he faced the alternatives and his future there was no going back to go back to admit the lie that was resignation he was a member of the service and if the lie were admitted then he would be out of the service sorry mattie so sorry to have abandoned you the telephone is one of the great tyrannies of modern life things are a little more confused our message to our man in tehran the message for him to abort it didnt get through why not seems that our man had disappeared couldnt be traced thats a shame a long sad silence in the room and henrys eyes never left matties face he walked across the carpet and he stood in front of mattie what ive always heard and you know that ive no personal experience when you start talking under pressure then you cannot ration yourself if you start then you have to finish he said the explosion damn you how many times do i have to tell you i think well have a walk down to the pub youd like that wouldnt you mattie ill ask george to tether the hound the message was very faint the message from the short wave transmitter that was in itself hardly larger than a cornflakes packet was carried the miles from bandar abbas across the shipping lanes of the straits of hormuz to the listening antennae on the summit of the jebal harim in oman only the height of the jebal harim feet above sea level enabled the message to be monitored it was known by the service that the transmitter could reach the antennae with short messages and it had been given to the official who worked in the harbourmasters office for use only in emergency he knew his situation was critical he knew he was being watched he sent the one short message he was a man filled with fear that spilled towards terror and that afternoon he prayed to his god that he would have the protection of mr matthew furniss and the colleagues of mr furniss park was waved forward by the military police corporal there was no salute a ford escort didnt warrant a salute from a corporal who was losing sunday at home park drove forward bumping over the rutted dirt track and he parked beside the suzuki jeep on the far side of the jeep was a black rover newly registered and the driver was quietly polishing the paintwork and minding his own business park had changed at home after he had tidied the bathroom and made the bed that harlech had been in then he had stripped off his suit and put the rose from his buttonhole in water and put on jeans and a sweater he walked towards charlie eshraq eshraq stood with the man the supercilious and drawling creep who had lectured park at century he walked towards them and their conversation didnt hesitate so thats it that is it mr eshraq mr park will accompany you to the border you will not attempt to impede his job you dont fool with him and he has been told not to play silly buggers with you got it and i get the weapons mr eshraq if you were not getting the weapons then this afternoons exercise would be somewhat pointless i dont get to see mr furniss you will be handled from ankara good chap there why do i not see mr furniss because from inside iran you will need to deal with someone else all that will be explained to you once you are in turkey good luck well be rooting for you the driver had finished his polishing and had started up the rover there were no farewells the car drove away in the cause of duty park walked to charlie eshraq im david park no youre not youre april five but you may call me charlie ill call you any name i want to probably like me you reckon this setup stinks eshraq was tango one trafficker in heroin always would be there was no handshake charlie turned his back on him and walked away towards the army landrover park followed and behind him the military police corporal reckoned that it was safe to light a cigarette there was an officer standing beside the landrover and squatting on the low seats in the back were two sergeants david saw the olivepainted case lying on the floor between their feet the officer said which of you is it i was told the instruction was for one for me charlie said the officer looked him up down the law is pretty straightforward oh thats good youll be able to manage the tutorial park thought the officer might have cracked charlie he heard the sergeants laugh aloud they went out on to the range the officer led theyd given charlie a tube to carry and the sergeants each carried one they seemed to walk a hell of a distance past red flags past warning signs until they came to a place where the heather ground sloped away there were tank tracks and ahead of them was the burned black hull of an armoured personnel carrier where are you going to use this young man is that your business dont fuck me about mr eshraq on where you are going to use it depends my briefing are you going to use it in a battlefield condition are you going to use it over open ground are you going to use it in an urban environment you dont have to tell me but if you dont then you are wasting my time and you are wasting your time got me the officer smiled he reckoned he had the upper hand the first one will be fired on a street in tehran thats in iran and the smile died on the officers face all i can say is that i am not totally confident at the moment henry said it was the scrambled phone hes peculiarly aggressive when i attempt to pin down detail yes it bothers me very much that i may be selling him short i suppose we just have to soldier on thank you it was quiet in the house they had indeed been to the pub but that had not been a good idea because the two pints of ale and mrs fergusons lunch had given mattie the excuse to retire to his room for a siesta and it was sunday afternoon and the director general was in the country and the duty desk werent quite sure where the deputy director general was and the man who had taken the call from carter was only a minion and carter was a tedious fusser and mattie furniss was a hero nothing would happen not until monday morning he crouched his left knee was bent forward his right knee was on the ground there were the steel gates ahead of him there was the derelict house behind him the oleanders were in flower and gave him cover and he had elevation from the ruined and overgrown gardens and he could see over the wall that fronted the derelict house and he could see across the road and to the high sheeting of the security gates there was a cramp settling in his legs but he did not respond to it and he struggled to hold the tube steady on his shoulder the tube was well balanced and its weight of lbs kept it firmly in place on his collar bone his left hand gripped tight at the cradle under the tube holding it and the index finger of his right hand was on the smooth plastic of the trigger and the thumb of his right hand was against the switch that would change the firing mechanism from the spotting round to the main projectile his right eye was locked on to the sight and in the centre of his vision were the steel gates to the mullahs home he knew that the mullah was coming because he had heard the revving of the engine of the big mercedes the traffic in the road was continuous and the mercedes would have to stop before it could nose out so hard to be still because the adrenalin flowed and the thrill of revenge stampeded in him the gates opened he saw two guards running forward and across the pavement and they were gesturing for the traffic to stop and the whistles in their mouths were raucous the snout of the mercedes poked through the gates he had a clear view of the radiator grille and the front windscreen the headon target was not the best side shot was better but the side shot would be against an accelerating target even better would have been the magnet bomb that mr furniss had given him and the motorcycle and the chance to see the face of the mullah as he pulled away as the pig knew that he rode underneath death not possible not with the escort car behind he could not see the mullah he would be in the back and through the sight he could only see the radiator and the windscreen and the face of the driver and the face of the guard who sat beside the driver a boy pedalled past on his bicycle and was not intimidated by the whistles and the shouts and the flailed hand weapons of the guards who were on the road and the driver waited for the boy on the bicycle to clear the path ahead the spotter rifle first the flash of the red tracer round running flat and the impact against the join of the bonnet of the mercedes and the windscreen and the windscreen had a clouded mark at the base nearly dead centre thumb to the switch push the switch the finger back to the trigger holding the tube steady ducking it back into the fine of sight because the kick of the tracer round had lifted the aim fractionally squeezing a second time on the trigger and the blast and the recoil and the white heat flash roaring behind him behind his crouched shoulder a shudder of light that moved from the muzzle of the tube at a speed of metres in a second and the range was less than forty metres the explosion on the front of the mercedes the copper slug of the warhead driven into the body of the car and the debris scabs following it and the car rocked back and lifted and the first flicker of fire what he had waited for the car burned and the road was in confusion move yourself eshraq the shout in his ear and his hands still clasped the tube and the voice was faint because his ears thundered from the firing get yourself bloody moving and the officer was dragging at his collar and snatching the tube from his grip you dont stand around to watch you move as if all the demons in hell are on your tail and about half of them will be the officer had flung the tube aside and charlie was on his feet he saw for one last time that the smoke billowed from the armoured personnel carrier target he ran he was bent low and he ran for more than yards up the shallow slope of the hill and away from the officer and the sergeants and the three discarded tubes and the target he ran until he reached park at his own pace the officer walked to him that wasnt bad eshraq he was panting the excitement throbbed in him thank you dont thank me its your skin thats on offer you have to move faster in the moment after firing you do not hang about to congratulate yourself on being a clever kid you fire you drop the tube you move out you were wearing ear protectors no one else in the target zone will be and they will be disorientated for a few seconds you have to make use of those seconds yes understood you wont have realised it time goes pretty fast but you were four seconds and the rest between the rifle aiming round and the missile discharge too long the target today was stationary thats kids play inside an armoured mercedes id rather not be the passenger the law is designed to take out main battle tanks up to metres no car whatever the small arms protection has a chance dont lose any sleep over that are you happy i will remember your kindness just give my love to the ayatollah charlie laughed and he waved he walked away and park followed him he thought park was like the labrador dog that mrs furniss had owned when the girls were still at school and which had been detested by mr furniss he thought the officer was great because there was no bullshit about the man and he had given him the depth of his experience and freely he reached the jeep i am going back to london are you coming with me those are my instructions that i stay with you but ive my own car he heard the tang of dislike in the brittle voice then you can follow me ill do that im going to my flat i know where your flat is im going to my flat and i am going to take a shower and then i am going out to dinner i am going to have a very good meal perhaps you would care to join me he saw the snarl on parks face his face was almost amusing ill eat with you because i have to be with you and ill pay my own share so we understand each other dont want to be with you but those are my orders ill tell you where id like to be with you i would like to be sitting alongside the dock in number two central criminal court and id like to be there when a judge puts you away for fifteen years charlie grinned perhaps youll win some other ones he had stayed in his room all afternoon and when henry had come to the door and knocked and told him that supper was ready he had said that he had no appetite and that he would skip the meal it had been late when he had come down he had been driven downstairs by his growing loneliness that had become keener as the light fell over the trees in the garden they were in the drawing room for that time of year it was unusual for it to have been so cold and mattie stayed close to the fireplace which was idiotic since there was no fire but he felt the chill of his loneliness and he could not shrug the warmth back to his mind henry wasnt communicative it was as though he was watching the clock had decided that sunday evening was his free time and that the debrief would continue in the morning henry had brought him a whisky sat him in a chair with back editions of the illustrated london news and country life and returned to the study of a brochure advertising holidays for ornithologists he craved to ask the question but henry was far from him lost in the danubes marshes he held the drink he hadnt spoken to harriet not since the phone call that was their reunion three quick minutes and stiff lips and both too gushing because they were too old and too regimented to have cried down the lines and he wouldnt speak to her again not until this was over harriet would have known what he should do and equally certainly henry would turn down any request that he call her oh yes hed do it politely but hed do it carter had a calculator out and must have been adding up the damage because just after he had made the final punch a frown ploughed his high forehead mattie saw that henry did nothing by accident he also realized that for all his seniority at century here he was subordinate old henry carter centurys vacuum cleaner for gathering up the odds and sods of administration was running the show and had determined that mattie furniss would be left through that evening to sweat henry smiled melting butter a wrinkled choirboys smile such innocence too damned expensive for me itll be the fens again mattie blurted eshraq charlie eshraq he was due to go back inside did he go henrys eyebrow lifted deliberately he put down the calcu lator and closed the brochure any day now going in the next few days i must say it sounds as if hes taken on more than he can possibly chew mattie thought a knife could have been sharpened on henrys voice hes a fine young man theyre all fine young men mattie our field agents but thatll keep till the morning the director of the revolutionary centre for volunteers for martyrdom was still in his office because on many evenings the office doubled as his bedroom he was in an easy chair and reading a manual of the us marine corps on base security procedures and he was happy in the discovery that they had learned nothing the authors of this study they took coffee thick and bitter and with it was served orange juice they were two men of cultures that were chasms apart the director had spent six years in the qezelhesar gaol in the times of the shah of shahs and he had spent six years in exile in iraq and france if a young mullah who was a rising star had not offered the investigator his protection then in great probability the director would have used the pistol holstered and hanging from a hook behind his door on the back of the neck of the one time s a v a k man the investigator spoke of a watch that was now maintained on a barbers shop in the aksaray district of istanbul he told of a man who would come to the shop at the back of the shop charlie eshraq the son of the late colonel hassan eshraq would collect forged papers that he would use when he came back into iran he asked a great favour of the director he said that he would have this eshraq under surveillance from the moment that he left the shop his request was for a small force of men who would be in position on the frontier to intercept eshraq at whatever crossing point he used would he come over at a crossing point of course and the investigator had researched the matter because of the weight of the armourpiercing missiles he was known to be bringing and their packaging he would have to come by road he asked for the service as if he were a humble creature at the feet of a great man he asked for nothing the director would be most pleased to make such a squad available in the name of the imam the director said consider the words of the martyred ayatollah sadeq khalkhali those who are against killing have no place in islam faith requires the shedding of blood we are there to perform our duty he was a great man and a great butcher and a hanging judge without equal his patron the mullah that he served was but a boy in comparison with khalkhali the unlamented protector of the revolution a great man who spoke words of great wisdom the investigator said and he asked the second favour he asked that after charlie eshraq had collected his papers from the barbers shop that the shop be destroyed by explosives profusely he thanked the director for his cooperation it was necessary for him business completed to stay another hour in the company of the director the director was pleased to report the details of the killing in london of jamil shabro traitor to the imam traitor to his faith and guilty of waging war against allah when they parted in the quiet of the dark on the steps outside the old university their cheeks brushed each others lips if the restaurant had been half empty and not full then park would have sat at a separate table there was only their reserved table so he had to sit with eshraq if he wanted to eat and he did want to eat eshraq made conversation as if they were strangers who had crossed paths in a strange city and needed company and he ate like he was starting a hunger strike in the morning he ate fettucine for starters main course bowl and he followed with the fegato and took the lions share of the vegetables they should have shared and he finished with strawberries and then coffee and a large armagnac to rinse down the valpolicella of which he had drunk two thirds of the bottle park hadnt talked much and the first real exchange was when he had insisted on halving the bill when it came he took his time eshraq but he pocketed the money and he paid the whole bill with an american express card park said but you wont be here not when they bill you present from america thats dishonest why dont you call the head waiter the mocking in the eyes and you eat like a pig eshraq leaned forward and he looked into parks face do you think where i am going that i will be eating a meal like this do you think so and you know what is the penalty for drinking wine and for drinking brandy do you know i dont know and i dont care i could be flogged best thing for you you are a generous member of the human race there was a hesitation and park asked when you get there what do you do i build a life for myself where do you live sometimes rough and sometimes in safe houses at first how long does it last how long is a piece of string april five i dont care its nothing to me but its suicide what did your man offer you many years ago he offered you blood and sweat and tears and he offered you victory he couldnt find the words the words seemed to mean nothing the face loomed ahead of him and there was the chatter and the life of the restaurant around them and the flapping of the kitchen doors and laughter and youre not coming back theres no coming back is there its all one way isnt it youre going back and youre staying there is that right you said that you didnt care that it was nothing to you but i have no intention of dying the bill came back with his plastic he put his tip on the table between his coffee cup and the brandy glass everything that park had given him at the door eshraq kissed the waitress on the mouth and he bowed to the applause of the other customers park followed him out eshraq was on the pavement and flexing himself as if he was breathing in the london street air as if he was trying to keep a part of it for himself for always park walked alongside him back towards eshraqs place he followed the big bounding strides there was an excitement about the man everything before was windup tomorrow was real they reached the entrance to the flats eshraq i just want to tell you something what charlie turned what do you want to tell me april five it had been going through parks mind most of the time at the restaurant he waited while an old lady walked her dog between them waited until the dog had cocked its leg against a railing and was then dragged away i just want you to know that we will follow you anywhere you go except iran if you come out of iran then well know and that goes for the rest of your life well circulate you eshraq theyll hear about you in paris bonn rome washington theyll know youre a trafficker in drugs if you come out of iran if you pitch up at any airport then ill hear ill get the call you want to play games with us just try us thats the truth eshraq and dont ever forget it charlie smiled he fished his keys from his pocket youre welcome to sleep on the floor i prefer my car are you married whats that to you just assumed you hadnt a home to go to my instructions are to stay close to you until you go over the border i asked if you were married i was what broke it if its any of your business you broke it the director general was at the joint intelligence committee the deputy director general was on his way back from the country of all the many hundreds who worked on the nineteen floors and the basement at century they were the only two who had an overall picture of furniss case both would be at their desks by the late morning of monday neither was available for the fast reaction that was needed to coordinate a jumble of information originating from differing sources there was carters call from albury on sunday that had been logged by the duty officer there was the monitoring of a short wave radio message in oman that required immediate response there was a report brought by a turkish lorry driver to dogubeyezit and from there telephoned to ankara related matters but early on that monday morning as the building strove without enthusiasm to throw off lethargy those matters remained unrelated the transcript of henry carters message was passed to the director generals pa the short wave radio message ended on the desk of a man with the title of special services armed forces liaison the communication from ankara lay in the in tray of the desk head near east later a subcommittee would be set up to examine means of ensuring that all crucial intelligence was distributed at once to the desks that were available to deal with it there had been subcommittees with that brief as long as the old hands could remember faced with the absence of the director general and his deputy the ssafl officer took a car across the thames to the ministry of defence to ask a rare favour of old navy chums they went on the morning flight charlies ticket was one way parks a return they flew tourist class they didnt have to talk on the flight because charlie slept park couldnt sleep not with the stiffness settling in after a cramped night in the back of the escort he was grateful that eshraq slept because hed had his bellyful of small talk it had started with a police phone tap on a dealer but parrish didnt tell them that nor did he tell april team that there had been all but blood on the carpet when the ndiu had passed it from police control to id his style was matter of fact he showed no signs of having had about the worst weekend he could remember since joining customs and excise it would have been a passable weekend if his wife hadnt pitched in with her opinions and her report he told it as he knew it the dealers supplier was a turk who operated out of the port of izmir the scag would be iranian and across the land border and into turkey and then overland to izmir he had the name of the ship out of izmir and its route was via naples it was known that naples information provided by the drugs enforcement agency was a pickup point for a consignment of italian pinewood furniture the assumption was that the scag would be coming into southampton docks all tucked up with the table legs april would be there in force he would be there himself along with harlech and corinthian and token and the new kid from felixstowe who had joined them that day and who hadnt yet a codename which meant thai theyd call him extra and there would be backup from southampton id parrish said that it was good they had the dealer spoken for and the supplier but that they wanted the distributor he reckoned the distributor would show at southampton theyd be going down that morning and he didnt know when theyd be back so theyd better have their clean socks with them there were the jokes about the cars from the depot being clapped out and the vodaphones not working all the usual crap he was pretty pleased that theyd another investigation to latch on to so soon and better still to get them out of london those of april who were not going to southampton would be for the delights of bethnal green chez the dealer and for the banks where he had his accounts the ship was coming in that night was already down the channel with a brixham pilot on board so could they get their backsides off their seats please hed finished his finger snaked out pointed to duggie williams he gestured towards the inner office and headed there he sat at the desk he let harlech stand hed get it off his chest he thought april was the best team in the lane and he was damned if hed see it broken saturday night duggie that was insufferable she asked for it you only had to take her home drop her how did you know i know but if i hadnt known id have read it all over your face she was ready for it she was the wife of your colleague i didnt start the dumping hes your brotherinarms for heavens sake hes a prig and a bore and he doesnt keep his missus happy sorry bill no apologies if i catch you round there again you going to sit on the doorstep youre back in uniform she was the unhappiest woman ive ever poked and shes a good kid and where is our brotherinarms dont know dont know where he is what hes got himself into lose yourself the dg rang mattie hes just back from the joint intelligence session he wanted you to know that your praises were sung to the roof thank you much appreciated and im to tell you that youre being put up for a gong i thought those sort of things were supposed to be a surprise be the order of the british empire mattie i expect the dg wanted to cheer you a bit why henry do i need cheering your agent in tabriz revolutionary guards beat us to him and what exactly are you implying which comes on top of your man in tehran also not reached also gone absent although we dont know for certain that he was arrested we do know it of the man in tabriz ill tell you what i think i think that i was compromised from the time that i landed in the gulf i think that i was trailed right the way across the gulf right the way to ankara and on to van i think i was set up from the start whats happened to my man in bandar abbas making a run for it tonight navy are going to try and pick him up at sea i think thats rather dodgy he knows they are watching him i told you i gave their names looking back on it on the moment that i knew knew absolutely that my cover was a farce was when the investigator asked me what i had been doing all round the gulf he practically gave me the addresses i had been at starting in bahrain i wish youd get someone on to this at once see just who is in and out of that service wing but yes what must have been two weeks later i did give their names but what i cant get over is the utter uselessness it makes me sick to think of it of day upon day of torture while the service twiddles its thumbs and now you come moping in here and say alas weve lost another agent lost for gods sake henry not lost thrown away henry said im on your side mattie and was from the very start no professional would have let it happen ive told you that but id like to leave the gaol now come back to it later and well certainly do as you say about the bahrain station i want to talk this afternoon about the actual escape they sat either side of the unlit fire and henry was mother and poured the tea carter wriggled in his shirt he had not brought enough shirts to last him and he had had to entrust his dirty ones to mrs ferguson and the woman used too much starch the shirt was uncomfortable against his skin worse the summer had come at last and even with the lounge curtains half drawn the room still sweltered and henry boiled unhappily in his threepiece suit and stiff shirt your investigator mattie your torturer what was he looking for in general they wanted to know why i was in the region what was my brief and what did you tell them i told them that i was an archaeologist of course you stick to your cover story its all you have to hang on to and youre not believed right im not believed but you have to stick to your cover whatever the holes are in it and i was never going to be believed the interrogator was an old savak hand and he had met me years ago in tehran he knew exactly who i was called me furniss the first time i was sat down in front of him they caught a bbc bulletin saying that dr owens was missing he made fun of that on that day you still hadnt abandoned your cover do you understand anything you are alone you are beyond help if you give up your cover story then you are finished they wanted to know your mission in the region and what else were they fishing for names of agents they knew you were in the region and they knew your identity what did they know of the identity of the agents they didnt have the names did they have anything on them if they did they didnt give me any hint of it henry said quietly you gave them what they wanted but not the name of charlie eshraq he saw the head go down he did not know how long it would take it might take the rest of the day and it might take the rest of the week but mattie had dropped his head how many sessions mattie plenty torture sessions mattie how many six seven they were whole days whole days of torture and in essence the questions were the same what i was doing in the region and the names of the agents im very admiring of you mattie that you were tortured day after day that the questions were over such a small area range and that you held the cover story so long very admiring did you consider mattie telling them a little about charlie eshraq of course you consider it because the pain is so great i hoped the names of the field agents would be enough youll have to talk me through this you are in great pain you are the subject of the most vicious and degrading treatment the questions are asked again and again because they dont believe you have named all the agents what do you say you stay with your story damn difficult mattie you have no choice through the kickings beatings faintings through a mock execution henry made a note on the pad that rested on his knee he saw that mattie watched him he saw the trickle of relief on the mans face of course he was relieved he saw his inquisitor make a note on his pad and he would have assumed that carter made the note because he was satisfied with the answer and the assumption was incorrect henry noted on his pad that he must ring century for more clothes for mattie there was always a stock of clothes held there for visitors there was a wardrobe full of slacks and jackets and jerseys and shirts and underwear and socks assorted styles and shapes even shoes mattie would need more clothes because he was trapped in a lie and the debrief would go on until the lie was disowned i think you are a very gentle man mattie what does that mean i think that you care about people over whom you exercise control i hope i do there was a sad smile on carters face he would have been deeply and sincerely upset to have had mattie believe that he took pleasure from his work mattie when you left the kids on the mountain the kids who lifted you up when you were finished shared their food with you and so on that must have hurt obviously super kids werent they great kids and they helped you when you were at your weakest mattie shouted what did you want me to do you didnt argue their case you told me that you walked away from them and you sorted yourself out with the officer i did try but its true i didnt upset the applecart as far as to get pushed back up the hill myself my first priority my duty as i saw it was to get myself back to london thats a heavy cross that sort of duty you werent there henry bloody carter you werent there you can never know the sun played on the windows and the distortions of the old glass were highlighted and the brilliance of the rare sunshine showed up the dirt dust on the panes if george if the handyman were to hold his job then it was about time the idle wretch started to get round the windows with a bucket of warm water and a pocket full of rags carter said my assessment mattie and this is not meant as a criticism is that you were looking to save yourself hear me out saving yourself was pretty important to you saving yourself was more important to you than speaking up for those kids who had carried you to the border the hoarse rasp in matties voice one minute you want me to hang on long enough in the victims chair and get every bone in my body broken fingernails tugged out all that and the next minute you want me to have got myself booted back across the border i want to know what you would have done to save yourself from the pain of torture why dont you refresh your memory with a glance at my medical report or would you like me to take my socks off i need to know if you named eshraq to save yourself from the pain of torture i might have named them all the minute the interrogation began no call for that mattie there was a grimace from carter as if he had been personally wounded when i was down here must have been a couple of years back there was an old croquet set in the cellar ive told that lazy blighter to mow a bit of the lawn would you fancy a game of croquet mattie after weve had our lunch to save yourself your own admission you let those kids be herded to a firing party what would you have done to save yourself from the pain of torture ive told you of course eshraqs going back over very soon they went to their lunch and through the open windows there was the coughing drone of the old cylinder mower out on the lawn and the pandemonium of the dog at georges heels the route of the lorry had been through calais munich salzburg belgrade and then the poor roads of bulgaria nineteen hundred miles in all and a run of hours sometimes the driver worried about the tachograph sometimes his employer took care of his lorries and paid him extra money for hammering across europe there was the potential that the tachograph would be examined at a border post but that potential was slight and the driver with extra funding could live with that slight potential the driver was skilled at negotiating the overland customs point at aziziye it had been his habit for years to telephone ahead from bulgaria to his friend at the customs at aziziye to warn of his arrival the driver called the customs officer his friend to his face but in fact had similar friends at most of the entry points to european countries where he might be ending his journey and requiring customs clearance the bribe that was given to the customs officer at aziziye was not so much to prevent search of the containers on the lorry and its trailer more to ensure a smooth passage for the cargo a present a gift for the customs officer was an essential part of any swift movement of goods his vehicle was well known at the aziziye crossing point there was no reason for him to attract attention and with the gift to his friend he ensured speed it was a healthy arrangement and paid for on this occasion by a carton of marlboro cigarettes a seiko watch and an envelope of us dollar bills the lorry travelled through the seals of the containers had been legally broken he had his manifest list signed stamped the driver was free to drop off at an assembly of addresses the contents of his containers he had brought into turkey quite illicitly and quite easily four law armourpiercing missiles and he carried in his wallet a passportsized photograph of the man to whom he would deliver four wooden crates and hed get a holiday with the wife and the kids in majorca on the bonus he was promised for the successful shipment of the particular cargo that was stowed at the bulkhead of the container that was immediately behind the drivers cab a piece of cake the customs point at aziziye the lorry headed for istanbul the envelope contained a dogeared and wellscuffed shenassnameh recognition paper and a certificate of military discharge following injury and a drivers licence for a commercial vehicle included also in the envelope was a letter of authentication from a factory in yazd that produced precision ballbearings and would therefore be classified as important to the war effort and there were bank notes rials as he took each item out of the envelope charlie held it against the light that hung down from the ceiling of the room at the back of the barbers shop he looked for the signs of overwriting and overstamping it was right that he should check carefully his life depended on them he paid cash he paid in sterling notes he thought that the forger could have bought a half of the aksaray district with what he made in documentation provided for the refugee exiles he thought that he was a case of interest to the forger because the forger had told him not the time before but the time before that had confided in charlie that he was the only customer who looked for documentation to go back inside iran the barbers shop was in the centre of the aksaray district that was the little iran of istanbul to the room at the back of the shop there came by appointment a stream of men and women seeking the precious papers which were required for them if a new life were to be born out of exile and he charged he charged what he thought he could get and those from whom he could get nothing received nothing from him for a turkish passport he charged and this was the bottom of his range and full of risk to the bearer because the number would not tally with any of the records maintained on the interior ministry computer for a british or a federal german passport with entry visa he would expect to relieve his customer of most expensive top of his range was the american passport with multiple entry visa and there were very few customers who had managed to secrete that sort of cash in used notes sometimes but only occasionally the forger took diamonds in lieu of cash but he was loth to do that because he had no knowledge of precious stones and then he must go and put himself at the mercy of the young jew in the covered bazaar that was a thousand metres away down yeniceriler caddesi and he might be cheated with fast and busy fingers he counted the cash when they shook hands when charlie had pocketed the brown envelope when the forger had locked away the money then charlie noticed the tic flicker on the right upper eyelid of the forger charlie did not consider that the tic flicker might have been caused by fear apprehension he thought the twitching came from an over indulgence in close and painstaking work charlie eshraq walked out into the sunshine he looked up the street for his shadow he saw park he was at least yards up the street charlie was about to wave a curt acknowledgement when he saw the shadow turn away from him he had first seen the tail in the aksaray district where the walls were covered with posters that rubbished khomeini where the kids gathered to plot crimes that would bring them the money to get out of turkey and onwards into europe he had first seen the tail when eshraq had come out of the doorway of the barbers shop and started to walk towards him he wasnt sure whether there were two cars but he was certain that there was one car there were three men on the hoof there was the man in the forecourt of the cafe who stood and then came after eshraq as soon as he emerged into the sunshine he was a tail because he left three quarters of a glass of cola undrunk there was a man who had been leaning against a telephone pole and who had been busy cleaning his nails and his nails didnt seem to matter once eshraq was out there was a third man and when the car had pulled level with him then he had spoken quickly into the lowered front passenger window he knew a tail when it was in front of him hed thought that the tail was good in istanbul hed thought the tail was better in ankara he didnt doubt that the tail had been in place from the time they had walked out of the terminal of the esenboga airport but he hadnt picked it up until eshraq had gone park walking with the young man who called himself terence in the park the genclik park with the lakes and the artificial islands and the cafes he had kept himself back and he had watched eshraq and his contact from more than a quarter of a mile three men again but different from those who had done the footslog in istanbul he could have rung bill parrish and he didnt he could have called up the acio and he didnt they had passed him on from the lane they would be into the priority of harlechs case and sifting everything else that had taken back seat to the eshraq investigation they wouldnt have wanted to have known that there was a tail on eshraq he acknowledged that the tails were in place he allowed them to stay in place a man who wore a new black leather jacket and who had a trimmed goats beard he saw him in the genclik park and he saw him at the airport when he and eshraq boarded for van there was no communication between them there was no bond in formation eshraq was moving to the frontier and park was his shadow they hardly spoke when they spoke it was commonplace and factual they spoke about where eshraq was going how long he would be there where he would be going afterwards that didnt bother park and it seemed to him that it didnt concern eshraq no need for it to have concerned either of them they were the subjects of a deal and if eshraq had a tail on him had had a tail ever since he had walked clear of the barbers shop in the aksaray district of istanbul then that was his worry not parks tl to turkdesk century cc irandesk ddg from ankara station message ce vanwards in company of park transhipment from uk complete no hitch and now in transit vanwards have

london mattie reporting back i wont be sorry henry if they slap your wrist probably will wont be for the first time what i was saying its not quite a matter of bolting the stable door after the horse has gone theres still one horse in the stable eshraq is in the stable not for much longer but hes there right now are you quite sure there is nothing you wish to add to what you have already told me quite sure when i get back if theres still enough light we might get the mallets out again very soothing is croquet do you think we should have a nightcap one for the stairs boghammer bill was a blip limeshaded on the emerald wash of the screen the operator the egghead of the radar room crew had identified the blip and called over the ic to watch its progress the crew of the type guided missile frigate were on defence watch they were dripping sweat those in the radar room those on the bridge those manning the mm rapid fire close engagement guns the middle of the night and the temperature close to fahrenheit and all crew members swaddled in the white gown action suits and hooded the technician knew that it was boghammer bill from the speed of the blip on the screen it was a swedish built patrol boat and the fastest craft in the gulf the type would not hang about not in the waters where it was now cruising maintaining radio silence and blacked out just outside the iranian twelve mile limit for any more minutes than were essential the ic thought the world was getting dangerously daft there was a bright moon high in a clear sky and there was no wind it was a ridiculous night to be stooging just off the limit without identification or prior warning they were east of the iranian island of larak and west of the small fishing harbour of minab far too bloody many sea miles from their regular station on escort duty in the straits of hormuz the ic knew the mission but he didnt know his skippers rules of engagement orders if they came under iranian fire they had been watching the dhow on the screen for more than half an hour and they could picture the fishing craft chugging on a small engine away from minab the ic knew it was the dhow they were to rendezvous with because its course was directly towards the longitude latitude reference that he had been given and there were no other crawling blips on the screen it was now seven minutes since the patrol boat had speared on to the screen going fast out of bandar abbas powered by engines that could attain in excess of knots staccato reports from the ic to the bridge gestures that were self evident from the technician to the ic the dhow was on course for the rendezvous and boghammer bill was on course to intercept the dhow some four miles short of the rendezvous no hiding place not on a clear night when he was home on leave when he was in plymouth the ics idea of relaxation was to get himself up to one of the devon water supply reservoirs and to put a small roach on to a damn great treble hook and let it flutter underneath a big bobbing float until it attracted the attention of a pike of course the ic never saw the pike actually close on the tethered roach couldnt see under the murk of the reservoir surface but he imagined it he told himself that the pike didnt stalk its dinner it charged it he thought of boghammer bill as the pike he thought that some poor creature on the dhow was the roach bait he watched the blips closing he watched the racing speed of the blip that was boghammer bill the blips closed merged he had waited in his office at the ministry building he had waited for the final message to be telexed to the communications rooms in the basement in place were the arrest at sea of the official who worked in the harbourmasters office at bandar abbas in place were three teams of men from the revolutionary centre for volunteers for martyrdom settled into a guards corps barracks at maku that was close to the main overland crossing point from turkey in place were three men who had tracked eshraq from the airfield at van to dogubeyezit there was one aspect of the situation that still puzzled the investigator as he cleared his desk shovelled the maps and the briefing notes into his case furniss had named charlie eshraq and yet eshraq was in dogubeyezit eshraq was in the ararat hotel in dogubeyezit why was he not warned off at this time he did not concern himself with the man who had accompanied eshraq from istanbul to ankara to van to dogubeyezit time enough for that but later his car waited at the military airfield an aircraft waited he was a coming man when he had eshraq at the border he would be a man who had arrived if eshraq came to the border very confusing he had started early certainly before mattie furniss was on the move he had gone to his flat one bedroom and a large living room and all the usuals which was plenty for him fixed rent too and they couldnt get him out to collect his post he sat on the bench in front of the spinning soapy window he had raised a few eyebrows there werent many who came to the launderette and stuffed into the cavern an armful of clean ironed shirts hed paid for a double rinse which he thought would be sufficient to sort out the starch once and for all he gazed at the maelstrom in front of him he was a regular and sometimes there were people there who knew him and talked to him quite a little social club on a thursday evening he doubted there was a man or woman in the building who would want to hear what he had to say certainly not the director general who was giving him fifteen minutes and it was bad news for him that the ddg was on his way that morning to washington when his shirts were washed rinsed and dried he folded them carefully and carried them back to his flat and gave them a quick iron his car was on a good parking place too good to lose and so he took a bus from putney bridge along the river route to century no one loved the bearer of evil tidings but what choice did he have he believed that mattie was lying the dog was chained to the leg of the one solid garden seat mattie strode behind the mower he had george at the wheelbarrow for the cuttings he made neat lines he knew where henry carter had gone poor old henry and not half as clever as hed thought he had seen to it that the telephone in the hall was removed but he had forgotten the telephone in mrs fergusons bedroom he did the croquet lawn close cut he assumed that george was prepared to be outside with him ferrying the cuttings to the compost heap because george had been instructed to mind him his name is charlie eshraq mattie mowed pure straight stripes and he scrubbed from his mind the echo of his own words but he has told you nothing that is quite correct sir he has admitted absolutely nothing the director generals smile was withering but you don t believe him i wish i could sir and i cannot but you have no evidence to substantiate your distrust i have the conviction that a man who is driven by days of torture to name his field agents is not going to be allowed to stop there but why do you think he didnt make his escape before giving eshraqs name ah yes that sir is a hunch and you are prepared to damn a man because of your hunch on the basis of what i might rephrase as a lifetime of listening to debriefs sir i would simply avoid sending this young man into iran until we are certain no one has explained to me the reason for the haste there are all sorts of things that you dont know carter there was a light knock houghton walked in like a man who has been told that his banker has defaulted he didnt seem to notice henry carter he laid a single sheet of paper on the director generals desk there was the moment of quiet while the director general ferreted in his breast pocket for his reading glasses from our naval friends in the gulf youd better hear what it says carter its timed at message no repeat no rendezvous subject craft intercepted by iran navy boghammer missile boat believed all crew of subject craft taken on board before subject craft sunk boghammer returned to base bandar abbas we resuming escort duty message ends the director general placed the sheet of paper back on to his desk he removed his reading glasses what would furniss say mattie would say that he had been through a hell that neither you nor i can comprehend in order that we would have had the time to get those three men clear mattie would say that our lack of resolution condemned our network to death he admits the names came from him yes but only after withstanding what i reckon to be anywhere between five and seven days of torture if he admits that why then can he not admit to naming eshraq pride carter spoke the word as if it were an obscenity as if he should now go and wash out his mouth with soap what in gods name has pride got to do with it eshraq is more or less part of his family he cannot bring himself to admit that to save himself from pain he would betray his family are you really telling me carter that furniss would sacrifice eshraq for his pride just my opinion yes the director general went to his safe he obscured the combination from henry carters view he played the numbers he opened the safe he took out a file the file was old worn the writing on the outer flap was faint faded since he was taken ive been looking into furniss history ive come across nothing that indicated any vestige of vanity i have found only a man of outstanding loyalty and steadiness did you know that he was in cyprus during the emergency in the guards with a platoon very young did you know that im not surprised because i gather that period is not on his general biography he was on a search mission on the troodos slopes some idiot decided that the brushwood should be fired so that an eoka gang would be smoked out and driven towards the positions where furniss unit were waiting for them the wind got up the fire ran out of control furniss platoon was surrounded by a wall of fire the report ive read is from his company commander who watched it all through field glasses furniss held his men together kept them calm waited until their clothes were damn near burned off their bodies he waited until he saw a break in the fire wall and he led his guardsmen through it and all this time the platoon i was under enemy fire they lost six men i havent come across anyone in century who knows that story obviously furniss has never mentioned it does that strike you carter as symptomatic of a vain or proud man carter smiled tired wearied that was about winning sir this is about losing well tell me what do you want i need some help with furniss sir if you will be good enough to authorize it he had the number of the lorry and he had photographed the driver that would wait that was other business park looked down from the hotel room into the back yard he saw the driver and eshraq transfer the crates one at a time and heavy from the lorry to the tail doors of the transit the evening was closing on dogubeyezit the car crunched on the drive scattered the gravel mattie heard it and he saw henrys flickering eyebrow register the arrival of the car mattie coughed as if he tried to draw attention to himself and away from the car that arrived at the country house at past ten in the evening and carter wasnt having it carter was listening for the car and for the slammed door and for the suburban chime on the bell in the porch mattie did not know what was to happen only that something was to happen he knew that something was to happen because henry had been back four hours from london and had not said what had happened in london and had said precious little about anything else mattie understood henrys silence through the evening was because he was waiting and now the waiting was over to mattie it was absurd the pallid smile of apology as henry let himself out of the drawing room he thought that it was possibly the end of the road for them both and he reckoned that he had henrys measure another night another day survived and he would be on his way to bibury and back to his desk at century of course mattie had not asked what henry had been up to in london to have asked would have been weakness weakness was no longer a part of matties world weakness was the villa at tabriz and the hook on the wall and the electrical flex and the firearm that was not loaded and that was all behind him weakness was scrubbed away by the trek across the mountains to the slopes of mer dag on that evening after the long silences over supper there was a part of matties mind that could no longer remember with any clarity much of the days and nights in the villa if he had tried and there was no damn way that he was going to try then he might have been able to recall fragments moments no damn way that he was going to try his name is charlie eshraq no damn way at all the door opened henry stood aside made room the man was sturdy the hair on his head was close cut barely tolerating a parting he wore a suit that was perhaps slightly too small and which therefore highlighted the muscle growth of the shoulders his face was clean shaven bar the stub brush moustache mattie couldnt help himself good god major this is a surprise grand to see you i hear weve a little problem mr furniss the man said the moonlight was silver on the snow peak of ararat when he tilted his head dropped his gaze then he could see the outline shadow of the transit the heavy gates of the hotels yard were padlocked for the night the lorry and its driver were long gone they would be in erzerum tonight hed heard that said when he had watched from the window and seen eshraq pay the driver off seen him pay him off with the money that had once belonged to a greek christ and that was simple watching the house of a greek with token in tow and doing the things that came easy to him nothing came easy for park in a shared hotel room in dogubeyezit eshraq was sitting behind him on the bed that he had chosen eshraq had taken the bed further from the door eshraq ignored park he had laid out on the bed a series of large scale maps of northern iran eshraq hadnt spoken for more than an hour and park had stood by the window for all of that time and stared over the unmoving unchanging vista that ran towards the distant summit of ararat get up the voice rattled in matties ears there was no place of safety get up mr furniss but there had never been a place of safety no safety here no safety in the cellar of the villa in tabriz they merged there was the carpet of the lounge and the tiled floor of the cellar there were the pictures on the wall of the lounge and there was the hook on the wall of the cellar there were the armchairs with the faded floral covers and there was the iron bed frame with the straps and the stinking blanket there was the rasp of the majors voice and there was the hushed clip of the investigators voice the hands reached down for him i said mr furniss to get up the hands were at the collar of matties jacket and grasping at the shoulders of his shirt and the jacket was too loose and did not make a good fit and was climbing up his arms and over the back of his head and the shirt was too tight and could not be fastened at the collar and was ripping he didnt help he lay as lead weight he was pulled upright but when the grip weakened because his jacket was coming off him and the shirt was too torn to hold then mattie collapsed back on to the carpet he was lifted again and the major was panting just as they had panted in the cellar he was lifted to his feet and he was held and he was shaken as if he were a rug he was thrown backwards his arms were flailing and found nothing to catch and he cracked down on to the carpet and the back of his head hammered the floor he gazed up henry stood in front of the fireplace looking away as if he wanted no part of this mattie no longer knew how long it had been since the major had first slapped his face out of the blue a question a deflecting answer and the slap homing on to his cheek the smarting at his eyes the reddening of his cheek but the slap across the face had been only the start he had been slapped he had been kicked he had been punched it was not vicious the pain was not inflicted on him for the sake of it the pain was a humiliation and a progression they did not want to inflict pain on him they only wanted him to talk the blows were harder the kicks fiercer they wanted to do it with the minimum the bastards he lay on the carpet mattie let his head roll to the side oh yes mattie had learned from the cellar in tabriz kids play this after the cellar and the hook on the wall and the electrical flex and the unloaded weapon he looked at henry and henry had his hand over his face mattie let his head sag he lay still he heard carters voice the whinny of apprehension they said that he wasnt to be abused hes only faking do you want an answer or do you not want an answer for christs sake its mattie furniss i want the answer of course i want the answer but ill be minced if hes hurt so whats at stake mr carter a mission god what a mess the life of an agent is at stake he was splayed out on the carpet and he was trying to control his breathing as a man would breathe when he was unconscious slow and steady the blow came between his legs he had no warning of the kick he cried out and he heaved his knees into his stomach and he rolled on the carpet and his hands were over his groin his eyes were squeezed shut watering good god major the tremor in carters voice he was faking told you and the major had dropped down beside mattie mattie felt his head lifted he opened his eyes he saw the majors face a few inches from his own his name is charlie eshraq mr furniss dont be a silly chap what did you tell them the merging of the face of the major and the face of the investigator christ they must think he was pretty piss poor they were the same face they were the same voice mattie furniss did not talk mattie furniss was desk head iran and he had the second chance he had lost the first chance talked cracked broken but he had the second chance the pain was through his stomach and the retching was writhing in his throat he had the second chance my name is owens i am an academic a scholar of the urartian civilization and he was sliding slipping and the blackness was closing around him charlie lay on his bed the light was off he was close to the window and the moon silver filtered the cotton curtains he knew that park was awake parks breathing told him that he was still awake he was packed he was ready he was going at the dawn at the foot of the bed beside the soap box his rucksack was filled and in the yard outside the transit was loaded with drums of electrical flex for industrial use and under the drums were three wooden packing crates he was going in the morning and park hadnt spoken since the light in the hotel room had been turned off there was the bleat of animals in the night air the call of the goats and the cry of the sheep there was once the wail of a jandarma siren there was the drone of the hotels generator there was the whirring flight of a mosquito he was charlie eshraq he was years old he was the man with the mission and with the target he was not afraid of death not his own and not the death of his enemies and why couldnt the bastard talk to him why in hells name not in the moon darkness in the hotel room he wanted to talk if he had been with the dossers under the arches of charing cross station then he would have had someone to talk to he was going back inside he knew how to fire the weapon and he knew the faces of his targets and he knew the routes that he would use and he was going back inside alone and he wanted to talk david i want to talk i want to sleep david is that why your wife went why because you have no love i have no love for heroin traffickers the heroin was for money the money was for weapons the weapons were for the killing of evil people in my book the evil people traffic in heroin there was no other way thats an excuse eshraq and excuses dont make rights out of wrongs david who do you love none of your business anyone anyone in the world i want to sleep and i want to get out of this shit hole in the morning do you love your wife thats my business my sister david she was my business i dont care i will tell you what they did to my sister they took her from the gaol at evin they flew her to tabriz they drove her to the centre of the town they had brought a crane into the centre of the town they stood my sister on a table and they put a rope around her neck there were many hundreds of people there to watch her die david i am told by people who were there that when my sister stood upon the table and looked down on to the people who had come to watch her die that she smiled at them she made the smile of a girl who was not yet a woman it was talked about for many weeks afterwards the way that my sister smiled they kicked her off the table and they hoisted the crane up that was how she died they tell me that she died in great pain that she did not die easily there were two men who held her on the table as the executioner put the rope around her neck i killed them as i killed the executioner if it had been your wife david and not my sister would you not have wanted money for weapons running heroin is wrong for me thats the beginning and the middle and the end of it because you have no love because i have no love for people who run heroin your father is alive my father is alive do you love your father i want to go to sleep is it shaming to say that you love your father my feelings for my father thats not your concern my father was in the gaol at evin he was a soldier he was not a policeman he was not in the s a v a k he never commanded troops who were used to put down the revolt of the masses he was an enemy of no man and he was my father i know about my sister david her last hours and i know also something of the last hours of my father i know that he was taken from his cell at dawn one morning out into the killing yard at evin he was tied to a stake in the yard and shot there when that has happened to your father and your uncle has been butchered is it wrong to want weapons you can talk all night eshraq me ill be sleeping he heard the heaving of the bed he saw the shadow of parks body toss as the back was turned to him he thought that by the next nightfall he would be far inside he thought that at the next dusk he would be approaching the stone hovel of majid nazeri on the frost cold slopes of iri dagh he would be where there were eagles and where there were wolf packs and where as the light came or as the light went there was the chance of seeing the fleeting passage of a leopard perhaps that was his world perhaps he did not belong never had belonged in the world of david park david may i ask a favour i doubt youll get it what that you take back a letter for me just a letter to a very fine man a very kind man a man who knew about love there was the grated concession ill take it charlie crawled from his bed and he went to his rucksack and took out the envelope the envelope had been bent while it had been lying amongst his clothes and his map charts in the rucksack he laid the envelope on the table beside parks bed he stood at the window carefully slowly he edged aside the curtain he looked down at the transit he saw the jutting nose of a mercedes car and he saw the white light flash he felt the thunder roar in his ears and he felt the hot heat back draught of the law you should try to find love david without love then life is empty he had waited all evening for a call to be routed through to the nineteenth floor his chauffeur was in the car park below houghton was yawning the director general dialled the number and they were a long time answering carter is that you carter have you any idea of the time it is past midnight i have been waiting for two and a quarter hours for your call what has furniss said the voice was faint tinny the scrambler connection had that effect and the scrambler could not disguise the hesitancy of the far away metallic voice he hasnt said anything then youve a problem carter by christ you have im aware of the problem sir my advice to you carter is that you have one hour i want to speak to furniss he heard the telephone put down clumsily he heard the tramp of departing footsteps he waited what was the bloody man at he didnt know how he would ever again face furniss he heard the footsteps returning not possible at the moment sir to speak to mattie carter understand me understand your position ill see you gutted if harm has come to furniss if you turn out to be wrong ill have you skinned you have one hour he thought that he had betrayed furniss he felt deep shame he strode out of his office and he had no word for his personal assistant who padded behind him he thought that he had betrayed a very good man the station officer could no longer stay awake on a pad beside the telephone in the bedroom was written the code of dogubeyezit and the number of the ararat hotel the call from london if it came would be in clear there was no difficulty in that the codeword for a halt a postponement had been agreed via the teleprinter in his office before he had shut up shop for the evening in an ideal world he should not have been snuggling against his wifes back in his own bed he should have been close to that wretched frontier up in northeastern anatolia he should have been hugging the iranian border not his wifes slim back no question of him being there the frontier was out of bounds the border was closed territory after the lifting of the desk head iran he had not been told the reason that there might possibly but not probably be a hold put on eshraqs movement he had no need to know why there might conceivably be a hold if there were a hold then he would communicate it he drifted towards sleep he had rather enjoyed the company of the young man who had come to the park in ankara a bit wild of course any man going inside iran with law os was entitled to be a bit bloodyminded but they had thrashed out their lines of communication not that he would last not possible that he would survive terence is that phone going to ring tonight therell be murder if it does dont know love i really dont know they had not slept they had lain on sleeping bags on the concrete floor inside the inner hall of the guards barracks at maku the investigator was amongst the last to push himself back up to his feet there were some amongst them who prayed and some who worked with clean cloths at the firing mechanisms of their automatic rifles the investigator wandered out of the inner hall in search of the latrine and after the latrine he would be in search of the communications room and news from the men who watched a hotel across the border it was sensible of him to leave the inner hallway for the latrine and the communications room if he had stayed then it would have been remarked that he had not prayed it was hard for him to pray because the words of the quran held no place in his mind he had no time that early morning because his mind was filled with the vision of armourpiercing missiles and a transit van and the man who had been named by matthew furniss he would enjoy his meetings with mr eshraq he thought that he might enjoy conversing with charlie eshraq more than he had enjoyed talking to matthew furniss the clock was striking in the hall and the dog was restless and sometimes there was the heavy scratching at the kitchen door and sometimes there was the clamour of the animal shaking the big link chain on its throat the dog wouldnt sleep not while there were still people moving in the house and voices mattie heard the clock the light was in his eyes he was on the sofa and they had stripped his shoes off and they had heaved his feet too on to the sofa his tie was off and the shirt buttons were undone down to his navel he could see nothing but the light the light was directed from a few feet so that it shone directly into his face it was a long time since they had hit him kicked him but the light was in his face and the major was behind him and holding his head so that he could not look away from the light and the bastard henry fucking carter was behind the light questions the soft and gentle drip of questions always the questions and so bloody tired so hellishly tired and the hands were on his head and the light was in his eyes and the questions dripped at his mind past all our bedtimes mattie just what you told them a young mans life mattie thats what were talking about so what did you tell them nobodys going to blame you mattie not if you come clean what did you tell them all that barbarian stuff thats over mattie no more call for that and youre with friends now what did you tell them too tired to think and too tired to speak and his eyes burned in the light i dont remember i really dont remember got to remember mattie because there is a life hanging on you remembering what you told them park watched the peace of charlie eshraqs sleep he wondered how it would be to live with love he was alone and he was without love he was without parrish and token and harlech and corinthian he was without ann he was away from what he knew what he knew was behind him back at the lane what he knew had been stripped from him on the nineteenth floor of century house he did not know how to find love he thought that going to bogota was a journey to escape from love there was the sharp bleep of the alarm on eshraqs wrist he watched as eshraq stirred then shook himself eshraq was rubbing hard at his eyes and then sliding from his bed and going to the window the curtain was dragged back there was a grey wash of early light in the room eshraq stretched pretty good morning to be starting a journey there was a glass of scotch and water beside him the major sat on the sofa beside him henry was at the window he had his ear cocked and he stared outside and probably he was listening to the first shouted songs of the blackbirds it was the third scotch that had been given to mattie and each had less water than before the major had his arm shirtsleeved loosely around matties shoulder the major smiled into matties face you know where youre going mattie in a few hours you know where youll be by lunch time do you know mattie the slurred response i want to see a doctor i want to go to bed and sleep and then i want to go home a magistrates court mattie bollocks the charge will be conspiracy to import heroin dont be so fucking silly major its too late at night for games charlie ran heroin heroin subsidized him you ran charlie youre going down old boy going down for a long time and the arm was round his shoulder and mattie was trying to push himself up from the sofa and away from the calm of the voice in his ear and he hadnt a prayer hadnt the strength nothing to do with me fifteen years youll get very hard years mattie not me youll be in with the queers and the con artists and the gbh lads in with them for fifteen years its all sewn up mattie hows mrs furniss going to cope with that is she going to traipse up to the scrubs every first tuesday in the month and your daughters i doubt theyll come more than once or twice i dont know anything about heroin nothing not at all ask the magistrate to believe you mattie ask him to believe that you didnt know how charlie eshraq more or less a son to you funded himself and ask mrs furniss to believe that you didnt know itll break her mattie you being inside think on it its just not true she wont have a friend in the world have to sell up at bibury of course couldnt face the neighbours could she your neighboursll be a bit foul mattie the jokers in your cell they have their pride and heroin they dont like its a lie i know nothing about heroin its all been a lie mattie it starts with the lie that you didnt name charlie eshraq did eshraq fuck your daughters the pause the silence henry had turned henry looked at his watch grimaced the major nodded like he thought that he was nearly dry close to home mattie charlie eshraq was running heroin out of iran when he was fucking your daughters do you reckon heroin came with the service mattie its not tell me thats not true there was the first shrill call of the birds its what i hear god pushed heroin to your daughters eshraq did the truth its you i want the truth from charlie gave that filthy stuff to my girls youve just had bad luck mattie a long run of terrible luck there were tears running down matties cheeks and the hands that held the glass shook the major had raised his head and henry could see his eyebrows aloft carter said from the window you named him mattie it wasnt my fault no mattie it wasnt and nobody will hold it against you henry came to the sofa he had his notepad in his hand he wrote a single sentence and he put a pencil in matties hand and he watched the scrawled signature made he buffeted off the hall table on his way to the telephone and there was pandemonium in the kitchen the major was at the door of the lounge on his way out it did not seem necessary for them to shake hands henry went back into the lounge he went to mattie he took his arm and hoisted him unsteady to his feet can i go home i think thats a good idea ill drive you myself tell me that it wasnt true of course not mattie it was an unforgivable trick i am so very sorry dawn was coming and at first sight the day looked promising he was looking down from the window and into the yard there was a kid ten or eleven years old scrubbing at the windscreen and eshraq was hunched down by the front radiator screen and he already had the turkish registration off and he was holding the iranian plate in place while he screwed it tight there were lights in the kitchens that backed on to the yard and they threw shadows into the yard he was dressed and he was shaved when the telephone bell rang in the room he was zipping shut his bag and he had his passport and his wallet on the bed beside him and the ticket for the flight back to istanbul the telephone in the room had not rung since they had arrived in dogubeyezit below him eshraq had the front plate secure and was moving to the rear of the transit he was moving easily and casual in old jeans and trainer shoes and a service blue cotton shirt and the telephone was still ringing he picked it up he heard the clicking of big distance connections he heard a small voice and far away is that room this is room is that david park park speaking i want to speak to charlie hes not here bugger ive been cut off twice on your switchboard can you get him take me a bit of time and well get cut again god names terence i met him in ankara he remembered the genclik park he had been yards back and eshraq and the man had walked and there had been a tail he remembered it very clearly he could picture terence terence was pale skin almost anaemic with fair hair and a missing chin and he looked to have come from a good school if you give me the message ill pass it you can reach him if you give me the message i can reach him the telephones in this country are bloody awful you guarantee he gets my message ill pass it this is an open line thats stating the obvious hes not to go that is a categorical instruction from my people he is not to approach the border he is compromised cant say more than that he is to return to ankara do you understand the message understood most grateful to you for nothing i might see you in ankara and many thanks for your help he replaced the telephone he went back to the window the rear plate was in place and the kid was scrubbing dust off the transits headlights there had been the tail in istanbul and the tail in ankara he assumed they had been better in dogubeyezit because he had not been certain of the men on the tail not certain as he had been in aksaray and the genclik park he was a long time at the window there were many images in the mind of david park there was in his mind leroy winston manvers back in the corner of the cell and he was at safe haven in jamaica there was the wife of matthew furniss at the door of a cottage in the country and her husband was the guarantor of a heroin trafficker and he was on safe wicket back in the united kingdom there was charlie eshraq sitting on the bonnet of a sierra saloon and mocking him and he was on safe passage out there were images of ann and wet towels on the bathroom floor and images of the supercilious creature who had done the big put down at foreign and commonwealth and images of bill parrish stuck in an anteroom outside the office of the power and the glory at century he knew what was right and he knew what was wrong he had to know right and wrong were the core of his life he moved around the room he checked each drawer of the chest and each shelf of the cupboard and he frisked the bathroom he made sure that they had left nothing behind he slung on his jacket and put his passport and his airline ticket into the inner pocket with his wallet and he threw his grip bag over his shoulder you will satisfy yourself that he has indeed travelled back into iran at the reception he paid for the room they had made out a joint bill and he paid it he folded the receipt carefully and put it into his wallet he didnt give the porter a tip because he couldnt claim on tips and anyway he preferred to carry his own bag he put his bag in the small hire car locked it away from sight he went back inside the hotel and took a side door beside the staircase and then the corridor that led into the yard at the back the tail doors of the transit were open and david could see the drums of electrical flex piled to the roof and stacked tight what kept you he started he hadnt seen eshraq at the front of the transit hed lost him he was looking at the drums and he was wondering how successfully they hid the wooden crates just clearing up the room did i hear our phone go front desk confirming we were leaving today probably thought you were running out on them he saw the big smile on eshraqs face i suppose you paid yes i paid he saw the big smile and the big buoyancy of young eshraq park didnt smile himself often and it was rarer for him to know happiness and eshraq was smiling and he looked as though he had found true happiness and the big smile split you hate me yes time you went for the border your problem youre too serious because ive a plane to catch and youll do my letter itll be posted what im doing dont you think its worth doing thinking about you makes me tired dont i get a goodbye and a kiss good luck charlie brilliant luck he said that he would see eshraq in front of the hotel he walked back through and out of the front doors as he pushed them open he heard the farewell greeting from the reception clerk and he didnt turn he unlocked the car and when he was inside he wound down the windows to dissipate the heat keys into the ignition it was slow starting he thought that the plugs needed cleaning there was the blast of the horn behind him the transit came past him he didnt think that he would see eshraqs face again he thought that the last that he would see of charlie eshraq was a grin and a wave he pulled out into the traffic by the time that he had found a space there were two lorries between himself and the transit a wide and straight and potholed bone shaker of a road two lorries ahead of him he could see the transit he drove slowly as far as he could see ahead there was the column of commercial vehicles heading for the customs post mattie stood in the hallway he could hear their voices it was typical of harriet that she should have walked back to the front gate with henry carter she had that inbred politeness it was a part of her sweet scents in his nostrils he could smell the polish on the walnut hall table he could smell the cut chrysanthemums that were in the vase on the shelf of the window beside the front door sweet sounds in his ears he could hear the passage of the honey searching bees in the foxgloves that lined the path between the house and the front gate and he could hear the whine of the flies against the panes and he could hear the purring of his cat as it brushed against his legs the car left she came back inside she closed the front door she latched the door and made him safe from all that had happened to him she came to stand against him and her arms were loosely around his waist she kissed his cheek you need a jolly good shave mattie i expect i do what a dear man that carter i suppose he is he spoke so well of you how youd come through it all did he darling and he said that you needed looking after what would you like most mattie most and first id like to sit outside in the garden and id like the times and id like a mug of coffee with hot milk he said it was pretty rotten where youd been well talk about it but not yet he said theyre all talking about it at century your escape such a nice man he said they were all talking about what they call dolphins run ill go and sit in the garden the sun was hardly up there was still dew on the grass he heard the first tractor of the day moving off to cut silage the road was quite straight and it ran bisecting a wide green valley to his left was ararat magnificent in the sunlight to his right was the lower summit of tenduruk dag there were grazing sheep alongside the road and when they were clear of the town they passed the folly palace of ishak pasha he glanced at it the building was above the road dominating he had read in the guide book that a kurdish chieftain in the last century had wanted the finest palace in the wide world and he had had an armenian architect design it and build it and when it was completed then the chieftain had had the armenian architects hands cut off so that he could never design another that was as fine rough old world mr armenian architect rough old world mr charlie eshraq far ahead where the haze of the shimmered heat had begun to settle he could see the flatroofed buildings of the turkish customs building and he could just make out the blood red of the turkish flag amongst the fields stretching to the foothills of ararat that was to his left and tenduruk dag that was to his right he could see the brilliant scarlet oases of poppies where the poppy flowers were that was a good place for the burying of charlie eshraq he eased down through the gears the turkish customs post was one old building of two stories and a sprawl of newer more temporary buildings a wind lifted the flag there were troops there pretty lackadaisical bunch too and there was a customs official in the centre of the road who seemed to stop briefly each lorry speak to the driver then wave it on on the other side of the road was the queue of vehicles travelling the other way coming out from iran stopped and waiting for clearance no delays for the lorries going into iran the transit was two lorry lengths ahead of him and the going was slower one hand on the wheel and his thumb was inches from the horn one hand on the gear stick and his fingers were inches from the arm that could have flashed his lights the transit was stationary the customs official was walking down the length of a lorry and trailer and heading for the cab of the transit park watched it was what they had sent him to do he watched the customs official peer into the drivers window then nod his head then step back then cheerfully wave the transit forward the lorries in front of him nudged forward park swung his wheel he drove off the metalled surface and on to the stone grit of the hard shoulder he walked away from his car he walked towards the buildings and the soldiers who were already seeking what shade was offered his shirt stuck to his back there was the shiver in his legs as he walked he took as his place the flagpole the wind pushed his hair across his face he estimated that the iranian flag and the iranian buildings were metres down the road he thought that the border was at a point that was halfway between the two where a small stream crossed under the road through culvert tunnels the road fell on its way to the tunnels then climbed on a gradual gradient towards the iranian buildings and the iranian flag the transit was slipping away down the slope going steadily for the dip where the culverts were set under the road the wind in his hair the sun in his eyes the roar of the heavy engines in his ears a young officer regular army had strolled to stand beside him would have seen a foreigner at the post and wondered been interested there were binoculars hanging loosely at his neck park didnt ask a fast sharp smile his finger pointing to the binoculars he knew nothing of the turkish nothing of their generosity his gesture was enough he had the binoculars in his hand the transit was climbing up the slope from the stream his vision roved ahead he saw the buildings of the customs post and huge on the wall facing the oncoming road was the image of the imam past the buildings uniformed and armed men held back a line of lorries from further movement towards turkey from a side door in the largest of the buildings he saw three men duck out and run crouching and doubled to take up positions behind parked cars on the far side of the road the far side to the buildings was a heap of sandbags inexpertly stacked and no more than waist height with the glasses through the power of the binoculars he saw the sun flash on belted ammunition there was a man standing beside the building closest to the roadway he wore sandals and old jeans and his shirt tails werent tucked in he was not a young man he was talking into a personal radio the transit was into iran heading up the shallow slope of the road there was the crash of the gunfire he started up he clasped his hands to halt the shaking its alright dear just the pottinger boy i dont mind him shooting pigeons and i suppose i cant object at carrion crows but i do think that killing rooks is the limit i hope that youll have a word with his father heres your coffee mattie darling you look frozen ill get you a warmer sweater and when youve had your coffee youre coming straight in the sun was sharp on his forehead there was the distortion of the binoculars and from the heat on the ground but he could see well enough the road was clear ahead and in front of the transit and a man in dun uniform had emerged from the ditch that ran alongside the road as soon as the transit had passed him and he was waving down the following lorry there was a moment as the transit came to an easy and unhurried stop beside the building that it was the only vehicle within yards in front or behind quick fast movements the van surrounded he saw the men who ran forward towards the back of the van and he saw their weapons raised to their shoulders and aimed at the transit carried on the wind must have been a megaphone he heard a shouted order they were closing on the cab he saw the door of the cab open he saw the barrel shape the tube shape jutting out from the opened door there was the fire squirt there was the following thunder hammer of the recoil of the law smoke and fire and the building ravaged and toy doll figures laid out in crazy posture under the galloping spread of black smoke and brilliant flames of the fire he saw the transit burst forward he wondered when in hell charlie had taken the launcher from the crates in the back of the tra nsit he had seen the flash of the brass cartridge cases he knew where it would come from he knew where the stopping fire would come from he thought the van might have made yards it was lurching forward as if the driver was trying to hit the higher gears too fast the transit might have made yards when the machinegun behind the sandbags opened fire belting the transit the van swerved he saw that he followed the swerve through the glasses the van straightened he was cold he was not willing the escape of the van and nor was he cheering for the death of the van he was the witness and he was watching the transit had swerved and it had straightened and it had swerved again it was across the road it was against the pole that carried the telephone line from the customs post back into the interior the hammer of the drum the belt of the machinegun and the target was stationary crippled there was a shouting in his ear it was the turkish soldier insistent but courteous he held out his hand for his binoculars there was little more for him to see there was the bright orange glow of the ultimate explosion he watched a dreams destruction he thanked the officer who was lost in concentration on the scene unfolding across the valley and he turned and walked back towards his car he thought that if he hurried he would still be in time to catch the flight from van he turned only once when he had opened the door of the hire car he looked behind him the sun was a high white orb its brilliance shed by the rising pillar of smoke park drove away he drove back along the straight road to dogubeyezit and past the sheep flocks and past the shrill patches of scarlet a job done a man going home she was first out of the chapel and belinda and jane were close at her back she had dressed rather boldly and that had been her decision and without the prompting of the girls she wore a suit of navy and a matching straw hat with a crimson ribbon perhaps the girls would not have approved she had worn the same suit and hat only once before nearly two years ago and then she had sat in the gallery and looked down on to the investiture room she had watched with pride as mattie had gone forward to receive from his sovereign the medal of the order of the british empire she thought it right on this autumn morning when the leaves cascaded across the road from the plane trees in the park to wear the same clothes as on that day mattie would have approved and he would have liked the way that she held herself she took her place a few yards from the doorway and there was a fine spit of rain at her back and behind her the traffic streamed on birdcage walk the girls were on either side of her they were sentries positioned to protect their mother not that harriet furniss was in need of protection there would be no choke in her voice no smear on her cheek she had been a service wife and now she was a service widow she understood very clearly what was expected of her she thought that the director general had aged that his retirement had not given him a new lease of life his morning coat seemed too large and his throat had thinned it was kind of you to come it was he who had insisted on matties immediate retirement to pay my respects to a very gallant gentleman mrs furniss she knew that he had resigned from the service on the day the report of the internal inquiry had reached downing street youre looking well good of you to say so ive a little to occupy me i shall remember your husband with nothing but admiration it gave her strength to see his fumbling walk towards the parade ground the man who had sent her mattie to his doom she had made it clear that she had wanted none of them to make the journey from london for the funeral the funeral three weeks earlier had been family and in bibury she had insisted on that two hard years they had been from the time that he had come home to her to the time of death and release from his personal agony two wretchedly hard years they had been as the will to survive had ebbed from mattie the new director general stood in front of her his face was a little puffed as though he ate too much too often at lunchtime most fittingly done mrs furniss it was as mattie would have wanted i think we miss him very much at century as he missed being there desperately they still talk about his run it was a magnificent memory for us all hes not forgotten i expect that iran desk is substantially changed well yes very changed now that we have the embassy back in tehran we are much more efficient i think mattie understood should you have any problem well you wouldnt hesitate i hope mattie would never have left us in difficulties the new director general nodded she thought that she would have gone on the streets put her daughters into a workshop before she would have gone back to century to plead hardship all so different now in the last months of his life mattie had fumed at the exchange of diplomats the reopening of relations with the islamic republic of iran they had angered him insulted him she had seen those wounds on his body she had forced herself to look at them when he was bathing and pretended that she saw nothing and she had raged in her mind each time she saw our people and their people shaking hands on the television screen she had no line into century for gossip because flossie duggan had gone the same week that her mattie had been brought back to her nor did she want a line the wind caught at her hair and she pushed it decisively back there was a surge of men past her faces that she did not know she imagined them to be from the century desks and from the administrative departments and few caught her eye most avoided her gaze henry carter stood in front of her and he held a trilby across his chest it was henry carter who had come down to bibury a week after he had first brought mattie home and who had gone out into the garden with him to report that charlie had been killed on the iranian border and mattie had never spoken the name of charlie eshraq would never even let the girls refer to him from that day to the day of his slipping passing going so good to see you henry are you still alas mrs furniss no longer i have a parttime job with the royal society for the protection of birds the mailorder section i get the tea towels out and the nesting boxes was anything achieved henry that spring by any of you desperate question mrs furniss my opinion its better to believe that so much mayhem led to something positive dont you think and he was gone before she could press him he almost ran they were almost all gone from the church now and the music had stopped there was a middleaged man standing a few feet in front of her making no move to come towards her he wore an old raincoat that was too small for him and that was gathered in tight lines across his stomach and the half moon of his hair blew untidily in the wind he met her gaze he stared back at her he was an intruder she was sure of that but she could not place him she straightened her back do i know you im bill parrish have we met i came once to your house bit more than two years ago youll have to excuse me i dont recall the occasion im fulfilling a promise to a friend mrs furniss hes abroad and cant be here me being here is closing a file you might say that its shutting up shop a very nice service mrs furniss she watched them all go the old director general was waving down a taxi flourishing his umbrella at the driver the new director general was climbing into the black limousine henry carter was arguing down the street with a traffic warden across the bonnet of an old car bill parrish was striding purposefully towards whitehall she let the girls link their arms through her elbows had anything been at achieved was there something positive she hated them all every last one of them who were now hurrying away to escape from the contact with the life and death of maine furniss
