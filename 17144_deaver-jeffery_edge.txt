jeffery deaver edge copyright by jeffery deaver for shea sabrina and brynn june the rules of play the man who wanted to kill the young woman sitting beside me was threequarters of a mile behind us as we drove through a pastoral setting of tobacco and cotton fields this humid morning a glance in the rearview mirror revealed a sliver of car moving at a comfortable pace with the traffic piloted by a man who by all appearances seemed hardly different from any one of a hundred drivers on this recently resurfaced divided highway officer fallow alissa began then as id been urging her for the past week abe yes is he still there shed seen my gaze yes and sos our tail i added for reassurance my protégé was behind the killer two or three car lengths he was not the only person from our organization on the job okay alissa whispered the woman in her midthirties was a whistleblower against a government contractor that did a lot of work for the army the company was adamant that it had done nothing wrong and claimed it welcomed an investigation but thered been an attempt on alissas life a week ago andsince id been in the army with one of the senior commanders at braggdefense had called me in to guard her as head of the organization i dont do much fieldwork any longer but i was glad to get out to tell the truth my typical day was ten hours at my desk in our alexandria office and in the past month it had been closer to twelve or fourteen as we coordinated the protection of five highlevel organized crime informants before handing them over to witness protection for their facelifts it was good to be back in the saddle if only for a week or so i hit a speed dial button calling my protégé its abe i said into my handsfree where is he now make it a half mile moving up slowly the hitter whose identity we didnt know was in a nondescript hyundai sedan gray i was behind an eighteenfoot truck carolina poultry processing company painted on the side it was empty and being driven by one of our transport people in front of that was a car identical to the one i was driving weve got two miles till the swap i said four voices acknowledged this over four very encrypted com devices i disconnected without looking at her i said to alissa its going to be fine i just she said in a whisper i dont know she fell silent and stared into the sideview mirror as if the man who wanted to kill her were right behind us its all going just like we planned when innocent people find themselves in situations that require the presence and protection of people like me their reaction more often than not is as much bewilderment as fear mortality is tough to process but keeping people safe keeping people alive is a business like any other i frequently told this to my protégé and the others in the office probably irritating them to no end with both the repetition and the stodgy tone but i kept on saying it because you cant forget ever its a business with rigid procedures that we study the way surgeons learn to slice flesh precisely and pilots learn to keep tons of metal safely aloft these techniques have been honed over the years and they worked business of course it was also true that the hitter who was behind us at the moment intent on killing the woman next to me treated his job as a business too i knew this sure as steel he was just as serious as i was had studied procedures as diligently as i had was smart iqwise and streetwise and he had advantages over me his rules were unencumbered by my constraintsthe constitution and the laws promulgated thereunder still i believe there is an advantage in being in the right in all my years of doing this work id never lost a principal and i wasnt going to lose alissa a business which meant remaining calm as a surgeon calm as a pilot alissa was not calm of course she was breathing hard worrying her cuff as she stared at a sprawling magnolia tree we were passing an outrider of a or chestnut forest bordering a huge cotton field the tufts bursting she was uneasily spinning a thin diamond braceleta treat to herself on a recent birthday she now glanced at the jewelry and then her palms which were sweating and placed her hands on her navy blue skirt under my care alissa had worn dark clothing exclusively it was camouflage but not because she was the target of a professional killer it was about her weight which shed wrestled with since adolescence i knew this because wed shared meals and id seen the battle up close shed also talked quite a bit about her struggle with weight some principals dont need or want camaraderie others like alissa need us to be friends i dont do well in that role but i try and can generally pull it off we passed a sign the exit was a mile and a half away a business requires simple smart planning you cant be reactive in this line of work and though i hate the word proactive as opposed to what antiactive the concept is vital to what we do in this instance to deliver alissa safe and sound to the prosecutor for her depositions i needed to keep the hitter in play since my protégé had been following him for hours we knew where he was and could have taken him at any moment but if wed done that whoever had hired him would simply call somebody else to finish the job i wanted to keep him on the road for the better part of the daylong enough for alissa to get into the us attorneys office and give him sufficient information via deposition so that she would no longer be at risk once the testimonys down the hitter has no incentive to eliminate a witness the plan id devised with my protégés help was for me to pass the carolina poultry truck and pull in front of it the hitter would speed up to keep us in sight but before he got close the truck and i would exit simultaneously because of the curve in the road and the ramp id picked the hitter wouldnt be able to see my car but would spot the decoy alissa and i would then take a complicated route to a hotel in raleigh where the prosecutor awaited while the decoy would eventually end up at the courthouse in charlotte three hours away by the time the hitter realized that hed been following a bogus target it would be too late hed call his primaryhis employerand most likely the hit would be called off wed move in arrest the hitter and try to trace him back to the primary about a mile ahead was the turnoff the chicken truck was about thirty feet ahead i regarded alissa now playing with a gold and amethyst necklace her mother had given it to her on her seventeenth birthday more expensive than the family could afford but an unspoken consolation prize for the absence of an invitation to the prom people tend to share quite a lot with those who are saving their lives my phone buzzed yes i asked my protégé the subjects moved up a bit about two hundred yards behind the truck were almost there i said lets go i passed the poultry truck quickly and pulled in behind the decoya tight fit it was driven by a man from our organization the passenger was an fbi agent who resembled alissa thered been some fun in the office when we picked somebody to play the role of me i have a round head and ears that protrude a fraction of an inch more than i would like ive got wiry red hair and im not tall so in the office they apparently spent an hour or two in an impromptu contest to find the most elflike officer to impersonate me status i asked into the phone hes changed lanes and is accelerating a little he wouldnt like not seeing me i reflected i heard hold on hold on i would remember to tell my protégé to mind the unnecessary verbal filler while the words were scrambled by our phones the fact thered been a transmission could be detected hed learn the lesson fast and retain it im coming up on the exit okay here we go still doing about sixty i eased into the exit lane and swung around the curve which was surrounded by thick trees the chicken truck was right on my bumper my protégé reported good subject didnt even look your way hes got the decoy in sight and the speeds dropping back to the limit i paused at the red light where the ramp fed into route then turned right the poultry truck turned left subject is continuing on the route came my protégés voice seems to be working fine his voice was cool im pretty detached about operations but he does me one better he rarely smiles never jokes and in truth i dont know much about him though weve worked together often closely for several years id like to change that about himhis sombernessnot for the sake of the job since he really is very very good but simply because i wish he took more pleasure in what we do the endeavor of keeping people safe can be satisfying even joyous especially when it comes to protecting families which we do with some frequency i told him to keep me updated and we disconnected so alissa asked were safe were safe i told her hiking the speed up to fifty in a fortyfive zone in fifteen minutes we were meandering along a route that would take us to the outskirts of raleigh where wed meet the prosecutor for the depositions the sky was overcast and the scenery was probably what it had been for dozens of years bungalow farmhouses shacks trailers and motor vehicles in terminal condition but still functioning if the nursing and luck were right a gas station offering a brand id never heard of dogs toothing at fleas lazily women in stressed jeans overseeing their broods men with beerlean faces and expanding guts sitting on porches waiting for nothing most likely wondering at our carcontaining the sort of people you dont see much in this neighborhood a man in a white shirt dark suit and tie and a woman with a business haircut then we were past the residences and on a road bisecting more fields i noted the cotton plants shedding their growth like popcorn and i thought of how this same land years ago would have been carpeted with an identical crop the civil war and the people for whom it was fought were never far from ones mind when you were in the south my phone rang and i answered my protégés voice was urgent abe shoulders tense i asked has he turned off the highway i wasnt too concerned wed exited over a half hour ago the hitter would be forty miles away by now no still following the decoy but something just happened he made a call on his mobile when he disconnected it was odd he was wiping his face i moved up two car lengths it looked like hed been crying my breath came quickly as i considered possible reasons for this finally one credible disturbing scenario rose to the top what if the hitter had suspected wed try a decoy and had used one of his own hed forced somebody who resembled himjust like the elfin man in our decoy carto follow us the call my protégé had just witnessed might have been between the driver and the real perp who was perhaps holding the mans wife or child hostage but this then meant that the real hitter could be somewhere else and a flash of white streaked toward us as a ford pickup truck appeared from the driveway of a sagging deserted gas station to the left and bounded over the highway the truck its front protected by push bars slammed into our drivers side and shoved us neatly through a tall stand of weeds into a shallow ravine alissa screamed and i grunted in pain and heard my protégé calling my name then the mobile and the handsfree flew into the car propelled by the deploying airbag we crashed down a fivefoot descent and came to an undramatic stop at the soupy bottom of a shallow creek oh hed planned his attack perfectly and before i could even click the seat belt to get to my gun hed swung a mallet through the drivers window shattering it and stunning me with the same blow my glock was ripped off my belt and pocketed dislocated shoulder i thought not much blood i spat broken glass from my mouth and looked to alissa she too was stunned but didnt seem hurt badly the hitter wasnt holding his gun only the mallet and i thought that if she fled now shed have a chance to tumble through the underbrush and escape not much of a chance but something she had to move immediately though alissa run to the left you can do it now she yanked the door open and rolled out i looked back at the road all i could see was the white truck parked on the shoulder near a creek where you might hunt frogs for bait like a dozen other trucks id seen en route it perfectly blocked anyones view from the road just like id used a truck to mask my escape i reflected grimly the hitter was now reaching in to unlatch my door i squinted in pain grateful for the mans delay it meant that alissa could gain more distance my people would know our exact position through gps and could have police here in fifteen or twenty minutes she might make it please i thought turning toward the path shed be escaping down the shallow creekbed except that she wasnt running anywhere tears rolling down her cheeks she was standing next to the car with her head down arms crossed over her round chest was she hurt more badly than id thought my door was opened and the hitter dragged me out onto the ground where he expertly slipped nylon restraints on my hands he released me and i sagged into the sourscented mud beside busy crickets restraints i wondered i looked at alissa again now leaning against the car unable to look my way please she was speaking to our attacker my mother no she wasnt stunned and wasnt hurt badly and i realized the reason she wasnt running because she had no reason to she wasnt the target i was the whole terrible truth was obvious the man standing over me had somehow gotten to alissa several weeks before and threatened to hurt her motherto force alissa to make up a story about corruption at the government contractor because it involved an army base where i knew the commander the perp had bet that id be the shepherd to guard her for the past week alissa had been giving this man details about our security procedures he wasnt a hitter he was a lifter hired to extract information from me of course about the organized crime case id just worked i knew the new identities of the five witnesses whod testified at the trial i knew where witness protection was placing them gasping for breath through the tears alissa was saying you told me but the lifter was ignoring her looking at his watch and placing a call i deduced to the man in the decoy car followed by my protégé fifty miles away he didnt get through the decoy would have been pulled over as soon as our crash registered through the mobile phone call this meant the lifter knew he didnt have as much time as he would have liked i wondered how long i could hold out against the torture please alissa whispered again my mother you said if i did what you wanted please is she all right the lifter glanced toward her and as an afterthought it seemed took a pistol from his belt and shot her twice in the head i grimaced felt the sting of despair he took a battered manila envelope from his inside jacket and opening it knelt beside me and shook the contents onto the ground i couldnt see what they were he pulled off my shoes and socks in a soft voice he asked you know the information i need i nodded yes will you tell me if i could hold out for fifteen minutes there was a chance local police would get here while i was still alive i shook my head no impassive as if my response were neither good or bad he set to work hold out for fifteen minutes i told myself i gave my first scream thirty seconds later another followed shortly after that and from then on every exhalation was a shrill cry tears flowed and pain raged like fire throughout my body thirteen minutes i reflected twelve but though i couldnt say for certain probably no more than six or seven passed before i gasped stop stop he did and i told him exactly what he wanted to know he jotted the information and stood keys to the truck dangled in his left hand in his right was the pistol he aimed the automatic toward the center of my forehead and what i felt was mostly relief a terrible relief that at least the pain would cease the man eased back and squinted slightly in anticipation of the gunshot and i found myself w september saturday the object of the game is to invade and capture the opponents castle or slay his royalty from the instructions to the board game feudal chapter weve got a bad one corte go ahead i said into the stalk microphone i was at my desk on a handsfree i set down the old handwritten note id been reading the principal and his familyre in fairfax theres a goahead order for a lifter and seems like hes under some time pressure how much a couple of days you know who hired him thats a negative son it was saturday early in this business we drew odd hours and workweeks of varying lengths mine had just begun a couple of days ago and id finished a small job late yesterday afternoon i was to have spent the day tidying up paperwork something i enjoy but in my organization were on call constantly keep going freddy thered been something about his tone ten years of working with somebody even sporadically in this line of work gives you clues the fbi agent never known for hesitating now hesitated finally okay corte the thing is what the lifters henry loving i know i know but its confirmed after a moment in which the only sounds i could hear were my heart and a whisper of blood through my ears i responded automatically though pointlessly hes dead rhode island was dead was reported dead i glanced at trees outside my window stirring in the faint september breeze then looked over my desk it was neat but small and cheaply made on it were several pieces of paper each demanding more or less of my attention as well as a small carton that fedex had delivered to the town house only a few blocks from my office that morning it was an ebay purchase id been looking forward to receiving id planned to examine the contents of the box on my lunch hour today i now slid it aside go on in providence somebody else was in the building freddy filled in this missing puzzle piece though id almost instantly deducedcorrectly from the agents accountexactly what had happened two years ago the warehouse henry loving had been hiding in after fleeing a trap id set for him had burned to the ground the forensic people had a clear dna match on the body inside even badly burned a corpse will leave about ten million samples of that pesky deoxyribonucleic acid which you cant hide or destroy so it doesnt make sense to try but what you can do is afterward get to the dna lab technicians and force them to lieto certify that the body was yours loving was the sort who would have anticipated my trap before he went after my principals hed have a backup plan devised kidnapping a homeless man or a runaway and stashing him in the warehouse just in case he needed to escape this was a clever idea threatening a lab tech and not so farfetched when you considered that henry lovings unique art was manipulating people to do things they didnt want to do so suddenly a man a lot of other people had been contentid go so far as to use the word happyto see die in a fire was now very much alive a shadow in my doorway it was aaron ellis the head of our organization the man i reported to directly blond and fiercely broad of shoulder his thin lips parted he didnt know i was on the phone you hear rhode islandit wasnt loving after all im on with freddy now gesturing toward the handsfree my office in ten sure he vanished on deft feet encased in brown tasseled loafers which clashed with his light blue slacks i said to the fbi agent in his office about ten miles from mine that was aaron i know freddy replied my boss briefed your boss im briefing you well be working it together son call me when you can wait i said the principals in fairfax you send any agents to babysit not yet this just happened get somebody there now apparently lovings nowhere near yet do it anyway well do it anyway your wish et cetera et cetera freddy disconnected before i could say anything more henry loving i sat for a moment and again looked out the window of my organizations unmarked headquarters in old town alexandria the building aggressively ugly s ugly i stared at a wedge of grass an antique store a starbucks and a few bushes in a parking strip the bushes lined up in a staggered fashion toward the masonic temple like theyd been planted by a dan brown character sending a message via landscaping rather than an email my eyes returned to the fedex box and the documents on my desk one stapled stack of papers was a lease for a safe house near silver spring maryland id have to negotiate the rent down assuming a cover identity to do so one document was a release order for the principal id successfully delivered yesterday to two solemn men in equally solemn suits whose offices were in langley virginia i signed the order and put it into my out box the last slip of paper which id been reading when freddy called id brought with me without intending to in the town house last night id located a board game whose instructions id wanted to reread and had opened the box to find this sheetan old todo list for a holiday party with names of guests to call groceries and decorations to buy id absently tucked the yellowing document into my pocket and discovered it this morning the party had been years ago it was the last thing i wanted to be reminded of at the moment i looked at the handwriting on the faded rectangle and fed it into my burn box which turned it into confetti i placed the fedex box into the safe behind my desknothing fancy no eye scans just a clicking combination lockand rose i tugged on a dark suit jacket over my white shirt which was what i usually wore in the office even when working weekends i stepped out of my office turning left toward my bosss and walked along the lengthy corridors gray carpet striped with sunlight falling pale through the mirrored bulletresistant windows my mind was no longer on real estate values in maryland or delivery service packages or unwanted reminders from the past but focused exclusively on the reappearance of henry lovingthe man who six years earlier had tortured and murdered my mentor and close friend abe fallow in a gulley beside a north carolina cotton field as id listened to his cries through his stillconnected phone seven minutes of screams until the merciful gunshot delivered not mercifully at all but as a simple matter of professional efficiency chapter i was sitting in one of our directors scuffed chairs next to a man who clearly knew me since hed nodded with some familiarity when i entered i couldnt however place him beyond his being a federal prosecutor about my agefortyand short a bit doughy with hair in need of a trim a foxs eyes aaron ellis noticed my glance you remember jason westerfield us attorneys office i didnt fake it and try to respond i just shook his hand freddy was briefing me agent fredericks westerfield asked thats right he said we have a principal in fairfax and a lifter who needs information in the next few days westerfields voice was high and irritatingly playful you betcha thats what we hear we dont know much at this point other than that the lifter got a clear goahead order somebody needs information from the subject by late monday or all hell breaks loose no idea what the fuck hell is though pardonnez moi while i was dressed like a prosecutor ready for court westerfield was in weekend clothes not office weekend clothes but camping weekend clothes chinos a plaid shirt and a windbreaker unusual for the district where saturday and sunday office hours were not rare it told me he might be a cowboy i noted too he was also sitting forward on the edge of his chair and clutching files with blunt fingers not nervouslyhe didnt seem the sort who could be nervousbut with excitement a hot metabolism burned within another voice female from behind us im sorry im late a woman about thirty joined us a particular type of nod and i knew she was westerfields assistant a tight hairstyle that ended at her shoulders blond new or drycleaned blue jeans a white sweater under a tan sports coat and a necklace of impressive creamy pearls her earrings were pearls too and accompanied on the lobes by equally arresting diamonds her darkframed glasses were despite her youth trifocals i could see by the way her head bobbed slowly as she took in the office and me a shepherd has to know his principals buying habitsits very helpful in understanding themand instinctively i noted chanel coach and cartier a rich girl and probably near the top of her class at yale or harvard law westerfield said this is assistant us attorney chris teasley she shook my hand and acknowledged ellis im just explaining the kessler situation to them then to us chrisll be working with us on it lets hear the details i said aware that teasley was scenting the air floral and subdued she opened her attaché case with loud hardware snaps and handed her boss a file as he skimmed it i noted a sketch on elliss wall his corner office wasnt large but it was decorated with a number of pictures some posters from mall galleries some personal photos and art executed by his children i stared at a watercolor drawing of a building on a hillside not badly rendered i had nothing on my office walls except lists of phone numbers heres the sit westerfield turned to ellis and me i heard from the bureaus charleston west virginia field office this morning make a long story short the state police were running a meth sting out in the boonies and they stumbled on some prints on a pay phone turned out to be henry lovings for some reason the homicide and surveillance warrants werent cancelled after he died well supposedly died looks like they call our people and we take over find out loving flew into charleston a week ago under some fake name and id nobody knows from where finally they tracked him down to a motel in winfield this morning but hed already checked outa couple of hours ago around eightthirty clerk doesnt know where he was going at a nod from her boss teasley continued the surveillance warrants are technically still active so the agents checked out emails at the hotel one received and one sent the goahead order and lovings acknowledgment ellis asked what would he be doing in west virginia i knew loving better than anybody in the room i said he usually worked with a partner he might be picking somebody up there weapons too he wouldnt fly with them in any case hell avoid the dcarea airports a lot of people up here still remember what he looks like after after what happened a few years ago i asked internet address of the sender routed through proxies untraceable any phone calls to or from his room in the motel mais non the french was irritating had westerfield just gotten back from a package vacation or was he boning up to prosecute an algerian terrorist what does the order say exactly jason i asked patiently at a nod from him chris teasley did the honors like you were saying it was solely a goahead so theyd have had prior conversations where they laid out the details go on please i said to her the woman read lovingre kessler its a go need details per our discussion by monday midnight or unacceptable consequences as explained once you get information subject must be eliminated end of quote it gave an address in fairfax unacceptable consequences all hell breaking loose no audio no i was disappointed voice analysis can tell a lot about the caller gender most of the time national and regional roots illnesses even reasonable morphological deductions can be made about the shape of the nose mouth and throat but at least we had a confirmed spelling of the principals name which was a plus kesslers a cop in the district ryan kessler detective westerfield explained lovings response confirmed that was it the primary wants the detailswesterfield did air quotesby late monday details i asked to see the printout noted a slight hesitation on teasleys part then she passed it over when westerfield gave no reaction i read through the brief passage grammar spelling and punctuation are good proper use of per teasley frowned at this observation i didnt explain that as per what most people say is redundant she wasnt my protégée i continued and matching commas around the appositive after details which you hardly ever see everyone stared at me now id studied linguistics a long time ago a little philology too the study of languages from analyzing texts mostly for the fun of it but the subject came in useful sometimes ellis toyed his neck sideways hed wrestled in college but didnt do many sports nowadays that i knew of he was just still built like an iron triangle he asked he left at eightthirty this morning he probably has weapons so hes not going to fly and he doesnt want to risk being seen at an airport here like you were saying corte hes still about four hours away his vehicle i asked nothing yet the bureaus got a team canvassing the motel and restaurants around town ellis this kessler what does he know that the primarys so interested in extracting from him no clue westerfield said who exactly is he kessler i asked ive got some details teasley said as the young attorney dug through a file i wondered why westerfield had come to us were known as the bodyguards of last resort at least aaron ellis refers to us that way in budgetary hearings which i find a bit embarrassing but apparently it plays well on the hill the state departments diplomatic security and the secret service guard us officials and foreign heads of state witness protection cloaks the noble or the infamous with new identities and turns them loose in the world we on the other hand handle situations only when theres an immediate credible threat against a known principal weve also been called the er of personal security the criterion is vague but given limited resources we tend to take on cases only when the principal is involved in matters like national securitythe spy id just delivered to the cia gentlemen yesterdayor public health such as our job guarding a whistleblower in an overthecounter tainteddrug trial last year but the answer became clear when teasley gave the cops bio detective ryan kessler fortytwo married one child he works financial crimes in the district fifteen years on the force decorated you mayve heard of him i glanced at my boss who shook his head for both of us hes a hero got some media coverage a few years ago he was working undercover in dc and stumbled into a robbery in a deli in north west saved the customers but took a slug was on the news and one of those discovery channel cop programs did an episode about him i didnt watch much tv but i did understand the situation now a hero cop being targeted by a lifter like henry loving westerfield saw a chance to be a hero of his own heremarshalling a case against the primary presumably because of some financial scam kessler was investigating even if the underlying case wasnt bigthough it could be hugetargeting a heroic dc police officer was reason enough to end up on westerfields agenda i didnt think any less of him because of this washington is all about personal as well as public politics i didnt care if his career would be served by taking on the case all that mattered to me was keeping the kessler family alive and that this particular lifter was involved alors westerfield said there we have it kesslers been poking his nez where it doesnt belong we need to find out where what who when why so lets get the kesslers into the slammer fast and go from there slammer i asked yessir teasley said we were thinking hansen detention center in dc ive done some research and found that hdc has just renovated their alarm systems and ive reviewed the employee files of every guard whod be on the friendly wing its a good choice cest vrai a slammer wouldnt be advisable i said oh westerfield wondered protective custody in a secluded part of a correctional facility makes sense in some cases but this wasnt one of them i explained hm the prosecutor said we were thinking you could have one of your people with them inside non efficient agent fredericks and you can interview him youll get good information i guarantee it in a slammer witnesses tend to remember things they wouldnt otherwise theyre all happyhappy that hasnt been my experience in circumstances like these no you put somebody in detention yes usually a lifter from the outside cant get in anda nod toward teasley conceding her diligent homeworkim sure the staffs been vetted well with any other lifter id agree but were dealing with henry loving here i know how he works we put the kesslers inside hell find an edge on one of the guards most of them are young male if i were loving id just find one with a pregnant wifetheir first child if possibleand pay her a visit teasley blinked at my matteroffact tone the guard would do whatever loving wanted and once the familys inside therere no escape routes the kesslersd be trapped like petits lapins westerfield said though not as sarcastically as id expected he was considering my point besides kesslers a cop wed have trouble getting him to agree there could be a half dozen cons hes put inside hdc where would you stash them westerfield asked i replied i dont know yet ill have to think about it westerfield gazed up at the wall too though i couldnt tell at which picture or certificate or diploma finally he said to teasley give him kesslers address the young woman jotted it in far more legible handwriting than her bosss when she handed it to me i was hit by another blast of perfume i took it thanking them both im a competitive game playerall sorts of gamesand ive learned to be humble and magnanimous in victory a theory id carried over to my professional life a matter of courtesy of course but id also found that being a good winner gives you a slight advantage psychologically when you play against the same opponent in the future they rose the prosecutor said okay do what you canfind out who hired loving and why our numberone priority i assured him though it wasnt au revoir westerfield and teasley breezed out of the doorway the prosecutor giving sotto voce orders to her i too rose i had to stop at the town house and pick up a few things for the assignment ill report from the location i told ellis corte i stopped at the door and glanced back not sending the kesslers to the slammer it makes sense right youd rather get them into a safe house and run the case from there hed backed me upaaron ellis was nothing if not supportive of his troopsand would go with my expertise on the question but he wasnt in truth asking for reassurance that it made tactical sense not to put them in protective custody what he was really asking was this was he making the right decision in assigning me and not someone else to the job of guarding principals from henry loving in short could i be objective when the perp was the one whod murdered my mentor and had apparently escaped from the trap id set for him several years before a safe houses the most efficient approach i told ellis and returned to my office fishing for the key to unlock the desk drawer where i kept my weapon chapter many governmental agencies are wedded to initials or acronyms to describe their employees or departments but in ours for some reason nicknames are the order of the day as with lifter and hitter the basic bodyguards in our organization are the close protection officers whom we call clones because theyre supposed to shadow their principals closely our technical support and communications department is staffed by wizards there are the street sweepersour defense analysis and tactics officers who can spot a sniper a mile away and a bomb hidden in a principals cell phone the people in our organization running surveillance are called not surprisingly spies im in the strategic protection department the most senior of the eight spd officers in the organization were the ones who come up with and execute a protection plan for the principals weve been assigned to guard and because of the mission and the initials of the department were known as shepherds one department that doesnt have a nickname is research support to me the most important of all our ancillary divisions a shepherd cant run a personal security job without good investigative research ive often lectured younger officers that if you do research up front youll be less likely to need tactical firepower later and i was lucky to have as my protégée the person i considered the best in the department i called her now one ring then dubois came the voice from my earpiece it was the womans secure mobile id called so i got her work greeting with its french origin youd think the name would be pronounced doobwah but her family used dooboys claire somethings come up yes she asked briskly lovings still alive she processed this alive im not sure how that could happen well it has im thinking about it she mused almost to herself the building burned there was a dna match i recall the report there were some typos in it remember claire dubois was older than her adolescent intonation suggested though not much short brunette hair a heartshaped and delicately pretty face a figure that was probably very niceand i was as curious about it as any man would bebut usually hidden by functional pantsuits which i preferred her wearing over skirts and dresses the practicality of it i mean it doesnt matter are you in town i need you do you mean did i go away for the weekend no plans changed do you want me in she asked in her snappy monotone i pictured her having breakfast as the september morning light slanted through the window of her quiet town house in arlington virginia she might have been in sweats or a slinky robe but picturing either was impossible she might have been sitting across from a stubblebearded young man looking at her curiously from over a sagging washington post that too didnt register hes after a principal in fairfax i dont know the details short time frame sure let me make some arrangements i heard a few brief clicksshe could type faster than any human being on earth half to herself mrs glotsky next door then the water okay ill be there in twenty minutes i suspected dubois had a bit of attention deficit disorder but that usually worked to my advantage ill be on the road with the principals but ill call you with the assignments we disconnected i signed out a nissan armada from our transportation department and collected it in the large garage beneath the building i drove up king street and then through the quaint and narrow avenues of old town alexandria on the potomac river the virginia side not far from washington dc the suv wasnt tellall black but a light gray dusty and dinged cars are a big part of the personal security business and like all of ours this nissan had been modified to incorporate bulletresistant glass armor on the doors runflat tires and a foamfilled gas tank billy our vehicle man had lowered the center of gravity for faster turning and fitted the grille with what he called a jockstrap an armored panel to keep the engine protected i doubleparked and ran inside the brownstone town house still smelling of the coffee id brewed on a onecup capsule machine only an hour earlier i hurriedly packed a large gym bag here unlike at my office the walls were filled with evidence of my past diplomas certificates of continuingeducation course completions recognitions from former employers and satisfied customers including the department of state the cia the bureau and atf mi in the uk too also a few photos from my earlier years snapped in virginia ohio and texas i wasnt sure why i put all of this gingerbread up on the walls i rarely looked at it and i never socialized here i remembered thinking a few years ago that it just seemed like what you were supposed to do when you moved into a goodsized town house by yourself i changed clothes into jeans and a navy windbreaker and a black polo shirt then i locked up set the two alarms and returned to the car i sped toward the expressway dialing a number then plugging the handsfree into my ear in thirty minutes i was at the home of my principals fairfax virginia is a pleasant suburb with a range of residential properties from twobedroom bungalows and row town houses to sumptuous tenacre lots ringed with demilitarizedzone barriers of trees between neighbors houses the kesslers house between these extremes sat in the midst of an acre half bald and half bristling with trees the leaves just now losing their summer vibrancy about to turntrees i noted that would be perfect cover for a sniper backing up henry loving i made a u parked the armada in the driveway climbed out i didnt recognize the fbi agents across the street personally but id seen their pictures uploaded from freddys assistant i approached the car they would have my description too but i kept my hands at my sides until they saw who i was we flashed ids one said nobody paused in front of the house since weve been here i slipped my id case away any outofstate tags didnt notice any different answer from no one of the agents pointed to a wide fourlane road nearby we saw a couple of suvs big ones there they slowed looked our way and then kept going i asked they were going north yeah theres a school a half block away theyve got soccer games today its early in the season so id guess it was parents who hadnt been to the field yet and werent sure where to turn they both seemed surprised i knew this claire dubois had fed me the information on the way over id asked her about events in the area but let me know right away if you see them again up the street i saw homeowners mowing lateseason grass or raking early leaves the day was warm the air crisp i scanned the entire area twice im often described as paranoid and i probably am but the opponent here was henry loving an expert at being invisible until the last minute of course at which time he becomes all too present thinking of rhode island again two years ago when hed just materialized armed from a car that he simply couldnt have been inside except that he was hefting my shoulder bag higher i returned to the nissan and noted my reflection in the window id decided that since ryan kessler was a police detective what it took to win his confidence was looking more like an undercover cop than the humorless federal agent that i pretty much am with my casual clothes my trim thinning brownish hair and a cleanshaven face i probably resembled one of the dozens of fortyish businessmen dads shouting encouragement to their sons or daughters at the soccer game up the street at that moment i made a call on my cold phone that you freddy asked im here at kesslers you see my guys yes theyre good and obvious whatre they going to do hide behind the lawn gnomes its the suburbs son its not a criticism if lovings got a spotter on site i want him to know were on to him you think somebodys there already possibly but nobodyll make a move until lovings here anything more on his position or eta no where was loving now i wondered picturing the highway from west virginia we had a safe house a good one out in luray i wondered if he was driving near it at the moment freddy said hold on just getting something funny you asked corte got some details from the team at the motel okay hes in a lightcolored sedan no year no make no model that anybody saw henry loving stimulates the amnesia gene but its also true most people are simply extremely unobservant freddy continued i say at least three hours before hes even in the area and hes going to spend some time staging before he gets to the kessler place i said are you owed any favorsthe virginia state troopers no but im such a lovable guy theyll do what i ask i have trouble with freddys flippancy but whatever gets you through the day in this difficult business can you get his picture to the state police have it sent to all the cars between here and west virginia on an orange notice the officers on patrol would get a flash on their computers and theyd be on the lookout for lightcolored cars and a driver who fit lovings description the orange code meant he was dangerous ill do it but i know youre a math wizard corte and divide a million cars by forty troopers whatta you get thanks freddy we disconnected and i called ryan kessler hello i told him who i was and that id arrived id be at his door in a moment or two i wanted him to call freddy and check on my appearance this was a good security measure but i also did it to increase his paranoia i knew kessler as a copand a decorated street cop at thatwould be a reluctant principal and i wanted him to sense the reality of the danger silence are you there detective kessler well sir i told agent fredericks and those men outside i see you out there too agent corte i told them this isnt necessary id still like to talk to you please if you dont mind he made no attempt to mask his irritation its really a waste of time id appreciate it i said pleasantly i tend to be overly politestiff many people say but a calm structured attitude gets peoples cooperation better than bluster which im not very good at anyway all right fine ill call agent fredericks i also asked him if he was armed yes that a problem testy no i said not at all i would rather he wasnt but as a police officer he was entitled and asking a cop to give up his weapon was a battle rarely worth fighting i gave him some time to call freddy while i considered the house nearly all singlefamily residences are indefensible visibility permeable construction susceptibility to fire theyre naked to thermal sensors and have limited escape routes tactical cover is a joke a single bullet can take out the power a proudly advertised fiveminute response time by central station security companies simply means the lifter knows he has a guaranteed window for a leisurely kidnapping not to mention that the paper trail of home ownership automobiles and financial documents will lead the perp directly to even the most reclusive citizens front door in no time at all principals of course always want the security blanket of their homes but i remove them from their beloved residence as fast as possible seeing ryan kesslers house i was determined to spirit him and his family away from the insubstantial twostory colonial as soon as i could i walked to the front door checking windows ryan opened it i knew what he looked like from personnel files and my other research i glanced past him at the empty downstairs and moved my hand away from the small of my back he moved his from the holster on his hip i introduced myself shook his hand i showed him my id which has my picture name and a federal government logo on it eagle included like the justice departments but our own brand of bird theres nothing specific about our organization im described simply as a united states officer he took a fast look and didnt ask the questions i would have did you call agent fredericks to check on me no maybe he felt his cops intuition could verify my credibility maybe it didnt seem very macho ryan kessler was a solid man broad shoulders and black hair looking older than his years when he tilted his head down which he had to do because i was shorter and a step below a double chin rolled outward a round belly above tapering thighs and hips his eyes were inky and focused it was as hard to imagine a smile on his face as on mine hed be good at interrogation i surmised well agent corte just cortes fine one name like a rock star my id has two initials but i never use them or anything more than corte like some people ryan seemed to consider this pretentious i didnt explain to him that it was simply a wise strategy when it came to my business the rule was to give peoplegood people bad or neutralas little information about myself as possible the more people who know about you the more compromised you are and the less efficiently you can do your job protecting your principals agent fredericks is on his way over i told him a sigh this is all a big mixup mistaken identity theres nobody whod want to threaten me its not like im going after the jeights one of the most dangerous latino gangs in fairfax still id like to come in if i could so youre what like protection detail exactly he looked me over im a little under six feet and weigh about a range of five pounds plus or minus depending on the nature of the assignment and my delisandwich preference of the month ive never been in the army ive never taken the fbi course at quantico i know some basic selfdefense but no fancy martial arts i have no tattoos i get outside a fair amount jogging and hiking but no marathons or iron man stuff for me i do some pushups and situps inspired by the probably erroneous idea that exercise improves circulation and also lets me order cheese on my deli sandwich without guilt i happen to be a very good shot and was presently carrying a glock thein a galco royal guard insidethepants holster and a monadnock retractable baton he wouldnt know that though and to ryan kessler the protection package would be looking a little meager even them his eyes swung toward the fbi car across the street all theyre doing is upsetting my wife and daughter the fact is theyre a little obvious dont you think i was amused that wed had the same observation they are but theyre more a deterrent than anything well again im sorry for the waste of time ive talked it over with my boss chief of detectives lewis i spoke to him too on the way over here ronald lewis with the district of columbias metropolitan police department squat with a broad face dark brown skin outspoken id never met him in person but heard hed done a good job turning around some of the more dangerous neighborhoods in the city which was one of the more dangerous cities in the country hed risen high in the mpd from street patrol in south east and was a bit of a hero too like ryan kessler ryan paused registering that id been doing my homework then he told you he doesnt know any reason id be a target i really will have to ask you to leave now sorry you wasted your time i said mr kessler just do me a favor please let me come in and lay out a few things ten minutes i was pleasant not a hint of irritation i said nothing more offered no reasonsarguments held in doorways are hard to win your opponent can just step back and close the door i now simply looked up at him expectantly my eyes never left his he sighed again loudly i guess come on five minutes he turned and limping led me through the neat suburban house which smelled of lemon furniture polish and coffee i couldnt draw many conclusions about him or his family from my observations but one thing that stood out was the framed yellowing front page of the washington post hanging in the den hero cop saves two during robbery a picture of a younger ryan kessler accompanied the story on the drive here claire dubois as efficient as a fine watch had given me a backgrounder on ryan this included details of the officers rescue some punk had robbed a deli downtown in the district panicked and started shooting ryan was en route to meet an informant and happened to be in the alley behind the deli hed heard the shots drawn his weapon and sped in through the back door too late to save the husband and wife who owned the place but he had rescued the customers inside taking a bullet in the leg before the robber fled the story ended with a curious twist the woman customer had stayed in touch with him theyd started going out she was now his wife joanne ryan had a daughter by his first wife whod died of ovarian cancer when the girl was six after delivering the bios dubois had told me in the car thats pretty romantic saving her life knight in shining armor i dont read much fiction but i enjoy history medieval included i could have told her that knights armor was the worst defensive system ever created it looked spiffy but made the warrior far more vulnerable than a simple shield helmet and chain mail or nothing at all i also reflected that getting shot in the leg seemed like a rather unromantic way to get a spouse as we moved through the cluttered family room ryan said here it is a nice saturday wouldnt you rather be hanging out with your wife and kids actually im single and i dont have children ryan was silent for a moment a familiar response it usually came from suburbanites of a certain age upon learning theyre talking to an unmarried familyless fortyyearold lets go in here we entered the kitchen and new smells mingled with the others a big weekend breakfast not a meal im generally fond of the place was cluttered dirty dishes stacked neatly in the sink jackets and sweats were draped on the white colonial dining chairs around a blond table against the wall the number of empty paper safeway bags outnumbered the whole foods four to one schoolbooks and running shoes and dvd and cd cases junk mail and magazines coffee ryan asked because he wanted some and preferred not to appear rude only discouraging no thanks he poured a cup while i stepped to the window and looked out over a backyard like ten thousand backyards nearby i observed windows and doors noting my reconnaissance ryan sipped enjoying the coffee really agent corte i dont need anybody to stand guard duty actually i want to get you and your family into a safe house until we find the people behind this he scoffed move out should just be a matter of days at the most i heard sounds from upstairs but saw no one else on the ground floor claire dubois had given me information on ryans family too joanne kessler thirtynine had worked as a statistician for about eight or nine years then after meeting and marrying widower ryan she had quit to become a fulltime mother to her stepdaughter who was ten at the time the daughter amanda was a junior at a public high school she makes good grades and is in three advanced placement programs history english and french shes on the yearbook she volunteers a lot id wondered if some of the organizations were hospitals or devoted to health care because of her mothers death dubois had continued and she plays basketball that was my sport you wouldnt think it but you dont have to be that tall really the thing is you have to be willing to bump hard ryan now said look im just a cop handling some routine nonviolent cases no terrorists no mafia no conspiracies he sipped more of the coffee snuck a look at the doorway and added two more sugars stirring quickly agent fredericks said this guy needed the information whatever it is by monday night theres nothing im working on that has a deadline like that in fact im in a down period now for the past week or so im mostly on some departmental administrative assignment budget thats all if i thought there was something to it id let you know but there just isnt a mistake he repeated i had a principal last year i was protecting he hadnt invited me to sit but i did anyway on one of the swivel stools he remained standing i spent five days playing cat and mouse with a hittera professional killerwhod been hired to take him out it was all a complete mistake the hitter had been given the wrong name but he would have killed my principal just the same in this case it isnt a hitter whos after you its a lifter you ever heard that term i think an interrogator right a pro close enough i nodded now a hitters one thing mistake or not youd be the only one at risk but a lifter hell target your family anything to get an edge on yousome leverage to force you to tell him what he wants by the time he realizes its a mistake someone close to you could be seriously hurt or worse considering my words who is he his names henry loving former military special ops no civilian in a gang organized crime not that we could find in fact we didnt know much about henry loving other than hed been born in northern virginia left home in his late teens and had maintained little contact with most of his family his school records were missing the last time hed been arrested was when the sentence involved juvenile detention a week after he was released the magistrate in the case quit the bench for reasons unknown and left the area it might have been a coincidence but i for one didnt think so lovings court and police files vanished at the same time he worked hard to hide his roots and protect his anonymity i looked out the window once more then after a brief conspiratorial pause and a glance into the stillempty hall i continued speaking even more softly but theres something else i have to say this is completely between us he gripped the coffee hed lost his taste for i continued henry loving has successfully kidnapped at least a dozen principals to interrogate them those are just the cases we know about hes responsible for the deaths of a half dozen bystanders too hes killed or seriously injured federal agents and local cops ryan gave a brief wince ive been trying our organization and the bureau have been trying for years to collar him so okay im admitting it yes were here to protect you and your family but youre a godsend to us detective youre a decorated cop somebody whos familiar with tactical response with weapons well its been a few years those skills never go away dont you think like riding a bicycle a modest glance downward i do get out to the range every week there you go i could see a change in his dark eyes a bit of fire in them im asking for your help in getting this guy but we cant do it here not in this house too dangerous for you and your family too dangerous for your neighbors he tapped his pistol im loaded with glasers safety bullets powerful rounds that can kill but they wont penetrate sheetrock and injure bystanders theyre called suburb slugs but loving wont be hell come in with ms or mps itll be carnage there will be collateral damage he was considering all that id said his eyes took in the dirty dishes seemed to notice them for the first time whatre you suggesting you another officer and ill form the guard detail well get you and your family into a safe house thatll give us a defensive advantage over loving my people and the bureaull try to take him on the street or his hideyhole if they can find him but if he gets through and he could ill need you i have a safe house in mind thatll be perfect i was speaking very softly now making clear that what i was asking was off the record you sound like youve been up against this guy before i paused i have yes as he debated a female voice came from the hallway ry those menre still out there im getting she turned the corner and stopped quickly glancing at me with narrowed brown eyes i recognized her face immediately from the photos dubois had uploaded to me joanne kessler in running shoes jeans and a dark zippered sweater sprouting a few snags joanne had a handsome though not pretty or exotic face she got outside a lot sun wrinkles and tan gardening i guessed from the short nails two of which were broken she didnt seem athletic although unlike her husband she was slim the hair was dark blond frizzy and long pulled into a ponytail she wore glasses which were stylish but the lenses were thick a reminder of her prior career if anybody looked like a statistician for the department of transportation it was joanne kessler her face had registered a moment of shock seeing meapparently she hadnt heard me arriveand then went completely blank not stony or cold in anger she was numba bookish woman i guessed whod been thrown by these events this is agent corte he works with the justice department hes a bodyguard i didnt correct ryan about my title or employer i shook her limp hand and offered a momentary smile her eyes remained uninvolved mrs kessler joanne youre familiar with the situation ry told me theres been some mixup somebody thought he was being threatened i glanced at ryan who tipped his head in response i kept a calm visage and said to joanne there may be a mixup yes but the fact is that theres no doubt a man has been hired to get information from your husband her face deflated she whispered you think we really might be in danger yes i explained about lifters and henry loving a freelance interrogator i summarized but you dont mean he tortures people or anything like that do you joanne asked softly her eyes eerily emotionless as she stared at her husband i said yes thats exactly what i mean chapter some lifters bribe some threaten some blackmail with embarrassing information i explained but the man whos after ryan yes specializes in physical extraction physical extraction joanne muttered specializes you make it sound like hes a lawyer or doctor i said nothing in this line you look for anything to help you do your job its like the games i playboard games exclusively i like to see my opponent i learn a lot noting body language verbal language eye contact clothing even breathing patterns i had to convince the kesslers that they needed me i made a decision based on what id learned just now i spoke to them both though directed most of my attention to the wife i said evenly lovings lowtech usually he uses sandpaper and alcohol on sensitive parts of the body doesnt sound too bad but it works real well i tried not to picture the crime scene photos of the body of my mentor abe fallow i wasnt very successful oh god joanne whispered and lifted her hand to her narrow lips a lifters basic technique is getting an edge as in getting the advantage over you in one job where i was protecting someone from him loving was going to break in and torture a child right in front of the father he wanted information from no joanne gasped but amanda we have a daughter this is her eyes swung from one part of the room to another then settled on the sink and the dirty dishes almost urgently she stepped forward grabbed a pair of yellow kitchen gloves pulled them on and twisted the hot water faucet open wide this happened a lot principals focusing onsometimes obsessing overthe little things things they can control ryan said we should do what agent corte says get out of the house for a little while leave yes i said just a precaution now thats right as soon as possible but where a hotel one of our friends were not packed leave now you just need to take a few things and youd go to one of our safe houses its not far away its a nice place i wasnt more specific about the location i never was i didnt blindfold principals before i drove them to a safe house and they could probably figure out some general idea of where it was located but i never told anybody the address now if i could ask you to pack your amanda joanne interrupted and perhaps forgetting shed mentioned it before said we have a daughter shes sixteen ry where is she is she back from school yet principals often slipped into a hyperactive mode and their minds jumped from thought to thought at first i guessed shed forgotten it was saturday morning but it turned out the girl was taking a computer course for extra credit at a nearby community college on weekends i heard her come in a half hour ago ryan said joanne was staring at the bright yellow gloves she tugged them off twisted the faucet closed im thinking yes i prompted i dont want her there amanda i mean i dont want her with us at that safe house but shes as much at risk as ryan is so are you what i was saying earlier about the edge loving wants no please she said it seemed important to joanne that the girl be separated from them i recalled that amanda was ryans alone and i wondered why the kesslers had not had any children maybe hed had a vasectomy during his first marriage or maybe joanne had been unable to conceive or maybe theyd simply chosen not to have a family together preferring to know all i can about my principals i consider information like this it can make a difference joanne stared at the dishes and put down the gloves ryan was considering this too i agree lets get her someplace out of harms way i realized hed be thinking of what id mentionedabout the possibility of a firefight to take loving joanne said well go to the safe house but she goes somewhere else its the only way ill agree then ryan said to his wife you and amanda go no she said adamantly im staying with you but im staying she took his hand i stepped to the window once more and looked out joanne noted this the same way her husband had earlier and she was uneasy with my apparent concern i turned back i dont mind in theory but i dont have enough people to put your daughter in a separate safe house can you send her away somewhere as long as the place she goes to has no connection to you or your family at all and her name isnt on travel records or creditcard purchases loving and other expert lifters managed liberal access to datamined information bill joanne said suddenly who ryan said william carter hes a family friend he was in the department with me retired about ten years ago she could stay with him i wondered if loving could track him down because of his past association with ryan was he your partner were you ever assigned together is he amandas godfather no just a friend we were never on the same detail hes got this place on a lake in loudoun county near whites ferry they could go there amanda likes him hes sort of her uncle he reiterated and hes a former cop youre absolutely sure nobody could place you two together you dont own anything together a fishing boat a car ever loaned each other money that was part of a public filing bought property from each other no nothing can he be here in ten minutes five he lives a neighborhood away he was going to the game this afternoon but hell change his plans on a dime for something like this i opened my bag and withdrew my laptop i booted it up and began typing commands into a new window i examined the information scrolling past on our organizations secure database nothing about william carter or his career or life circumstances gave me any concern my next search was about the girl amanda kessler was a typical teenager active on facebook myspace and blogs but the personal information was minimal i was relieved at that social networking sites have made our jobs as shepherds nightmares given all the personal details people threw out into the ozone i noted too that amanda had never posted anything about william carter or his vacation house or loudoun county i was satisfied that it would be virtually impossible for loving to find any connection call him i handed ryan a mobile a flip phone black a little larger than your standard nokia or samsung whats this a cold phone encrypted and routed through proxies from now on until i tell you otherwise use only this phone i collected theirs and took out the batteries ryan examined the unitjoanne stared at it like it was a poisonous snakethen he made the call and had a conversation with carter he disconnected hes on his way then the detective paused for a moment framing what he was going to say and turned toward the doorway calling amanda come on down here honey we want to talk to you a moment later a shadow appeared in the doorway and their daughter entered the kitchen the girl was wearing redframed glasses her dark hair long and moppy she had her fathers physique narrow hips and broad shoulders a basketball player her eyes were quick and though shed probably heard something about what the agents were doing outside she seemed unafraid she looked me over carefully her stepmother said amanda this is agent corte he works with the government like the fbi hi amanda i said easily hello she seemed more interested in my impressive laptop than me personally telling children theyre in danger is an art girls id found do better with the bad news than boys im skilled at having the discussion but i generally prefer to let the parents talk to them first ryan took over mandy weve got a little problem the girl nodded eyes growing sharper yet looks like somebodys not too happy about a case of mine and some of the boys at the department and the fbi are going to arrest him but until they do were going to get out of the house for a while somebody you busted amanda asked matteroffactly were not sure you said you werent working many cases lately ryan paused before saying it could be from the past we dont know yet i told the girl we arent sure what hes up to but we know hes dangerous your mom and i are going with agent corte to talk about the case try to help them figure out whos behind it a lockdown ryan smiled i wondered what tv show she had gotten the term from not quite but its better if we leave the house while were helping out the feds youre going to spend a few days with uncle bill at the lake house dad come on she whined her pretty round face dusted with a bit of mild acne screwed up in disappointment which seemed exaggerated to me i cant miss school she recited the reasons the first quiz of the term in her biology class basketball practice her assignment at a student counseling center hotline a homecoming parade committee she shot them out fast hoping one would stick i mean i just cant children invulnerable immortal and by their own reckoning the center of the universe youll be out of school for a few days tops like a vacation vacation aw jo come on go pack some things now now i gave her a cold phone too and collected hers she was reluctant to part with it i added to the girl and until i say its all right im afraid you cant go online what to a teenager the worst deprivation possible it wont be for very long but this man probably knows how to trace your computer that like sucks amanda her father said sternly sorry but i have to go online i mean facebook and twitter at least and i write my blog every day ive never missed joanne said not until agent corte says its okay you can rough it at uncle bills watch tv read play games you can go fishing you like to fish oh that totally the teens face crinkled into wellhoned exasperation youll have fun now go pack billll be here any minute fun she muttered sarcastically as the daughter left i asked the kesslers any other close relatives in the area joanne blinked in surprise oh my god my sister i forgot about maree it was an odd name marree shes been staying here for the past month shell have to come with us is she out i asked id seen no other signs of life in the house no shes still asleep my sisterinlaws a night owl ryan explained wake her up i said we have to leave oh and dont let her use her mobile joanne blinked at the urgent instructions she nodded to a tray on the island thats her phone there i shut it off removed the battery and slipped it into my bag joanne stepped into the hall and i heard her footfalls on the stairs ryan went into the den and began filling a large briefcase and a shoulder bag with paperwork the metropolitan police logo was on many of the documents i continued my inquiry about other relatives who could be used as an edge ryans parents had passed away his brother was in washington state joannes father and his second wifehe was a widowerlived in the area but they were on vacation in europe maree was her only sibling joanne had never been married before does joanne have children i asked he hesitated for a weighty second no the kesslers would have friends of course but lifters usually had little success using people who werent blood kin for edges another glance outside across the backyard two doors down a man coiled up a green garden hose wrapping it leisurely under his elbow and between finger and thumb another neighbor was taking down screens one house nearby was quiet though a window shade moved slightly that house behind you kittycorner to the left are the residents home today as far as you know ryan looked where i pointed yeah i saw teddy this morning on his way to starbucks then he glanced at the doorway to see if his wife was out of earshot you know corte this world what you and i do joanne cant handle it well things freak her out things we dont even think about sometimes she even leaves the room when the news comes on id appreciate it if youd keep that in mind sorry ill make sure of it thanks ryan smiled and went upstairs to pack in fact id been much more blunt with sensitive joanne than i needed to beso that ryan would do what he just had asked for that very favor which id agreed to solely for the purpose of getting him more on my side my phone buzzed and my audible caller id said through my earbud fredericks i hit answer freddy im pulling in the driveway corte dont shoot me chapter i never understood the fbi agents compulsive joking perhaps it was to protect himself the way not joking is some kind of shield for me i found it irritating but i didnt have to live with him the way his wife and five children did so i tried not to let it bother me i told him come in the front and disconnected at the door i greeted the tall whitehaired agent claire dubois whose quirky mind had a habit of prodding her to make odd but accurate observations once said of freddy did you ever notice that the best fbi agents look like tv mafia dons and the best mafia dons look like tv agents i hadnt but it was true solid and columnar ever in low gear the fiftyfiveyearold paul anthony xavier fredericks was a longtimer in the bureau hed worked nowhere else after his graduation from college he stepped into the house accompanied by a younger agent both followed me into the kitchen special agent rudy garcia was in his late twenties scrubbed and reserved hed clearly been military before the bureau quick eyes unsmiling and married he wasnt i judged the sort to have a good time going out for a beer with but then ive heard the same about me the kesslersre packing any word from west virginia a shrug said it all i hadnt expected much an unidentified vehicle an unknown route loving was invisible what do you think freddy about his eta at least two hours plus till he gets to fairfax at the earliest the agent said reading the framed news story about ryan the hero i remember that sure garcia was walking around the ground floor glancing out the windows he was good careful not to give anything away to anybody outside and not presenting any target himself joanne and ryan came down the stairs two suitcases in the cops beefy hands they stopped in the hallway and he set them down they joined us in the kitchen and i introduced them to the agents messing up your weekend freddy said sorry about that i asked is maree up we have to go shell be down in a minute i suggested amanda might feel more comfortable if her aunt goes with her to your friends place in loudoun for some reason ryan replied after a hesitation probably not joanne agreed freddys radio clattered suv approaching registered to william carter i told him the friend the kesslers daughters staying with him a moment later bill carter was at the door he entered without knocking and joined us hugging joanne hard then he shook ryans hand warmly the whitehaired man was in his early sixties tanned and fit sixtwo or so his face grave and gray eyes sharp he looked me over through large clear aviator glasses as he gripped my hand he greeted freddy and garcia too carefully examining all the ids i caught the crown of a holster and shiny butt of a pistol under his jacket this is for real then he muttered its terrible bill joanne said one day everythings fine and then this i handed carter another of the cold phones and explained it to him whos after you he asked ryan the devil incarnate was the dry response i replied to carters very nonrhetorical questionthe former cop would want details his names henry loving hes white midforties about two hundred pounds dark hair had a scar his temple probably doesnt anymore i typed on the computer heres an old picture hes good at changing appearances but itll give you a rough idea my principals and carter had fallen silent looking at the benign face of henry loving put a white band of collar on him and he could have been a minister a navy blue suit an accountant or salesman at macys his face was as placid as mine merely a little fuller he didnt look like a killer torturer and kidnapper which worked to his advantage i said to carter i think were on top of things and he doesnt know about you but be alert you have wireless in your house in loudoun yessir can you disable it sure i added and make sure amanda doesnt configure your computer for dialup shed know how to do that shes a teenager i said she could build a computer out of kitchen appliances suppose youre right about that he looked at the kesslers how much did you tell her ryan said pretty much everything but i didnt overdo it shes got some grit your daughter itd take a lot to get her rattled but ill keep her distracted thanks bill and when you leave i told him keep her down have her look for something you lost under the front seat just for a block or two maybe carter thought this was excessive but he agreed amanda bounded down the stairs clutching a pillow in a redandwhite gingham case it seemed teenagers couldnt travel without pillows girls at least security blankets maybe uncle bill hi she hugged the man and sized up freddy and garcia the new arrivals hey thiss some weird adventure honey carter said yeah we better hit the road the former cop said i was amused the solidly built teenage athlete had around her shoulder a purse in the shape of a plush bear with a goofy smile and a zipper down its back joanne grabbed the girl and hugged hard to her stepdaughters embarrassment then her father did the same he too was treated to a stiff return embrace come on humor your old man ryan said affectionately dad okay she stepped back though her father kept his hands on her shoulders you call us anytime about anything yeah okay its going to be fine honey then the bulky detective released his grip apparently worried that his coddling might give his daughter more cause to worry he smiled like bye lugging her pillow backpack and bear purse amanda ran to carters suv again the former cop hugged joanne and then gripped ryans hand with both of his ill take really good care of her dont worry god bless then he was gone ryan returned to the den and came out with his briefcase and another backpack it was heavy and i assumed it contained ammunition and possibly another weapon freddy called his men outside on the radio we heard one of them respond carters gone nobody following the girl wasnt visible then i heard footsteps on the stairs and a woman quite attractive appeared in the kitchen doorway she was blinking as if shed just awakened though she was dressed in a nice outfit and her face was made up she bore a faint resemblance to joanne and was six eight years younger she was taller but willowy not as solid this is maree joanne said well lookit this she said it seemed that she hadnt quite believed what her sister had been telling her sure enough i thought you were kidding jo i mean looking at freddy and garcia didnt i see you in the sopranos she poured some orange juice and added an herbal powdered concoction to it she drank it down and made a face the agents regarded her blankly maree had longer and straighter hair than her sisters and it was mostly but not completely or authentically blond she wore a full suede skirt and a gossamer floral blouse of yellow and green silver jewelry no wedding ring i always look not for availability of course but because marital status gives me information about a lifters options in getting an edge on the principal a fancy camera dangled over her shoulder and i could see in the foyer her luggage she had a large wheelie a heavy backpack and a laptop case as if she were going away for two weeks maree picked up a stack of mail on a table near the kitchen door the pieces had been sent to her but the printed addressin the north west quadrant of the districthad been crossed out and the kesslers penned in forwarded here maybe shed lost her job and been forced to move in with her sister and brotherinlaw as she flipped through the mail i noted the woman give a slight wince she moved her left arm more gingerly than her right i thought i saw a bandage near the elbow beneath the thin cloth she took a jacket from a coat rack tugged it on and turned to her sister this looks like its shaping up to be a great party but im out of here im going to stay in the district tonight what joanne asked youre coming with us i dont see a lot of fun in that option im choosing door number three mar please youve got to come where would you go i called andrew im going to stay with him called him i was concerned she had another mobile from the house phone yeah this didnt trouble me while monitoring and tracing mobiles was a piece of cake tapping into a landline was very difficult and even if an associate of loving had done so maree couldnt have given away anything crucial to the job she was looking around i couldnt find my cell you know where it is ive got it i explained about the risks of tracing well i need it she wasnt happy when i told her that she was incommunicado i didnt have any more cold phones to hand out well im still going downtown joanne said no you dont want to do that i i said im afraid youre going to have to stay with your sister and brotherinlaw and i want to leave now weve waited too long as it is i mean right now maree waved a hand whose fingernails ended in glittery white crescents french tipped i thought they were called though i could have been wrong she said to me nodding at her sister i dont want to stay with her my god shes no fun then laughed im kidding but really ill be fine no i said firmly youre coming with us and you guys go on let me borrow the honda you dont mind she looked at me my cars in the shop do you know what they want for a new fuel pump hey whatre you doing garcia was taking the luggage out to the armada he returned to the kitchen and nodded at me meaning the yard was clear to maree freddy said youll have to listen to corte you need to leave now maree opened her eyes wide wait wait i know you she regarded me with a frown i must have blinked in surprise had we met the woman added youre on that reality show the vacation from hell youre the tour guide please mar joanne said her sister pouted hes mean he stole my phone at that moment i was looking out the kitchen window again into the backyard trying to figure out what was different from when id looked earlier there was something visible now that hadnt been a half hour ago because of the shifting angle of the late morning september sun i called ryan over and pointed is that a path a line of trampled grass lay between the kesslers house and the one id mentioned earlier kittycorner to the left it was teddys i recalled the man whod gone out for coffee yeah to the knoxes theyre our i guess best friends in the neighborhood we hang out with them all the time the path had been created over the summer from trekking back and forth for barbecues borrowing cooking ingredients and tools birthday parties what is it joanne asked youre making me uneasy wow he does look totally intense maree said corte freddy grunted grimacing i nodded shit the agent muttered he sighed and unbuttoned his jacket garcia go dark i said freddy and garcia pulled shades and drapes in the den tv room and kitchen ryan tensed and joanne eyes wide blurted whats going on tell me i could see the palm of freddys hand tap the butt of his glock we do this to reorient our muscles and nerves so we know exactly where our weapons are like i noted the pressure of the baby glock in the small of my back i left it in the holster for the moment ryan stepped forward to the window no i said firmly get back lovings here i herded everyone into the windowless hallway between the kitchen and the front foyer howd he do it freddy asked he should still be halfway from west virginia i didnt answer there were several possible explanations though none relevant to our goal at the moment to keep the principals alive and get out of the area instantly what do you have sir garcia asked me the house that path leads to the window closest to here the blinds were down ten minutes ago theyre about six inches up now makes no sense for them to be open only that far except for surveillance a spotter no i said a spotter wouldve picked the house with the best view thats the one directly behind here or to the right lovings in the left house because he noticed the path and figured the family who lives thered be good friends with the kesslers i added theyd have the best information about you and might know what my suv was doing in your drive and the sedan parked in front teddy and kath joanne blurted you mean hes there with them you sure corte freddy asked meaning we push the button on this its going to get expensive and possibly messy im sure enough i want people here now fairfax county and your folks whoevers nearby call it in freddy ordered garcia who pulled his cell phone out of a holster and hit a speed dial button im sorry this is too weird for me maree said with an edgy laugh the tour guides freaking us out because somebody opened a window good luck guys maree lifted car keys from a dish on a table nearby im going downtown she started for the front door no i told her firmly and everybody get the rest of my instructions were cut off at the sound of a huge crash from the street joanne screamed maree gasped and stood frozen in front of the door i strode forward fast gripped the young woman by the collar of her jacket and yanked her backward and we fell together onto the tile floor as the bullets began crashing through the front picture window in the living room chapter the numbness vanished from joannes face and she scrabbled forward on her knees grabbing her sister and sliding her farther into the foyer away from the windows the younger woman had dropped her forwarded mail in a white spill on the floor her camera too had fallen and she cried out reaching desperately for it leave it joanne muttered restraining her ryan had his weapon out now and was crouching i still didnt draw because there was no target yet and i was busy flinging my computer into my shoulder bag besides as the shepherd i tend to let people with more tactical experience handle the firepower two or three more shots into the living room the slugs slammed into a lamp a picture frame the wall the gunshots were soft the sound of shattering glass loud freddy was on the phone calling his agents out front but getting no response were they dead garcia i called the young agent had instinctively gone to the side windows overlooking the trees covering our flank what do you see clear he shouted only incomings from the front i gestured everyone farther back into the dim hall and then slipped into a small guest bathroom in the front and glanced through a window a silver ford had slammed into the rear of the agents vehicle knocking it forward ten feet or so the men without their seat belts on had been thrown back then forward and were slumped in the front seat i couldnt tell if they were dead or alive the ford was immobilized but the driver whod been belted in and protected by the airbag was firing a pistol at us through the open window i couldnt see the face clearly he was hunkered down and taking careful aim i stepped out of the bathroom to find ryan kessler taking a deep breath and then bursting forward breaking the window next to the front door with his pistol barrel like clint eastwood in a spaghetti western he was aiming toward the car no i shouted grabbing him and pulling him back whatre you doing the cop cried ive got a target wait i replied as calmly as i could garcia monitor the side yard stay on it roger that freddy the back i called to the senior agent who was in the kitchen clear so far two more shots slammed into the living room maree screamed again ryan said out the back we can flank him why didnt you let me shoot corte maree started crawling toward the back kitchen door sobbing her flippancy turned to raw panic im scared jesus im scared get back i said to her grabbing her shoulder to stop her once more joanne had gone catatonic again staring at the broken glass saying nothing eyes unfocused i wondered if wed have to carry her as sometimes happened i said calmly nobody go anywhere freddy took a call corte five minutes ago somebody called in two shooters at george mason university ten students down all of fairfax county tactical is on the way im trying to get a team here but theres nobody available for us a school shooting no no its fake loving called it in garcia clear on the flank still okay were moving out the front hes out there ryan cried no hes not i said the couple behind you the knoxeswhat do they drive a lexus and a ford he glanced out quickly ducked back thats their car he killed them oh shit god no no joanne whispered clutching her sister who was sobbing her own arms around her camera which shed retrieved and was cradling like a baby its teddy knox in the car not loving i said what do you mean ryan asked hes a hostage no hes the one shooting teddy wouldnt do that even if loving forced him to loving is forcing him hes threatened his wife whos back in the house but teddys not supposed to hit anybody hes just shooting at random to drive us out the back thats where lovings waiting for us in their house or maybe the bushes hell have a partner he wouldnt try an open assault alone we go out the front freddy you and garcia stay in the house and cover the side yard the one with the trees and the back ryan when we go you cover the field on the other side dont shoot unless you see somebody engaging with a weapon were going to be getting neighbors on the street any minute i dont want collateral damage ryan hesitated looking toward the front of the house he was debating follow my orders or not joanne said do what he says ry lets do what he says please go to my suv fast but not so fast you hurt yourself falling okay hurt ourselves falling ryan blurted at my bizarre concern the delay from a twisted ankle could kill us all what if lovings in the car the backseat freddy asked wouldnt be logical i called then turned to ryan the side yard loving could be prone and crawling up you saw his picture if you can confirm its him try for a nonlethal shot we need to know who hired him i can park one in his shoulder or ankle ryan said good better to aim low avoid the femoral i want him stopped but not bled out got it i hit the button on the key fob that started and unlocked the nissan then opened the front door to the house a few inches drew a target on the driver of the silver ford which was sitting half on the parking strip half in the street he was in a baseball cap and sunglasses tears running down his cheeks he appeared to be mouthing im sorry im sorry a black pistol was secured to his hand with duct tape the slide was back hed run out of ammunition teddy joanne called miserable the man shook his head thinking of his wife the edge at homewith loving holding a gun on her or so he thought loving had likely killed her the moment her husband pulled out of the driveway the lifters plan was good it was what i wouldve done had i been in lovings position limited personnel attempting to snatch a principal who was an armed cop with several other law enforcers inside in daylight no less i looked around and ushered ryan joanne and maree out we moved steadily toward the armada about twentyfive feet away though i was convinced that loving and any backup were waiting behind the house i checked the garage first it was clear we continued on like a hungry wolf ryan kept his eye on the far side yard weapon up and finger outside the trigger of his revolver we arrived at the armada and i got everybody inside and locked the doors maree was still crying and shivering joanne was blinking her eyes wide and ryan was scanning for prone soldiers crawling up on our flank seat belts i called itll be rough for a few minutes i skidded in a wide circle through the yard that ryan had been guarding then over a neighbors lawn and into the street redlining the big vehicle up to sixty sitting forward and watching carefully for pedestrians bicyclists and backingout cars i wasnt surprised that i heard no gunshots from either the hostiles or from freddy and garcia the lifter and any associates would have noted the plan didnt work and would get away as fast as they could had loving not called in the fake school shooting announcement wed have had more than enough fairfax county police in the area to set up roadblocks and interdict them but that wasnt going to happen now i slowed the vehicle to keep attention off us i wouldnt want loving to circle around in this direction flash a fake badge and ask if anybody had seen a gray nissan suv ryan sat back and holstered his weapon youre sure it was loving yes thats exactly the kind of strategy hed choose theres no doubt it was him i was aware of the corollary to that conclusion loving would know toobecause of the escape strategythat i was the opponent he was now playing against chapter thirty minutes laterit was about half past nooni was eyeing a beige car some distance behind us moving at about our speed as we cruised along surface roads in prince william county a place with a multiple personality the populace included politicos business people farmers proud rednecks entrylevel strivers and plenty of recent immigrants most of the meth in the northern virginia area got cooked in pw i couldnt tell the make or model of the car but was well aware that it had made the same turn we had a couple of miles back a pointless trip down a bleak bluecollar side street a shortcut to nowhere you either lived on heavenly lane or you detoured along it to see if somebody was trailing you whoever was in the beige car didnt live there it was still behind us light sedan no year no make no model i guessed that loving had probably switched wheels yet it was possible that he would keep the same car because it wasnt what wed expect i debated but decided not to radio for assistance not yet again i didnt want to call attention to us id just keep an eye on our beige shadow the kesslers were calmer now not much but some in the front passenger seat ryan was playing lookout and marees pendulum had swung eerily from hysterical back to cute and coy she kept calling me tour guide which i found more irritating than her panicked screaming a half hour before joanne had gone into withdrawal again and was staring blankly out the side window i wondered if shed always been this timid or if the incident at the deli six years agofacing her own death and seeing ryan and the owners shothad affected her fundamentally the degree of joannes emotional state might have been extreme but the frame of mind itself wasnt the response of principals when a lifter or hitter is after them often follows the stages of grief denial anger bargaining depression acceptance joannes detachment was a form of denial once wed sped out of the kesslers neighborhood via an evasive route joanne had said only two things first shed made the accurate observation that at least her stepdaughter and bill carter were safe since it was obvious where loving and any partners had been hiding then she offered the speculation that it made sense that teddy knoxs wife was all right too if loving had killed her that would lessen the leveragethe edgehed have over teddy to discourage him not to testify against him that was a possibility yes it was also possible however that loving didnt care what teddy knew and could testify to and hed just killed the wife for convenience that was my opinion but i said nothing ryan asked me to call freddy and find out if the wife was all right but it was possible that he garcia and the other agentsif they were alive and functioninghad engaged loving or were in pursuit and i didnt want to distract them freddy would call when he had something to say i told ryan this and he nodded though he seemed irritated i wouldnt make the call he returned to his impromptu surveillance i made a sudden turn into a burger king parking lot and paused startling me maree said quickly hey can i escape for a minute theres a pay phone no stay in the vehicle please sounding like a teenager begging for a trip to the mall no i repeated but it wouldnt be traced or anything really i know all about it about what her sister asked surveillance i saw this episode on ncis spies use pay phones to be safe off the grid thats what they say sorry no calls i said oh youre no fun i demand a lawyer she fell into a juvenile pout it irritated me all the more and i ignored her i waited for the beige car to pass us which it didnt do after ten minutes i returned to the road and sped up trying to catch the lights incurring a horn or two an extended middle finger as well but we saw no beige cars my handsfree announced freddy was calling at last i asked your guys in the car out front theyre okay yep battered shouldve had their belts on they learned their lesson and how about the shooting at the school id believed it was fake but i wasnt sure i would have been troubled by casualties certainly i was however more interested to learn if false alarms were a technique henry loving was adding to his repertoire something else to file away about him you were right son threedollar bill nothing at all but it kept sixty troopers and agents busy for close to an hour okay loving got clean away no leads no vehicle anybody see anything beige that was there and then wasnt sedan beige no and we canvassed but one of my guys across the street got a look at his partner in the side yard the trees where garcia was covering tall thin sandy hair wearing a dark green windbreaker or army jacket weapon black autoloader couldnt tell what kind he was running out of the woods fast after you left we were past densely populated areas and were surrounded by fields and houses and some commercial lots with businesses limping along or abandoned to banks i now eased up the speed of the big suv steadily did teddy knox id loving yep abe fallow had refused to use that trite line about making an ass of you and me with careless assumptions but he beat into our heads the same principle though loving might have been identified in west virginia as the man hired to target kessler wed had no independent proof that in fact he was the attacker until now freddy added we also got some prints on the tape hed used on knox and his wife just a partial but its him my principals i could see or sense were all staring at me wanting information the knoxes i sure didnt want to deliver the news that the wife was dead bothll be okay if thats what youre asking it is i told the kesslers this oh joanne exhaled and lowered her head she whispered thank you the household hadnt seemed religious but i got the impression she herself might be and was sending aloft a prayer and i asked freddy meaning did either of them say anything more other than the id squat we could put em in a room with speakers blaring walltowall captain and tennille and they wouldnt talk impression i asked ignoring the pointless quip they really dont know diddle we could maybe find out what hes wearing but how helpful would that be i submit not very i asked him if the weapon in knoxs hand could lead us anywhere he gave a sour laugh stolen years ago evidence responses been over under and through the car the yard compost heaps and recycling bins in the whole goddamn neighborhood the woods where the partner was spotted too no leads zero zip they dont even know where loving and his boyfriend parked not a single fucking tire tread or fiber and here i swore he couldnt be there for another couple of hours did i get this one wrong or what i believed i had the answer to lovings early arrival in fairfax im guessing he got an edge on the clerk at the motel in west virginia and had him say lovingd checked out at eight but hed really left around four or five this morning you win the ceegar corte all he had to do was mention the name of the clerks daughter and what middle school she was in loving did the same amount of homework as claire dubois did and as i had years before i felt a perverse admiration for his methodology and meticulousness i continued but the lightcolored sedan was his legit because there were other witnesses at the motel whod seen it earlier yup squared he then added that the charleston field office had gone through the room carefully nothing i looked behind me and then executed another series of evasive turns no beige car nothing out of the ordinary locals doing what they did on saturday driving to stores fast food restaurants for a treat after errands movies kids soccer games and tae kwon do lessons what do you think freddy real or a diversion i couldnt decide what lovings strategy at the house had been did he really want to kill us and take ryan and his family hostage or was it a feint did he have something else in mind something i couldnt figure out freddy mused real id say so i think he wanted to get in fast get ryan and get out he couldve pulled it off too if wed gone out the back like he wanted thatd be it theyd be writing our eulogies right now and kesslerd have bamboo under his fingernails or more likely his wifes oh and ill give you my opinion about the sister son she gives blondes a bad name next step find the primary id told ryan that hed possibly been targeted by mistake but i didnt believe it henry loving wouldnt make an error like that i wanted to find whod hired him and what information ryan had that was so important to him or them i told freddy id start looking into that when we landed and i disconnected the call as soon as i did my phone buzzed and i listened to the numbers read off by the caller id voice it was the federal prosecutor jason westerfield he would have heard the newsthat his hero cop a star witness in a case that didnt exist yet had nearly been kidnapped amid a shootout in fairfax county westerfield was the last person in the world i wanted to talk to at the moment i didnt hit answer i noted ryan was staring into the sideview mirror i said detective kessler call me ryan okay ryan thanks for covering our flank at the house were you ever swat never just worked the street you pick things up he was subduedhed come close to shooting his neighbor he continued to look behind us he kneaded the grip of his revolver the same way i held tight to the wheel the atmosphere in the car was somber quiet i was calmer now too reflecting on the operation trying to step into henry lovings mind and determine his next strategy i noted that in a relatively short period of time hed made a clandestine trip from another state found a trusted partner obtained weapons successfully masked his travel to the target location conducted thorough surveillance of the area where his victim lived targeted the most knowledgeable neighbors and attempted a risky daylight assault after calling in a fake school shooting to divert backup he had executed a friendly feintgetting one of your allies to assault you either because hes mistaken or because hes been forced to while the real opponent comes at you from another direction he wasnt afraid to give up weapons to a potential riskteddy knox this analysis was helpful but like looking over a chessboard in the early stages of a game gave me only a flavor of his plan there was still an infinite variety of strategies he could choose joanne was shaking her head clutching her purse closely which id also noticed happened frequently with principals familiar objects gave comfort she said to me in a soft voice if you hadnt been there she was i imagined speaking in general of the familys fate but then realized as i did that the comment was also a criticism of her husband whod resisted our help at first and she fell silent on the subject if ryan noticed he didnt react he looked toward me a moment later i want to call amanda sure just dont mention our location he pulled out the cold phone i explained the unit and he placed the call he got through at once and keeping his voice completely calm asked about her trip finally he explained that thered been a little problem at the house whatever she heard on the news stories everybody was fine little problem maree said and laughed cynically thats what the captain of the titanic said the young woman opened her large shoulder bag and pulled out and began sorting blackandwhite photographs good i reflected keep her busy count cows look for outofstate plates ryan handed the phone to his wife joanne too downplayed the incident to her stepdaughter though it seemed more difficult for her to put on a cheery face a pause as she listened i dont know why honey well find out mr corte agent cortes going to find out she listened some more and they fell into a meaningless conversation about high school some friends a ski vacation they had planned for christmas i made a fast turn another scan in the mirror nobody was following i saw too maree wince and i thought shed been hurt in the escape but then i recalled seeing an ace bandage wrapped around her arm she rolled up her sleeve and examined it maree are you all right i asked just bumped my arm last week is it bad i sounded sympathetic but i was asking because i needed to know if the injury would affect my guard job lifters like wild animals go right for the wounded breaks take at least six weeks to heal no the orthopod says its just a bad hematoma thats a great word sounds so much sexier than bruise hurt much some not too bad but i milk it for all its worth she laughed then explained i was shooting some images in downtown dc and this asshole on his mobile knocked into me and i slipped down some steps he didnt even apologize not really it was like oh whatre you doing taking pictures when peoplere trying to get to real jobs i wasnt interested in the source of the injury just her state of wellness but maree continued loud and indignant i couldnt take pictures for a few days afterward i was so dizzy i shouldve gotten his name and sued him her voice faded then she looked my way hey mr tour guide can i call my friend please pretty please singsong again who the guy i was going to be staying with before the terminator screwed up my plans i was going to meet him at six if i dont show up hell be worried joanne asked mar dont you think its better if you dont andrewll figure it out i mean agent corte didnt want you to call from that pay phone no i said that was just because i didnt want to spend any time there but if you want to call go ahead its not a bad idea we dont want him getting curious and coming to the house now that loving knows where it is i handed her my cold phone just keep it short dont say anything at all about where we are or whats happened understand sure with that maree dropped the giddy persona and suddenly grew reluctantbecause i guessed she realized the conversation would be overheard by us all or maybe she just really didnt want to change plans finally she called i glanced into the mirror and saw that her shoulders were knotted with tension after a moment though her body language changedshe relaxedand i deduced shed got andrews voice mail her voice became that of a teenager again hey its me um i feel so bad i really really want to see you but i cant come over after all like somethings come up kind of serious with the family its totally important so i cant make it tonight ill call you as soon as i can okay have a good day im sorry she disconnected and handed the phone back to me her hand seemed to be trembling she asked joanne something about plans for thanksgiving a non sequitur and they had a conversation that i stopped listening to traffic thinned and i sped upbut now that we werent being pursued i kept the needle no more than six miles an hour over the limit my organization doesnt use government license platesall the vehicles were registered to one of a dozen corporations commercial and nonprofitso if a cop were to speedgun us hed pull us over which could be inconvenient and dangerous a whisper from ryan ask you a question sure it was two of them there at the house loving and his partner probably could have been three or even more but lovings profile is working mostly with one partner well its just that there were five agents there plus me we couldve taken him he was thinking of the plan id laid out earlier to nail loving i gave him a knowing look then back to the road the agents in the car they were out of commission true but i continued i considered a takedown but it wasnt an advantageous playing field i was worried hed involve mrs knox or maybe some other hostages from the neighborhood he puts innocents into play all the time its one of his trademarks he said slowly i guess i didnt think about that ryan went back to riding shotgun i glanced his way and concluded that he had no clue he was being conned as my mentor taught me and i teach dubois you always ask yourself whats my goal and whats the most efficient way to achieve it nothing else matters thats the rule in the business world medicine science academia and its the rule in the protection field which is a business like any other abe fallow regularly had said frustration hurt feelings vindictiveness elation pride theyre all irrelevant you disappear you dont have feelings you dont have lust you dont get insulted youre nothing youre vapor part of being efficient as a shepherd was calmly picking the best strategy to get your principals to do what you wanted some you have to order around theyre more comfortable that way some you reason with others you just plain trick the story id given ryan kessler about having him help me capture henry loving was nonsense though rooted in the truthof course i wanted loving collaredit was just a strategy i was playing to win ryan over id decided on my approach after meeting him and learning from dubois details of the incident at the deli from which hed emerged a hero the rescue of the customers and the ensuing love story were in themselves irrelevant to me what was important was how the event had affected ryan a formerly active man he was now off the street he loved with a bad leg and relegated to investigating financial crimes mostly from a desk i supposed and poring over balance sheets i needed to play to where his heart was his macho cowboy side so id given him the role of partner since id make sure hed never have to act out that part you could make the argument that my strategy was condescending even mean in a way it was but whats the goal whats the most efficient way to achieve it i had to make him believe that i couldnt take loving on my own i thought id been overacting but apparently hed bought the whole story this trickexploiting the desires and weaknesses of the principals to get them to do as we wishwas called baitandswitch abe fallow had taught me the technique it was of course inconceivable to enlist a principal to help us engage a hostile but the difference between the detective ryan kessler id met at the front door just an hour and a half ago and the man sitting beside me was significant just then i sensed him tense i glanced in the rearview mirror the or a beige car was behind us once again it was going about our speed which was only three miles over the limit now maree saw us both looking backward as much as toward the road ahead what she asked her addled voice resurrected as she sat up eyes wide there was a car that might have been following us earlier vanished for a while its back now ryan was regarding me impatiently it was time for a decision i made one easing off the gas i slowed so that the beige car moved closer then glancing behind me i said firmly go ahead now shoot chapter ryan kessler blinked drawing his pistol should i aim for the wheels the driver no no i said quickly i hadnt been speaking to him but to the woman whod been looking into my eyes in the rearview mirror maree with your camera shoot the license plate the woman had a serious telephoto lens mounted on her canon i wanted the tag of the car it was too far behind to get a visual with naked eyes oh ryan sat back he seemed disappointed maree played with the cameras controls spun around and shot with the clickbuzz of singlelens reflex cameras i wondered with the digital models like they all were nowadays if that was just sound effects and speakers a moment later she was looking at the screen i can read the plate good job hold on a minute i called freddy and told him i needed a tag run immediately maree gave me the letters and numbers and i recited them into the phone ryan was looking around gripping his gun again fewer than sixty seconds later freddy came back on he was laughing registered to one jimmy chung owns a restaurant in prince william his sons driving around dropping off flyers for the restaurant i got his number and talked to the kid he said hes behind a gray suvthat needs washing by the wayand it looks like somebody just took his picture which hes not too happy about they have a good menu corte the general tsos chicken is a specialty was there really a general tso thanks freddy i disconnected and noted the passengers were staring at me its safe theres no problem chinese food delivery after a moment maree said lets order out a fragment of a laugh from her sister ryan seemed not to hear now that the vehicle had turned out to be harmless i relaxed somewhat and fell into the rhythm of the road i enjoyed driving i never had a car as a teenager but my father a lawyer for an insurance company and a good one made sure i learned to drive safely and well once you realized that most of the other people on the road were idiotshe knew this firsthand from his joband took appropriate precautions you could enjoy the process of tooling around the roads quite a bit he himself drove a volvo claiming it was the safest thing on the highway in any event i liked the act of driving i wasnt sure why it certainly wasnt speed i was quite a cautious driver maybe it was that as a shepherd when i was driving my principals and i were moving targets and therefore incrementally at least safer though not always of course abe fallow had been captured by henry loving and killed during a convoy transport the chicken truck incident in north carolina i pushed the thought away at the moment we were on a road heading west dancing in and out of fairfax and prince william counties we moved past the tudor turrets of strip malls with their assemblyline chain outlets and busy fast food franchises manned by teen clerks counting down the hours the glistening humps of used cars in rows their features touted with exclamation points doctors offices and insurance agencies the occasional antiques store in a fiftyyearold singlestory building gun shops abc stores a sagging barn or two some highrise wannabes in office parks northern virginia could never decide whether it was a suburb of new york or a part of the confederacy i checked the time it was a little after pm wed been on the road for less than two hours id decided not to go directly to the safe house but to stop at a way stationa nearby motelto confuse the trail and switch cars i often moved my principals in stages wed stay there for three or four hours then continue to the safe house my organization had a list of about a dozen hotels or motels in the area that were secure and out of the way the one i had in mind was perhaps the best checking traffic i hit speed dial dubois i asked her who are we at the hillside we have different covers for the various halfway houses we use even if im sure i know i always ask there came the clatter of a keyboard the jingle of her charm bracelet the young woman said youre frank roberts sales director of artesian computer design you were there eight months ago for two days with pietr smolitz and his friend the last word was delivered frostily dubois had formed an indelible opinion about the whistleblowers condescending mistress whod accompanied him roberts that is you was making sales calls in tysons and reston along with your associate from moscow the bullet hole in the wall got repaired before they knew about it that i remember we hadnt been attacked the crazy russian had a hidden gun that had emerged after significant consumption of equally clandestine vodka the discharge of the silenced weapon was accidental but the taser hit to his back compliments of me had not been i told dubois im checking in now ill call in twenty in twenty okay in a few miles i slowed signaled and turned into the long drive of the hillside inn the white colonial buildings stuccoed and gabled squatted in the middle of five acres of attractive landscaping geometric lawns trimmed trees english gardens roses still in abundant bloom though i doubted she was in the mood to appreciate it i hoped joanne would enjoy a brief glance at the grounds given her interest in gardening despite marees sarcasm earlier i am a bit of a tour guide in that it works to my advantage to keep my principals occupied and content the hillside inn was indeed situated on an incline though more at the bottom than the side and was backed by naked farmland there was an anemic forest to the right but a lifter or hitter would have a tough time approaching from a distance without being seen i headed up the drive then cut right and through the parking lot to the back of the motel avoiding the large windows in the lobby i parked and told everyone to stay inside i walked through an archway between two wings of rooms at the back and headed for the office there were twentytwo cars in the lot i have a scanner with a direct uplink to a national dmv database but to scan that many cars would take some time and look suspicious besides in all my years of this business id never known a lifter or hitter to park at a halfway or safe house in a vehicle with tags that would give him away i fished in my wallet from among the ten credit cards in various personal and company names and found the artesian mastercard issued in the name of frank roberts artesian is a real companywell its incorporated that isand has an impressive web site had we ever decided actually to go into computer software design we had a lengthy list of potential customers whod emailed us my organization has a number of cover companies like this and research specialists like dubois have fun writing up a briefing sheet on each of them incorporating all sorts of information like bios of chief executives exotic locations for sales conferences and even ad campaigns shepherds spend hours memorizing the data so we can have credible if brief conversations on the subjects of computer design aircraft hydraulics deli meat and cheese and a number of other products and servicesive been told my recitation of these cover stories is unsexy if not boring and discourages further inquiry which is of course the point i checked in noted nothing out of the ordinary with the desk clerk and a bellboy then returned to the suv seeing nothing that aroused suspicion in the parking lot either i opened the drivers side door and announced bring your things with you i thought we werent staying here maree said for a little while were switching vehicles you think thats necessary ryan asked just a precaution if theres a mantra in the personal security field thats it there a hot tub maree asked preferably with a cute masseur named raoul im afraid youll have to stay inside i repeated marees look silently reiterated her comment about my attitude as a tour guide i ushered them quickly into the twobedroom suite tactically the best in the hillside inn for defense since there was no sniper vantage point outside joanne looked around blankly her sister seemed genuinely disappointed at the small sparse place maybe she thought the federal government should put some stimulus money into her accommodations like a swat officer ryan opened doors to bathrooms and closets then he went to the window and carefully pulled back the curtain to look outside at a blank wall about thirty feet awaythe side of the banquet hall there was something defiant about this gesture as if he half expected to see loving on the other side of the glass he seemed disappointed to find gray cinder block rather than a target he could gun down still he said good choice defensible i nodded oooh can i have that room maree asked pointing to the larger i shrugged the rooms were just for showers and a nap if they wanted i wasnt going to be using one the others agreed and the young woman stepped toward it i said the phones in there dont work her step slowed id had a feeling that shed wanted to have a longer and private conversation with her friend andrew but she gave an exaggerated pout and said then youll have to arrange for my masseur mr tour guide she winked and vanished with a tired glance after his sisterinlaw ryan lifted his cold phone my boss sure just nothing about the location a nod he took his backpack and stepped into the other bedroom dialing he swung the door closed with his foot leaving me in the living room of the suite with somber joanne she clicked the tv on flipped through the channels there was nothing about the assault on her home only a report about the false alarm of a shooting at george mason university how did they keep it out of the news she asked i dont know i told her though i did aaron ellis my boss he had never been a shepherd like me his background was administration in federal security agencies and he was experienced at congressional liaisons budgetary infighting and media relations when abe fallow died six years ago there was some talk of me taking over the organization i was abes protégé but it would have meant less time in the field and i didnt want that so the powers that be shopped around and found ellis whod been doing some good work at langley he didnt completely get the subtleties of what shepherds did but when it came to gutting a news story that might work to our disadvantage he was the man for the job though he couldnt completely eradicate accounts of an assault in a quiet suburban neighborhood he could delay the report and turn it into something like a breakin gone bad of course elliss skills were as mysterious to me as mine were to him and i never quite figured out his magic i supposed part of his talent was rooted in finding an edge too the same sword that henry loving used and i did that too on occasion as does nearly everyone of course from time to time joanne stared unseeing at the screen her shoulders slumped her face was free of makeup she wore only a watch and her wedding and engagement ring while maree i recalled was decked out in a flare of funky jewelry joanne examined one of her broken nails i stepped to a window gazed out through the curtain at the cinder blocks and placed a call to aaron ellis i gave him an update on our progress though i didnt share with him where we were and which of the three or four dozen government safe houses in the area we were going to that was needtoknow only if a fellow shepherd or an agent from freddys office was providing backup oras was about to happenour transport man was bringing a new vehicle id part with the information but i always tried to minimize the number of people who knew where the principals were its not that i didnt trust colleagues but there was no doubt in my mind that if henry loving got to my boss hed do anything he could to find the location of my principals ellis had a charming wife julia and three children exactly fourteen months apart the oldest being eight loving would get ellis to give up my principals location in about ten minutes i didnt blame him one bit id give them up too in circumstances like that abe fallow himself said to me when i joined our organization corte listen rule number one and its a rule we dont mention to anybody but ourselves is at the end of the day your principals are packages theyre a dozen eggs theyre crystal vases lightbulbs consumer goods you risk your life to keep them safe you dont sacrifice your life for them remember that ellis asked a few questions but i sensed he had something else on the agenda so i preempted saying westerfield called i know he said you didnt pick up or was it a missed call i didnt pick up i decided i cant add him to the mix right now aaron can you keep him off me yes but it was a yes with the flu my boss added just let him know from time to time whats going on can i let you know and you let him know just give him a fast call what can it hurt he chided like one brother reminding another to phone mom on her birthday i relented and agreed no word on lovings location ellis asked no i said and an accomplice hes got one weve confirmed we have a rough id i described the tall sandyhaired man whod been spotted flanking the kesslers house we dont know anything more about him i should go aaron im going to talk to ryan about his caseload with the lifter out of sight i really want to move forward on finding the primary after we hung up joanne asked for my cell phone and called her stepdaughter she continued to put on a good facade for amanda she said she was going to call the school on monday and have the girls absence excused it seemed the girl was genuinely upset to be missing school and her various extracurricular activities amanda reminded me of myself at that age i actually enjoyed going to class i liked the precision of study taking exams i got bored easilystill doand school was a chore originally but when i began to look at classes as a series of increasingly complex games i devoted myself to the courses intensively once my father wanted me to come to his office with him some holiday party i was happy he wanted me to go but i told him i was sick after he left my mother still in bed asleep i tossed off the blanketsi was fully dressedand headed off to school the only instance i ever heard of where a student played sick to attend class i nearly went into academia only through some veering of circumstance did i end up in personal security work i whispered to joanne let me talk to bill she nodded and when she concluded her conversation with her stepdaughter she asked to speak to him she then handed the phone to me its corte hi talked to a friend downtown carter said meaning i assumed somebody at mpd had told him what happened at the kesslers house he added on my fancy new phonedont worry sounds like we just missed an interesting party he was speaking euphemistically because the girl would be listening he got close nobody was injured carter said what i heard nobody knows where our friend is correct he gave a laugh sometimes i was chided for using stiff or oldtime language i prefer to think its being precise besides by the time you get to twenty or sowhen i graduated from collegeyou talk the way youve learned to talk no sense in trying to change it that doesnt work and why should you anyway i added our information is that hes in the dark about you that parts good how was the drive i asked uneventful i got lost saw the same scenery three or four times his way of telling me hed used evasive driving techniques good keep amanda busy and dont let her near your landline oh about that i just remembered its broke i liked the old detective thanks keep em safe corte i will a mysterious chuckle i wouldnt want your job for any money chapter ryan stepped out of the bedroom carrying his shaving kit hed washed up hed changed his shirt and hed had a drink bourbon i thought a fair amount i like some wine or beer occasionally but you cant deny that alcohol makes you stupid and careless i can prove it when im playing a board game that involves skill not chancelike chess or arimaa or wei chiand im not in a seriously competitive mood i might have a glass of wine the occasional successes due to some bold unforeseeable strategy on my part inspired by a nice cabernet are vastly outnumbered by the mistakes i make thanks to the grape ryans drinking was something else id have to factor into the protection equation along with his eager pistol and his role as protector of his family i assessed the situation an armed drinking cop with a hero complex a woman in shockthough she didnt know it yetand furious with her husband for bringing this tragedy on the family also in the dark about that and a giddy irresponsible sister with no selfesteem who whipsawed back and forth between panic and grating giddiness of course every principal ive ever protected has had some glitch or foiblelord knows i do tooand if their quirks affect your job you simply note them and compensate if they dont forget the issue and get on with your business were shepherds were not parents joanne too noted the real purpose behind her husbands fake mission to the bedroom but didnt acknowledge it much less share a look with me i made some coffee and poured a good dose into a styrofoam cup i stepped into the corner and asked ryan to join me cop to cop and we sat down together before i could speak ryan said look corte i was wrong i mean what jo was saying if you hadnt been there it couldve been well i dont even want to think about it so he had heard his wife after all i acknowledged the gratitude with a nod and noted that booze made him agreeable and sentimental not hostile if it werent for the gun on his hip i might have encouraged him to have another drink his comments had been spoken loudly enough for joanne to hear and i decided he was apologizing to her too indirectly i said i know you think this is a mistake but on the off chance it isnt i want to find who hired loving the primary he said i overheard you thats what you call them right at first i was thinking it was all bullshit but after what happened at the house i mean it doesnt make sense that anybodyd go to that kind of trouble if they didnt think i knew something no not henry loving i said then i explained that we always try to get to the primary we do that and arrest him then usually we get information that leads to the lifter or the lifter will just vanish since their only interest is getting paid with the primary in custody the lifter isnt going to be collecting the balance of his fee he just takes off therere only two major cases ive got at the moment that was all i wondered surprised a cop of his age and experience in a city like dc would normally be inundated with open case files i asked give me the details ill have somebody check them out carefully they wont disrupt your investigation but i mustve collared a hundred perps in my day no more it might be revenge i was shaking my head i dont think so why for one thing he doesnt want to clip you he wants information besides you worked street crime yeah how often was revenge a motive and who was behind it ryan considered this only a dozen times usually jealous lovers or a gangbanger after another one for diming him out youre right corte nothing like this tell me about the cases the first he explained was a forged check written on the account of a man who worked for the pentagon the victims name is eric graham civilian analyst ryan went on to explain that the mans checkbook had been stolen from his car in downtown dc the perp had been smart the forger had noted grahams balance and written a check in nearly the full amount and sent it to an anonymous online payment account once it cleared hed used the money to buy gold coins from a dealer they were delivered to a post office box and he picked them up and presumably sold them for cash a clever money laundering scheme the perp had never had to present the check in person anywhere only collect the coins at the private mailbox operation poor bastard ryan said know how much was in the account hed just deposited forty thousand joanne was sitting nearby staring at the tv screen the volume low shed been listening apparently that much in a checking account thats a little suspicious dont you think i recalled that shed been a statistician so that numbers would come easily to her which suggested that she probably was the one who ran the household finances i noted too that it seemed shed never heard about the case this struck me as odd since my experience was that husbands and wives often talked about their careers but then i recalled her sensitivity to the seamier side of life maybe pillow talk about even nonviolent crimes was discouraged but her husband said hed looked into that question it seems hed just sold some stock and put the money into the account to pay his sons tuition at an ivy league school it was due a week after the forgery any leads i asked i just drew the case ten days ago i hadnt gotten very far the po box where the coins were picked up was in new jersey the man who collected them was asian in his twenties i followed up with newark pd but well you can guess theyve got more serious things to worry about than bad paper newark had one of the biggest drug and gang problems on the east coast did you look into what he was working on i asked who the victim guy whose checkbook got boosted ryan examined the shag carpet for a moment at the pentagon right not really why i noted the defensive tone was back i was wondering if it was a random crime or if he was targeted well random it looked random smash and grab they got a gym bag some clothes nothing classified or sensitive i asked for details names phone numbers addresses he opened his large briefcase which was filled with hundreds of papers and found a manila folder he gave me the information id asked for i reassured him again that we wouldnt jeopardize his investigation appreciate that whats the other big case youre working on a ponzi scheme he answered like madoff lot smaller but the theorys the same it looks like he could be causing just as much damage relatively speaking madoff ruined a lot of rich peoples lives my suspect could ruin a lot of poor folks you ask me thats even worse they dont have anything to fall back on he explained that the investment advisor under investigation was accused of preying on people in a lowerincome primarily minority quadrant of the district whats the suspects name clarence brown hes a reverend i lifted an eyebrow i know could be legit but its also a good cover to win over investors especially in that part of the city he got his divinity degree mailorder ryan added that hed been surprised to find that the man had nearly a thousand clients so that although the amounts each contributed were small the total in the portfolio was significant he explained that over the past month several of those clients had tried to get their money out but brown kept stalling making excuse after excusethe classic symptoms of a ponzi scheme the clients complained to the police and the case landed on ryans desk hed just taken a dozen victims statements and was starting to piece together browns operation the delays in getting the money were just technical problems because of some of the particular investments hed picked brown had explained to kessler the advisor didnt live the sweet life the office was modest and based out of a storefront in south east dc brown lived up the street in a tenement im just curious i said if its a securities violation whys metropolitan police handling it ryan gave a tight smile because its small potatoes the crime the victims so a smallpotato cop gets the case an awkward silence another excavation of the big briefcase documents appeared and i took down relevant details on this investigation too no other cases it could be another shrug like i said its a quiet time the other casesre small creditcard scams identity theft lowdollar amounts mostly misdemeanors he pulled out a pad and wrote the details pennyante stuff a shrug thats it i gave him a nod of thanks this is helpful ill get somebody on it right now i took my notes to a table in the corner clicked on the lightit was dim inside with the shades and curtains drawnand made a call dubois claire got some info on kesslers cases i want to find out if anybody connected to themsuspects witnesses victims anybodycould be the primary who hired loving i want you to start backgrounding all the players okay im ready dubois never calls me anything shes about twelve years younger than me which puts her squarely between sir and corte i gave her the details of the cases ryan kessler was running she said the forgery case the guy works for defense that can be tricky sometimes youre dealing with military sometimes civilian government sometimes private contractors if theres one thing they dont like to do its talk to outsiders even inside outsiders like us do you have any contacts there no i told her she was silent a moment one of her habits was tucking and retucking her brunette hair behind her ears i pictured her doing this now it never stayed in place but then neither did she i know somebody who dated a friend of mine he was wacky played games a lot not your kind of games and not boyfriend or husband games i mean hed run scenarios for the pentagon and cia like world war three scenarios and world war four scenarios there really is such a thing now thats pretty scary dont you think i always wondered if there was a five anyway ill call him and ill get on the ponzi scheme too i myself dont invest i like the mattress theory as we disconnected i heard a jangle i was sure came from her bracelet i knew that if there was any connection however slim between ryans cases and henry lovings primary dubois would find it despite her youth she was better than i at the investigation side of our jobtracking down leads she didnt have a game players mind which i seem to have been born with so the deadly chess match between me and lifters and hitters didnt come naturally to her but she was persistent as a terrier sharp and wily when the script called for it because of her frenetic nature and dancing mind she chatted up a storm with the subjects she interviewed who ended up overwhelmed or intimidated or captivated shed actually gotten a marriage proposal from a principal wed protected about a year ago after shed spent some hours interviewing him since he was a former organized crime enforcer dubois had declared him not prime dating material about a year ago barbara the personal assistant i share with another shepherd at the office caught me gazing at dubois with what was apparently a smile an uncharacteristic expression for me it was only a look of admiration after the woman had poured out a flood of helpful details shed unearthed about a potential primary that smile though was enough for barbara a single mother of fifty and a regular in the online dating world she assumed my gaze was romantic and had later asked why id never asked dubois out she mentioned something about mayseptember which seemed to me a little harsh for a mere twelveyear difference in any case of course i deflected the suggestion but my professional enthusiasm for my protégée was unrelenting and i didnt pull back from expressing it though admittedly in my typically subdued way i now typed my own notes into my laptop encrypted the file and saved it maree joined us for some reason shed changed clothes and renewed her makeup a flowery scent of perfume surrounded her she seemed even more attractive than earlier interestingly though she and her sister resembled each other in many ways only maree was what id call sexy and this had nothing to do with the age difference she walked to the coffee station and poured some she then set the cup down cocked her head as she looked at an arrangement of flowers on the dresser lifting her camera she shot a dozen or so fast pictures i made a mental note to review all the photos shed taken since the family had come under my care id make sure she deleted any that depicted me or anyone else on the team then she returned to the coffee glanced my way and refilled my cup thanks anything in it no this is fine she looked at me as if she wanted to say something else but kept silent i received a text message read it and then sent a reply i turned to my principals the new suvs here well be leaving soon ryan joked just about to take my shoes off and put the game on his attitude was completely different from when wed first met the mission id given him and the liquor helped i assessed i rose stay here i looked at ryan dont open the door for anybody but me he nodded and adjusted his holster i stepped outside and circled our wing to the parking lot behind the motel a dark green gmc yukon pulled up trailed by a ford taurus i gave a wave and the two vehicles stopped nearby two men emerged from the suv a young officer in my organization lyle ahmad was a solid oliveskinned former marine with a trim crew cut he was a clone a close protection officer i had met ahmad when he was a marine guarding the us embassy in warsaw and i was an agent with the state departments protection and investigation arm diplomatic security where i worked before joining my present outfit he was quiet and sharp and boasted impressive multiplelanguage skills he was a rising star in our organization driving the suv was our transport man billy the gangly man whose age i couldnt begin to guess had shaggy hair and a crooked incisor you had to force yourself not to look at he absolutely loved cars trucks motorcycles anything that moved by what he called dead dinosaurgas or diesel fuel he not only maintained the fleet but he would play rubiks cube with the three or four dozen vehicles we useswapping them and shuttling personnel and principals around the area we had quite a collectionafter salary and safe houses transportation was the biggest item on our budget vehicles are like fingerprints along with cell phones and credit cards theres probably no better way to trace somebody than through his car so we made sure to swap vehicles often billy nodded at the nissan she ready to go yep we swapped keys and he drove off the man who had emerged from the taurus was rudy garcia the young fbi agent freddy had brought with him to the kesslers house i shook his hand and introduced him to ahmad and we started back to the motel room i introduced the new arrival to the kesslers and maree who whispered to her sister hes cute drawing a blushbut no other reactionfrom the unmarried ahmad i noted dismay behind the nod ryan gave as if the presence of other guards might rob the dc cop of his chance to see some action as my wingman in the operation to take down loving it was then that my phone rang the caller id was from my organization but i wasnt expecting this particular individual hermes i said that was the real namepronounced without the hof our technical director the man in charge of surveillance devices computers and communication systems corte he said urgently his voice tinted with an indiscernible accent believe it or not we got a hit on the squawk box the one connected to the armada then fifteen minutes ago somebody made a call to the north east dc trap i felt my heart begin to thud quickly all right thanks hermes i disconnected i thought for a moment yes no then i told my principals garcia and ahmad that there was a slight change in plans youll be staying here a few hours longer if you want some food lyle or rudy can order room service nobody leave the room i wont be long ryan asked corte whats this all about i gave what i thought was a nonchalant shrug i have a meeting with somebody about the job i headed out the door fast not explaining that that somebody happened to be henry loving himself chapter theres some debate about exactly what the role of a shepherd should be in personal security work the nickname itself is telling shepherd to me doesnt refer to a motley farmhand with a hooked staff but to a very big dog im not a canine person myself but i know there are herding dogs that move sheep around a field and then there are herding dogs that both guard the flock and attack predators however big and however numerous which of those two roles should we personal security officers have abe fallow used to say a shepherds job is to protect the principals thats it let somebody else catch the lifter and hitter and their primaries butone of the few areas in which i disagreed with my mentori didnt subscribe to that theory i think our task is both to move the herd to safety and rip out the throats of any wolves whore threats protecting the principal and neutralizing the lifter or hitter and the person who hired him are to me inextricably joined driving fast toward the district in garcias taurus i was speaking with freddy who would lead up the hunting party the one department my organization doesnt have is tactical ive always wanted one and had the nickname gunslinger all ready to go but ellis got shot down so to speak in committee tac departments are surprisingly expensive so we rely on the fbi and in some cases local swat after i laid out the plan that i hoped would snare henry loving freddy said you think this is gonna work corte sounds like santa claus meets the tooth fairy are you there yet based out of ninth street in the district he had a shorter drive than i did make it twenty minutes move fast how many do you have plenty son peace through superior firepower he said a quote from somewhere i believed we disconnected i sped on toward washington dc hermess call had been about a flytrap a ploy we regularly use to lure the bad guys to a takedown location they work once in twenty thirty times but thats no reason not to try all of our cars and most shepherds mobile phones have inside them an electronic device we call a squawk box which periodically transmits a fake phone call thats encrypted but traceable a lifter or hitter with the right equipment can pick up the number that these phones call a landline whose location they can track down through your basic commercial reverse lookup according to hermes loving had picked up one of these automated calls from the armada when it was parked at the kesslers house hed called the landline a phone in a warehouse in north east dc the message he would have heard was that the place was no longer in business the kicker was that i had recorded that message myself so that anyone with a print of my voice as i imagined loving had would think that it was indeed the place where the kesslers were being kept given the pressure to get information from ryan by monday nightand avoid the unacceptable consequences mentioned in the email loving had received in west virginiaand given lovings unrelenting drive to finish his assignments i thought it was likely that he and his partner would at least conduct some surveillance at the warehouse the contest between loving and me was now about to begin in earnest i often put my job in terms of something that i an otherwise dispassionate person ive been told am passionate about board games which i not only play but collect the fedex package that had arrived that morning was an antique game id been looking for for years one of the reasons i picked the town house in old town alexandria is that its about two blocks from my favorite gaming club just off prince street the membership is reasonable and you can always be sure of finding somebody inside to play chess bridge go wei chi risk or dozens of other games the members are a great mix all nationalities levels of education ages though most are male all manners of dress and income politics vary but are irrelevant in the town house are sixtyseven games and i have even more in a house near the water in maryland all arranged alphabetically naturally i prefer the more challenging games my present favorite is arimaa a recent invention and a variation on chess but so elegant and challenging that the creators prize to anybody who can write a program so a computer can play is as yet unclaimed chess itself is certainly a good game and i enjoy it it has though been so written about and studied and deconstructed that when i sit down across from an experienced player i sometimes feel that im not playing against him but against a crowd of stuffy eccentric ghosts what do i like about board games as opposed to say computer games which certainly offer the same mental challenge for one thing i like the art the design of the board the playing pieces the cards the die the spinners and the wooden or plastic or ivory accoutrements like sticks and pins the aesthetics are pleasing to me and i like it that they also serve a functional purpose if you can call playing a game utilitarian i like it that a board game has longevity and is tangible it doesnt go away when you shut off a switch or pull a plug from the wall most important though i like sitting across from a human being my opponent much of my life involves playing a match of life and death against people like henry loving who are invisible to me and i can only imagine their expressions of consideration as they pick their strategies to capture or kill my principals playing chess or go or tigris and euphratesa very good game by the wayi can watch people as they choose their strategy and note how they respond to something ive done even übertechie bill gates is a devout bridge player ive heard in any event playing games has honed my mind and helps me as a shepherd so does game theory which i became interested in while i was getting one of my graduate degrees in math also for the fun of it lolling in academia and delaying entry into the real world game theory was first debated in the s though the ideas have been around for years the academics who formulated the theory originally analyzed games like bridge and poker and even simple contests like rock paper scissors or coin flipping with the goal not of helping win leisuretime activities but to study decisionmaking simply put game theory is about trying to make the best choice when presented with a conflict among participantseither opponents or partnerswhen neither knows what the other will do a classic example is the prisoners dilemma in which two criminals are caught and held in separate cells the police give each one a choice to confess or not even though each doesnt know what the other will pick they do knowfrom the information the police give themit will be for their mutual good to confess they wont go free but theyll get a relatively short sentence but theres also the chance that by not confessing they will get an even shorter sentence or none at all though thats riskier because they could instead receive a much longer one confessing is the rational choice but not confessing is acting with whats called rational irrationality in the real world you see game theory applied in many situations economics politics psychology and military planning for instance customers might know that its better not to withdraw all their savings from a troubled bank because if they do theyll contribute to a panic the bank will fail and everybody will lose on the other hand if theyre the first to get their money out they wont lose anything to hell with the common good by withdrawing all their funds fast rational irrationality might save them individually even though it will start a run on the bank and ruin it how does this affect my job as a shepherd since neither i nor opponents like henry loving know what moves the other will make i continually apply game theory in trying to pick the best strategy to winstrategy being not an overall approach to a contest but a specific move like pawn to rook seven or selecting a fist in rock paper scissors here my strategy was to play the flytrap believing that henry loving was more likely than not to make a rational choice to go for the bait but game theory exists because of uncertaintyon gaming boards and in real life perhaps loving would sense this was a trap and knowing that i was preoccupied there would use this opportunity to find the real safe house the kesslers were in while i was busy here or would he try a different strategy altogether something i couldnt figure out but which was even now brilliantly outmaneuvering me i was getting closer to the nations capital i noticed behind me a black suv i might have seen earlier westerfield someone else i called claire dubois again i need a crowd festival parade in the district i dont think i have a tail but i want to make sure of it what do you have for me a crowd okay how big a crowd theres the game at the stadiumbut sorry to say thats not going to be much of a crowd given how theyre playing this season then theres a romance author and the cover model of her bookstheyre signing at a safeway in north west how did she know this without looking anything up how many people go to romance book signings at grocery stores youd be surprised true but i want bigger and downtown make it a thousand people plus too bad its not spring i dont go for the cherry blossoms myself she told me if the blossoms did something while you were there that would be one thing but i never quite understood going to look at trees lets see lets see i heard typing i heard tinkling charms dubois said theres not much a gay rights march up connecticut in dupont circle preaching to the converted estimate four hundred a mexicanamerican parade in south east but its just winding down now oh here we go the biggest thing is the protesters outside of congress thats about two thousand strong i never know why they say that strong as opposed to two thousand weak that sounds good the crowds were there to protest against or support a supreme court nominee she explained i was vaguely aware that the juristprojected to be confirmed by one or two votes in the senatewas conservative so the left was busing in folks to protest while the republicans had marshaled their own troops to show support where exactly she told menear the senate office buildingand i disconnected and steered in that direction in five minutes with the sanction of my federal id i was easing in and around the demonstrators and past barricades that would stop anyone tailing me the supporters of the nominee were on one side of a line the protesters on the other i noted the viciousness of the insults and even threats they flung back and forth at each other the police were out in force i recalled reading a recent series in the post about the increasing polarization and aggressive partisanship in american politics my phone buzzed freddy where are you trying not to run over supreme court nominee protesters hit a few of em for me youre on site were here in the staging area anything nothing so far ill be there soon i now emerged on the other side of the demonstration assured that i had no tail and sped to a small garage we sometimes used just north of union station in five minutes id swapped garcias official car for another fake one and was heading out a different doorway from the one id driven into ten minutes later i was at the flytrap a new round of the game against henry loving was about to begin chapter wed picked this location a scruffy portion of north east dc because it was a perfect takedown site some industrial parts of the district of columbia like this one are as breathtakingly grim as anything detroit or chicagos south side can offer the warehouse we leased for a song was in a marshy weedcluttered landfill crisscrossed with rusting railroad tracks id never seen a train crumbling access roads and a couple of soursmelling canals our property was three acres of overgrown lots filled with trash clusters of anemic trees pools of water the color of a sickly tropical lizard in the center was an ancient warehouse with just enough evidence of habitation to make it seem like a credible safe house nearby were two small crumbling outbuildings where tactical teams could wait for the bad guys they offered perfect crossfire positions the warehouse itself had bulletproof brick walls and few windows weve used it a number of times though only twice successfully the most recent was last january when id sat in a snowstorm for four hours sipping increasingly chilly coffee from a flabby cup clutched in my stinging red fingers until the hitter finally made his bold and for him unfortunate move i now drove through back alleys and fields largely invisible to any surveillance from the perimeter i parked some distance from the warehouse beside the other federal cars out of sight of the nearby driveways and roads then my shoulder bag bouncing on my back i walked through a stand of brush and beneath a rusting railroad bridge that was graffitifree even the gangbangers had no interest in this prime example of urban decay i surveyed the area again saw no sign of hostile surveillance and slipped through tall weeds toward the staging area a glance at the groundthe broken twigs overturned leaves and stonestold me that freddy had brought with him at least six agents all of them seemingly unconcerned that they left such clear evidence of their presence i spent some time obscuring the most obvious signs surrounding me was a world of trash and abandoned vehicles and rusting machinery and outright garbage piles on my right i could see a glimpse of a narrow canal filled with bile green water and dotted with refuse and a dead squirrel or two which i suspected had ended up there after taking a sip improbably a small recreational power boat floated in the current toward the potomac then the strip of foul water vanished from sight a moment later i got to the command post and greeted freddy and his people six male agents in their thirties large and unsmiling and one younger woman equally somber the mix of these law enforcers was like the city itself black latino the minority whitethe woman and an older weathered male agent people tend to think that the fbi is all dark suits and white shirts or the scary tactical outfits that make them look like science fiction movie soldiers in reality most agents dress informally windbreakers baseball caps and blue jeans in the case of the woman make that designer jeans which i couldnt help but notice fit very closely all were in body armor which i myself now donned everyone seemed tense though i could tell from their eyes that they were looking forward to engaging as i slipped on my com device earpiece and stalk mike freddy gave me their names and i paid attention since i might need to differentiate them if the situation heated up i nodded to each in greeting i asked if thered been any contact the woman said we had a light sedan gray or tan go by the west perimeter that road over there five minutes ago didnt pause but it was going slow id guess ten miles an hour gray or tan could have been beige lovings car from west virginia i suggested this and they took note the slow transit in itself might not be suspicious a lot of roads in the district were riddled with potholes the asphalt was crumbling and traffic signs were missing kids stole them for souvenirs which could explain the cars leisurely pace but then the bad conditions would also provide a good excuse for loving to drive slowly and be less suspicious you have a sniper i asked freddy he snorted a laugh sniper youve been watching too many movies corte best we have is bushmasters accurate is what we want freddy its not about size was that a joke corte you never make jokes a map i asked here sir the woman agent produced one i looked it over carefully though i was keenly aware we didnt have a lot of time either loving would move fast or he wouldnt try for the assault at all i turned to the agents and explained my plan for the takedown then pointed out the best placement for everyone and for the hardware freddy made a few suggestions which i thought were good i looked at the building that was supposedly our safe house a few lights were on inside and there was a machine that hermes had developed a nice little toy like a slowmotion fan whose blades cast shadows randomly on shades and curtains giving the impression that somebody was inside and walking occasionally from room to room it also produced a light that mimicked the glow of a tv screen you could program voices to sound like people having conversations there was even a mode selector argumentative humorous conspiratorialto make any eavesdropping lifters or hitters believe the warehouse was populated by principals under guard and not workers howre the kesslers freddy asked calmer than a lot of my principals but i told him joanne was a zombie and would be in therapy for a year her husband was drinking and wanted to shoot anything that moved and mareewhen she wasnt hystericalwas more concerned about boyfriend trouble than professional killers i warned you about that sister corte you know you get tired of this job you should think about doing some kind of dr phil show then i said im going into position he gave me one of his looks it was a container of a dozen messages that i read instinctively freddy whom id met years ago under unusual circumstances was the only person in the world i could be partnered with in operations like this of the two of us im the strategisti pick the movesand hes the tactician figuring out how to implement my choices in terms of games i decide rock and freddy makes the fist i trekked through a long weedy gully bordered by a thick stand of trees to my right the smelly canal beyond and on the left grass and piles of machinery at the end under cover of the sad foliage i set up a big ear unita twelveinch parabolic dish that was an ultrasensitive microphoneand slipped on a headset i turned this toward the warehouse aiming the device below the window which had purposely been left open i focused beyond the warehouse and noted in the middle of our property two civilian vehicles up on blocks a chevy sedan and a dodge van rusty and covered with graffiti some of which i myself had helped spray on a few years ago alone now feeling very alone i looked around once more as a trickle of excitement and anticipation danced down my spine fear too of course as abe fallow had told me and i told my protégés you have to be afraid in this business if you dont get scared you cant be effective ten minutes passed a long long ten minutes team one to command post a voice clattered through our earphones got some movement north command post to one go ahead be advised unknown person moving slow dark clothing male probably gone from sight now hes in grid eighteen weapon not obvious i strained leaning forward to look where the subject had been spottedthe opposite side of the property from where i was after a moment of staring at blond and green weeds i too noted some motion the subject was moving furtively from a dead end road toward the warehouse ive got him the woman agent said no weapon doesnt appear to be loving probably the partner i radioed but hes not alone lovingll be here too the others called in reporting what they sawor mostly didnt seefrom their respective positions the figure tentatively approaching the warehouse had stopped then a whisper team two hes noticed the dodge hes interested in it i kept quiet id be getting the details as soon they were verified it was inefficient to waste time by asking professionals for more information it was like urging be careful as youre moving in for a takedown i wiped my hands on my slacks this is team one hes on the move again slow team two copy that hes real interested in the dodge one of the agents asked any equipment in there no freddy said its clean let him poke around team four you see anything more any sign of loving negative three negative then this is team two the partners getting closer hand in pocket looking behind him has something in his hand a mobile i pulled out my alpen x long eye binoculars and scanned the area but couldnt see him working on calming my breathingwhich was shallow and fast i tried thinking one of my mantras rock paper scissors rock paper scissors it was then that i heard snap directly behind me i froze and turned my head slowly holding his silenced pistol steadily on me henry loving glanced down briefly his mouth curling with faint disappointment at not having avoided the dry branch hed just stepped on chapter loving noted a bit of body armor protruding from beneath my jacket he lifted his gun and aimed at my exposed neck then his pale left hand moved slightly delivering instructions i stood i was to remove the radio mike bud from one ear and the listening device earpiece from the other and to pull my weapon from the holster with thumb and index finger i complied with all of his requests assessing him calmly the way the game was moving was now clear loving had guessed that this was a trap and had decided to engage me personally a rational decision which explained why hed ordered the partner to hold back near the dodge and not approach the warehouse itself which he would have done if loving had fallen for the setup hed known it was a trap but hed taken the risk not to get ryan kessler of course but to kidnap me who after sufficient coercion would tell him where exactly the kesslers were i had suddenly become a principal lovings murky eyes in the fleshy nondescript face of a businessman approaching middle age took in the scene quickly and noticed no threat around him here at a distance from the command post and the warehouse i realized that this was the closest id ever gotten to the man whod tortured and killed my mentor in rhode island in the botched takedown id never been nearer than a hundred feet or so close enough to see him squint slightly as he pulled the triggeran instant before realizing that hed walked into a trap and the principal was really an undercover agent behind an invisible bulletproof shield neither of us said anything now his plan was that we would talk of course but later and in the back of his vehicle or in another grim abandoned warehouse somewhere far away hed be thinking how long i could last before i told him where ryan kessler was because henry loving knew i would talk everybody talks sooner or later with my weapon the radio and cell phone on the ground and knowing he had limited time henry loving gestured me toward him walking forward i lifted my hands to shoulder level to show i was no threat my gaze riveted to his i couldnt look away this was not because his eyes were intense or focused though they were but because they were the last thing that abe fallow had seen as he died i knew this because the bullet had been fired from close range and had struck abe in his forehead the men would have been looking at one another i often wondered sometimes for hours before i fell asleep about abes last moments hed given up the locations of the five principals hed been guarding but id been listening on the stillconnected mobile between the moment abe whispered the address of the last witness and the fatal gunshot thirty seconds or so had passed what had happened during that time what had their expressions been this was perhaps the reason i was so obsessed with catching henry loving not only because hed killed abe fallow but because hed forced the man to spend his last few moments in agony and despair hands submissively out to the sides i began to wonder what shepherds always wonder under such circumstances how long can i hold out under torture lovings lowtech usually he uses sandpaper and alcohol on sensitive parts of the body doesnt sound too bad but it works real well this question though was merely theoretical something that popped into my mind as i stepped forward because despite appearances i wasnt the losing player at the moment henry loving was the real bait here wasnt the warehouse and the suggestion that ryan kessler was inside the real bait was me the trap was something altogether different from what it appeared to be and the moment had come to spring it squinting i lifted my hands over my shoulders this was the signal to the two fbi teams hiding nearby my backup and as i dropped to the ground i caught a glimpse of the shock in lovings face as the explosions began they were stunning i felt the blast wave and heat slam into my face as i rolled on the dirt to retrieve my weapon radio and phone the powerful remotecontrolled flashbang grenades continued to detonate along the line id ordered them set up fifteen minutes before by the agents covering me teams three and four theyd been told to set them off when i raised my hands above the level of my shoulders or if loving shot me move in move in i shouted from the ground plugging the earbuds in and grabbing my weapon hes headed for the canal i heard freddys voice team two take down the partner the agents on teams three and fourthe ones whod been with me the whole time hidden only thirty or so feet awaywere on the move now heading after loving i joined them sprinting we ran in pursuit through the brush and weeds around tires and abandoned washers and refrigerators the lifter was ignoring us concentrating on speed not turning to fire id decided that loving would probably guess that this was a trap but i also believed that hed figure id be present and hed take the risk to kidnap me and extract the location of ryan kessler then kill me afterward i am of course the henry loving of his life my strategy had been to put the agents around me and rig explosive charges nearby then set up the microphone and turn my back to where i believed hed come at me i became the most obvious target i could be like a suspect in the prisoners dilemma id made a risky choice rational irrationality id bet that loving wouldnt kill me outright but would try to extract information about the kesslers whereabouts i wondered if hed arrived by that boat in the canal and possibly he had but he was now heading the other waytoward an open field there was very little cover and it seemed a strange choice but then i spotted a hundred yards away an embankment on top of which was a road he had a getaway car there waiting i saw wed stop him easily before he got halfway there though the four agents whod been guarding me were gaining on himi was holding my own i called freddy to tell him that loving was heading for the road and to send a car to intercept him the radio transmissions were flying like shrapnel as our voices stepped on each other gasping i continued to race after our prey we got some good news team two got one in custody lovings partner that was something i reflected we could learn valuable information from him his phone forensics he might even confess the prisoners dilemma but then an agent from team two said weve got him down no weapons not armed i wondered hed had a semiautomatic pistol at the kesslers oh no i stopped fast as the stark understanding came home i forced myself to speak clearly as i radioed the message meant for the four agents ahead of me teams three and four get down find cover immediately the man in custodys not the partner its a setup i dropped to the ground like a rag doll which was probably what saved my life as i landed in a stand of brush i heard a snap over my head and nearby dirt and rocks flew up a moment later the rolling boom of a distant rifle shot filled the field i called incoming sniper fire what somebody transmitted the agents ahead of me similarly rolled to the ground as dirt and bits of trash leapt up around them lovings partner was a talented shot but the agents managed to find suitable cover nothing would protect them from a direct hit but the weeds were tall enough so that the partner couldnt spot them loving was now only about forty feet from the embankment and the car the agents tried a few shots his way but the moment they rose the partner would let go with three shot burstshe had an automatic weaponand the teams dropped again to cover i looked for a target and saw nothing the car freddy had sent was speeding along the embankment and would get to the escape vehicle about the same time loving did i sighed and hit transmit freddy get the car back now its our only chance corte no no call it back theyre sitting ducks shit okay would it be in time then i saw the car swerve and i was watching bits of asphalt and debris pop up on the road beside the vehicle as the partner turned his long gun their way the driver steered off the road fast the car disappeared down the embankment on the other side and i heard a crash loving reappeared and jumped into his car which sped off a lightcolored sedan tan or gray i heard freddy radioing the bureau and the mpd to order a search for the car the sniper fire ceased but we knew the drill and duckwalked back toward the staging area low presenting no target as we assumed the partner might be holding in shooting position finally with no more shots fired we arrived at the command post i looked over the man that team two had collared i didnt have much hope that this scared kid could be helpful but still you go through the motions the diversion was a young meth head he explained that somebodyloving to hear his descriptionhad picked him up near a club in south east and asked him to help score some drugs at the warehouse loving had explained that he wanted some heroin but was too scared to buy it himself there was a dealer operating out of an old derelict dodge van on the premises here hed slipped him cash and told him to buy four hundred dollars worth for loving and a hundred for himself he was to be carefulgo up slowbecause sometimes the cops checked it out im going to go to jail arent i there was something almost humorous about the kids wideeyed lament though it occurred to me i wasnt sure hed actually done anything illegal i asked him a few questions but loving had known the kid would be caught the decoy had been told nothing that might be helpful to us freddy went over him for evidence but while i certainly appreciate forensic science in these circumstances the only connection between loving and this kid was the hundreddollar bills if thered been any trace evidence exchange through shaken hands and the money it wasnt going to lead to lovings hideyhole we tried to reconstruct where the real partner had been shooting from there were dozens of highground vistas that would have been perfect nobody had seen a muzzle flash or leaf reaction from the powerful gun the agents in the car that had crashed were all right one of them radioed that he was canvassing some workers on the other side of the embankment whod heard the shots a man reported seeing somebody running to a dark blue fourdoor sedan buick they thought i clicked transmit this is corte ask them what he looks like after a moment tall thin blond green jacket yes thats the partner nobody got the tag number or anything else specific thanks i said calls came in about the search which included a metropolitan police chopper but loving had left the immediate vicinity without being spotted we gave it a try freddy said we had but loving had outthought me and negated my strategy we were playing a game yes but that didnt mean it might not end in a draw rockrock paperpaper for me though a draw was as good as a loss i walked up to the car id driven to the warehouse and took a handheld scanner from my shoulder bag freddy said you think the partner got to the staging area i didnt answerwhy guessbut apparently he had i found the first tracker in my cars wheel well in about fifteen seconds and just after that the second one hidden six inches from the first in hopes that i might stop the search after finding number one i kept going but i didnt find a third at least not a third one that had switched itself on yet i noted that removing them switched off the power alerting loving that theyd been found we couldnt use them as bait to lure him to another trap i searched a second time with an explosives sniffer and didnt come up with any bombs i hadnt really thought that was a risk though loving wanted me to lead him to the principals he didnt want to kill me that would come later chapter i swapped the borrowed car for garcias taurus and drove it to old town alexandria parking in our garage next to the office the dc area is peppered with operations like this units of various government agencies sometimes its a question of space langley for instance is extremely crowded for meetings at the cia i sometimes have to park a hundred yards or more from the entrance sometimes its security everybody from the writers at slatecom to the mossad to al qaeda know where the nsa nro and cia are located other operations like ours prefer to stay off the grid as much as possible in the garage i greeted billy and told him to run a full scan of garcias car it had been unattended in the garage near union station for several hours while i was at the flytrap i stopped halfway here and ran a scan nothing active but youll have to give it a thorough check a lot of trackers have timers that turn on hours or weeks into the future you need very sophisticated equipment that can detect not radio signals but tiny electrical sources you bet corte the scrawny man said ill call a sweeper billy would look right at home in the cab of a peterbilt tractortrailer i made a detour outside and bought a roast beef on whole wheat extra mustard and two pickles and black coffee i returned to the office the boring and uninviting lobby featured an unhealthy tree a poster of a smiling man and woman whod apparently just been approved for a loan and a black sign containing white adhesiveletter names of a half dozen companies all fake i nodded at the two guards both seriously and subtly armed then did the eye and thumb thing at the wall panel and walked through the door i went up a flight of stairs outside my office my shared personal assistant barbara lifted her head and handed me some message slips the slim middleaged woman purposefully didnt look at my coffee and i knew she was thinking why didnt i like hers which she made daily for the floor i didnt like it because it was reliably bad her hair was grayish dark and frozen into shape i sometimes thought she got the hairdo about where she wanted it and then pushed it into position with gusts of hair spray since our organization never closed we had support staff all the time though no one assistant was required to work more than forty hours a week i hadnt done the math but i believed barbara was working on her second forty i like weekends she sometimes said its quieter apart from lying in polluted mud and getting shot at by a talented sniper i sat down at my desk and ate a pickle spear and a large bite of sandwich a heimlich bite i then sipped hot and strong and very good coffee i called lyle ahmad at the hillside inn whats the status quiet garcia and i make rounds every twenty or so any calls anybody from the front desk anything no he said crisply ahmads ancestry was middle eastern of some sort and he might or might not be a muslim unlike some people of that faith in this country he didnt seem the least selfconscious or defensive about it nor should he have been the vast majority of people whove tried to kill me have been of christian or jewish or agnostic leaning the principals doing fine he assured though with a certain tone in his voice that meant they were probably impatient bored and uneasy but he didnt want to say so while ten feet from them i heard the sound of a baseball game in the background and joanne saying to her sister well sure i just wonder if you think thats the best idea though sure my mother would often sound like that ill be back for the move to the safe house in about fortyfive yessir after we disconnected i ate two more large bites of sandwich thinking of the fedex package id received the antique game id been looking forward to examining on my lunch hour i wondered if it was in good shape if it had all the pieces and cards as the seller had promised i glanced at the safe behind my desk but left it where it was i didnt have it locked away because i was afraid it would be stolen no it was simply that i didnt share my personal life with anybody here even those i worked closely with yes there were some security reasons for this in reality though i just felt more comfortable being secretive i couldnt really say why i reached for the phone to call dubois and have her brief me about what shed found out so far about ryans case but it buzzed first my bosss extension corte its aaron could you come in for a moment tone often tells more than content and i noted the uneasiness in elliss voice making the otherwise innocuous request i expected to find westerfield sitting in his office when i arrived but in fact it was somebody else altogether a slim man balding in a suit and powder blue shirt no tie he looked at me with eyes that didnt look at me as if he was seeing what i represented rather than who i actually was we shook hands he identified himself as sandy alberts ellis seemed to have met him before but then my boss knew almost everybody in washington dc he said to me sandys chief of staff to senator lionel stevenson moderate republican from ohio i thought hed been on the cover of newsweek or something recently im not really here alberts said jokingly referring to the secret nature of our organization we heard this a lot im sure youre busy ill tell you whats going on sir corte officer corte then the senator is on the intelligence committee which explained the security clearance allowing him inside id been wondering the committeell be holding hearings next month on domestic surveillance issues patriot act fisa warrants its looking into possible privacy abuses and im doing some research for the senator he held up jovial hands were not suggesting anythings wrong here just interviewing as many people as we can in federal law enforcement gathering information youre the senior protection officer in your organization and wed like to interview you to see if youve been aware of instances in which theres been lets say carelessness in failing to apply for warrants for wiretaps on phone lines and emails in any agencies youve dealt with the bureau the cia dea nsa nro local law enforcement id be happy to help but well i need to run this job now alberts was nodding we know what you do here the senators a friend of aarons a glance toward my boss we dont want to jeopardize any of your great work its just that theres a bit of time pressure why ellis asked any time committees start looking into things the press invariably catches on and if they preempt us everybody loses i couldnt disagree with that there are plenty of other people you could talk to here i suggested oh we want the star alberts replied my boss backed me up im afraid i agree itll have to be after this case is concluded alberts wasnt pleased but he took it in stride three four days you think probably something like that i said but i cant commit its a very critical time for the family in my care ill let you know as soon as im free sure i understand alberts said looking through me again smiling that nonsmile of his appreciate it he rose with a nod to ellis the man collected his briefcase and i meant thatabout the good job you folks do after he left i asked ellis the senators a friend of yours ellis scoffed shrugging his huge shoulders if you call going to somebody with hat in hand a friend then i guess stevenson usually comes through with most of what i want for the budget hes to the right but its a thinking right hes smart and hell listen to the other side we need more pols like him too much screaming in congress too much screaming everywhere i recalled the turbulent demonstrations id just driven through each side really looked like they wanted to kill the other i believed that was the gist of the newsweek article senator stevensons efforts to encourage bipartisanship in washington good luck i thought i regarded my bosss childrens artwork on the wall a river dominated by a very large fish a purple airplane rabbits and alberts only met him once or twice typical beltway pro political action committees fundraising aide for senators on the finance committee armed services and now intelligence with stevenson ellis was shifting in his chair youll follow up with alberts i suppose i need you to corte keep the pursestring people happy though you dont look too happy about it i cant testify in a hearing im only good because i dont exist alberts knows that he only needs leads to other agencies the public ones you know what lead translates into in this line of work dont you aaron snitch my boss suggested the very word i had in mind chapter i returned to my office barbara said your coffee was cold so heres a new one i just made it ah i thanked her and sipped it was even worse than id remembered i punched speed dial dubois the voice chirped youre in the building for ten minutes or so can you come over here she appeared a moment later and i wondered how the job had disrupted her plans for the weekend she had two cats and a boyfriend who seemed like a regular i deduced from snippets of conversation but whom she didnt live with id never met him i dont socialize with colleagues her boyfriend was apparently always ready to come over to feed the animals and change the litter i sometimes felt sorry for him on the other hand i wondered if he wasnt better off in that sort of relationship with claire dubois rather than living with her which might be an exhausting proposition she sat across from me principals phones i handed her the bag containing the kesslers nokias and samsungs and blackberrys and their respective batteries which id removed shed put them in the sealed room up the hall in hermess work area if ryan or joanne absolutely needed a number from their phones in an emergency and had no other way to get it hermes or a wizard in technical would go inside power up the phone and get the information without any risk of a telltale signal escaping loving dubois asked his partner was there but no further description or lead except a blue fourdoor probably buick nothing else a raised eyebrow light or dark blue i mean therere about twentyfive shades of green for current passenger vehicles i happen to know eighteen red i havent looked at blue sorry but its probably the same oh and they typically fade one degree of color temperature every six months depending darker she jotted this down in her ubiquitous notebook now theres this i handed her the plastic bag containing the trackers dubois lifted a thick dark eyebrow two okay you were telling me they do that sometimes sometimes three in your car at the flytrap i nodded lovings partner did it i need prints and source of origin ill track them down she said without any irony at her choice of verb i asked now ryans cases dubois didnt need to glance at her notes first the forgery graham eric fortynine civilian employee of the dod heres the background they call it the inner circle where he works i think its ring e or something like that inside the center of the pentagon i couldnt find out exactly what he does even with my id and pulling strings but we can go with its classified and it involves weapons development howd you find that weapons developers are very careful to make sure they never say they develop weapons checked his résumé his clearances correlated some times and places of meeting with a defense contractor or two you know sometimes you can tell more about somebody from what he doesnt tell you than what he does i put it all together dubois was really a gem she tucked away strands of hair and the charms on her bracelet jingled i saw a sterling silver dog an armadillo a baguette and a tiny silver king wenceslas which shed bought in prague when wed been on assignment there she continued no security incidents involving graham but somethings come up something odd i dont know what to make of it she was looking at my sandwich is that dinner i looked at my watch it was a little after pm i said its more lunch go on what else did you find you were saying i went back to the detective bureau at the metropolitan policeto find out moreand it seems grahams decided to drop the case dropping it he called the chief of detectives lewis on friday and told them hes not going to pursue it he wants it dropped any reason because of his job is what hes saying security issues he doesnt want to be public seems odd what does getting robbed have to do with national security ryan told me the perp didnt get anything sensitive no computers or files from work dubois agreed thats right why now i wondered wouldnt he have been worried about that from the beginning and not even reported the theft in the first place youd think and theres something else i checked the law hes to blame it seems if youre careless with your checkbook or your signature if youre negligent then the bank doesnt have to cover a forged check its your own insurance company that has to pay which isnt going to happen unless theres a police report i tried to understand this so essentially hes taking a fortythousanddollar hit walking away is the government going to reimburse him now thats not likely ive been trying to get to talk to him which is not easy ill tell you go ahead eat i saw you looking at the sandwich you ever notice in restaurants if people are with somebody they look at their food more than at the other person if theyre not with somebody they watch people more than the food i said but ryan didnt say anything about the case being dropped i just talked to him about it at the hillside he probably didnt know his assistant told me he was working out of the office all thursday and friday on some administrative thing theres some big meeting next week about revamping accounting procedures in the department i recalled that ryan had mentioned an internal assignment of some sort she asked so does that cross the graham case off our primary list no just the opposite nobody ignores forty thousand dollars unless theyre being forced to i ate some more of my sandwich dunch or linner dubois was saying theres no meal in the afternoon corresponding to brunch she wasnt making a joke i asked your impressions of him of graham dubois considered upset evasive somebodys leveraging him to drop the case possible they dont make a lot of money the graham family without the forty k his kids not going back to princeton if that was me id go allout to nail the perp some scenarios unfolded in my mind okay the primary forges the check buys the gold and launders himself some cash he spends it on something compromisingdonation to a radical mosque a big coke buy prostitution who knows maybe fronts that hes graham the money can be traced back the primary says give me access to secure files or sabotage the system youre working on or i ruin your life forever and get you arrested graham agrees only ryans still on the case the primary hires henry loving to find out what he knows plausible dubois said now the other case the ponzi scheme her azure eyes framed by shiny dark hair now dipped to her notes id googled ponzi i knew a bit about the scams from the madoff thing of course you couldnt watch the news without learning something the theory was that a scam artist would pose as an investment advisor and take peoples money which he would claim to invest hed keep the money for himself but would send out statements reporting that the fund had increased in value if the early investors wanted to cash out the thief would pay them off with more recent investment moneya scam that works fine as long as not all the investors want their money at the same time they were usually discovered when customers got nervous and there was a run on the fund in the prisoners dilemma analysis of the depositors acting with rational irrationality dubois explained now the suspect clarence brown the mailorder reverend not exactly i checked his online church and online that was a new one yep mails not involved at all you can download and print out your divinity degree new zion church of the brethren dot com anybody can do it you could i could i wanted to see if it was as much of a scam as it seemed and i got halfway to being a priest well priestess i guess they wanted big money though and i logged off on her bracelet were cross star of david and islamic crescent charms a cat with an excessively arched back and a witchs hat too dubois was not easy to define go on claire hes a fake reverend but thats not the most interesting part what i found out is that clarence brown is an alias hes really ali pamuk he have a record dont think so nothing in the standard databases but ive got some friends looking into his history a little more closely im particularly interested in doingbusinessas records ive got to correlate social security number address phone records accounting statements sec filings id noted the reference to friends hardly an official us government designation for an investigator but however dubois was doing this it would be by the book you could break all the rules you wanted in bodyguarding your principalsmy job but the task of finding the primary required us to be cops like any other marshalling evidence and not giving the defense attorneys any windows through which the bird could escape any more details turkish father mother from nigeria both naturalized a few years ago he seems to have converted to christianity before he became a reverend but he contributed a lot of money to a mosque in virginia last year and the year before not on any watchlists hes kind of a player dubois said has that small place in the south east tenement sure but he also lives in the watergate which he doesnt talk about much state tells me hes been to dubai jeddah and jordan in the past two years this was a portrait very different from the one ryan kessler had uncovered thats helpful it was my highest compliment what about those smaller cases ryan was running the cop had dismissed these but id asked her to talk to chief of detectives lewis and check them out anyway oh the stolen credit cards dubois continued they were all pretty small most of them got pled out the identity thefts were bigger lowclass felonies most were pled the big one was some kids ordering electronics online they picked the wrong vica computer security expert with advanced circuit design one of intels big competitors the victim traced the perp and turned them in but they got off with probation and fines thats pretty neat somebody who got hacked got revenge by hacking in after the hackers rough justice i finished my sandwich reflecting some leads yes but nothing golden i was frustrated keep digging got my shovel both cases got my indian clubs i gave her a smile i hoped cat man treated her right flipping through my phone i jotted some information a few more things to look into i slipped the note to her and gave her some more instructions a priority i added sure ive got to get the kesslers to the safe house she rose hesitating i glanced at her a gaze of curiosity i heard at the flytrap loving got pretty close she fell into a rare bout of silence but there was nothing to talk about regarding the topic of my brush with mortality it was in the past and what might have happenedlovings death or minehadnt there were no lessons to be learned from it nothing for me to file away for future strategies nothing to impart to her speculation about the past is inefficient and therefore irrelevant to achieving your goal so i simply regarded her with a neutral gaze ill get right on these corte she said using my name for what i believed was the first time in all the years wed worked together chapter i collected garcias car to which billy had given a clean bill of surveillance health and i piloted it back onto the highway i made several bizarre but legal route changes and when i was convinced nobody was following me returned to the highway and drove toward the hillside inn at a little after pm i arrived at the motel and parked behind it once more in about the same spot as when id left several spaces down from the yukon i looked to the north and saw in the haze the distant hints of housing developments i was probably looking at two or three thousand people such a tiny sliver of the population in the county and a smaller portion yet of the region i couldnt help but think as i often did on a job that the lifter was out there somewhere but where how close thirty miles away lost in the same speculation about where the principals and i were or was he very close a mile or less with knowledge of our whereabouts and a clear strategy for killing the shepherds and kidnapping ryan kessler i returned to the room calling ahmad on the phone to announce my arrival we dont use secret knocks though it probably wouldnt be a bad idea he let me in and i got a cup of black coffee from the kitchenette the smell of roomservice foodonions and garlic mostlypermeated the air two plates one clean one picked over sat on a tray near the sink were going to be leaving soon for the safe house everyone was looking at me in anticipation and i realized that id left under mysterious circumstances but keeping with needtoknow i didnt explain about where id been just told them they should pack up anything theyd unpacked when we arrived while maree and joanne were doing this i pulled ryan aside hed had more liquor i could tell but he didnt seem any more inebriated than when id left weve found out something about the graham case he dropped the charges he did what the cop was surprised that doesnt make sense are you sure i told him i was he continued when i first interviewed graham he was furious about the forgery man has a temper ill tell you how was he going to pay for his kids tuition the boyd have to drop out all his dreams for his son were ruined he was practically bullying me to nail the perp and now this when did you talk to him last probably tuesday so something significant happened between then and yesterday thats when he dropped the charges right ryan said i was in meetings all day that accounting crap he thought for a moment so its looking like that could be the relevant case thats what im thinking something you found during the investigation could be a key to whoevers targeted him he sighed and said defensively its tough to get information about people like that the dod i mean they dont talk to us little guys i had an idea he wouldnt like what i was about to tell him nexta significant fact about his other investigation that he hadnt uncovered and the ponzi scheme yeah clarence brown is a fake name hes really ali pamuk i explained what claire dubois had found then added that she was continuing to look into his background but if ryan was upset that a federal government sleuth had uncovered more information than hed been able to find he didnt show it he was mostly confused by the turn the case had taken it seemed legal name change we dont know yet now is there anything that suggests youve uncovered facts in the investigation that somebody would want to have he lowered his head and looked over my shoulder i wondered at what his wife his sisterinlaw the armed guards his hidden bottle of wild turkey or makers mark im sorry corte no i cant think of anything ill keep looking ill keep thinking i glanced at my watch i wanted to get everyone up to the safe house i stepped outside and walked to the front desk recalling again who i was im frank roberts my company is artesian we do kickass computer software designing i smiled at the man behind the desk and said were going to be heading off id like to settle up sure thing mr roberts the man said he was fidgeting acting the way a clerk sometimes does when things werent going quite by procedure everything okay meaning why would you check out after just three or four hours oh its great as always we just needed the rooms for a sales meeting we finished up early and im taking the gang to a play downtown sure sure tough you gotta work on saturday well the companys paying for a night out so there you go i looked over the bill and noted that someone had ordered a bottle of wine with the food they got from room service ryan of course no one else seemed to be drinking i was a little irritated it was always a pain to get liquor expenses approved and didnt he have an entire bar in that backpack of his i thanked the clerk and i returned to the room when rudy garcia opened the door i glanced inside and saw maree laughing as she spoke to her sister i frowned as i examined the scene the women werent in the common living area they were in a bedroom to the side and i was watching them in the mirror i asked him did you get the kesslers and maree into the bedroom when the room service got here oh sure was the door open to the bedroom there he was looking back well i dont know i made sure they were out of sight i was grimacing from the reflection too the agent studied the mirror i oh shit did the bellboy act odd he was pretty nervous now that you ask i closed the door behind me and pointed ahmad to the back windows and garcia to the front without a word they drew their side arms and moved fast into defensive positions i swept the lights out throughout the room i called to joanne and maree bedroom lights out now a pause and then that room went dark too whats going on joanne asked alarmed stepping into the doorway i think lovings found us ands on his way or more likely i reflected he was already here chapter my mind had done something that occasionally happens when im playing certain types of games against a skilled opponent via instinct i understand exactly what their strategies are this usually occurs in games with whats called perfect information like chess or tictactoe perfect information means that all of a players past moveshis strategiesare accessible to his opponent both see every move made from the beginning of the game unlike the prisoners dilemma say which is a game of imperfect information since prisoner one doesnt know what prisoner twos choice will be for some reason at times all the past moves the opponent has made coalesce in my mind into a clear understandingfor me its almost a graphic or pictureand i know what his next strategy will be now the pieces falling into place were the clear view of my principals in the mirror the managers uneasiness in the front lobby a few minutes earlier the bellboys nervousness though i didnt know all the details i believed almost to a certainty that loving had posed as a law enforcement officer and sent faxes or emails to dozens of hotels and motels in the areamaybe the ones he felt might be good safe houses hed included a picture of ryan kessler claiming perhaps that he was a fugitive loving would have given a phone number and instructions to call but warned the managers not to take any action on their own in the event the suspect was spotted the manager would have shown the picture to the wait staff when the food was delivered to our room the employee would have gotten a glance in the mirror at ryan and probably seen the mans damn colt on his hip the manager wasnt fidgety because i was unhappy with the service and checking out early it was that two women and i were hostages of ryan kessler and the men with himtough unsmiling and dangerouslooking the big question as far as i was concerned was when exactly the manager had called loving ten minutes earlier we probably would be fine an hour loving was already nearby clear each of my colleagues reported in his own accent i called freddy he picked up at once corte we have a situation you just had one at the flytrap lovings on his way here the hillside inn i rattled off the address okay hold on im scrambling our peopleand prince william county too try them but ill bet hes going to call in a fake incident like he did in fairfax sure right just concentrate on getting your folks here fast i ignored the frantic looks my principals sent me as they threw together their personal items i did however gesture at ryan kessler to put his pistol away with that much liquor he could shoot his wife or me or himself thank god his weapon was a revolver which meant the trigger had a heavy pull i noticed him looking at me with a broad shrug and i realized his meaning isnt this what were supposed to be doing luring loving here and then taking him out like id told him earlier baitandswitch reluctantly he slipped the gun back into the holster freddy came back on the line cavalrys on the way eta probably twenty or thirty you going defense or rabbiting i dont know yet patch me through one of your public lines to the motel lobby here and dont mask it i want the clerk to see justice department or the bureau on caller id yeah hold i lose you call me back i dont know this technical shit as the people in the room gathered jackets and suitcases and my colleagues moved efficiently from window to window to door signaling that they spotted no threat i waited tensely listening to clicks on the line finally ringing hillside inn may i help you it was the man id spoken to before id just have to hope that he wouldnt recognize my voice i said briskly yessir this is special agent hugh johnston were following up on that report about the suspect at your motel i was just about to call back about that theyre fixing to leave so i was right a hostage came inmr roberts the clerk continued he looked pretty beat up hes been here before works for a company and they use our place some he paid tried to act like nothing was going on but its weird them checking out after only four or five hours or so im coordinating the rescue efforts i told him which agent did you speak to before said his name was special agent jonathan corte with an e my stomach did a little flip at lovings perverse sense of humor if that was what it was jonathan was his own middle name and i asked when did you call him exactly had to be fortyfive minutes ago just after benny got a look at the kidnapper when he delivered the food hes got a gun but i guess you know that you have to move fast theyll be leaving any minute all right now listen i said seriously the mo of this manyou know mo modus operandi the wife and i watch criminal minds his mo is that he sometimes leaves somebody behind to stop pursuers you understand what im saying i want you to try to keep everybody inside their rooms for the next hour or so i dont want any innocents caught in a cross fire god sure okay ill do what i can god i disconnected and rubbed my forehead as i debated considering the timing loving had heard fortyfive minutes ago that we were here he and his partner would have to rendezvous ditch the car loving had collected on the embankment near the flytrap theyd switch wheels which would take a little time but not much rock paper scissors defense or rabbit i thought for a moment okay were going now fast still clear garcia said peeking out through a splinter of window ahmad echoed him then ryan limped closer to me the skin around his drunken eyes crinkled corte come on we can take him we can do it theres four of us jesus christ were running from one man two joanne corrected his partner and he could have more ryan ignored her and said to me you just called for backup look its perfect he doesnt know we know about him hell walk into a trap get him in a cross fire i said no my job is to get you away im tired of running im tired of this crap fuck it corte you get joanne and maree out of here take em to that safe house ill stay him too he looked at ahmad who wore two weapons we dont do last stands ryan too many innocents therere always innocents around corte therere always excuses for not doing what you should ryan joanne snapped please im scared i calmly said this is not the time or place for a firefight its not the rational choice to engage implying the safe house were headed for is better honey she begged please with the obligatory look of disgust ryan grabbed his belongings fuck i gazed over ahmads shoulder into the courtyard of the hotel what troubled me were the dozens of black windows facing us across the parking lot and garden we would have to exit the suite turn to the left and traverse about fifty feet exposed to those windows before we got to the alley that would lead us behind the building where the yukon was parked i regarded the windows of those rooms facing us you couldnt open them but every hitter or lifter in the world knows the twoshot technique of firing through windowsfirst bullet aimed way off target into the sky or ground to take the glass out without letting your target know he or she is under fire and then the money shot a moment later still wed have to take the risk i knew the yukon was safe it had a security system that called the key fob in my pocket if somebody so much as breathed on the bumper i decided to break us up into separate groups that way loving or his partnera good shot i now knew from experiencecouldnt hit all of the personal security officers at once were going to the suv behind the building three groups garcia youre with maree ahmad joanne ryans with me in the air i drew a letter u on its left side explaining garcia you first out the door down the sidewalk to the left hold at the alley to the parking lot and cover us ahmad you next go all the way to the lot and hold there you cover the back roger well go next and cover your retreat to the lot i said to garcia her pretty jaw trembling maree looked like she was going to cry the flippancy was gone completely in many ways she was a child in a womans body ill start the suv remotely jump in and get your belts on okay now garcia and maree moved slowly along the sidewalk as i crouched in the doorway looking for threats i saw no obvious ones my phone buzzed freddy just for the record he tried the same thingfalse alarms prince williams had ten assaultinprogress calls just like you guessed i hadnt guessed i was learning lovings strategy but our guys are en route make it fifteen minutes now were leaving he found out about us fortyfive minutes ago hes got to be close by now i cant talk i disconnected garcia and maree were behind a pillar the agent scanning those black leering windows looking down on us the rooftops too ahmad went next with grimfaced joanne again clutching her purse to her chest and wheeling her suitcase they hurried past garcia and turned left down the alley to the parking lot i got a sign from garcia lets go i whispered to ryan i started one of the longest walks of my life i was close to ryan and knew that loving wouldnt risk killing him to take me out despite the partners skill as a sniper but they might have sprayed our legs and kept garcia and ahmad pinned down while they dragged ryan away but we joined garcia without incident and as i covered the troubling windows he and maree slipped to the back lot when theyd made it ryan and i moved out my pistol in one hand the key fob in the other i pressed the start button for the yukon i hadnt expected an explosion but i still felt relieved when there wasnt one we hurried forward and scrambled inside the vehicle belting up and locking the doors no incoming shots no diversionsscreams or collisionsto take our attention in ten seconds i was out of the space fast and we were heading around the back of the wing on the right of the motel the way wed come in i eased to the front and merged onto the main driveway which led to the highway via a hundred yards of winding asphalt i was trying to narrow down the time calculation to gauge how likely it was that loving was close i was angry with myself most shepherds used the twopart transport to get their principals to the ultimate safe house it makes senseto organize your escape to make sure nobodys following to change vehicles i reflected that my strategy however had backfired it was because of going to a public facility that loving had a lead to us if id driven right to our safe house wed be home free just as i often pretend to be a lifter to anticipate their moves i wondered if loving had stepped into my shoes compiling names of hotels thatd make good halfway houses maybe he had the same list we did but so far so good we were in an armored suv and my principals were unhurt no sign of loving most likely it had taken him longer than id thought to get here rolling farther along the drive i could see the highway eighty yards away then sixty fifty oh how i wanted to be on that road the hillside inn was a great place to be invisible and the suite wed taken was good for defense but here in front of the building were hedgerows and trees for cover and ponds to limit escape routes and a very serpentine drivepicturesque but hard to see in the dusk without headlights it was in short a great spot for an ambush forty yards from the road i rolled fast over a speed bump thirty yards ahead the driveway cut through a thick hedge eight feet high which separated the highway from the grounds i saw a nissan van waiting to make a left turn into the motel grounds from the far lane the driver was a woman and i could see a child belted in beside her not a threat but then i hit the brakes what ryan asked why isnt she turning i asked no one the woman had been waiting too long for oncoming traffic to pass before she made her left turn into the inns drive i could see in her windshield the flash of an oncoming cars turn signal that driver making a right turn into the inn would have the right of way but he wasnt turning then i saw the vague form of a man settling into the thick boxwood something in his hand a weapon thats why loving was pausing on the roadsomehow hed spotted us leaving the back of the motel and hed told his partner to climb out and flank us did i have time to get away before he aimed and fired i jammed the accelerator to the floor but as we leapt forward henry lovings black dodge avenger skidded to a stop before us blocking the drive i hit the brake pedal we faced each other an endless moment silence in the car silence outside then the partner hidden somewhere in the bushes opened fire as the tires on lovings car squealed to smoke and he sped directly toward us chapter i slammed the shifter into reverse a threepoint turn would have taken too much time i shoved the pedal to the floor i heard a jarring bang from the side of our vehicle as the partner continued to fire on us from the bushes but id moved just as he was pulling the trigger and the slug hit the sheetmetal not tires which was good runflats are impressive but theyre not indestructible another slam of a bullet on the body steel the sound was very loud unlike in the movies you never hear whining ricochets and you never see sparks a bullet is a piece of lead thats moving about three thousand feet a second you hear a big big bang when it hits your car and it usually stays where its sent and doesnt bounce around the neighborhood covering fire i ordered keep the partner down but visible hostiles or neutral targets only do not shoot blind everybody else stay down ryan was in the far backthere were three rows of seats in the carand garcia and the women in the seats just behind me garcia muzzle flash to your left got it he rolled down the window a few inches and began firing judiciously regulations prohibit us from discharging a weapon unless we have a clear target and there could possibly be bystanders nearby garcia shot toward where the partner had stationed himself in a thick stand of bush but was aiming only at a tree or the ground to keep the partner down while making sure no innocents were hit lovings car was pursuing us and still driving in reverse i called to ahmad next to me to target him but it was particularly difficult to do so because of the curvature of the driveway lined with trees i had to swerve wildly depriving my colleague of a clear shot another slug from the partners gun impacted the yukons side maree barked a brief scream her hand to her mouth eyes wide ryan was trying to open the rear windowwhich was sealed shut his revolver was in his hand but at least his finger was outside the trigger guard in fourwheel drive the yukon bounded backward churning up a nice cloud of dust my head spun around briefly glancing behind us through the front windshield i saw lovings car coming after us fast veering to avoid ahmads rounds i turned back again to look out the rear window in the direction we were speeding ahmad called lovings slowing his voice was calm garcia take your shot the fbi agent leaned over joanne who looked numb with fear her purse clutched to her chest he eased out the window the trees garcia called i dont have a clear shot ill do it ryan muttered ill get the fucker this brought joanne to life no honey please youve been drinking goddamnit im a better shot drunk than all of them put together he strained forward but we were saved from a confrontation because we hit a speed bump and he was knocked to the side thank god his weapon didnt discharge garcia leaned forward and fired in bursts of three with his handgun i couldnt tell if hed hit anything i couldnt be concerned with that now i had the yukon up to about forty in fourwheel reverse the transmission screaming and we were crashing over speed bumps and tearing the shrubbery apart a bullet thudded into the back of the yukon the fender or bumper one glanced off the windshield no glass broke it was resistant but not bulletproof depending on the jackets of the rounds so i was thankful thered been no direct hit on the windows though it made sense loving would not want to risk killing ryan then about ten yards from the motel a straight stretch loomed both of you i called to garcia and ahmad youll have clear targets in about five seconds go for the grille of the dodge take out the engine no the windshield ryan shouted i said nothing else not explaining that the rational move in a situation like this was to aim for a vital area of the car youd have to be very lucky to hit the driver but just as we leveled out loving ditched the lights and veered to the right the dodge skidded behind a bush beside a curve in the driveway and vanished over the lawn no target ahmad called calmly but i didnt slow i kept speeding backward my sweating hands clutching the wheel so hard my wrists were cramping garcia call fredericks let him know yessir he alerted freddy of the situation then disconnected and took up a defensive position again basically sprawled over joanne maree was huddled in the corner sobbing hold on watch your weapons i hit the next speed bump at close to miles per hour still in reverse we bounced into the inns courtyard and i continued on toward the back with a fast glance into the lobby where the panicked clerk was on the phone where i shouted loving where is he no sign ahmad called the gears were screaming now and the floorboard seemed to be hot reverse was not made for these speeds coming to the end of the drive i called big bump fingers off triggers and hold on without slowing we careened over the curb through the narrow gap wed just taken on foot ten minutes earlier in our three teams to get to the rear parking lot i destroyed a low row of bushes and then bounded onto a concrete patio that jutted into the parking lot sending the colorful lawn furniture sprawling over the asphalt glass from the tables shattered loudly i skidded the vehicle to the left and braked to a stop gasping for breath my shoulders ached running parallel to the motel on the other side of the parking lot was a sixfoot stockade fence to the left was a brick wall about four feet high to the right was the driveway wed just exited by and beyond that a small thicket of trees no no no maree was wailing were trapped whatre we going to do oh jesus youll be okay joanne said to her sister im so fucking scared stay on the alley the driveway and the trees i said to ahmad nodding to what wed just backed through and the small forest beyond garcia the brick wall yessir im on it shadow in the alley ahmad said somebodys coming in a car looks like now ryan called ram him hell be coming through there any second he thinks youre still going hit the gas i ignored him ahmad had opened his window further and was aiming his weapon toward the alley what are you going to do the urgent question came not from ryan as i might have thought but from his wife i didnt answer her either ahmad said shadows getting closer i glanced that way a car was slowly following our route along the path wed just torn along cautious its him ryan said the lightsre out ram him ram him garcia the brick wall stay with it yessir forget the fucking wall hes coming up the path between the buildings ryan blurted you can see it no hes not i said lovings forced somebody to drive their car up here slowly just like in fairfax he and the partner split up to flank us from the trees and from the brick wall ahmad take out the tire of the car that comes through the gap the driverll get spooked and stop then watch the driveway and those trees beyond it garcia the wall they acknowledged the orders the feint car hood edged slowly into view from the alley ahmad shot out the tire and immediately lifted his weapons muzzle staring past the vehicle cant see clearly but think theres somebody in the woods solo brick wall garcia called its lovings car theyre flanking us covering fire i shouted both directions mind innocents both men fired driving loving back the partner too vanished under cover in the woods theyre going to try again maree said still crying were trapped here now they knew we were ready for them i dropped the transmission into fourwheel low gear and turned directly toward the stockade fence whatre you doing maree gasped no well get stuck i nosed the yukon against the wood and a slight nudge the panel of fencing broke free i drove over it and into the farm field on the other side i ordered target the gap in the fence but dont fire unless youre sure its them therell be spectators now i was heading slowly down the hill toward a line of trees surprisingly it was joanne kessler who caught on you had that escape route planned you cut mostly through the fence posts so you could drive over it if you needed to when a couple years ago i pick all my halfway houses for escape as well as defensibility and i do a lot of work on the properties late at night the hillside inn people never knew id vandalized their fence i dont see anything ryan said not yet we rolled slowly down the hill slick with dew then through a series of soft dirt rows of recently harvested corn husks and stems you could measure the progress in feet but we were moving steadily still nobody ahmad said i ordered them to keep targeting the opening in the fence wed just eased through though i knew that loving would take one look at the ground we were traversing and know that his sedan couldnt possibly pursue us hed make the only rational decision he could to retreat as fast as possible chapter a half hour later we were on the highway again heading for the safe house it was a little after pm and id been driving a fast complicated and unpredictable route generally north though loudoun and fairfax counties in the back ryan kessler sat brooding looking through his canvas bag for ammo or booze joanne was quiet staring out the window maree calm finally fidgeted with a pacifier her computer she was coming out of her hysteria but hadnt yet returned to referring flippantly to me as a tour guide principals get terrified of course disoriented too and a little bit crazy i need the people in my organization to be percent with me my principals though if they can be or if they can do what i ask with a measure of promptness and intelligence im content a sizable portion of my task is fixing as many of their inevitable mistakes as i can and minimizing the principals more destructive foibles and habits which is not a bad philosophy of life id decided in fact this was a typical sampling of principals behavior from experience i found joannes numbness more worrisome than her husbands bluster and her sisters juvenile banter and hysteria principals like her could melt down suddenly and explosively and usually it happened at exactly the wrong time i glanced back in the mirror and my eyes met hers which were blank and unfocused and we simultaneously looked away now that i was comfortable that there were no tailsit would be purest coincidence that loving would find usi made the call hello the deep voice answered aaron my boss responded corte i heard from fredericks at the hillside inn he said you were okay i assumed you were on the run and i didnt want to call thanks this was one of his best attributes he might have no instinctive feel for shepherding but he understood how we operated and he accommodated his job to ours i said i havent talked to freddy yet any casualties there he answered no but its a mess they picked up a lot of brass mustve been forty fifty shots fired two slugs hit guest rooms with people inside i cant keep the lid on this one whatll it be loving gave us an out with the press believe it or not well springboard on what he said in his faxthat there was talk of a kidnapping and some organized crime involvement ill trot out bad hector i dont have much choice hector carranzo was a smalltime colombian drug figure who was named in a number of felony warrants both here and in various latin american countries the reports gave mixed descriptions and vague background but all included warnings of his dangerous nature and the admonition to be on the lookout for him anywhere in the country he was known to pop up unexpectedly he was also a complete fiction when we had a shootout like the one at the hillside inn under circumstances where we wanted to keep the truth quiet we blamed the incident on señor hector and possible drug or other illegal activity we have yet to identify with specificity after we collared the primary in the ryan kessler case ellis might come back in a few days with ooops we were wrong the real perp was actually soandso but bad hector would keep the press busy for a time were on the way to the safe house now good get there and stay there a pause i knew what hed say next we all want to get him corte but i want you to sit tight in the safe house no more attempts to engage loving hed be thinking of rhode island only the flytrap was offensive what happened at the hillside was pure defense we were trying to get away i understand that but there may be some issue raised of why you used a halfway in this situation why you didnt go directly to the safe house meaning i supposed was i subconsciouslyor perhaps very consciouslytrying to draw loving to us he wanted a reason but even though he was my boss i wasnt going to answer he caught this and continued it was your call and im not questioning it just telling you that the question could come up i told him if i do anything at all itll just be to help claire track down the primary fine he muttered ellis was having a tough saturday so he wasnt treading softly any longer you didnt call westerfield you said you would i will its been busy which though true sounded lame we disconnected and i was scrolling through numbers to find westerfields but then freddys name was recited on my audible caller id i clicked accept and asked you get anything at the hillside freddy said no trace he vanishedreal fast like houdini or the allowance i give my kids thin air aaron said no injuries right peoplere shaken up but so what life shakes you up nothing wrong with getting shook once in a while aarons handling the press therere more reporters than you can shake a stick at hell do what he can freddy added that the hostage loving had taken to coerce her husband to drive his car after us as a diversion was safe not that it mattered but she said she couldnt identify her kidnapper the husband got amnesia too i asked any indication which way loving went none we take out their dodge yup fan and a tire they left it fifty yards west where they had switch wheels hidden the abandoned one was clean and the new one no tire treads our boys and girls could find and you know them if theres a pubic hair theyll get it so was there a fax with ryans picture on it yep who was it supposed to be from you guys federal department of tax investigation i nearly smiled an outfit as phony as artesian computer design you had to hand it to loving i told him it said the typical dont try to apprehend just give a call if you see him and an eight hundred number prepaid mobile now deactivated i said freddy didnt need to confirm this what was the incoming fax number sent from a computer through a swedish proxy naturally freddy wondered howd he tip to the hillside specifically and send the fax there i think he went fishing sent faxes to dozens of possible halfway houses ill bet theyre sitting in front lobbies all over the area jesus he exhaled pronouncing the name with an initial h maybe he was worried about being sacrilegious i knew he went to church at least once a week this guys earning his fee what the hell does kessler know thats so friggin important just what claire dubois and i were going to find out in the next few hours i hoped then freddy got my attention asking you know somebody named sandy alberts he give you a call came to the office works for that senator from indiana or ohio stevenson i know who he is ohio whatd alberts want just asking questions about wiretaps patriot act so on and so forth got to say corte your name came up all happy cheerful good things but well like i said your name came up find that interesting interesting i reflected glumly and no and i told him i was busy had to go thanks i muttered for what im not sure we disconnected and i considered alberts visit to freddy then i decided i could no longer delay the inevitable i scrolled down and found westerfields number hit send the man answered on the second ring my heart sank id been hoping for voice mail corte he said and didnt slip into french listen we need to talk but im in with the ag right now he was sitting in the us attorney generals office on saturday night and hed taken my call ill get back to you when were through this number yes you have an alternate no click i pulled off onto a side road and stopped maree gasped and looked up alarmed her psychic pendulum still on the hysterical side joanne slipped from her coma long enough to say to her its okay itll be okay whyre we stopping the younger woman asked her voice on edge i said just checking the car we took some hits ryan began scanning the dark roadside like a sniper for prey ahmad climbed out of the back and joined me and we inspected the yukon carefully it wasnt badly damaged from the shootout or the rough escape the suv was doing better than my back was as we checked the tires i glanced up and saw joanne still in the back seat look at her watch and place a call it was to amanda from the conversation which i could hear through the open door it seemed everything was fine she caught my eye again then lowered her head and continued the call she was struggling to be animated as her stepdaughter apparently pelted her with a report of her day in the country ryan took the phone and his face softening also had a conversation with the girl parents and children for a moment some of those memories id had earlier surfaced some childrens faces among them memories i didnt want i put them away sometimes i was better at that than others tonight they vanished more slowly than usual i got back inside and when the door slammed ryan spun around startled and gripped his gun i tensed for a moment but he oriented himself and relaxed my lord did he want to shoot everybody as i started to drive my phone buzzed and the caller id voice announced a number i recognized as the justice department my finger hovered over the accept button i didnt press it the call went to voice mail and i steered the yukon back to the main road chapter more dark winding routes nobody was behind us unless he was driving without lights which was possible thanks to the new night vision systems but the way i was drivingfast then slow occasionally abrupt stops sharp turns down roads that i knew well but i doubted loving wouldleft me convinced that no one was following after forty minutes i hit route briefly then georgetown pike and took it to river bend road then bypassing downtown great falls i took a series of tangled roads and streets on which gps was helpful but not definitive finally after a drive through dense woods during which we passed no more than three housesthree very large houseswe arrived at the safe house compound separated from the road by a sevenfoothigh stockade and farther along sixfoot chainlink fences the compound had a sevenbedroom main house two outbuildingsone of them a panic facilityand two large garages as well as a barn complete with a hayloft the grounds were nearly ten acres of rolling fields bordering the potomac river the turbulent part the narrows where there is indeed a series of falls and rapids though great falls is by anyones estimation exaggerated modest but picturesque would be a better name the property had been a bargain you cant be in any government service nowadays without being aware of the bottom line in the nineties the compound had been the residence of chinese diplomats a retreat from the embassy downtown it was also the fbi had learned where the peoples republic secret police regularly met their runners and agents whod been collecting information from contractors and lowlevel government workers and taking pictures of the nsa the cia and other unmentionable facilities in langley tysons and centreville most of the work it was learned was commercial property theft rather than defense secrets but it was politically naughty not to mention illegal when the chinese got busted the delicate negotiations involved an agreement that the diplomats and fake businessmen would leave the country without prosecution and in exchange the government would get the house and some other nondisclosed treats the property was used by a number of agencies as a hideaway until abe had grabbed it for us about eight years ago the large brownpainted nineteenthcentury house itself had been retrofitted with all the accoutrements of modernday security that we could afford which wasnt as hightech or sexy as people might expect there were sensors on the fence though they would deter only people who didnt know about sensors on fences the grounds themselves werent monitored everywhere though at key approaches not necessarily the obvious ones there were weight sensors buried in the dirt of course the whole place was amply covered by video cameras some obvious some not id activated an employee what we call spectators or specs that morning to begin monitoring the place ours sit in west virginia in a dim room and watch tv screens all day long andthough they dont admit itlisten to really loud music usually headbanging they can do so because our cameras arent miked that takes too much bandwidth someday well be able to afford both and the specsll lose their sound tracks but for now its silent movies of the compound and def leppard coming from the speakers i called the spec assigned to us and he answered immediately were here i said though he knew that since hed been watching us for the past five minutes it was quiet he reported hed seen nothing suspicious wherere the deer where the deer should be because of this job and some other aspects of my life ive learned a lot about wildlifefor instance what intimidates deer and other animals and why ive told my specsand protégésalways to watch for patterns of animal behavior that might give away clues as to intrusion id actually lectured on this at professional conferences an uneasy badger saved the life of one of my principals a year ago alerting us to a hitters presence no funny business with nearby traffic either was the specs twangy comment id never met the man but i had some impressions given his residence in the mountains of west virginia his accent and his taste for heavy metal how could i not i thanked him and punched in the code to the front gate which swung open and a nearly invisible but impressive tire strip receded into the ground we headed through the stockade fence and up the winding drive which was about a hundred feet long garcia and ahmad were looking around carefully as were maree and the still alert ryan kessler who i believed had snuck a drink or two joanne glanced out the window as if she were looking at a monthold magazine in a doctors waiting room i parked and we got out beside the front doorlooking like wood but reinforced steeli opened a panel and typed on the keypad below a small lcd screen the program confirmed via motion sound and thermal sensors that the house was completely unoccupied it can identify a beating human heart but wont bother me with the sound of a river rat nosing about for food or the water heater coming to life i unlocked the door and stepped inside then temporarily disabled the alarm it would reactivate once we were inside and then would lock though there was a panic button that would allow anyone inside to open it in the event of fire or intrusion the same was true of most windows which otherwise would open only six inches i got the lights on and the heat goingthe temperature had dippedand then i booted up our bank of security monitor screens which mirrored the ones in west virginia next the secure computer server i checked to see that the shielded landlines were working finally i verified that the generators were armed theyd come on automatically if an intruder cut the main line i showed the principals briefly around the musty ground floor oh neat maree said striding up to a number of old sepiatinted photographs on the wall ignoring shelves of books and magazines and yes board games though not ones id donated looking at the younger sisters giddy expression i tried to recall when id had a principal who could so quickly forget that shed been part of a shootout an hour earlier never i decided i explained about food beverages the tv like a bellboy i took the kesslers to their room on this floor in the back maree to hers next to it the young woman seemed impressed youre redeeming yourself mr tour guide she said she offered me a dollar as a tip a joke i guessed i didnt know how to respond and so i ignored the odd gesture she offered another pout ahmad garcia and i would sleep in shifts with two guards always awake and on duty the shepherds bedroom was a small one on the ground floor between the front door and the bedrooms for the principals i knew the layout of the compound and the safe house perfectly and ahmad whod never been here had studied the place id tested him several timesmost recently a month agoand i knew that he was familiar with the layout i had him brief garcia and i explained to the fbi agent about the com system and the weapons locker i gave him the combination to the lock inside there wasnt much some h ks and m bushmasters tripped to fully auto sidearms and flashbang grenades like the sort that wed used against loving at the flytrap with my principals now safely inside their fortress i walked into the den which i used as my office sat at the ancient oak desk and booted up my laptop i plugged it and my phone into the wall socket in the personal security business there are many important rules abe had recited but high on the list never miss a chance to recharge batteries or use the bathroom id done the former i now did the latter walking into the front bedroom i washed my hands and face in the hottest water i could stand and checked the scrapes and bruises from the pursuit of loving at the flytrap nothing serious though my back ached like hell from the jarring escape in the yukon at the hillside inn i walked through the house checking sensors and making sure all the software and com systems were working i felt like an engineer personal security is a stateoftheart profession it has to be since the bad guys know all the toys and have seemingly unlimited budgets to buy them although as youd think with somebody who prefers board to computer games im not inherently high tech i nonetheless made sure we too had the latest gadgets explosives sniffers as small as a computer mouse which they resemble highdensity carbonfiber detectors for nonmetallic firearms audio sensors that can alert us to the sounds of an automatic weapon slide slamming a round into the chamber or the click of a revolver cocking microphones that will reassemble conversations from vibrations on the other side of the wall communications jammers gps signal reorienters that will send the car following you right off the road i always carried in my breast or hip pocket a video camera disguised as a pen it was linked to software whose algorithms alerted me that the body language of a person approaching was consistent with that of an impending attack i also used it to record crowds in public when i was transporting principals to see if faces of passersby in one locale turn up in another a second pen is actually a wireless signal detector to sweep for bugs there was even what we call a mail box its about a foot square and unfolded explosively outward when it heard a detonation of an ied shooting a kevlar and metal meshlike knights chain mailupward to intercept as much shrapnel and blast force as possible sometimes these devices worked and sometimes they didnt but you do whatever you can to get an edge over your opponent abe fallow used to say that edge could be microscopic but often that was enough i returned to my computer and downloaded several emails that dubois had sent i was sending replies when i sensed a presence i looked up and saw the kesslers in the kitchen i heard cabinets opening the refrigerator door this facility does have a bar which separated the dining room and kitchen but its stocked only with sodas in the kitchen our facilities person usually has some wine and beer although we cant drink on duty of course we try to keep our principals as comfortable as possibleand more important try to give them little to complain about ryan limped to the bar and poured some coke into a glass that was already half full of amber liquid joanne got a sierra mist you want something in it i heard him ask she shook her head his shrug said suit yourself he glanced into the den and saw me looking at them he turned and walked back to the bedroom i returned to my computer reviewing the encrypted efiles dubois had sent me she was responding to several of my various requests that day and assured me that she expected to have more details about ryans two relevant cases there was some more research i needed to doby myself i logged into a secure search engine we userouting my requests through a proxy in asia the information came back instantly i wasnt looking for classified material but simply perusing the general media for a half hour i read through hundreds of pages of news stories and op ed pieces mostly finally i had a portrait of the object of my search senator lionel stevenson was a twoterm senator a republican from ohio hed been in congress before that and a prosecutor in cleveland before running for office he was a moderate and respected on both sides of the aisle as well as in the white house judiciary committee for four years now intelligence he was the one whod hammered together a coalition to get just enough votes in the senate for the supreme court nominee one politician was quoted as saying of stevensons efforts that was tough work building supporteverybody seems to hate everybody else in washington nowadays too much screaming in congress too much screaming everywhere he made visits to veterans administration hospitals and schools back in ohio and in and around dc he was part of the washington social scene and was seen in the company of younger womenthough unlike some of his colleagues that was not a problem since he was unmarried he was supported by political action committees lobbyists and campaign fundraising organizations that had never run afoul of the law he was considered one of the icons in what was being called the new republican movement which because of its moderate stance was converting democrats and independents and looked likely to win solid majorities in upcoming state and federal elections maybe the most significant thing i found were his remarks delivered at a community college in northern virginia a few months ago while in many ways a fervent lawandorder advocate stevenson nonetheless said government is not above the law it is not above the people it is bound by the law and it serves the people there are those in washingtonthere are those in every statewho think that rules can be bent or broken in the name of security and attaining a greater good but there is no greater good than the rule of law and politicians prosecutors and police who would turn a blind eye toward the will of our founders are no better than common bank robbers or murderers the reporter stated that these remarks earned stevenson a standing ovation from the hall full of future voters other articles observed that this philosophy had cost him votes at home from republicans and occasional enmity from fellow gopers in congress which told me that his motive for the upcoming hearings on government surveillance was rooted in ideology not winning votes i continued to scroll through the voluminous material jotting a note or two i felt at sea doing this and again i envied claire dubois her research skills this however was not an assignment i would give to her i glanced up to see joanne stepping into the doorway between the kitchen and living room leaning against the jamb her stern handsome face a bit less numb than before i saved the pages in an encrypted file and typed a command to bring up the passwordprotected screensaver i stared at the monitor for a moment the images of chess pieces appearing and dissolving as i reflected on what id just learned about stevenson then i rose and walked to the doorway nodding to joanne the inside of the safe house was surprisingly cozy many women principals fell in love with it a few men too when a lifter or hitter is after you the nesting instinct swells fast like a helium balloon at hallmark id even come downstairs once to find my principals had rearranged the furniture another time to my horror a couple had swapped the drapes between two rooms presumably standing in full view of naked windows to do so the comfort made this my favorite safe housenot for my personal ease but professional my principals felt less agitated and that made my life easier joanne picked up the remote asking me okay sure she turned on the tv perhaps to see if wed made the news we had albeit anonymously possibly gang related the announcer said referring to the shootout at the hillside inn then the story was gone replaced by snippets on the orioles chance in the playoffs a suicide bombing in jerusalem a statement by the supreme court nominee urging that the demonstrations in front of the capitol both for and against him remain peaceful thered been some incidents of spitting and hurling bottles i gave him my silent thanks for helping mask my transit to the flytrap joanne sat staring at the screen clasping her soda firmly her fingers separated as she tucked a strand of limp dark blond hair away she still had her purse over her shoulder the comfort of the familiar out of the blue she looked at me and said as if continuing a conversation wed been having all along hes frustrated ryan very frustrated hes guilty about bringing this on us and when he gets guilty he doesnt know how to handle it he gets angry dont take it personally she might have been referring to his biting comment that he was a better shot than me and the others protecting him or to his implication that we were cowards afraid to engage loving i understand i did hes never quite recovered from the deli shooting i dont mean the wound the limphes okay with that most of the time i mean the psychology how it affected him he had to move to a desk he loved working the street thats what his father did in baltimore after ryan moved to financial crimes his father seemed to lose respect for him i remembered that both of his parents were dead and i wondered what the relationship between father and son had been toward the end my own father had died young it was always a regret that i had been too busy to make it to the birthday party that had turned out to be his last a regret too that because of his death he hadnt been at my sons first joanne continued he does his job but his hearts not in it now theyve saddled him with that administrative work she paused they know about the drinking he thinks he covers it up he doesnt you cant i reflected that i too would find it hard to give up what i do and not be able to play my games against people like henry loving not to be with my principals but i didnt tell joanne this of course i always have to be on guard against sharing things with the people in my care its not professional they might spill something about youif they were captured by a lifter or if they talked to the press theres another reason too principals and their shepherds are going to part ways thats as sure as the seasons its better not to form any connection minimize the risk of emotional hurt this is why abe fallow told us to refer to them as my principals only keep them anonymous corte this is a twodimensional business you have to be a cardboard cutout of a person thats how you have to look at them learn only what you need to learn to keep them alive dont use their names dont look at their kids pictures dont ask em if theyre all right unless youve been dodging bullets and you need to call a medic but the irony is that principals love to talk to us shepherds oh do they want to share partly its the presence of mortality that puts them in a talkative mode confessional often theyve done some things wrong in their liveswho hasnt of courseand they want to assuage the guilt by talking more important though im no threat im in their lives for twelve hours or fortyeight or at the most a few weeks i go away at the end of that time and will never be in a position to repeat the secrets to their friends or loved ones so i listen and i nod without being particularly encouraging and i make no judgments whatsoever part of this is calculated of course the more they depend on and trust me the more theyll do exactly what i tell them toinstantly and without question joanne glanced at my computer though id turned the screen so she couldnt see it she asked which of ryans cases do you think it is my associates investigating them now at ten oclock saturday night i nodded ryan doesnt talk to me about his job much youd think itd be pretty obvious whos the what did you call it the primary thats it yes you mean to warrant hiring somebody like henry loving thered have to be a lot at stake yes true but sometimes you never know ive had plenty of assignments where the identity of the primary was a big surprise maree appeared poured herself a glass of wine and walked up to us i asked the room okay very martha stewart mr tour guide old paintings of horses tons of horses they have skinny legs fat horses and skinny legs i wonder if they really looked like that back then you think theyd fall over a lot joanne smiled at thisan observation worthy of claire dubois maree then asked how do i go online i need to check email im afraid you cant oh not the spy stuff again please can i beg she said this with that teenagers coy glint in her eyes her lips of course pouted admirably sorry why not we have to assume lovings found your account if you read messages or send any its possible for him to correlate time with router and server traffic in the area here corte do you look four ways before crossing the street mar joanne chided really oh puhlease i said just taking precautions i regarded her serious expression and nodding head whats wrong if i cant get my masseur here then somebody owes me a massage say mr tour guide is that in your job description i must have been staring at her blankly she said you dont joke much do you maree her sister said sternly give it a rest seriously she said to me id just like to send a few emails ive got to get some images to a gallery for a show if its really important i can encrypt it send it to our central communications department and we could route it through some proxies in asia and europe is that a joke no so other people would read it yes three or four and me then i think ill just opt for the exciting alternative of going to bed she turned defiantly and vanished down the dim corridor joanne watched her sister walk away marees slim hips shifting under the wispy skirt as she took steady almost flirtatious strides whats she taking i asked joanne hesitated wellbutrin anything else maybe an ativan or two or three and nothing else she needs a prescription for she never got insurance so i see her medical bills because i pay for them howd you know i told her language some of her behavior i found out about her hospitalizations there were two right joanne barked a cautious laugh you know about those my associate looked into anything that might be relevant suicide attempts thats what i deduced from the report joanne nodded the doctor said more of a gesture than an attempt shed been dumped by her boyfriend well not even a boyfriend theyd only gone out for six months or so but she was ready to move in have his babies you know the drill i imagine her voice faded and she was looking me over as if maybe i didnt know the drill ryan had probably told her i was a single man with no children she continued a note a little overdose the second time same thing a bit worse different man i wish shed get as obsessed about going to therapy as she gets about lovers i glanced up the hall and then asked softly was it andrew who hurt her i tapped my arm joannes eyelids fluttered youre good she shook her head to be honest i dont know he has hurt her in the past he put her in the hospital once she claimed it was an accident they always do that abuse victims or she says it was her fault this time she was pretty convincing that some guy knocked into her but i just dont know and the forwarded mail she broke it off with andrew and moved in with you joanne caught her reflection in an old scabby mirror and looked away thats right andrews got a lot going for him hes talented hes handsome and he thinks my sisters talented or at least he tells her she is but hes also jealous and controlling he convinced her to quit her day job and move in with him that lasted a couple of months he was mad at her all the time but when she moved out he got even madder thank god we were in the area she had someplace to go when she bailed maree whod been born marie and never officially changed her name dubois had learned also had been the subject of some runaway reports filed with local police when she was in her teens and a few drug and shoplifting charges which had been dropped it seemed the boys she was with had coerced her to join them theyd tried to set her up to take the fall none of this was relevant to my job or to the conversation we were having though and i said nothing about it so you do your homework do you for the job yes after a moment joanne who didnt seem to joke anymore than i did gave me a brief smile whatd you find out about me i wasnt sure how to answer duboiss research on joanne had revealed a thoroughly unremarkable life shed been a responsible student grad student statistician and homemaker she was on the pto at amandas school the only incidents that rose above or descended below the four decades of routine were in themselves not unusual for instance a backpacking trip abroad before grad schoolthe high point of her younger days i imaginedand a serious auto accident years ago that required some months of physical therapy i found out that youre the one i dont have to worry about the smile dissolved joanne held my eye youd make a good politician corte good night chapter at pm after making rounds inside the house i stepped outside and settled into a nest of fallen leaves i began scanning the property with a xenonics supervision night vision monocular theyre very expensive but the best on the market we could afford only three in the department and id checked out the last one earlier today this was normally the work done by a clone but i believed that even we shepherds should get our hands dirty on the job regularly abes philosophy of coursea belief you could say that killed him i was concentrating on looking for anything that seemed out of the ordinary i found my shoulders in a knot i was breathing hard i began reciting silently to myself rock paper scissors rock paper scissors lulled by the flow of moon shadows from the slowly moving clouds i began to relax after forty minutes my fingers numb and arm muscles shivering from the chill i headed inside in the shepherd bedroom i unsnapped my royal guard holster and took a bottle of drawez from my gym bag i massaged some of the gel into the naturalcolored leather now tanned as a beloved baseball glove the smooth side fit against my skin the rough facing outward i didnt really need to work on the leatherive timed my draws and theyre acceptablebut i found it relaxing when i was through i took care of business in the bathroom and then rolled into the lumpy old bed blinds drawn of course though the odds of a shooter emerging from the glorious line of old oaks to pump a round into the room were pretty slim the window though was open a crack and i could hear the faint unfurling sound of the wind and the softer rustle of the water over the falls a half mile away im lucky because i can sleep almost anywhere nearly on command which ive learned is particularly rare in my job not surprisingly my principals suffer from insomnia i knew id doze off soon but at the moment i was pleased to lie in bed fully clothed though minus shoes and stare at the ceiling i was thinking whod lived in this house originally it had been built around i supposed it had been a farmhouse with much of the land devoted to oats corn barleystaples not the designer crops you see nowadays i had an amusing image of a workingclass nineteenthcentury family kicking off supper with an arugula and spinach salad though the property hosted ten thousand trees now i knew the vista back then from mathew bradys and others photographs much of what was now woods in northern virginia had been open agricultural land around the time of the civil war great falls had been occupied early by the union army this area wasnt the scene of any major battles though nearly four thousand troops met briefly at what was now route and georgetown pike in december resulting in about fifty dead and two hundred wounded it was considered a union victory though most likely because the confederates saw no strategic point in occupying an area where they werent greatly supported and they simply walked away more than any other area in the commonwealth of virginia great falls had been a place of mixed sympathies those favoring the union and those the confederacy were often neighbors here brother against brother was not a cliché i knew this from reading historyanother one of my degreesthough ive also learned a lot about world affairs and conflict from playing board games i enjoy those games that recreate famous battles which are almost exclusively of american design the europeans prefer economic and socially productive games the asians abstract but americans love their combat among the games i have are battle of the bulge gettysburg dday the battle of britain the siege of stalingrad rome some people ive met through the gaming community shunned them claiming they were disrespectful but i believed the opposite was true that we honor those who died in the service of their country by remembering them however we can besides who wouldnt admit that rewriting the past has a deep appeal i once utterly defeated the japanese military at a game based on pearl harbor in my world the pacific campaign never happened my thoughts kept returning to the family whod lived here when the house was new it had been a large clan i assumed many children were the rule then the seven bedrooms could easily have accommodated the offspring plus an older generation or two that always appealed to me generations living together an image from the past of peggy and her mother and father i realized now that in appearance and because of her quirky side maree reminded me of peggy none of marees darkness of course or the irritations and unsteady nature mr tour guide peggy had once called me a bad boy but it happened after i realized wed been given a large order of fries at mcdonalds instead of the regular and i said lets sneak out without telling them more memories i didnt want i stretched feeling the pain in my calves and joints from the pursuit of henry loving at the flytrap and in my back from the retreat at the hotel i forced myself to play a few mental rounds of the chinese game weichi against an invisible opponent i sometimes imagine to help me banish unwanted thought then i decided it was time to sleep and rolled over on my side in two minutes i was out sunday players do not always take alternate turns to move their armies instead a deck of battle cards determines which player moves next and which of his units can move and attack no one knows whose turn will be next until the top battle card on the deck is flipped over in this way the play sequence remains a mystery from the instructions to the board game battle masters chapter doing nothing its not such a problem for us shepherds were used to it were like airline pilots whose life is routine percent of the time we expect this andthough we train for the rare moments of action to avoid calamitywe understand that most of our lives on the job will pass in a waiting state ideally so at least but for our principals time spent in a safe house often becomes a nightmare theyre plucked from their active lives and have to spend hour after hour in places like this cozy though they may be unable to work unable to pursue projects around their houses unable to see friends few phone calls no email even tv is unsatisfying the programs remind them of the world that exists outside their prison fading reruns of our existence they may never see again frivolous shows both drama and comedy that mock the tragedy theyre living through doing nothing one consequence of which is that they often opt for the oblivion of sleep theres no reason for principals to wake early at sunday morning i was sitting in the den at the desk where id been since five when i heard the snap of a door opening and creaks in the floorboards i heard the voices of ryan and joanne saying good morning to lyle ahmad making small talk he gave them details about coffee and breakfast i sent some more emails and then rose stretching the night had passed in peace and a new spec in west virginia told me in a deeper voice though with a twang identical to that of his associate that scans of the property had revealed nothing of concern a car had driven by at midnight but it was taking a route that was logical for a local returning from dinner in tysons corner or the district in any case our gps had measured his speed and he hadnt slowed as much as one mile per hour when he passed which took him off the threat list according to our algorithms i joined the kesslers in the kitchen and we exchanged greetings sleep well i asked well enough yeah ryan was blearyeyed he was moving slowlybecause of the limp and perhaps a hangover he wore jeans and an izod shirt purple with his belly hanging over the belt buckle he still wore his weapon joanne was in jeans too and a black tshirt under a floral blouse in a round compact mirror she inspected her lipstickthe only makeup she was wearingthen put it back in her purse ryan said hed talked to amanda for a long time earlier and everything seemed okay at carters place the girl had enjoyed fishing yesterday and theyd had dinner with neighbors last night a barbecue id called bill carter too that morning i told the kesslers this and added he said there hasnt been anything suspicious just that your daughter was still bothered about missing school tomorrow and her game and some volunteer job a student counseling hotline ryan explained she practically runs the place knowing what i did about the girl now i wasnt surprised lets hope she wont have to miss anything joanne said it was still early on sunday if we got loving and the primary soon the kesslers lives could return to a semblance of normality by suppertime what do we do today ryan asked looking outside id seen golf clubs in the garage and i guessed hed miss what might be a warm fall day on the links you just relax i said i couldnt help but think of claire dubois whod once commented to me as we were flying to florida to collect a principal the pilots always say that now just sit back and relax and enjoy the flight what options are there do handstands in the aisles open a window and feed the birds the kesslers too had no options i knew they werent going to like my further instructions which i now delivered that they had to stay inside inside ryan muttered peeking out through a slit in the curtain at a band of sun on leaves just beginning to color he sighed and knifed butter onto an english muffin doing nothing my phone rang and i glanced at caller id excuse me i headed back to the den clicking answer claire ive got some information go ahead her youthful voice offered enthusiastically the electronic trackers thiss interesting theyre made by mansfield industries the small tracker has a range of six hundred yards the big one a thousand that sounds impressive but theyre older models the new trackers like the ones we use are gps and satellite based so you can sit in your office and track the ones planted on you were cheap that means theyre used by police departments yes that was interesting and the model numbers are the same used in the mpd ryan kesslers employer serial numbers i asked but she said no serial numbers so we dont know the specific source prints or trace evidence on them none i considered this information a principal who was a detective and hardware that might have come from the same police department he worked for another piece of the puzzle i asked graham the department of defense employee whose checkbook was stolen the man whod surprisingly dropped the charges her voice lost its lilt as she said okay about that didnt sound good what i think i may need some help go on a teeny problem an adjective i never quite got she continued i was researching and making some headway i found that the chief of detectives lewis right cod lewis got a call from somebody powerful thats a quote though i have no idea what somebody powerful means it sounds like what a scriptwriter would say when hes describing a bad guy the nefarious character anyway this power person had lewis make sure the case wasnt being pursued somebody from the pentagon i dont know then i got some numbers graham makes ninetytwo thousand a year his wife fiftythree they have a sixhundredthousanddollar mortgage and two daughters in college in addition to their son stuart the girlsre going to william and mary and vassar their collective tuition is about sixty thousand a year room and board probably not too bad i mean with all respect to williamsburg and poughkeepsie you ever been there either of them no i considered this so the stolen forty thousand is a bigger hit for him to swallow than we thought huge i was thinking about when i went to duke my folks saved every penny they could for my tuition itd take something disastrous for them to give up and doom me to a career of memorizing specials of the day you mentioned a problem teeny actually claire dubois came in a quirky packageher dancing mind her bizarre observationsbut she was in her way as much a competitor as i was and it was hard for her to admit defeat especially if shed made a mistake which was what i sensed had happened i got this idea because of his clearance graham would have had to take a lie detector test all government employees with security clearances have to do this regularly some organizations have their own polygraphist the dod usually relies on the fbi so i called up a friend at the bureau to find out graham was scheduled to take one last week but he called the field office and said he was staying home he had a bad cold they dont let you take the exam if youre on medication so it was postponed until next month you checked login records at the pentagon exactly graham didnt stay home when he said he had and nobody got the impression he was sick he lied to avoid the test good thinking go on apparently somebody in records let him know id been looking into it graham got my name he called he wasnt happy it wasnt the best outcome i agreed id rather that graham had been kept completely in the dark about our investigation but i still wasnt sure why dubois seemed so upset then she explained i figured as long as i was blown i may as well interview him see what he had to say about withdrawing the complaint he got um uncooperative actually pretty insulting he called me young lady which i dont really like i was sure not he told me kind of rrated where i could put my warrant warrant how did a warrant come up thats sort of the problem i threatened to serve him for what i couldnt see any scenario in which a warrant made sense i made it up i just got mad the way he was talking i said if he wasnt going to answer my questions id go to a magistrate get paper and serve him to force him to talk i was silent for a moment lesson time claire theres a difference between bluffing and threatening with a threat you have something to back it up with a bluff you dont we threaten we dont bluff i was sort of bluffing i guess okay i said where is he now his caller id put him at home fairfax im sorry hes stonewalling now young lady tell you what meet me at the hyatt in tysons a half hour okay after disconnecting i joined ryan kessler at a table in the living room poring over documents i told him about the trackers that lovings partner had slipped into my wheel wells they were from the department he asked surprised we couldnt source them but theyre the same model numbers the metropolitan police buys fact is we never use them ryan said theyre great in theory but thats not how most tails work reception gets screwed up the signals get crossed mostly we put em in buymoney bags if theres a lot of cash and were afraid of losing it but you can also get them from almost any security gadget company anybody in the department you can think of who might be monitoring the graham or clarence brown cases or one of your smaller ones somebody inside working with loving impossible we dont do that cops dont do that to each other i said nothing though i thought people will do anything to anybodyif the edge is right i returned to my computer and not wanting him to hear my request wrote an email to dubois giving her another item on her growing todo list she acknowledged it garcia and ahmad were making rounds i told them i was leaving for a while to continue investigating who the primary was i stepped outside to the detached garage and opened the door inside was a honda accord registered to a fictional resident of arlington virginia billyd made some modifications to itrunflats better horsepower and a bit of armorbut it was still pretty much off the shelf i started the car and drove out of the compound cruising through the tunnel of leaves and branches glowing in the sun i was about ten minutes from the safe house when the phone buzzed i recognized westerfields number id forgotten my promise to aaron about keeping the prosecutor up to speed so i answered i shouldnt have chapter corte youre on speaker here with me and chris teasley okay ive talked to the attorney general and hes agreed to move the kesslers into a slammer in the districthansen detention all because i hadnt returned his call seemed a little excessive i see why chris teasley came on she said um agent corte officer corte i corrected my organization is an office not a bureau or an agency when congress gave abe the money thats what he created officer corte she continued i backgrounded you she sounded uneasy i was close to twice her age i concentrated on driving and looking for a tail which shepherds do automatically all the time even when we go grocery shopping but i didnt expect to be followed and i saw nothing go on its routine in cases like this she said quickly so i wouldnt think i was being persecuted one thing that came up an operation you ran in newport rhode island two years ago ah so that was it i have the whole report of the investigation here she kept pausing as if giving me the chance to confirm or deny i remained silent the assignment involved you and two associates from your organization guarding several witnesses from the same man involved in this case henry loving she paused again i wondered if westerfield was testing her the way i test dubois and ahmad and my other protégés its easy to do research its hard to aim it at somebody and pull the trigger apparently teasley wasnt firing fast enough her boss took over corte let me read this it was alleged that agent corte the justice departments internal affairs division had gotten the job title wrong too not many people know about our organization had a conflict of interest in running the kowalski protection assignment endangering the two witnesses in his care although a half dozen personal security professionals within three government agencies stated that standard procedure would have been to secrete the two witnesses in protective custody in the providence rhode island federal penitentiary agent corte chose not to do so but to keep the witnesses first in a motel and then to transfer them to a safe house outside of newport rhode island im familiar with the report i told him braking hard for a lazy deer but he continued to read the result was that henry jonathan loving whod been hired to kidnap and extract information from the witnesses injured a local police officer and a bystander he came close to successfully kidnapping at least one of the witnesses in question during the investigation into the handling of said matter it came to light that loving was the same individual who had murdered agent cortes superior abraham fallow the director of its redacted and a personal friend of agent cortes the conclusion of the investigating panel was that agent corte motivated by personal revenge chose not to put the witnesses in question into the federal detention center but rather kept them in public with full knowledge that loving would attempt to kidnap them there he in effect used the witnesses as bait to capture or kill loving this is supported by the fact that the witnesses were convicted felons and accordingly agent corte would feel more at liberty to imperil them he concluded it was only through good fortune that the witnesses were not lost and the trial proceeded on schedule good fortune i repeated softly something i absolutely do not believe in well the penitentiary in providence was more dangerous than the worst parts of the city itself and that was saying something my protégé at the time had learned that henry loving had done business with at least two people inside the slammer as for the principals yes they were felons but we shepherds never make moral judgments about the people we protect the only quality in a principal that matters is a beating heart our job is to keep it that way but if i hadnt justified myself to my boss i sure wasnt going to do so to westerfield and his young assistant its the same thing here corte the motel in providence the hillside inn the safe house there the safe house here from what we can reconstruct back at the hillside after loving showed up and was in pursuit you could have escaped right away but you paused in the back of the motel you engaged him with the kesslers in the vehicle with you people who explain are weak corte a shepherd cant be weak he can be wrong but he cant be weak abes words of course i realized that westerfield must be upset he hadnt lapsed into french once during this conversation i sped around a slowmoving prius so what happened is the trap in rhode island didnt work out after all and your fox shows up still alive yesterday so you set out to nail him all over again using the kesslers and now i understand from aaron theres a terrorist component a what ali pamuk aka clarence brown we havent found any terrorist connections his fathers turkish and hes contributed money to a mosque here in virginia hes also played with his identity thats all we know at this point were investigating but its possible that a terror cell wants to kidnap kessler and find out what he knows and who else might be involved in his investigation like i said jason we dont know look corte i appreciate youve saved the kesslers from two tight situations youre talented and you were lucky we cant risk that the third time lovingll have more luck than you do luck kessler may be the only key to a serious terror threat we cant afford to have him jeopardized like youve been doing i have the attorney generals okay i want the kesslers and the womans sister in a slammer now the hansen facility we were talking about earlier ive already contacted them i pictured him looking at teasley with an expression that said see thats how its done i want to talk to my boss this is coming from the attorney general everybodys boss i found i was driving ten over the limit i eased up on the gas westerfield continued speaking reasonably if this was some bullshit embezzlement or organized crime thing i wouldnt care so much but now theres a terror component we cant fool around we need to make sure we do everything we can to identify a threat we also dont need any blowback even spending so much time inside the beltway i could never quite get used to the lexicon i want them in hansen as soon as possible you want to keep after loving be my guest you want to keep tracking down the primary fine you just arent going to use my witness for cheese in your mousetrap his witness the famous hero cop westerfield continued im ordering an armored van now no ill just call aaron and find out where they are he doesnt know what i havent told him needtoknow well thats westerfield had trouble processing this though i wasnt sure why i doubted people in his organization shared everything with one another i hope this isnt going to become a fight corte mon dieu that would not be good ah the french at last finally i said heres what ill agree to do ill call aaron if he confirms that the ags ordered them into a slammeri let that lingerill arrange for one of our armored transports to get them to the hansen facility but ill tell you a district cop inside ryans not going to be happy at all i dont know how cooperative hell be after we move them you let me worry about that corte this has to happen immediately i can rely on you meaning he was going to call aaron ellis in about ten minutes to make sure i was doing what id said yes thanks its really for the bestfor us for them for the country i didnt know if those words were directed toward me toward teasley or an invisible audience after i disconnected i gave it a few minutes and without bothering to call aaron ellis for the confirmation dialed billy to ask about an armored van chapter hotels are good meeting places in our line of work they never close and even if you arent registered there nobody pays much attention if you sit quietly in the lobby in a business suit and pretend to look over your computer like youre waiting for a meeting which was what i was doing now at am claire dubois arrived at the tysons hyatt she was wearing a black pantsuit but a different black one from yesterday the pattern i noticed a thin burgundy sweater underneath as she sat down i smelled jasmine her eyes were red i supposed she hadnt gotten much sleep her face was troubled and for a moment i thought we had a security situation on our hands but she simply said in a ragged whisper i heard billys signed out a secure transport for a run to a slammer in dc he was secret about it i mean i sensed he was inscrutable im not sure exactly what that means but it seemed to apply when i walked toward him he headed the other way that was duboiss very long way of asking a very simple question first i gestured across the lobby picked up my laptop and we walked to the starbucks stand it wasnt my favorite coffee but it had caffeine and that i did need we got two cups and claire dubois went for some food a vegetable wrap we returned to where wed been sitting i explained about westerfields call though not the rhode island part or the inquiry i supposed that dubois knew about the matter which was there for public consumption provided you were up for a little insidious digging as chris teasley had done it wasnt the sort of thing to bring up with your protégé and fellow workers unnecessarily when i told her the us attorney had demanded the kesslers and maree go into a slammer dubois blinked as if id said the district were seceding but he cant do that youre in charge of the principals i told her but hes in charge of the sanctity of the nation and of his career i chose not to work the word selfrighteous into my comments i also chose to tell her nothing more in any case thats not our priority at the moment we need to find whos hired loving tell me what youve got so far im still checking on the email you sent following up on the tracker situation the police department since id given her the assignment only a half hour ago i wasnt surprised or troubled there were no results yet heres the result of the phone call traces you asked me for she handed me a folder i read it fast but completely the answer was pretty much what id expected dubois then handed me a second filedealing with the alleged ponzi scam this was filled with a lot of paperwork and documents i glanced up and she summarized clarence brown aka ali pamuk she shuffled through them detective kessler hadnt gotten too far with the case he told me he was busy and nobody in the department or the sec was that concerned poor minority victims not much money involved and no loudmouths to stand up for them like al sharpton pamuk has an office in south east but its a shortterm lease all the furnitures rented a secretary and two assistants neither of themve graduated from college it just doesnt smell right youd think that if you were an investment advisor youd have something that wasnt so cheesy now i saw this movie all the presidents men it was a book too was it well in it i know the story to track down what was going on the reporters followed the money i was thinking about it and thats what i did good she continued i know some people at treasury and state and this lawyer whos involved in international banking treaties she seemed to know half of the underthirty population in the district of columbia ever since the swiss got scared the ubs thing a few years ago and started to chatter its not quite as hard to get information but the trails really complicated she pulled a sheet of paper out of her file and showed me an elaborate diagram in her elegant handwriting i managed to find somebody at interpol in europe and mi in the uk they were working late or early or around the clock i dont know to summarize the investors money goes from dc to georgetownha thats funny i just realized the georgetown in the cayman islands not the georgetown where i go to dean and deluca from there the money goes to london and marseille and geneva and athens then guess where pamuks dad was turkish so i gambled on istanbul or ankara but the real answer was a lot more interesting riyadh saudi arabia the origin of most of the nineeleven hijackers westerfields terrorist connection which id thought was pretty speculative was looking more and more possible a british shell corporation and from there it goes to more companies throughout the middle east buthows thistheyre not middle eastern theyre registered in america france austria switzerland england china japan and singapore theyre all shell corporations every one of them they get the money and from there it disappears i sipped the bitter coffee i summarized so investors arent getting their money out because its being used to fund terror operations by hezbollah the taliban hamas al qaeda thats what i was thinking it was a clever idea using a ponzi scam to produce revenue for terrorists and if true it was doubly effective the money pamuk raised would not only fund operations but would also have secondary consequences destroying the lives of people in the west whod invested their savings with pamuk where are we now the saudis arent being cooperative no surprise there state and interpol and local fbire doing some digging trying to see who specifically is getting the money i guessed that pamuk could be a front man picked probably because he had connections with the neighborhoodand his sympathies to fundamentalism i wondered if hed been the one whod hired henry loving or if that had been someone in the middle east any word about when theyll know something i asked by tomorrow they hope they hope now about graham i said she grimaced sorry we threaten we dont bluff i shrugged shed learned the lesson the question was what to do about the situation i finished my coffee i said in my mentor voice in this line of work yes sometimes weve got to do things that test us push us to the extreme shed gone quiet unusual for her but she was looking me in the eye nodding slightly thats what we have to do now but its really above and beyond the call of duty i cant order you to do it dubois touched the single button closing her jacket subconsciously i believed tucked in her waistband was a pistol similar to mine the compact glock id seen her scores she was a good shot and i remembered the image of her at our range eyes focused and intense beneath the yellowlensed glasses her short dark hair puffed out comically around the thick ear protectors always getting a tight grouping in the fiftyyard targets shed be thinking possible terrorist connection possible new jersey syndicate connection even a department of defense conspiracy of some sort would there be a firefight she cleared her throat whatever you need corte i sized her up her still blue eyes taut lips steady breathing she was ready for what we were about to do i decided lets go chapter mr graham i was displaying my id which the man had glanced at as if hed been expecting it all day which he probably had been trimhaired eric graham was about fifty solidly built though not overweight he was in jeans and a sweater and he hadnt shaved since rising for work on friday he looked at me without interest and at dubois with sheerly veiled contempt once he learned her name agent corte theres nothing to talk about the forgery case has been withdrawn i really dont understand what the federal government is doing involved in this thats not what im here about sir you mind if we come in just for a minute or two its important i dont see it wont be long i was looking grim he shrugged and motioned us inside he directed us to the den whose walls were covered with photos diplomas certificates of achievement and memorabilia from his scholastic and athletic endeavors thirty years ago as i explained to her graham said icily im in a very sensitive job its unfortunate that the money was stolen but on the whole in the interests of national security i decided not to pursue a criminal case he gave a tight insincere smile why burden the dc police department anyway theyve got more important things to do than deal with a careless computer jockey who left his checkbook where it shouldntve been we sat down around a circular coffee table with a glass top and a recess in the middle inside were pictures of grahams sports successescollege football and tennis on the walls were some family photos vacation school pageants holidays i saw a few of his son presumably the one whose future education had been derailed i noted too photos of the daughters also in college they were twins many were of graham with what looked like wealthy business associates and a politician or two there were no sights or sounds of family though i saw two nearly empty coffee cups on the dining room table around the remains of the sunday washington post and heard npr talk radio on the stereo the volume in the netherworld portion of the dial i heard creaks coming from upstairs a door closed hed sent the women and children off to the hills when the marauders arrived im sorry about detective keller kessler whos had all this trouble he seemed like a nice guy when he interviewed me i knowanother nonglaring glare at duboisthat some hit man or somebody was curious about him because of something interesting way to phrase it im sorry about that but theres no way my situation could have anything to do with it youre thinking that whoever stole my checkbook wants to kill him that just doesnt make sense i held up my hands like i said were not here about that were here my voice faded and i glanced at claire dubois she took a deep breath her eyes down im here to apologize mr graham to what when my supervisor she began looking at me learned what id said and done in our conversation conversation graham said sardonically he advised me that id acted in an unprofessional manner to put it mildly i merely observed i said nothing but turned and studied the room graham was smugly pleased i wasnt defending my aide he looked to dubois she explained see we have profiling software when i ran the situation through the computers the scenario that was number one on our list was that detective kessler had been targeted because hed learned something about your check fraud situation what it laid out for us was that somebody possibly a security threat had stolen your checkbook and used the funds for something that might compromise you they then blackmailed you into either handing over secrets or maybe sabotaging some of your designs for the dod it was a credible scenario he snapped except it wasnt nodding dubois said im fairly new to this position i dont know if youve worked in any place other than the federal government i was in the private sector for a while she said i was too i was a security consultant for a major software developer i cant really mention which one but we had a huge piracy problem tens of millions hundreds of millions of dollars were at stake youre into computers you know source codes of course he gave a subtle eye roll i heard dubois say we had a situation where an employee was being blackmailed into giving important parts of source codes to a competitor i managed to track him down there were some similarities between that situation and your case i kind of leapt on that i told you there wasnt a problem you kept pushing yes i know i got a little focused or blinded you could say blinded dubois agreed so you had a taste of success at your other company and you wanted to relive it i thats about right youre an ambitious little thing arent you she was silent ambitions fine but you need the goods you need to deliver yessir i didnt have the goods if you dont have them you cant deliver right no delivery he offered her a drippy condescending smile ill give you two pieces of advice first and this is from somebody in the business computers can only do so much they point you in a certain direction you need to use that pretty little brain of yours in deciding where to go from there how do you learn that well from life experience the most important thing in the world you cant bottle it you cant buy it yessir whats the second bit of advice give people the respect they deserve youre young youre spunky but youll go further faster if you keep in mind where you fit in the scheme of things thats true i sometimes dont remember where i fit i glanced at graham anything else we can do your little lady and ive come to an understanding i dont think the matter needs to go any further thats kind of you you keep that attitude in check he said to my protégée a fraction of a moments silence as dubois nodded slowly her skin turned ruddy my teacher in seventh grade said the same thing once of course he thank you for your time mr graham i interrupted quickly and your generosity well leave you alone now we walked out the door then climbed into the honda as we pulled out watching a smug eric graham close the door i said to dubois that was helpful my highest compliment it didnt seem to wash today however she nodded glum i know it was tough yeah the clipped oneword response meant dubois was very upset i couldnt blame her i supposed she would have preferred a rolling fourperson tactical entry against an armed hostile to the humiliation shed just suffered but id had to ask her to do it there was absolutely no logical explanation for grahams dropping the case and the fact that somebody powerful had gone to the mpd to make sure the investigation died suggested all the more that this was a likely motive for ryan kessler being targeted i needed to do whatever i could to find out what was going on with graham even if it meant my protégée had to suffer pretty little brain claire duboiss prostrating herself to an arrogant chauvinist like graham was bitterly hard for her especially since her star shone a thousand times brighter than his but id remembered what abe fallow had told me keeping people safe is a business like any other you ask yourself whats my goal and whats the most efficient way to go about achieving it if that means you beg you beg grovel you grovel if that means you bust heads get out the brass knuckles cry if you need to a shepherd doesnt exist outside the context of his mission so id had to put dubois in playto beg forgivenesswhile i had become invisible and studied grahams reaction when dubois told him again about our theory that he was being blackmailed id noted his mannerisms his eyes his verbal and body language id also gazed around his study for anything helpful which i believed i might have found i plucked the video camera pen from my breast pocket and handed it to her i captured about a dozen pictures of people on grahams wall upload them to our server i want facial recognition on everybody run all the data you get along with the facts of the case through orc this was the computer that dubois had alluded to in her mea culpa performance with graham the official name of the impressive program residing on our tech wizard hermess massive servers is the obscure relationship pattern and connection determiner but we shorthand it to obscure relationship connector and tighten it even more to the evil creatures in tolkiens fantasy novels a thought of mine after a marathon bout of playing lord of the rings which is a very good board game the algorithm at orcs heart was elegantthe mathematician in me was truly impressed with how it workedand if there was any relevance to be found in the evidence id gathered orc could do so and run a facial and kinesics profile on him a liedetector scan dubois took the pen hooked up a usb cable and sent the video into the stratosphere she stared out the window i wondered for how long id lost her i wondered too if this had changed something permanently between us as we drove back to the hyatt in silence to collect her car i heard my phone buzz it was still in her hand she started to hand it back saying youve got a text read it its from transport a copy of a message to westerfield go on she sighed the armored van youd ordered left the safe house fifteen minutes ago its headed for the prison now chapter as the sky grew more and more overcast i pulled into the safe house compound in great falls i climbed out and stretched as leaves tumbled past in the fitful wind the rustic setting made me feel very much at homethe trees brush sloping fields of renegade grass my early adult life was rooted in classrooms and lecture halls and my recent professions and personal life have found me in offices and safe houses but i have always found a way to get outside sometimes for hours or days at a time i glanced enviously at the paths that led to the potomac or farther into the dense woods then i turned away looking down at another text from billy about the progress of the armored van to the slammer in dc i wondered if jason westerfield and his associate would be there to greet it then i realized of course they would climbing the stairs punching in the code the door of the safe house eased open and i nodded a greeting toward maree and joanne who sat across a wobbly card table from each other with tea and cookies at hand yes and armored van was en routea lengthy complicated routebut it was empty inscrutable there was no way i was going to send the kesslers to a slammer especially a mediumsecurity facility in the district nothing had changed from earlier when id refused to incarcerate them and if westerfield was convinced i was using my principals as bait that was a problem of his not mine i knew that if the stink got big enough aaron ellis might fire me but he wouldnt fire me until the job was concluded for one thing he didnt know where i was and it would take some effort to find out nor could he do so without risking that somebody on the outside would learn of the kesslers whereabouts which he wouldnt do i was amused to see that the sisters were playing a board game plucked from the shelves in the living room backgammon the game where you roll dice and move markers in an attempt to remove all yours from the board first goes back nearly five thousand years a variation was played in mesopotamia and the romans game of twelve lines was virtually the same as the backgammon people play now i left the sisters to their competition and greeted ahmad who stood at the back door looking out he assured me everything had been quiet i made a call to the spec in west virginia who reported that thered been no hint of surveillance from the outside nor had the deer badgers or other animals been behaving oddly ahmad was standing in a way i could only describe as anticipatory shoulders at one angle hips at another eyes were scanning the windows his job but also avoiding mine he said i heard you ordered a transport to the hansen detention center thats right he was nodding understandably confused the people supposedly inside the van were no more than thirty feet away from him i asked anybody call you about it it went out over the wire i told him of my ploy you wont be in trouble you can plead ignorance the young officer nodded curious but i said nothing more like abe fallow im always aware of my responsibility to teach protégés what i can about our businessthere is so much to learn but this was a situation i decided not to elaborate on since i hoped hed never find himself in one like it all he said was it was a good call sir a slammerd be wrong for this situation wheres ryan working in his room that accounting project of his i think i realized the downstairs was filled with a new smell spice which i took to be from shampoo or perfume i was struck by the domesticity replayed hundreds of times in the safe houses where ive stashed my principals and its always jarring to me the contrast the homey even mundane routine thats the antithesis of the reason these men and women are here as it did occasionally the comforting imagery made me feel somewhat sentimental certain memories again arose but i didnt shoo them away quite so quickly this time i recalled last friday night after work alone in the town house eating a sandwich for dinner before i went to my gaming club up the street id found the list for the party that peggy and i had thrown years ago id stared at it my appetite gone id become aware of the smell of the place bitter from the cardboard paper and ink of the many boxed games lining the walls the town house had seemed unbearably sterile i thought i should get some incense or do what people did when they were selling their houses boil cinnamon on the stove or bake cookies something domestic as if that would ever happen the game between the sisters now ended and joanne returned to her room maree gave me a smile and booted up her computer i asked who won jo did you cant beat her at anything its impossible as a statistician joanne would have had a talent for math and that meant a talent for gamescertain types in any event i knew my skill at numbers and my analytical mind helped me play in backgammon which i happen to be good at i knew the general strategy was to play a running game moving quickly around the board offensively if that didnt work players had to fall back on a holding action trying to create an anchor on the opponents side while not as complicated as chess its a sophisticated game i would have liked to see how joanne played but the interest was purely theoretical in all my years as a shepherd id never played a game with a principal though on occasion id been tempted maree gestured toward her computer tell me what you think what i asked come ere mr tour guide take a look she motioned me over and typed some commands into her computer a logo came up gsi global sofware innovations id heard of them but couldnt recall where after a moment the program loaded it was apparently a picture editing and archiving program folders of marees photos appeared marees fingers paused hovering over keys i thought at first she was unfamiliar with the software but it turned out the hesitation was due to another reason with a wistfulness in her eyes she said its amandas program we had a lot of fun installing it together i feel bad for her shes got to be terrified about this whole thing i glanced into the womans eyes focused blankly on the logo shes stronger than a lot of my adult principals shell be fine this was not just for reassurance it was the truth maree exhaled softly jo thinks shes stronger than i am a look up at my face as a rule i never agree with my sister but shes right about that then she seemed to toss aside the serious thoughtsas id been doing all dayand concentrated on the photo software she typed quickly and two pictures flashed onto the screen side by side i cant decide which of these two are the best she laughed looking up and patted the chair beside her its okay i dont bite i hesitated then sat down i noted that unsurprisingly she was the source of the pleasant spice not joanne and as id observed yesterday she was wearing makeup skillfully applied she had ironed and donned a new outfita sheer skirt and silk maroon blouse this was curious not only do principals tend to ignore fashion like this when their lives are in danger but if maree was as flighty as she seemed and the artist she claimed to be i would have thought shed have been inattentive to personal details or been more of a jeansandsweats woman she leaned close i felt her arm against mine and the sweet aroma wafted around me i must have eased away slightly because she laughed again i felt a ping of impatience but i did as shed asked and i looked at the computer screen the gallery show i was telling you about im submitting one of these ive got to send it in by tuesday to meet the deadline what do you think i whatre you asking which one i like better to me they were almost identical although one was more tightly cropped than the other they depicted two somber men in suits businessmen or politicians having an intense discussion in the shadow of the government building in downtown dc who are they i dont know it doesnt matter i was just walking down the street last week near the treasury building and saw them standing there they look powerful they look rich but dont they seem like little boys in a way on the school yard forty years younger they wouldve started a shoving match at first i didnt get that but then i saw yes she was right the theme is about conflict she explained i dont see much difference the one on the left its tighter the emphasis is on the men but therere no angles no sense of composition the one on the right is better stylistically you see more of the treasury building you see the sunlight that band of light there cutting into the stairs near them its aesthetically better so she asked which one i like better thats the question mr tour guide i felt suddenly awkward like i was being tested on something i hadnt studied for i didnt really know which one i liked more the only photos i looked at regularly were surveillance and crime scene shots aesthetics didnt count finally i pointed to the picture on the left that one why i hadnt known i had to show my work i dont know i just do uhuh commit i really dont know theyre both nice i glanced up the hall ive got to talk to your brotherinlaw come on corte humor me youve screwed up my weekend pretty bad you wont even be my masseur you owe me i banked my irritation again and looked at the pictures suddenly i had a thought i like it because you have to ask yourself whats your goal you said it was to show conflict the one on the left does that better its more focused even though its less artistic im not sure what artistic means but yes she lifted her hand to give me a high five reluctantly i lifted mine and she slapped it thats just what i was thinking maree then touched the pad the gsi software instantly shrank the pictures to thumbnails and she directed them back to a folder she then started a slideshow and the pictures faded up to fill the screen remained for a few moments then went to black and a new one was displayed i have no artistic ability whatsoever but i can appreciate something thats technically well executed her pictures were all in focus and seemed well composed but it was the subjects that appealed to me had they been still lifes or abstracts i wouldnt have been interested but maree specialized in portraits and she seemed to be able to capture the spirit of her subjects perfectly though i supposed since she used a fancy digital camera there were a hundred outtakes for every keeper as the show continued i noted the controls and paused several of them maree was leaning close workers mothers and children businessmen parents policemen athletes there was no theme but whoever they were maree had caught them in a moment of emotion anger love frustration pride theyre good youre talented you do something enough times youre going to get a few chops down hey you want to see who youre guarding i frowned she typed and another folder appeared it took me a moment to realize what she meantand what i was looking at family albums of maree joanne and who i guessed were their parents and other relatives maree was calling out names and information i heard abes voice learn only what you need to learn to keep them alive dont use their names dont look at their kids pictures dont ask em if theyre all right unless youve been dodging bullets and you need to call a medic i said i really have to talk to ryan dont be scared of a few family pictures corte theyre not even your family im the one who should be scared a picture of a trim crewcut man in khaki slacks and a shortsleeved shirt faded in maree hit pause the colonel our father and yeah people called him the colonel capital c lieutenant colonel a little bird not a big bird still the man was imposing no question marees voice dropped dont tell freud but jo thought she was marrying him she got ryan instead dad was career military strong quiet distant didnt laugh ha like you corte hey you know im messing with you i ignored her comment and continued to look at her pictures many of them showed maree by herself and joanne with their father she was his darling jo was the perfect athlete the perfect student in school not a lot of fun i have to say dadd take her to her soccer matches and track events he tried with me im not saying he didnt but i sucked at sports and activities i was a total klutz dad never rubbed it in my face you know oh your sisters perfect none of that but thats what it smelled like so i went the other way i was the wild one the big iirresponsible dropped out i had a dui well a couple when i was seventeen or eighteen drugs a little shoplifting thanks to the boyfriends i recalled but said nothing i just didnt fucking care squeaked by in a community college jo graduated second or third in her class she majored in political science nearly went into the army like dad but he talked her out of that i think she wouldve been good actually drill instructor you have brothers or sisters corte no and no kids lucky man one picture of jo revealed that shed lost a lot of weight and looked gaunt was she sick there car crash i remembered that from duboiss bio she looked around pretty bad she lost control on some ice needed a lot of surgery its why she cant have kids but we dont talk about that so the child question was answered i realized one of the other attractions of the hero cophe not only saved her life he offered her a builtin family the pictures slipped past again and i kept looking at them some of the scans were sepia pictures going back a hundred years some were blackandwhite some were oversaturated from the sixties and seventies many were recent direct digital finally id had enough i really better get some things done i told her sure those are good pictures thank you she said formally maybe mocking my tone mr tour guide as i was walking up the hallway to find ryan and tell him what dubois had found about his cases my phone buzzed with a text message i figured it would be from westerfield or ellisnot risking a voice call that would end in a cowards voice mail but i glanced down and saw it was from dubois i was pleased thinking maybe shed finished her investigation from my espionage at grahams house or perhaps shed returned to her chatty self and forgiven me for the trial shed had to endure there but the message was brief and about something else altogether problem hermes has a bot roaming websites etc and he had a hit this was posted fifteen minutes ago heres the url i hurried into the den unlocked my computer and typed the web address shed sent the site was a blog written by someone with the screen name sassycat i was expecting something about clarence brownwell ali pamukor eric graham or even ryan kessler himself information that loving might use i skimmed quickly the postings were typical of all blogs containing more information about daily life than anybody cared to read some were humorousa boring saturday night at the mall when a date fell through and a music review of a really bad rock concertand some sobering a report about overcrowded classrooms a call for an aids awareness campaign and the start of a series about the suicide of a teenager the blogger knew through her volunteer work for a selfharm prevention program at her school i froze when i noticed that last entry with a sinking heart i grabbed my phone and dialed dubois i asked sassycat shes amanda kessler right i remembered that shed volunteered for a counseling program at her school thats right its her the girl mustve thought it was safe to post under her screen name and from a friends computer hermes says it was posted about an hour ago with a naked ip address it took him two minutes to find it was a private residence in loudoun county near whites ferry bill carters house next door if we had a bot loving would too hed check the property records of everybody in the area and find carters name hed learn that carters main residence was five minutes from the kesslers in fairfax hed know wed stashed the girl there caller id sounded on call waiting it was westerfields number hed just learned that the armored van was empty i guessed then it buzzed againi can juggle four calls on this phone my bosss number i ignored them both i told dubois im going to carters myself its less than a half hour from here call freddy and have him get some tactical troops there you have the location right yes i disconnected all the calls and slipped the phone away i briefed ahmad and then threw my laptop along with extra ammunition into my shoulder bag and headed out the side door hitting the speed dial for bill carters phone as i leapt into the front seat of the honda and sped down the drive it rang three times and went to voice mail chapter answer please answer was carter dead and the girl in lovings hands already the next occurrence would be a call from loving via a cold phone to the fbi asking to be connected to ryan kessler to inform him that his daughter was captive and requesting the information that the lifter had been hired to extract when that call came through it would fall to me to make the decision to put loving in touch with kessler and try to negotiate the girls release or not and write amandas death warrant i hit redial click the electronic voice of the phone urged please leave a message no i disconnected and nudged up the rpms on the hissing engine hitting seventy about the fastest i could do along route and the country roads that roughly paralleled the potomac river it was pm on a pleasant sunday and there were brunchers and golfers and sightseers out which made the going slow id called in a cleartransit request to loudoun and fairfax county police which i didnt want to do because it would identify my honda to anyone who thought to check or to hack the system but i couldnt afford to get stopped now i tried the phone once more one tone another then finally lo bill carter answered i exhaled in relief its corte lovings on his way there okay instantly alert what should i do first you have your weapon on you my old sidearm smittie thirtyeight yessir and a twelvegauge on the mantel get it now double pump auto overunder itd have to do load it extra ammo in your pockets need my hands im putting you down for a minute a faint hollow clink of metal i heard okay wheres amanda getting the tackle together we were going fishing in about a half hour i need you out of the house shell get upset carter said then shell be upset howd it happen she posted something from her friends computer goddamn we were over there for brunch the girls disappeared for a time i shouldve thought i heard footsteps then his voice telling amanda that there was a problem and they were leaving immediately she said thats your gun why do you have that uncle bill her voice trailed off he sounded reassuring as he talked to her there was no recrimination good no time for that now okay corte what next glancing down to my computer screen then back to the road i explained ive got a satellite picture of your property from earthwatch its not real clear but i see a road your drive connects to thats the only access right aside from the lake have you seen any cars on the road mandy its okay everythings going to be okay all right cars i was just raccoonproofing the trash and i saw one go past that unusual its pretty deserted around here but we get drivers some he didnt slow up and i didnt think any more of it description truth is i heard it moren saw it where do you want us dont drive dont go near the car go to some place on the property where you can see somebody coming and youve got good cover i risked a glance at the satellite image i think i can see a little clearing in the i guess its the northeast section of your property near the road yeah its a little meadow therere some trees on the other side we can get there its high ground good you have any camouflage fishing jackets dark green thatll do put the phone on vibrate there was the sound of clanks and zippers hows this uncle bill good it seemed that the girl wasnt panicking i was pleased i continued lovings armed and hes got a partner whos armed too has sandycolored hair maybe a green jacket slim but dont trust anybody all right get moving ill be there in fifteen the bureaus on their way too what about the neighbors loving knows where you live now he wont bother with them get to the meadow were going to hang up i need you to concentrate i needed to as well focusing on my driving i was reflecting that if loving had in fact tipped to amandas blog i knew hed be pleased to learn her whereabouts when it comes to edge snatching a principals child is as good as it gets chapter thirtythree minutes after leaving the compound i eased the honda to a stop in a stand of bushes in front of carters lakefront property and climbed out i activated the silent alarm i pulled a forest green jumpsuit out of my gear bagone of two the other was blackand tugged it on i slung the bag over my shoulder and walked quickly along the road examining the ground i could see evidence that a car had pulled over here recently paused and then started up again footsteps in the soft earth headed toward where i knew the house would beabout three hundred yards into the woods id have to assume loving was here surveying the ground i decided the logical route hed have taken i hopped a low stone wall meant to deter only the most stupid or nervous of animals and moved quickly along lovings path which would be invisible to many people but was evident to mebecause of an interest ive pursued for years in my twenties i was in austin texas finishing up yet another degree id always loved hiking and sick of the sedentary life of academia id joined the orienteering club at the university the sport which originated in sweden is a competition in which you use a special map and a compass to navigate through wilderness youve never seen before stopping at checkpoints to have a control card physically or electronically stamped the first competitor to hit the double circlethe end of the route on the orienteering mapis the winner i fell in love with the sporti still competeand found it a welcome relief from the static hours in the classroom or in front of computers or poring through obscure texts during one meet in austin i became friends with a fellow competitor a drug enforcement administration agent he was a sign cutteran expert at tracking people mostly illegal immigrants and drug runnersand he got me interested in the subject therere no competitions in sign cutting as with orienteering but border patrol and dea hold regular training sessions and he arranged for me to attend some sign cutting was to me like some huge board game that you played outside with yourself as a game piece i fell instantly in love with it and when i wasnt at orienteering competitions i would head outside and practice tracking animals and hikers who never knew they were being pursued i even made a little extra money from the dea on weekends during their training sessionsi pretended to be a drug mule and tried to escape from sign cutting agents i was pretty good since id studied the techniques and knew how to cover a trail as well as find one the art had come in handy to me as a shepherd on a number of occasions i was using the techniques now carefully scanning the ground and branches for indications of where loving had passed the signs were subtle a sunbleached branch upside down pebbles or deer shit out of place leaves where leaves shouldnt normally be sign cutting taught me that terrain determines the route the prey follows percent of the time you generally have only to follow the path of least resistance to be pretty sure of remaining on the trail of your target henry loving was different his route took him in directions that didnt seem to make sense less direct and more difficult but his strategy became logical when i realized that he was pausing repeatedly and turning to his left and right presumably to look for pursuers rational irrationality now that i knew his strategy of taking the high difficult ground and pausing prepared to engage i moved more quickly since he wouldnt expect someone to follow his exact route through the dense foliage his path wove through patches of forsythia dense blankets of kudzu and ivy vines brambles and brush whose pedigree i was unfamiliar with i paused to listen too dogs track by smell first then sound and then sight humans are different but hearing comes second with them as well always listen and listen carefully your prey makes noise escaping and those preying upon you make noise moving in for the kill humans tend to be the loudest approaching that climactic moment other animals the opposite youd think that snaps and rustling would seem to come from everywhere but it doesnt take long to learn to compensate for echoes judge distances and know with more or less certainty where the source is located after a few moments i detected some faint snaps ahead of me maybe they were from branches clicking together in the increasing breeze maybe a deer maybe they were the footfalls of a man intent on kidnapping a sixteenyearold girl then about a hundred yards away near a body of water i saw the outline of carters house i scanned carefully no movement other than leaves stirred by taut wind moving closer pausing and scanning again i was two hundred feet or so from the house when i spotted loving yes it was definitely the lifter i caught a glimpse of his face he was wearing the same clothes or similar ones as yesterday when wed had our meeting at the flytrap he wasnt carrying his weapon he was using his hands to move aside brush and branches as silently as he could id hope to catch him on the path hed be less cautious there than at the house where he would anticipate danger he would have done his homework and learned that bill carter was a retired cop and surely armed loving now drew his weapon and pulled back the slide slightly to make sure a round was chambered i drew mine as well and started after him i couldnt help but think what would westerfield or anybody say if he were observing this wasnt my job to get my principal now hiding three hundred yards away to safety as fast as i could then why was i stalking the lifter there are herding dogs that move sheep around in a field and then there are herding dogs that both guard the flock and attack predators however big and however numerous sorry abe im the second type i cant help it i narrowed the distance debating my next strategy id called freddy from the road and knew there were officers and agents en route running silent already local officers would be setting up roadblocks freddys eta was probably twenty minutes this was a poor area to stage a oneonone tactical assault and though the id was certain i had no clear target presenting loving was in and out of shadows a missed shot would be far too dangerous and not worth the risk and where was his partner i continued on once he was in the house it would take him ten minutes to search all the rooms and realize that his edge had left and was not hiding in the obvious places i was moving closer still under good cover and largely silent he approached the garage and looked in hed see carters suv inside he eased into the bushes separating the building from the house itself he crouched and moved along a low gray fence connecting the two structures the foliage was high there and dense it was hard to see his form but i could just make it out then i stopped a twitching in my belly if loving continued another fifteen feet or so in the direction he was headed hed be in a clearing and would present a perfectly backlit target i lifted my weapon and aimed where hed appear i was about eighty feet away not a particularly long distance for a powerful handgun like thisa caliber even with the short barrel a cluster would likely kill him i remembered the training three shots high three low move aside from where your muzzle flash wouldve registered and prepare to fire again count rounds expended he kept going ten feet to the break in the plants then eight then six i suddenly felt my heart rate increasing my palms cooling from sweat here was henry loving in front of me nearly in my sights two thoughts came into my mind we have specific rules of engagement that require us to make a surrender demand unless we or someone else is in imminent danger that rule applies to every hostile even those who are armed and who are willing to use a sixteenyearold girls screams to force her sobbing father to tell what he knows even those whod tortured and killed a good man like abe fallow but my second thought was three high three low step aside prepare to shoot again i curled my left hand under my right aimed steadily evened my breathing four feet until the shadow that was henry loving would break from the brush and id have a perfect shot he now approached the clearing but instead of standing he dropped to a crouch still obscured by the thick brush stand up i thought stand up goddamn it i felt a flush of anger unusual for me as i squinted at the darkness of his form on the other side of the brush hell just go for it i told myself suddenly empty your entire mag and reload a slow breath now i went into a shooting stance and leaned forward started applying pressure i felt as if i could will the bullets to strike their target i probably got to four pounds of pressure on a trigger with a pull of five and a half then gave an inaudible sigh and lowered the gun i reflected on what id just thought willing the bullets shooting is physics and chemistry vision and steady muscles choosing the right strategy of firing position having a clear target there is no will involved theres no luck involved i was a shepherd i couldnt afford to be emotional if id shot and merely wounded him or missed he would have had my position for all i knew the partner was fifty yards behind me waiting for me to present or hearing the shot bill carter and amanda might leave cover to come see what had happened unnerved that id nearly given in to emotion i checked the ground in front of me to make sure i could move silently and i started forward again still using the plants for cover loving slipped up to the gate and tried it gently testing for squeaking i saw him extract something from his pocket and he appeared to oil the hinges then still halfway out of sight he slipped through and made his way toward the house under good cover debating i finally picked my strategy i turned away and headed for the clearing where bill carter and amanda waited it was one of the hardest decisions id ever made but my goal was clear for me solo to try to take loving in the house was inefficient a tactical move would have required at least two and ideally four others my best strategy was to find my principals and get them out lovings going inside would buy us ten minutes id let freddy and his crew run the takedown i oriented myself and backed up the way id come then turned left toward where i knew the girl and carter were hiding it was some distance maybe three hundred yards across the length of the property but i had a sense of the forest now and i noted the area ahead of me was largely coniferouswith plenty of pine needles dampening the ground leaving resinous branches that didnt snap when you stepped on them one could move quickly and in virtual silence here which was why as i took my first step forward lovings partner got me from behind i never heard his approach a grunt of a whisper drop that weapon hands out to your side i felt the muzzle of a gun kiss my back chapter as the partner pressed his gun harder into my spine i thought is this what abe fallow had heard not long before loving had gone to work on him hands out to the side i was about to die too but not right away because like my mentor i was valuable i wondered if loving had created a flytrap of his own maybe hed used the girl not as an edge on her father but to get me to give up the detective speculating that it might be logistically difficult to let ryan know they had his daughter id been the bait in our flytrap amanda was the bait here i told you gun drop it i did you cant spin around faster than a bullet how long could i hold out i wondered sandpaper and alcohol memories of peggy and the boys jeremy and sam surfaced then the voice behind me whispered wait curious it seemed that he was speaking to himself then i heard pleasantly oh thats you isnt it corte my hands started shaking and i turned around slowly to see bill carter holding a twelvegauge overunder shotgun pointed directly at my chest his finger wasnt outside the guard amanda was behind him eyes wide breathing hard now so hard my chest hurt he lowered the scattergun you didnt go to the clearing i whispered no seemed too far and looks like you werent in any big hurry to come visit either true i reflected amanda gazed at me with cautious but steady eyes definitely her fathers eyes she still had around her shoulder her plush bear purse i studied the area around us it wasnt defensiblewe were in a low point i wanted to get back to the car and leave as fast as we could we crouched hes in the house hell know youre not there any minute now i gestured toward the road and to the right my cars past the rock fence in front about two hundred yards lets go now come on amanda its going to be fine she didnt look like she needed reassurance i got the feeling she wanted to go after loving herself grit i guided us up the incline of the ravine and toward the road we moved slowly and i was getting dizzy from looking from side to side and behind us so often there were a thousand configurations of shadow and shapes of green that took on the dimensions and postures of a hostile still none broke away from the backdrop and became an armed human twenty yards then thirty then fifty suddenly amanda gasped our weapons up carter and i dropped to our knees and i pulled the girl down looking in the direction she was the deer emerged from the bushes he was grazing on and stared at us with a face both blank and cautious two others joined him carter picked up a rock and was going to toss it to scare them off presumably to make loving think that any noise he mightve heard was from this fauna but i shook my head opting for quiet sometimes you can outsmart yourself looking down and verifying that there were no signs the partner had come along the path id chosen to follow we continued on silently the deer went back to destroying a bush for lunch more noises near us animals or loving the partner we came to a bald strip of the property about fifty feet across to keep to cover going around would have taken too long i motioned us across the open space just as we reached the other side i looked back about a football fields distance i caught a glimpse of the house and i saw henry loving stepping into the front yard he looked our way and froze then dug into his pocket for a radio or mobile he spotted us move fast i indicated the asphalt and we started to run bill watch the rear if you see him aim low hell be crouching better a minor wound on the feet and ankles than a miss over the head abe used to say got it i whispered come on amanda were doing fine keeping low gasping we ran through the thinning undergrowth not caring about noise i expected to hear at any moment the near simultaneous snap of the bullet and the boom of the weapon from behind us but neither loving nor his partner fired amanda was no good to them dead you need your edge relatively healthy finally all of us breathing hard we approached the road about fifty yards away was my car on the other side of the stone fence we sprinted through the low brush carter glanced back i think i see him go on get in the car ill cover you no we ran a bit farther then i pulled the others down beside me under the cover of a fallen tree old enough that as a youngster it might have given similar protection and comfort to union or confederate soldiers making their way south after the carnage of the most deadly battle of the civil war antietam i was sure i saw loving behind us not far away maybe sixty seventy yards or so he too had ducked behind a tree next to the wall i said to carter were going to move up close to the car ill be in the rear ill start it remotely when it starts fire both barrels into the woods across the road this time i want you to aim high reload and fire two more fast then you both go over the wall amanda get in the backseat and get down bill drive maybe twenty feet or so forward then stop cover the forest across the road with your sidearm ill join you in a minute the partners over there thats right he didnt ask how i knew and i wasnt inclined to explain that it was simply rational a glance at both faces sweaty and flecked with leaf debris ready nods i pressed the ignition button and the engine came to life our cars have special mufflers to deaden the exhaust sound but theres nothing you can do about a starter carter didnt hesitate the instant the car started he did as id asked rising over the fence and firing two hugely loud rounds he reloaded fired two more and reloaded again as i fired a burst of six in the direction where loving was hiding carter grabbed amanda by the hand they ran to the car it squealed away while i rolled over the stone fence and lay in tall grass on the shoulder of the road prone aiming back toward loving i felt a tickle on my spine loving would think i was in the car but the partner might have seen the ruse and gone for a shot at me in the shallow weeds come on come on then loving presented he jumped over the wall and started to aim at the car i didnt have much of a shot with the brush and the wall partially blocking my view yet it was something but just as i started to fire carter slammed on the brakesas id asked himand loving realized my strategy he didnt see me but he knew what had happened he spun around and started back over the wall i emptied my magazine at him chunks of rock flew from the wall and dirt from the ground loving vanished over the rock i couldnt tell if id hit him reloading i saw motion in the leaves across the roadit would be the partnerand i sprinted to the car i leapt into the drivers seat as carter scrabbled over to the passengers i floored the accelerator and we sped away carter was looking behind us yeah theres the partner climbing out of the woods and lovings joining him theyre in the road lovings hurt i think doesnt look too steady a few minutes later i skidded around a bend in the road and slowed from eightyfive carter laughed pointing up your boysre here a chopper swooped in fast descending as it sped directly for carters house a moment later a stream of black suvs in the oncoming lane braked to a stop blocking me they approached with weapons drawn cautious and i held my id out the window a young agent covered by two others looked into the car and then motioned the vehicles containing his fellow agents around him to continue on to the house you all right sir everybodys fine the agent looked us over yes we are is agent fredericks here hes about five minutes behind us all right tell your agents therere two of them loving and his partner both armed loving may be wounded i dont know where they stashed their vehicle well check it out sir i was looking over a map earlier and saw across the lake therere a dozen houses and some easy routes to the interstate im thinking they may try to row over hijack a car ill get some of the team over there the agent said i told him can you patch me through to the chopper pilot ill give him a description of the property chopper your tactical air unit i gestured toward the sky he looked confused well sir we dont have a helicopter involved in the operation chapter bill carter sat silently beside me and a glance in the rearview mirror revealed amanda in the backseat staring out the window at the overcast fall afternoon we were ten miles from carters lake house i was not thinking of what had just happened at carters property but was wrestling with a difficult memory peggy the boys and i were driving in the country and i spotted a bad roadside accident ahead id stopped to see if i could help the stoic but young and shaken county troopers they say that mothers are better than fathers at remaining detached around accidents and blood and trauma not peggy shed climbed into the back with the boys and clutched them to her the ostensible purpose was to make sure they looked away from the overturned cars and the mangled bodies as yet uncovered but in fact she was hiding her face as well as the boys thinking again about another similarity between maree and my wife the whipsawing between carefree optimism and edgy distress back then at the site of the accident sammy and jeremy had managed to peek despite their mothers huddle jer the oldest was horrified at what he saw and began sobbing uncontrollably sam though said daddy that man lying there he doesnt have a hand how can he eat ice cream not a tragedy to him a mystery you just didnt know how young people would respond to trauma i saw sams face unperturbed and curious reflected in amandas you all right honey i asked surprised id used the endearment she looked toward me nodded and then studied carters beretta shotgun open and sitting on the seat beside her hitting a speed dial button i called freddy hey he said you there nice place i may retire here i hadnt really appreciated the comforts of carters summer home anything theyre gone the chopper had to be no i said i know thats how they were extracted i mean do you have any details on it negative so far were still canvassing some wits reported hearing a helicopter low and nearby they thought it was going down you know crashing a couple nineoneone calls nobody saw anything interesting question son they looked but they heard only a ruckus and saw leaves and dust landed between two stands of trees thirty feet apart that takes some skill more it takes some equipment expensive find the car stolen months ago somebody elses tags we were hoping to get the partners prints but didnt find a single solitary swirl the neighbors theyre fine i told carter and amanda about their friends then turned my attention back to freddy i told him ill get claire tracking down the chopper our organization is always flying our principals around the country sometimes internationally so we had good contacts with the faa and private charter companies the fact that the craft seemed small which meant it had a short range and would have to be based somewhere near here would give dubois some guidance in finding the lessee freddy continued somebodys hurt we found blood where roadside the wall and some bushes a path too its loving i got him he was on his feet afterward how much blood not a lot found his footprints and the partners ill have claire look into medical treatment who is this gal of yours corte she clairevoyant jokes again listen corte westerfield i said my voice give that away son freddy asked what about him for one he keeps calling hes calling me hes calling everybody whatd you do i said he wants my principals in a slammer hes wrong but i couldnt reason with him so i basically i tried to think of a good euphemism put your job on the line by scamming the attorney general of the united states of america and pissing off half the federal government i said lovings got too many contacts in dc i couldnt risk it i dont care thats your business corte its no skin off my nose call me if you find any forensics loving went through carters house too will do we disconnected as soon as i did my bosss number came up on caller id so did westerfields i rejected both calls and dialed dubois i explained to her what happened and then told her about the helicopter find it if theres any way okay she took down the details then i said and lovings wounded the demure young woman said you got a piece of him thats good i want you to try to find where hell go for treatment theres a legal requirement that medical personnel must report gunshot wounds to law enforcement gangs and organized crime have doctors or nurses or even vets on call who treat wounds and conveniently forget to dial we knew some of these medicos and routinely monitored them we didnt arrest them since they were invaluable as sources to find and track wounded lifters and hitters loving though would avoid any of these of course i told dubois this and said hes going to find somebody private somebody we dont know about look through all the files we have on him checking addresses hes been seen at phone calls everything public records too shed use orc and other datamining programs ill see what i can find she said and corte my name again yes those images you got at grahams house im still running the analysis good she was pausing i thought about it and there wasnt any other way to get the information from him what you asked me to do i didnt like it then i didnt like it later but it was pretty smart ill remember that there wasnt any other way i repeated we disconnected and we drove in silence for a half hour carter asked to put the radio on and i said you dont mind id rather keep it off better to concentrate oh sure i saw that amanda was looking at me in the mirror was that all because of me back there she asked because of my blog yes hed linked your screen name to your real name through a social networking site he tracked the post to bills neighbors and then to his house she closed her eyes im sorry i i thought you meant i couldnt use my computer i didnt know he could track us i used my nic but she was a smart girl shed have had an inkling of the risk but in the oblivion and zeal of adolescence she hadnt thought it through or hadnt cared most likely a little of both amanda then added its just i felt really bad about susanthis sophomore at school the one who killed herself i asked thats the thing it was a car crash but she was driving real fast and stupid like she didnt care if she lived or not thats a kind of suicide our counselors tell everybody i wanted to blog about that make sure people know that being reckless can be just like taking pills or hanging yourself a curious thought struck me here was this young girl devoted to looking out for people she was in her own way a shepherd i wondered if i had had a daughter would she have turned out like amanda i wouldve been proud of her i knew that but that thought like so many others today got carted off to the dust bin she asked he wanted to kill me in the monotone of somebody who doesnt really believe they could ever die carter stirred and was about to reassure the girl i now knew though that she required little coddling no he wanted to kidnap you and get your father to tell him something tell him what we dont know she fell silent and stared out the window some lifters have standards some wont hurt women or children some rely on mental or professional pressure or risk of embarrassment or financial loss there are some cases they wont take on and some limits to what theyll do to coerce information out of people they assess the principals and use the minimum edge necessary to get the information theyve been hired to get at the other extreme are the ones like henry loving theyll take whatever steps they decide are appropriate curiously i respect these hitters and lifters more than the others theyre as true to their standards as i am to mine they determine their goal and achieve it in the most efficient way possible this makes them more predictable amanda asked is jo totally freaked not really i told her are you sure the question was wry okay shes freaked but shes safe with your father and aunt good im sorry uncle bill i kind of messed things up she didnt hesitate to accept responsibility for what had just happened everythings going to be fine i slowed then signaled and turned amanda frowned looking at the low stone building we were now approaching she said quickly i are you taking me here because of what i did i mean i couldnt help but smile no no its just a safe place for you and bill to spend the night i pulled up to the entrance gate of northern virginia maximum security federal detention center chapter whats going on where have you been my bosss voice clattered urgently through my earbud irritation and angerany emotionalways seemed muted when filtered through chinese plastic and metal but there was no mistaking his mood loving got a lead to the kesslers daughter shes safe lovings wounded ellis asked how bad we dont know didnt lose a lot of blood aaron he had a helicopter extraction he what claires tracking it down if she can you ever hear of a lifter having a chopper on call a thoughtful moment no i never have means his primarys rich or got professional access to choppers you dont need paperwork on whats your next step i just stashed the daughter in a slammer its safe shes under a jane doe a material witness to a drug hit if lovings got anybody inside i doubt hell pay attention and ive had the warden cut all outgoing communication for the day were still looking into kesslers two main cases to find the primary claires tracking down doctors off the grid loving might use to get stitched up ellis said listen corte im doing the best i can about westerfield hence my bosss mood of course about westerfield why didnt you just ignore him whyd you lie about the slammer in dc to buy time if id ignored him aaron he mightve tried to find me i was in the field i cant afford to be detained when ive got principals not in a case involving henry loving ellis said he could still get you fired i thought wed have an answer by now the primary or loving in a body bag had he stood up when id hoped at the lake house in loudoun county the case might well be over but we dont no please just keep him off my back for the night aaron tell him weve got a delicate operation going to find loving no thats gas on the bonfire tell him ive got some leads to the primary tell him the terrorist connection is panning out for real a legitimate question considering how deceptively id been running the job so far yes theres money going into the middle east some of its ending up in saudi arabia a dozen shell companies now thats interesting westerfieldll love it a good federal case for his cap cap feather in his cap claires checking out some reconnaissance i did at grahams placethe department of defense guy with the forged check were moving ahead but im keeping the kesslers make me out the heavy im fine with that but i cant let them go a sigh ill do what i can we disconnected and i made the turn to head back to the great falls safe house id called ahmad briefed him and learned everything was quiet there though apparently joanne and her husband had been squabbling it was over something petty the fights among principals invariably were id noticed i spoke to ryan who sounded sober and told him that thered been an incident at bill carters but everybody was all right amanda and he were in federal protection i ended the call before an alarmed joanne could get on the line the time was nearly pm and fatigue was seeping in my caller id announced dubois me go ahead ive got a couple of things first the helicopter one thing i noticed women dont say choppers ive talked to six people three men and three women the men all say chopper the women say helicopter duboiss observations were back shed largely recovered from the graham ignominy there was no flight plan filed i was thinking about what that would mean i assume it wouldnt be a government helicopter like fire or police not likely which means its not a charter leasing companiesre very buttoned up about flight plans they could lose their tickets if one doesnt get filed so the birds privately owned bird nobody called it a bird i made that up i said somebody like pamuk an investment banker could have one or maybe hes working with a rich client and on the graham situation ive got some results from the orc analysis well that was fast you said you wanted it fast i have addresses any in the area as a matter of fact yes dupont circle that had been one possibility id speculated greenwich village or fells point in baltimore were others but they would have been more problematic since id prefer to go there in person email them to me good job im still looking into doctors im crossreferencing specialties where do you think you hit loving i couldnt say if you hit a bone that might make a difference how so hed probably try to find somebody with orthopedic training narrow the search down i mean you cant remember no oh she sounded frustrated i wished it was a specialty i was trying to think of others ear nose and throat well i dont know where i hit him okay ill track it down im texting now we disconnected a moment later the information from the graham case slipped into my mobile i read through it quickly then pulled off the road i cut and pasted one of the addresses into my gps hit start route and obediently followed the synthetic womans commands chapter i drove to dupont circle once the home of cottage industries a pungent waterway and a famous slaughterhouse now the hood was among the more trendy parts of the nations capital gpswhose voice i had decided sounded unnervingly like chris teasleys westerfields assistanttook me to a storefront off connecticut avenue it was a usedcd store manned by a few slowmoving clerks the customers were mostly in their twenties along with a few smudged bearded music lovers about my age i walked up to one young man behind the register flashed my id along with a security picture of the asian man whod collected the gold coins in new jersey a perp in the graham forgery case he claimed he knew nothing i asked four or five other people nobody seemed to know anything about funny checks or the asian finally with a last glance around the store i pushed out the door which had a quaint oldtime bell on an armature i looked around and headed into a coffee shop nearby dupont circle survives on chic and café cafe had that aplenty the accent mark was a clue as was the lb sign in one bin of dark beans i ordered a black filtered colombian the cheapest thing on a menu full of exotic concoctions none of which were to my mind coffee tasty though they might be i recalled an image from years ago another one i didnt particularly want peggy ordering her favorite a mochaccino i was never sure what that was exactly but i remembered her heartshaped face turning toward the drink with effervescent anticipation shed once commented that she loved grocery shopping because she felt comfort in watching people buy their special treats its a tough life shed said its the little things that get us through the day how true id thought at the time how true i knew now i sipped the coffee set down the steaming cup and began to compose a text message about my progress on the graham case when i heard a squeakthe front door i was gazing down at the screen of my phone when i felt a shadow over me i looked up and behind into the face of a man in his early twenties he was white goodlooking slim wearing jeans and a seriously wrinkled striped shirt yes i work in the cd store you were just in when i didnt say anything he repeated i work there whats your name stu he eyed me carefully you were asking some things in the store his statements were inflected as questions i stared at him he looked down fast what do you want i finally asked you were asking about jimmy sun i know him you know where he is now i need to find him youre like an fbi agent wheres jimmy do you know a hesitation i dont no sit down i gestured at the table he sat and clasped his hands together in front of him people i deal with occasionally sit in exactly this position except that they do so because their wrists are in cuffs how do you know jimmy i asked sternly he comes into the store sometimes he likes music why were you looking for him there at the store traced him through credit card receipts he shops there oh sure hes in a lot of trouble itd be a big help if we could find him i thought i mean i heard there was some problem something about a check a forgery case stu said but the thing is the case was dropped i heard it was dropped so hes not in any trouble anymore he lifted his hands and offered a shallow smile i didnt smile it was dropped by the police department in dc um i went on to explain but you see there are different jurisdictions for a single crime jurisdiction can be geographic like if you commit mail fraud you can be guilty of a crime in all the states you scammed people in all fifty of them maybe separate crimes in each one or jurisdiction can be the power of a governmental body murdering a federal agent for instance is both a federal crime and a state crime oh this jimmy sun he stole the victims checkbook in the district the dc police can decide to drop that case but he used the internet to launder money launder money he bought gold coins and presumably he sold them to get cash thats money laundering it is yes thats my jurisdiction its a federal offense and a serious one now stu if you have any information about this jimmy sun i advise you to tell me lying to a federal officers a crime too and harboring a suspect could result in an obstruction charge those are very serious but if no one was hurt and the victim didnt want to pursue it i mean whats the problem the victims feelings are irrelevant that doesnt make sense well stu lets say i murder you he blinked youre dead you dont have any feelings one way or the other right i guess not i mean no but thats still a crime or say im a thug okay i steal your car but youre afraid of me and dont want to report it but there are lots of witnesses who saw me the police can still arrest me you dont testify but other people can i go to jail i didnt know that ive got an arrest warrant for sun i tapped my jacket pocket you do there were videos in the post boxes plus store where he picked up the coins hed bought with the money from the forged check but how exactly do you know jimmy be honest stu the young mans head was down again hes my partner my lover i see he lives with you no his parents are real traditional they suspect but they dont know youd be doing him a favor to have him turn himself in homeland securitys already started a file homeland security the terrorist issue terrorist stu appeared horrified its looking like sun stole the checkbook as part of an operation by the north korean government to blackmail the victimeric graham he works for the pentagon oh jesus no no is there anything that youve seen about jimmy that would support that of course not hes a great guy hes sweet his familys from south korea i smiled well terrorists can be very charming there are a lot of operatives from the north in and around seoul hes not a terrorist stu whispered well thats for the prosecutor and the courts to decide its just my job to bring him in without hurting him i hope but oh jesus i leaned forward the profile of people like him is that hes probably very dangerous we have an assault team active in the area they were ready to move into the store if hed been there theyre pursuing other leads now i glanced at my watch frowning i heard from one team twenty minutes ago they think they might know where he is the fbis authorized a lethal takedown if he doesnt surrender immediately the young man gasped i regarded the sallow face before me if you care about him you should help us out if it comes down to a fight he could lose his life our tactical teams are trained to expect suicide bombings and other lifethreatening behaviors stu began to cry big drops of tears his voice cracked it was all my idea not jimmys he was just helping me out jesus call themthose fbi people you were telling me about tell them hes not dangerous i frowned you need to explain yourself i stole the checkbook i opened the online pay account it was me not jimmy all he did was pick up the coins at the mailbox store im not following im afraid stu wiped his face the man whose checkbook was stolen eric graham hes hes my father so youre stu graham he nodded oh i cant believe how stupid i was i oh man have i fucked this up please call them not until you explain everything its so stupid tell me stu the sooner we know the truth the better itll be for jimmy he dabbed at his eyes fathers kind of hes pretty tough he always wanted me to go to his school princeton he was a bmoc big man on campus you know he wanted me to be one too but i hated it i fit in here his hand lifted outward meaning presumably dupont circle this is where i belong i love jimmy our friends im not the rahrah ivy league sort but father wouldnt listen whats this have to do with the forgery because im a fucking coward he grabbed another napkin and wiped his nose i couldnt tell father i didnt want to go back to college this fall im afraid of him moms afraid of him everybodys afraid of him he was always saying things like youre not going to be my third daughter are you i had to try out for the football team i weigh a hundred and fiftytwo pounds me on the football team but he kept on me all the time be a man do me proud follow in my footsteps i couldnt say no so you forged the check so he couldnt pay tuition how pathetic is that you had jimmy pick up the gold coins you bought stu nodded he didnt do anything bad swear to god he just helped me out hes got family in new jersey hes there a lot so we figured wed have the coins shipped there not to dc and your father found out and withdrew the complaint he nodded oh man yeah he found out i imagined that had been one pyrotechnic confrontation whatd you do with the money it wasnt about the money i understand but i want to know what you did with it we kept a little the rest we gave to an aids research fund and to amnesty international i hate it that my father makes weapons for a living thats what he does for the pentagon hes so proud of it so smug i wanted his money to do something good i said give me the name of somebody at amnesty who can confirm it stu looked through his blackberry and recited a name and number got that i asked he blinked again frowning i said im not talking to you in my earpiece claire dubois said im calling now i said to stu we wait a minute the man slumped blew his nose again he looked around the coffee shop and gave a faint laugh we come here all the time jimmy and me i said nothing you know what he was telling me just the other day what korea right youd think it was tea tea tea like china and japan but the last emperor of korea his name was sunjong the nineteen twenties he loved the west and always had coffee at the palace he and his father would sit around drinking coffee and talking about world affairs word got around and the citizens began to drink coffee they liked to do what their emperor does therere more coffee drinkers in korea than any other asian country they even have coffee shop hookers dabang girls theyre called he fell silent id rarely seen anyone looking more miserable tears running again please he begged call the fbi tell them jimmys not dangerous then i heard duboiss voice corte it checks out they gave amnesty international thirtyone thousand okay then i said to her tell the troops to stand down what she asked confused ill call you in a minute i cut off the com device under other circumstances i might have let stu spin in the wind a little but i couldnt forget grahams arrogance and his insulting dubois i said i dont think we need to pursue this any further ill hold off the investigation for now provided theres no recurrence no sir no i promise i rose and started for the door i turned back next year your dad could get more money or he could get a loan for your tuition im just curious whatre you going to do then the young man turned his red eyes toward me his jaw was set im going to tell him to go to hell i believed him i couldnt help but respond good i left the coffee shop well i had the answer about one of ryan kesslers cases i called dubois you were right she said the theory had presented itself in eric grahams den when id looked over the decor and photographs and had studied his reaction when dubois had laid out our theory as to why loving had been hired id decided he was telling the partial truthnobody was blackmailing him duboiss computer analysis of his expressions and body language bore this out on the wall were pictures of the young man id deduced was his son along with a man about the same age of asian extraction who closely resembled the suspect on the security video involved in the forgery scam backed up by the orc computer analysis shed run credit cards dmv information face recognition analysis blog and social networking site postings school records insurance claims phone records dozens of other databases the slim caucasian was in fact stuart graham the asian was james sun no record active in gay rights a grad student at george washington a resident of dupont circle id learned that stu had a parttime job at the music gallery also in dupont circle when i saw that the arrogant eric graham had turned his den into a shrine to princeton university i figured there could be a major gulf between father and son and that the young man might be behind the theft but i needed to confirm my theory which my visit here had so can i ask duboiss voice had an inquisitive lilt to it you were threatening with your warrant but i was bluffing with mine good i thought my protégée was feeling her oats i explained my fake warrant was supposedly in jimmys name he wasnt at the coffee shop to call my bluff yours would have been in grahams if hed asked for it what would you have done oh paper covers rock though i keep much of my private life secret even from her dubois has heard about my fondness for games that was clever i told her and i meant it so were back to the pamuk case being the likely reason ryan was targeted thats right i waswait her voice had taken on urgency ive just got an email a lead to somebody who could treat loving go on im reading its his cousin after loving killed abe fallow wed fleshed out his bio and tried to track down family hed been born in virginia we knew but had no relatives within a few hundred miles of the capital his parents were dead of siblings he had one sister and hed kept up some contact with her but shed died in an accident a few years ago i knew of the cousin he was the one who went to medical school in new york right right but he got his ticket here and moved to falls church about two years ago hes a doctor at arlington hospital dubois continued im looking at phone records now about a half hour after loving was wounded at bill carters place the cousin got a call on his landline from a blocked number it lasted three minutes whats the story on him single thirtytwo no record other than a few traffic stops names frank loving er background and now he does internal medicine he had good grades in medical schoolhe went to suny she gave me the address i thanked her and fired up the honda and punched the address into gps then pulled into traffic i called freddy and told him that id eliminated grahams forgery as a lead to the primary but more important i had a lead to where loving mightve gotten medical treatment he still there you think hed get in and out as fast as he could but lets assume he is move in slow and quiet with a couple of small tactical teams ill put it together and freddy the agent filled in dont tell westerfield i said exactly no problemo man can be a dick ill give you that on the other hand that assistant of his is hot if you like pearls i said that was good son freddy gave one of his chuckles this jobs bringing out a whole nother side of you chapter frank loving looked younger than the age dubois had recited he was crewcut tall and in the fit shape that most medicos of his age seem to be he was also very nervous understandable considering his murderous cousin had just paid him a visitand a half dozen armed fbi agents had just searched every nook of his residence he lived in a luxury town house in arlington one of those fourthousandsquarefoot places with columns and arches and rococo trim all of it prefabricated and bolted into place efficiently over the course of a busy few weeks the walls where youd expect printsoncanvas of shot pheasants or venice or medieval still lifes were incongruously covered with sports posters the redskins mostly what else glancing into the kitchen i could see bloody towels and discarded white and orange sterile packets from dressings or disposable instruments and syringes a bottle of betadine sat on the counter an orange ring from the disinfectant staining the pale marble frank had been trying to scrub it away i dont know where he is really frank said honestly freddys tactical team had cleared the house and was outside talking to neighbors who might have seen loving or his car i asked the doctor to join me in the sparse den and held his eye as i said let me tell you something doctor an hour or so ago your cousin was about ten minutes away from kidnapping and torturing a sixteenyearold girl to force her father to give him some information eyes widening he seemed genuinely horrified at this he whispered we knew he was a fugitive i mean i was mostly shocked to see him alive i should have called somebody as soon as he left but i didnt why not he scares me i said doctor respecting the title goes a long way if its an md youre talking to id learned from protecting a few of them doctor we really need some help here the man grimaced and played with his watch honestly i dont know where he is please you have to believe me a sixteenyearold girl i said slowly and stared into his evasive eyes he slumped what can i tell you first how badly was he hurt bullet wound to his abdomen six inches above the left hip bone in and out i cauterized some small veins cleaned and stitched oh also a small splinter of rock was lodged in his thigh i removed it cauterized the vessels and stitched that too did you shoot him yes to save the girl i nodded shes okay physically i let that sit for a moment i need to find him can you tell us anything thatll help car he didnt park in front i know that hed walked from someplace else look officer i saw the news about the shootouts i didnt know it was him he said hed been robbed and this guy from south east shot him if id known he was lying i could see but it sounded like typical improvised backpedalling when speaking to law enforcement not coconspirator deception all i wanted was for him to focus on the visit what else did he say think back anything at all the doctor frowned well you know there was one thing he wanted nitrous oxide for the procedurehe didnt want to be out but i didnt have any gas i had some propofol very shortactingthe sort of thing they use for colonoscopies he didnt go out completely but he went into that zone you know i was doing what i always do with patients just chatting away distracting them he said something i didnt think about at the time he said he wasnt happy that they were doing all that development out in loudoun county that made me think hed been to his parents house near ashburn maybe hes staying there i knew of the place when loving killed abe wed learned about the house where hed grown up but it had been sold years ago we never followed up on it i told the doctor this but he said well it wasnt exactly sold i frowned and told him to go on technically yes the deal was that henry and his sisterthe heirssold it on the cheap to the man who owns it now but he agreed to lease it back to them for i think it was twenty years or something henrys sister was sickit was terminaland i assumed he wanted to get the property out of his name but make sure marjorie had some place to live until she passed henry lovings only close family connection was this sister a few years older shed suffered from cancer but her death a few years ago had been in a boating accident her boyfriend the one driving the powerboat drunk in the occoquan river had died not long after id assumed loving had been behind the death the young man had also drowned but in his bathtubexhibiting the same symptoms of someone who had been water boarded for two to three hours i couldnt recall where the family house was frank loving found the address and i wrote it down i then asked is he on painkillers now he wouldnt take any demerol or vicodin with him no loving would endure agony to keep a clear head i gave him some preloaded lidocaine syringes for the pain topical frank looked down at his large hands i remember him from when we were kids it wasnt like he was beating people up or getting into fights just the opposite he was quiet polite i remember he was always watching watching what everything not saying anything just looking he was smart really smart his best subject was history one of my degrees i hadnt known that about loving i called freddy the agent appeared in the doorway got a lead lets get the teams to ashburn from my notebook i tore a slip of paper containing the address frank had given me i handed it to the fbi agent id already memorized it chapter people want to avoid the past i suppose thats natural when we tally up all weve said and done over the years despite the wonderful memories the regrets may be fewer but stand out more prominently glowing coals that we can never quite extinguish try though we might yet without the past my job wouldnt exist whether its because of the good things that people like ryan kessler have selflessly done that land them in a lifters sights or the bloody histories of professional killers theyre in my care as a consequence of what they did months or years earlier at the moment though driving as quickly as i could over the duskfilled slippery roads that would take me back to loudoun county i was thinking of the past for a different reason twenty minutes ahead lay the past of the man who was a threat to my principals a past that could be very helpful in finding evidence of his present the past of a man who had tortured and murdered my mentor and i wanted so badly to flip back through the years and learn what i could about him from what his cousin had told methat the family house sale was a scam in effectit was possible that inside were decades worth of family artifacts would i find pictures of loving as a child would i find toys he once played with i thought again of one of duboiss first assignments for me before the runin with loving in rhode island my protégées job had been to learn all she could about marjorie lovings sister dubois had leapt into the task with typical exhausting energy and had written a bio of the woman whod spent much time with her brother in their teen years before he turned to crime and fled the family i was convincedincorrectly it turned outthat details about his sister could somehow lead us to him dubois learned of her bouts with cancer the remission the onset once again and then the tragic death in the occoquan the river feeding into the chesapeake nothing helpful in the pursuit but id grown fascinated reading duboiss notes about the one person with whom loving had had some authentic and recurring connection i wanted to know more and hoped the old house would deliver of course when his parents found out about their sons crimes they might have eradicated any trace of him and the house would be as vacant as air if i had a child as troubled as loving would i do so claire dubois called shed run a title search and collected what information she could about the house the singlefamily eightyyearold structure was on about two acres outside ashburn a large area of scattered town houses and singlefamily homes halfway between dulles airport and leesburg growing rapidly as commuters moved farther and farther from dc the loving house had been unoccupied for nearly a year and a half though the owner whod been deeded the property sent a handyman occasionally to fix and prune the owner reported that loving hadnt contacted him for years but had prepaid more than ten years rent you didnt find all that on google i complimented dubois its interesting i could tell the owner was sort of guilty even though he hadnt done anything illegal when youre sort of guilty you sort of want to talk ten minutes later i slowed on the winding asphalt road no streetlights and checked numbers i braked and pulled into a thick stand of bushes about fifty yards from the house there were six or seven houses in the vicinity all of them set back some distance from the road trash littered the ground around me and a fragment of red brake light plastic attested to the treacherous curves and bad visibility i pulled out my mobile and placed a call to freddy you get the warrant i asked there was an argument that we wouldnt need one but in legal proceedings its best to avoid arguments in the first place and in case we found helpful evidence inside i wanted to make sure a good defense lawyer didnt get it excluded yep where are you about fifteen minutes away probably less you just got here jesus corte your outfit doesnt have those cars with flashing lights on the top youre gonna kill yourself driving like that i wanted to move fast i thought there was a chance i might find him here but you didnt i didnt im looking at the house now i told him no lights no movement but therere about fifty good shooting positions in the woods all the way around the place you guys have thermals with you sure but mostly if youre talking forest the deerll light up the equipment and bambi doesnt do much sniping eyes on the house i told him im going quiet we disconnected and i climbed from the car i removed my body armor vest from the trunk strapped it on and donned a jumpsuit the black one i moved through the cool autumn air stopping between two broad oak trees mist floated around the house which was about two hundred feet off the road i could hear the creak and groan of insects that had survived the end of summer frogs too i sensed the faint flutter from invisible motion above me bats i have no superstition within me whatsoever and i dont believe that we can feel the spirits of the dead but i dont deny that there sometimes occurs a ripening of impressions clues and the memories of experience that trigger an understanding within us that seems like a sixth sense i had no sense of dread or foreboding but i suddenly knew that i had to draw my weapon immediately kick my mind into a defensive mode and keep it there i nearly got a crick in my neck as i spun behind me and saw the shape of a man finger on the trigger of my glock i drew a target breathing hard i eased against the solid rough tree trunk only a moment later the saplings that had configured themselves into the lifter separated in the breeze and then gently drifted back the shape of a man but not a man which didnt mean that my concern was unwarranted loving could easily be nearby i turned back to the house the twostory country manse gabled was painted dark brown the handyman the owner had hired was long on landscaping and short on woodwork and painting the railing was sagging the stairs dipped and three of the beige shutters hung from their last hinge scales of dull paint rolled from the siding on the front porch which extended across the front of the entire house a swing was attached to the beams above by only a single chain another look around me no sign of human life gazing at the porch again i wondered if loving the boy had spent any time in the swing on summer or fall evenings and with whom i noted farmland behind the brokendown picket fence in the back would he have gone hunting small game there id heard rumors that hed tortured animals when he was young but i didnt believe that there was no evidence suggesting that loving was a sadist and enjoyed the physical pain he inflicted when he set the sandpaper and alcohol bottle in front of the person he needed to extract information from i knew that the main thought in his mind was my own whats your goal and whats the most efficient way to achieve it i stared at the dark windows two of which were broken from bb gunshots or maybe a unoccupied places like this would be as the law said attractive nuisances to local kids i knew this from the house in woodbridge that peggy and i had owned two doors down from it was an abandoned victorian and every neighborhood kid at some point tried to sneak inside the dangerous place id gone to town hall to have the city put up better fences which they ultimately did once more i wondered if it was the kesslers or henry loving conjuring these memories within me i pushed them away no more distractions i resolved i heard cars approaching though i spotted no lights i gave freddy a call to tell him where i was a few minutes later he and the tactical officers joined me anything on a car at his cousins i asked freddy the senior agent was looking over the lay of the land as were the tactical officers each covering a different quadrant we found a few drops of blood in a parking space about fifty feet away nothing else helpful no tread marks no trace but what do you expect true with loving you werent going to find the quality of evidence that led you back to his hideyhole i want to get moving i said gesturing at the house i was uncharacteristically impatient i glanced at the tactical agents and whispered i havent seen any sign of anyone since ive been here loving might not remember what he told his cousinhe was doped upand he mightve come back to go to ground or at least to pick up his things i regarded them gravely and its possible he said what he did to the cousin to make sure it was relayed to us this could be a trap and remember hes got a partner they scanned the grounds the trees the black windows of the house with keen eyes we divided into three groups and freddy and i leading moved forward chapter aware of the fine shooting that the partner was capable of we didnt expose ourselves by surveying any vantage points for more than a second or two before dropping to the ground or crouching behind trees in five minutes we arrived at the house and made arrangements for the tactical entry this is not my area of expertise nor was i as heavily armed as everyone else in the group i would remain outside on the front porch and keep an eye out for any flanking movement until the house was cleared another tactical officer would do the same at the back door freddy gestured to one of his tac officers the large man examined the door and with a single kick sent it flying inward simultaneously blurting the requisite fbi serving a warrant agents streamed inside through the front and back doors flashlights clicked on but i ignored the search and continued surveying the front and side yards crouching and presenting as little target as i could to a sniper in the surrounding woods using my night vision monocular i scanned but spotted no evidence of shooters finally freddy stuck his head out the front door were clear any sign of inhabitants recently yep food and drinks with pretty faroff expiration dates a set alarm clock five am boys an early riser fresh linens some clothes that dont seem too old lovings size so he had been staying here i walked inside and drew closed any open shades and curtains then clicked on the lights the air was musty and tinged with cedar and rot an agent appeared in the doorway hed checked for evidence of the vehicles but reported that the driveway and apron were gravel and hed found no tire prints what are we looking for another agent called freddy tipped his head to me credit card receipts correspondence computers or hard drives bills anything with or without henry lovings name on it he uses fake identities a lot i doubted wed find much about his immediate plans he was too smart to leave obvious evidence but even a player as conscientious as he made mistakes sometimes game theory takes this into account in a trembling hand equilibrium a player can accidentally pick an unintended strategysay when you reach for a queens bishops pawn and accidentally move the knights in error if you release the piece youve made the move even if the consequences are the opposite of what youd intended and are disastrous still we found little or nothing that was helpful but one thing i did indeed find was henry lovings past virtually all of it neither he nor his family had eradicated his history everywhere throughout the house were photographs framed postcards ribbons from awards won at state fairs and carnivals pictures of loving family vacations on the mantelpiece and on the shelves in place of books were souvenirs and memorabilia like ceramic animals ashtrays hats candleholders and in the den scrapbooks probably thirty or forty of them i checked quickly but none was more recent than about five years ago the most current one contained only a single item about loving himself it was a clipping from the washington post the same clipping i had in my office as a matter of fact about lovings murder of abe fallow and the woman hed been guarding had he clipped it and if he had why i guessed it was a matter of craft to see how the authorities were handling the investigation i flipped through the memorabilia and examined the many pictures of a younger henry his sister and their parents i was struck by the fact that in most of them he seemed somber and preoccupied rarely smiling and seemingly distracted but there were also a number of images of the young henry laughing one or two showed him with a girl presumably on a date though there was little physical contact between them young henrys sports were track and archery there were no pictures of him with teammates he seemed to enjoy solitary pursuits i went back even earlier i opened one page and stared down at it beneath a piece of yellowed scotch tape was a tuft of clipped brown hair i read the careful script below the hair was henrys at one year of age i started to reach out and touch it then withdrew my hand when freddy walked into the room whatcha think son freddy asked anything helpful here youre looking like you found bernie madoffs stash i shook my head nothing pointing to his next move but everything pointing to him that helpful not immediately but ultimately i hope so only theres a lot here to go through well collect it all take it in you folks have evidence bags in the cars i then noticed something against the opposite wall another shelf on which a dozen shoe boxes sat i picked one up inside were stacks of photographs i supposed the family had stored them here temporarily until somebody got around to pasting them into a scrapbook i realized to my surprise that there was a dustfree rectangle at the end the last shoe box had been removedtoday if not within the last hour or so had he sped back here from his cousins for the purpose of grabbing this one box what was there about it that loving wanted did it reveal something about his past that he wished to keep secret or was there something sentimental connected to it i mentioned this to freddy who noted it without much interest i flipped through the others like the scrapbooks they revealed nothing immediately helpful though wed have forensic teams prowl through them for clues to summer houses or family members we hadnt been able to locate earlier corte freddy asked he was getting impatient i supposed okay i told him got something here a tactical officer called from the hallway that led to the kitchen in the back of the house freddy and i joined him looks like bills sir sitting on the floor beside the kitchen table was a stack of envelopes bound with a rubber band he mustve dropped them and not noticed trembling hand the agent picked them up but then froze they only came halfway and tugged to a stop fuck he muttered and we all stared at the thin strand of fishing line that vanished through the hole in the floor freddy grabbed his radio clear the house ied ied from the basement i heard the bang of the booby trapsofter than i expectedand saw on the foliage and trees a brief flare as the flash radiated through the basement windows the room was eerily silent for a moment i thought the device might be a dud and id have ample time to collect the scrapbooks and shoe boxes but id taken only one step toward the repository of henry lovings history when the nearby basement door blew outward and a vortex of orange and yellow flame shot into the hall while simultaneously the fire raging in the basement erupted from every floorboard vent and crevice on the first floor chapter the device must have been made up of a grenade or small plastic explosive charge attached to a large container of gasoline i could smell the distinct astringent odor of burning fuel in seconds the fire was racing up the walls and consuming the rugs i kicked the basement door closed but the flames and heat muscled it back open as the fire spiraled outward and up freddy anybody down there i shouted he called no after they cleared it they came upstairs i started forward again toward the den yet every time i edged a few feet through the smoke thered be another flareup and id have to spin backward to keep from losing eyebrows and skin i looked around for water or a fire extinguisher or even a blanket i could use to protect myself to get to the scrapbooks and shoe boxes and save as many as i could i supposed that freddy wasnt as convinced of the importance of the memorabilia as i was but he knew that this was my expertisedealing with lifters and hitters from a strategic rather than tactical positionand he helped me push furniture against the vents and fling rugs over the flames that sprouted from the floorboards i didnt think we could control the fireit was going to winbut at least we might contain the flames long enough to get to the books we tried for three or four minutes but finally the heat was too intense the smoke blinding i was close to vomiting from the fumes and ash i grew lightheaded and knew that to faint here would mean death choking our eyes streaming we had to retreat the living room was now a mass of flame and so was the kitchen we kicked out a side window and rolled onto the ground the rest of the agents were nearby and thinking that the fire could be a diversion they were covering the trees the logical position for a sniper to take out those fleeing the house but there were no shots i wasnt surprised loving i knew would be gone report freddy shouted his fellow agents called back about their condition they were all accounted for one had a slight burn and another had been cut breaking through a window to flood the basement with water from a garden hosea futile effort of course there were no serious injuries however no the only victim here was henry lovings past i rubbed my stinging eyes wondering if as id speculated this had in fact been a trap all along i was alive but this round of our game was a decided loss for me scissors cut paper the roar of the flames was so loud that the fire trucks were almost to the property by the time we heard the sirens freddy said a shoe box with pictures in it he destroyed everything else whyd he save that whats inside a good question and one that i knew id ponder into the early hours did it contain photos of his sister of himself and her some place he liked to go pictures of a cabin in the woods or a lake somewhere he planned to retire to i said nothing but stared at the fiery tornado that had been the family house i walked back to my car to call the safe house in great falls and check on my principals i didnt however get very far two black vans with flashing red and blue lights on top skidded to a stop not far away and a small entourage got out making right for me my eyes closed momentarily as i realized who was leading them jason westerfield and chris teasley his assistant possibly sans pearls she wore a zippedhigh jacket i couldnt see any necklaces i shouldnt have been surprised to see these two i now realized that of course westerfield would have learned about the house and that id probably be here because we were on record wed gone to a federal magistrate to request a warrant to search lovings familys house the us attorney had sped directly here to find the man whod lied to him and sent him an empty armored van id hoped that hed be satisfied with a dressingdown in front of the troops and i could get back to work but he had a different agenda he glanced toward freddy standing nearby and announced in a voice louder than i thought necessary under the circumstances arrest him now chapter the fbi agent made no move to put me in cuffs and i thought that on one level the us attorney was going more for effect than to see me in chains but i was hardly sure i looked at the occupants whod been in the second vehicle they had fbi jackets on too and could have arrested me themselves but they were deferring to freddy who was senior and technically their boss freddy stepped between us like a referee jason he nodded to the other agents whod accompanied westerfield here i want him arrested i want somebody else to take over babysitting i wasnt sure what the actual charge would be using an armored van to not deliver something you said you would isnt a federal crime he lied to an officer of the federal court thats the charge on reflection i wasnt even sure id done that i couldnt remember my exact words which wasnt to say i couldnt be arrested in the first place even if the charges were ultimately dismissed that had happened to me before westerfield glanced my way i want the kesslers downtown near me i want to interview ryan personally that is going to happen immediately i cant do that i said release them to me or somebody aaron ellis recommends you do that and give me access to interview kessler i wont pursue the charges i cant do that i repeated freddy at a tennis match agent corte i think weve been in this business too long to play games westerfield said a slammer was not the right strategy jason you kept pushing i had no choice my first jobs to keep my principals safe interesting to hear that my impression would be that you felt your first job was to harpoon your white whale agent fredericks could i see some handcuffs sil vous plaît freddy who worked more for westerfield than he did for me seemed nonetheless marginally on my side he said whatever hes doing is working jason the familys safe but i cant help but notice hes here not with them and on top of it all loving got away he waved to the burning house that was true though i hadnt expected to find him here i was more interested in clues to his lifenow of course dissolving into ash and embers westerfield glanced toward the senior fbi agent are you going to arrest him probably not a disgusted sigh the us attorney looked my way corte youve even missed the boat on the primary i looked away from the house to him what do you mean weve eliminated graham now were concentrating on ali pamuk pamuks not the one either you said he was a terrorist i said that was a possibility since most of the funds money was showing up in the middle east my associate is still investigating his involvement ms dubois thats right i wondered how he knew about her andmore interesting yethow he knew the name was pronounced the nonfrench way you got it wrong corte youve been spinning your wheels with pamuk weve been doing some work on our own ive found the primary who freddy asked i was frowning and i said nothing he turned to teasley chris could you tell officer corte and agent fredericks what weve learned she said detective kessler has been involved in some internal administrative work for the metropolitan police i said something about the budget accounts so you know about that westerfield said with some satisfaction he mentioned it yes you didnt think it was relevant to loving and the primary no westerfield glanced toward teasley again she continued a year ago there were some mixups with expenses in the police department overtime charges nothing big it seemed but the head of budgeting told the chief of police who thought itd make sense to have somebodysomebody in their financial crimes divisionlook over the books and see what was going on it seemed to be nickelanddime stuff westerfield filled in but bottom line tell him the bottom line teasley continued expense checks were issued for tens of thousands of dollars but the money ended up in different department accounts been going on for years i said frowning youre saying that it was intentional some kind of a plan to skim money out of the police budget exactly westerfield said catching on freddy said and whoever was behind itsomebody senior in the police or city governmentgot scared because kessler had a background in investigating money crimes he was getting close to figuring out who i looked absently at the burning house and mused high up in the city governmentsomebody high enough to have access to an mpd helicopter claire couldnt find a flight plan or charter i grimaced and shook my head she even wondered if it was a government chopper thatd been used to extract loving and the partner but i said no it was probably private i didnt have her check police department logs my fault westerfield wasnt gloating but he liked my last sentence i said to freddy and somebody within the department would have access to police equipment too what equipment westerfield asked the senior agent answered lovings partner tried to plant trackers on cortes car earlier they were the same model thats used by the district of columbia police westerfield liked this addition too and he shot a look toward teasley questioning why this helpful piece of the puzzle had eluded her i cocked my head frowning in thought what westerfield asked just that kesslers mentioned chief of detectives lewis a few times the chiefs shown an interest in what hes doing a lot of interest i didnt think about it at the time but why would the man in charge of detectives be interested in some accounting issue that involves all the departments transport com patrol crime scene everything it seemed id made a good contribution to westerfields new case good question lewis freddy mused always wondered about him think there were some whispers in his past about what westerfield asked quickly i dont know they were whispers the government attorney now said corte look youve been so busy trying to tree loving that you dropped the ball on the primary completely treeing prey and dropping balls i supposed in court before a jury he didnt mix metaphors so relentlessly and lewis or whoevers behind this has had a chance to destroy evidence and get to other witnesses thanks to you i really think its time to hand the case over to somebody else we fell silent for a moment the sound track to our thoughts was the crackle and crash of the house dying the shouts of the firemen flashing lights rippled on every nearby leaf finally i asked jason can i talk to you we stepped aside walking with heads down away from the others about ten feet or so westerfield glanced at the embers and sparks you get any clues there nothing helpful we werent in time anybody hurt no i noted it was his first inquiry about casualties then staring at the sparks being sucked upward into the vague cloud of smoke i said you mentioned evidence that lewis might destroy a nod what if i told you that kessler has it all with him all the spreadsheets the memos the accounting books in the safe house thats right a sparkle of enthusiasm lit his eyes i lowered my voice further all right jason hows this ill admit ive been a little focused on getting loving and i havent focused on his primary as much as i shouldve a citywide financial scandal thats just the sort of thing a primaryd bring loving in for it could go way to the top go on meaning lets hear your offer what do you say to this ill get you copies of everything kessler has tonight as soon as i get back to the safe house but i keep the protection detail i control the kesslers and their whereabouts ill want to interview him i debated by secure phone not in person the us attorney chewed on a lip therell be some fallout he said you outright lied to me well deal with that afterward after lovings collared and lewiss in jail or whoever at police hq or city halls behind it a nod it amounted to a handshake he teasley and the other agents returned to the black suvs and headed off and i was treated to one of freddys particular looks the hell are you doing son i said nothing but called the safe house and asked rudy garcia for an update everythings fine sir the agent told me just checked with west virginia and the groundsre secure the fellow there said if you call in to tell you the deerre where theyre supposed to be he said youd know what that means good howre the principals holding up his voice lowered kind of a soap opera the nature of our work the husband and wife got into it again over something crazy didnt amount to squat maree wanted to take pictures of me portraits i had to tell her no and she started to well pout that womans a handful that last sentence was delivered in a whisper he continued at least the game was on baltimore that gave ryan something to do at home were an orioles family how bout you sir sorry i go for atlanta sports dont appeal to me much but spending so much time in hotel rooms and safe houses with male principals ive watched plenty of games and over the years have developed an interest in baseball i like the strategies involved football not so much garcia continued my sons only six but my wife told me he said brigham blew the game when he tried to bunt the man just doesnt know his way around a bat funny but ryan and i had just been saying the same thing and your boys just six that going to be his sport i asked soccer probably i could have mentioned that once i had coached a childrens soccer team but of course i didnt i told him id be back to the safe house as soon as i could then disconnected and called claire dubois chapter the house was small but well kept up the garden was nice i didnt know the names of the plants but in the lowvoltage landscaping lights they seemed plentiful and trimmed and subtly colorful burgundies and blues probably varieties of perennials that joanne kessler would have appreciated when we lived in woodbridge peggy had tried gardening for a season it didnt last i parked on the street and climbed out felt a bone in my back pop the smell of smoke followed me in the car id changed into a fresh pair of jeans and a sweatshirt but hadnt had a shower of course and the acrid scent from the fire at lovings rose from my skin i went to the door and knocked a pretty blonde around thirty opened it partway and peered at me cautiously from behind a thick chain i recognized her from claires research she examined my id and then still cautious asked how she could help me can i come in whats wrong is anything wrong please she let me inside this was a house of childrentoys cups crafts and clothesand she was about five or six months pregnant cheryl right her head bobbed we dont think theres anything to be concerned about words that of course made her instantly concerned her eyes widened im afraid were having some trouble getting in touch with your husband oh my god no is he hurt i told her reassuringly we have no reason to believe that he is but we cant get through on his radio tears running down her face cheryl was breathing hard as she compulsively bent down and gathered childrens pajamas and other clothes stacked on the floor id interrupted a laundry session i said we know he was running a drug surveillance operation but the dispatcher at headquarters didnt know where do you have any idea where he is did he say anything to you yes yes where she gave me the location then added but why cant you get through whats happened i dont know i said gravely but theres a mobile command post not far from there hold on ill text them i looked down at my phone and typed on the keypad hit send i could feel the electric tension as she rocked back and forth staring at the phone please then i looked up and smiled hes there hes fine the radio broke is all our supply divisions bringing a new one now oh thank you god the tears continued for a moment im sorry to have bothered you no no and hes okay yes hes fine i repeated sorry for the scare oh but do me a favor yeah sure anything hes in the middle of the surveillance operation now itd be better if you dont call him until the morning of course im so relieved i cant tell you im so relieved she repeated manically wiping tears i stepped outside and walked back to my car the gravel crunching beneath my feet and the smell of smoke wafting around me one aspect of board games that i happen to like is that you can play the part of somebody else for instance in the classic germanstyle game the settlers of catan designed by the famous klaus teuber you are just thata settler on a mythical island to win you need to develop the resources more successfully and more quickly than your opponents in agricola another germanstyle game you have fourteen turns to become the most successful farmer among your fellow players americanstyle games which tend to involve more combat than european games might give you the chance to be a general or admiral in my job as shepherd too i have to engage in fictions from time to time usually i enjoy the acting especially if it has positive results that are helpful in guarding my principals as in my performance with stu graham earlier today but there are some times when the roleplaying leaves me feeling cheap dirty the performance id just given was of this sort that it was necessary didnt lessen the probability that the womans tearful face filled with horror at the news id delivered at first would stay with me for a long time chapter at a little after pm i arrived back at the safe house in great falls and did the code ritual to lower the drawbridge once inside the compound i noted another car the engine idling it was being driven by a young associate from our organization he spotted me shut the engine off and climbed out the trim african american about thirty gave a nod and joined me at the steps to the porch i could see his nose twitch as he got close and realized that id grown accustomed to the smell of scorch i couldnt sense it any longer hello geoff corte you okay fine i glanced into his car in whose front seat was another young man with a round crewcut head and eyes that took me in briefly and then returned to scanning the property we waited out here like you said geoff had picked up an fbi special agent named tony barr at a rendezvous point halfway between here and his house a place that freddy and i had agreed on since the truce with westerfield was pretty tenuous id decided i wasnt going to give anybody outside my organization the location of the safe house directly i was afraid the us attorney might find out and descend in person to interview his new star witness in the mpd financial scam case theres also my general reluctance to give away information of any kind id i asked with loving involved you could never be too cautious but geoff said that freddys office had sent our office a picture of barr and that facial recognition confirmed he was the agent impression nodding toward the front seat military focused tactical time under his belt didnt talk much freddy had given barr high marks hang tight for a minute both of you sure corte i walked to the front door hit the keypad and opened it i was pleased the kesslers were not within earshot maree either ahmad and garcia were theyd known that the car was from headquarters but didnt know why it was here i said to rudy garcia talk to you for a minute sure sir i told ahmad to do a perimeter check and he headed out immediately i talked to agent fredericks on the way over here i said to garcia yessir i mean corte hes relieving you of duty the man was silent the stillness in his face was the equivalent to a gasp of shock im sorry sir i dont understand i went to see your wife cheryl about a half hour ago at your house his jaw drooped a bit you when i called earlier you told me youd talked to her about your son and the gamethats how i knew so i went to see her he realized where this was going id said no personal communications from the safe house none i its just shes pregnant i like to check on her it was like for three minutes i used a cold phone i told her i needed to find you something was wrong she told me you were in great falls off harper road i didnt mention the shock and dismay the woman had felt when id flashed the id and told her that her husband had gone missing his round face grew puffier it seemed and ruddy his eyes scanned the floor i i didnt even think about it oh shit she just asked whether i was in south east or some dangerous place i just said it was like a bedandbreakfast in great falls christ do you think loving picked it up no on the way here id had hermes run a signal scan around the garcia house if loving had been eavesdropping the receiver would still be there to collect any new information there was no evidence that hed planted anything nearby realistically loving probably had no idea who garcia was or what job he was assigned to nor could he track down his wife but that was beside the point is she agent fredericks had her picked up and moved to a safe location with your children im going to move you there too to be with her well keep you both incommunicado until the jobs concluded nodding miserable im sorry sir i dont know what to say this is all new to me this protection work it was of course but his offense had nothing to do with the job of being a shepherd or clone it was that he hadnt obeyed the orders id given him which were about as simple as they come i dont want to get fired sir i cant i love my job i understand rudy were simply relieving you of this detail im not going to write you up what happens to your career is between you and agent fredericks now get your things together my associate outsidell take you to your wife and kids yessir thanks for not being a hardass sir he didnt know that my generosity was rooted in simple selfinterest i couldnt afford to have a disgruntled former employeeone who knew the location of my principals even if he was in lockdown not until the job was over after that i didnt care if he got booted or not id recommend to freddy that he should be fired efficiency rational strategies a moment later joanne burst into the hallway she walked up to me blinking at the smell and what i supposed was the soot on my skin she blurted my stepdaughter how is she ryan joined us too eyebrows raised id called them from the car of course to tell them about the successful escape from carters and that both he and amanda were now safe but the parents would want more details and reassurance i told them what id done putting amanda in detention joanne was saying i wanted to talk to her i tried the phone but it wasnt working for the time being i dont want anybody in communication with her i want to keep her location completely secret whats the problem with me talking to her she might mention where she is why cant we know ryan asked loving recognizes her value as an edge over you i dont even want a hint of it on the airwaves we know shes completely safe carters with her and theyre in lockdown i thought you didnt want to use a slammer joanne said i noted how quickly shed caught on to the terms of our art normally i wouldnt but circumstances changed to reassure them i added she seemed to be doing better than carter what he said about her having grit thats true ryan was drinking coffee i couldnt smell liquor i said to both him and his wife we can eliminate the graham case whatd you find i explained about grahams son forging the check adding because he didnt want to go back to college joanne shook her head dismayed perhaps at the dysfunction of a family that required the children to engage in such tactics massaging his game leg ryan said most kids just drop out they dont commit felonies across state lines its still a crime even if he withdraws i could go after the kid anyway i hesitated for a moment then asked you met graham what did you think of him a prick kessler seemed to get what i was saying he nodded i dont blame the boy for doing his own thing i think ill just let it go joanne wondered aloud who called to pressure ryans department not to pursue the case somebody powerful probably one of grahams bosses at the department of defense doesnt matter at this point its a nonissue without a glance my way rudy garcia left i walked to the door and watched him get into the car and gestured tony barr inside i introduced the quiet unsmiling fbi agent to my principals and lyle ahmad whowith a nod from megestured him aside to give him the details of the procedures we followed in the safe house he caught on right away and i was pleased freddy had recommended him i then said ryan i need you to do me a favor sure what all the files on that administrative matter youre handling the you mean that accounting crap he waved his hand toward the dining room table covered with police department files exactly i need copies sent to a us attorney joanne said you mean you think thats the reason somebody wants ryan hes uncovered something illegal something within the department no i said then joanne asked i thought how best to describe my strategy with westerfield i came up with i need to toss a dog a bone chapter though neither was aware of it joanne and her husband frowned in identical ways normally i dont share much of my strategy with my principals but now i thought it was prudent to let them know what was going on i explained to them that when id been talking to claire dubois about the trackers just before we met at the hyatt it had indeed occurred to me that ryans accounting assignment might be the reason hed been targeted i had my associate look into that checking out chief of detectives lewis the police chief himself people on the commission even a few people in city hall but i added dubois had found no evidence of any malfeasance shed spoken to dozens of officers and administrators within the department armed with her pen and calculator what westerfield and teasley had found the money shifting from one account to another seemed to dubois to be innocent it was ryan confirmed frowning yeah some money went to the wrong accounts but it just sat there until somebody found it and then got transferred back thats why i was involvednot investigating just coming up with better procedures to move cash between the various departments well the us attorney thought it was a chance for a great political corruption prosecution i didnt let on that it was a dead end i kind of egged him on when he started down that path i didnt mention to the kesslers that freddy had caught on and helped i dont know they were whispers joanne said dont you people work together a good question and the answer was not always ryan shrugged ill send him whatever you need sure everything only the most impenetrable first he gave a smile westerfields going to want to talk to you too just tell him the truth let him sort it out but be a little mysterious ryan offered thatd be great think back to any conspiracy theory books youve read joanne remained for a moment standing awkwardly shoulders forward i knew she wanted to call amanda but i couldnt let her i didnt want anybody other than my contacts at the slammer in loudoun to know the girl and carter were there she didnt ask again though just said good night then headed down the hall i noted marees computer sitting on the couch shed probably gone to bed too i was suddenly aware that with the young woman absent the safe house was oddly sedate whatever else you could say about her maree livened up the assignment like no other principal id ever had mr tour guide ryan brought all the files into the den where i was sitting and checking emails he began to organize them and set them in neat stacks on the desk heres the first batch he said he dove back in the defensiveness and hostility from when wed met were gone completely ask you a personal question corte normally that sets off klaxons but for some reason i said sure howd you get into this babysitting job wait is that an insult not to me right he laughed howd you get into it were you like somebodys personal bodyguard or anything the short answer is i got arrested an amused glance now that deserves an explanation ryan limped to the kitchen called coffee sure i replied he brought me a large mug remembering i liked it black so ryan continued to leaf through his documents i explained how id started orienteering at the university of texas in austin and had gotten interested in sign cutting he frowned at that and i explained tracking like indians he asked exactly well one weekend i drove down to san antonio for an orienteering competition it was a long one all day id hit the halfway control point and id decided to take a different route to the next point not the straightest one sometimes the straightest take a lot longer well i was moving through some brush and heard what i thought was somebody crying i went to see and i found a family they were obviously illegals whod come over the rio grande sometime in the past day i thought maybe one of them was hurt so i went up to them you speak spanish it helps in texas and in my present line of work guess it would i was in competition gearlike a tracksuitso they didnt think i was police i asked what was wrong they said some men were after them theyd stolen the fathers walletall his savingsand tried to rape the couples teenage daughter the father grabbed one of the mens guns and they fled but the men were after them i had my mobile and i said id call for help they panicked at that and begged me not to because they were illegals and because the attackers were our guys border patrol ah the familyd managed to lose them but they were getting close i could see four or five of them following the trail theres sign cutting but theres also sign pushing cutting is looking for sign pushing is catching the person who left the sign thats what the officers were doingthey were coming to get the family i knew whatd happen if they found them we could see them about a half mile from where we were hiding we that sort of tells me where this is going i couldnt leave them theyd be killed for sure so i led them away covering up the signs as best i could it was kind of a catandmouse chase but we escaped about three hours later i got them to san antonio and a refuge at a church i was twentythree then and most of my life had been in academia that afternoon had been hands down the most exhilarating experience id ever had you said you got arrested im not sure you really did anything wrong you could have just said you didnt know they were illegal technically you were just helping out some people get away from some attackers i didnt mention that we found one of the agents had driven ahead through an arroyo the only way we could get out of there was with wheels i was afraid the father would shoot the agent so i took the gun snuck up behind the agent and stole his jeep and weapon okay thats arrestable ryan said after i dropped the family off at the church i threw the gun in a lake and left the jeep in a grocery store lot caught a cab back to the orienteering course howd they catch you stub check i explained its a safety procedure in orienteering officials compare the starting stubs with the control cards at the finish if somebody doesnt make it to the end they send out searchers to look for you the border patrol agents had seen the checkpoint flagstheyre orange and white hard to missand found out about the competition they tracked me down at school the next day arrested me and the case went to an fbi agent who was in town from dc agent fredericks the one im working with now but if youre a federal officer now you couldntve been convicted of a felony turned out that freddy was in texas to investigate cases of border patrol officers robbing and assaulting illegals so instead of a defendant i became a witness helped get four convictions and the illegals i gave him a smile somehow i forgot where id taken them good for you i finished up a degree or two and started teaching but i couldnt quite get that weekend out of my head a few years later i called agent fredericks and he put me in touch with some folks at diplomatic security in washingtonstate departmentand i signed on and spent a few years with them protecting our people at embassies and foreigners in the us eventually i didnt want to travel so much id heard about the outfit i work for now joined them and ive been there ever since ryan finished assembling the material to send to westerfield it looked to be about two hundred sheets cluttered with numbers and charts that were incomprehensible to me perfect i told him ask you a question corte sure how many of your principals you told that story to i answered honestly none he grinned how much of its true the whole shebang i said monday remember that this is a game of defense as well as offense and be prepared to protect the areas which you occupy from the instructions to the board game risk chapter claire dubois called just before am what she had to tell me was illuminating and discouraging i took down the information and went into the kitchen where the table covered with a yellow gingham cloth was littered with breakfast bagels cream cheese jam both of my principals were drinking mugs of coffee joanne was sitting at a laptop staring intently at the screen she gave me a quick look of greeting but returned immediately to the computer wheres maree i asked still asleep ryan said ive just heard from claire i told them grimly its not your other case the detective asked the clarence brown scam i mean pamuk hes not the primary but he has to be ryan said dismayed i thought so too i said but its not a ponzi scheme pamuks business is legitimate but the fake companies the fake name how can it be legitimate his name was legally changed and all the doingbusinessas certificates have been duly filed its true the investments were made through shell companies but it seems thats not a crime pamuks outfit is financially solid the books are solid it all checks out ryan asked what about the people who wanted their money back pamuk kept stalling some of them have been paid the others will be in the next few days we got information from interpol economic crimes they were in contact with forensic accountants and securities people in london new york paris and the grand caymans they put the company through an x ray ryan laughed sourly i tried for weeks to get the international boys to talk to me the french never even returned my calls neither did anybody in georgetown you carry more weight than us dc gumshoes it looks like i remembered the cops sour characterization of his status in the department small potatoes joanne lifted her head showing modest interest but returned to the computer i wondered what held her attention so raptly she couldnt go online so it had to be files stored on the hard drive i continued heres what happened pamuk sends his investors money to the middle east through dozens of shell corporations registered in america europe and asia right to fund terror operations you were thinking no its all real equity and debt investing he did it that way because he honestly feels that arab companies are solid ways to make money but he knows that americans might be reluctant to invest in them patriotism and some of the stockholders over there wouldnt be too crazy about knowing that their fellow investors have beer and pulled pork for dinner and go to church on sunday so he set up layers of shell companies if you dig deep enough youll find the details ryan sighed i continued if somebody wants their money out early it takes longer than with a us fund because of the layers of corporations and the laws overseas its timeconsuming but completely legal nobodys been robbed in fact the return on investment beat the standard and poors index by four percent this year no crime no reason to hire a lifter right goddamn it he muttered dead end so there we were one of the best lifters in the business was after ryan kessler it wasnt because of his two major active cases and it wasnt the administrative work he was doing game theory accounts for both unknowns and knowns in the equation you dont know how the dice will fall what card will be the next you pick up or are dealt you dont know what strategy your opponent will select for the next move your trembling hand sometimes makes you move in error but one thing you always know is who your opponent is what goal he seeks this game though was different i didnt know the opponentonly the playing piece the knight or rook henry loving and i didnt know the object of the game were we playing bridge arimaa backgammon go the game of life poker unknowns complete unknowns ryan kessler massaged his bad leg and stared at the painting above the fireplace more fat horses with skinny legs maybe it is one of the smaller cases i didnt think so but that could be it the identity theft or the credit cards then a voice behind us joannes said firmly no its none of those ryan and i both turned to her ive got the answer she whispered looking up from the computer and waving at it contemptuously its not ryan that lovings after its my sister hes after my goddamn sister chapter ryan was frowning maree it cant be her her last name isnt even kessler joanne looked my way did anybody actually see the phrase get ryan kessler in that email you were talking about i asked the goahead order no but it said kessler and gave your address joanne countered which is how youd describe where marees been living i considered this true but why do you think its her she nodded at the computer her sisters mar left it out here last night i remembered seeing it when id come back from garcias house joanne said i wondered if andrew was behind this i wanted to see if there was anything in her saved emails that suggested that her husband glanced my way andrew is that possible i said no we checked him out i had my associate look into him as soon as i heard his name mentioned in the car on saturday remember i told maree she should call him i did that to capture his phone number claire checked him out hes cleanfrom our perspective hes got some assault charges two battery domestic abuse counts a few years ago some restraining orders but he has no connection to henry loving joanne said im not talking about andrew i found something else look she spun the computer toward us i saw the global software innovations logo on the screen as joanne opened folders with the editing and archiving software she called up some of her sisters recent photographsthe series in downtown dc which included the pictures i had helped her choose from she paused at another image one id looked at but had paid no attention to it was also of two men engaged in a serious conversation as they sat at an outdoor café somewhere near the mall one appeared to be in his late fifties the other about twenty years younger the background was blurredintentionally out of focus i judgedand the intense faces of the men took the viewers attention you see anything unusual joanne asked i studied the picture carefully then i noticed that the older man was dropping something into the hand of the younger one it was impossible to see for certain what it might be but it looked like a thumb drive for a computer i asked her if thats what she meant yes so ryan asked his wife continued dont you recognize the older man no i said should i ryan shook his head martin allende he was on the news last week joanne explained that he was a colombian diplomat suspected of laundering al qaeda money through banks in his country i took her word for it i had only a vague memory of a passing news report joanne added that the story reported no charges could be brought because authorities couldnt find a trail to the terrorists or offshore banks maree got a picture of him with his contactthe younger man she raged i saw her hands were shaking in anger thats why theyre after her to get her camera computer find out if she made any copies see if she took any more pictures the terrorist cell is worried that somebody in national securitythe cia the fbi intelligence assessmentcould identify who allendes with remember the man who bumped into maree knocked her down i bet it was to grab something from her purse find out her address i looked closely at the picture i leaned over plugged a cable into her computer and downloaded the picture to my phone wrote out instructions to dubois and uploaded the email with the phone joanne was sitting forward the numbness masking her face all weekend was now gone she was furious her face flushed eyes flaring my little innocent sister poking her nose where it doesnt belong does she ever use her fucking brain what did she think would happen when she started taking pictures of people in public did she ever think that might be a stupid idea i wondered if she was heading for the predicted breakdown shed bottled her feelings up since saturday morning the explosion loomed id seen it happen dozens of times well find out i said nodding at the phone she never thinks there could be consequences and whos taking the shit us our daughter was almost killed because of her because i took her in no good deed goes unpunished right i didnt even want her in my house its been the worst month of my life she lectures about the sanctity of art but she cant even afford to pay for the food she eats ever since she moved in ryan and ive been at each others throats its been a fucking nightmare jo her husband said she snapped i should let her go back to andrew they fucking deserve each other let him beat some sense into her a piercing alarm made us all start ryan reached for his weapon and i went for mine though i recognized the tone it wasnt a breakin but the emergency door release somebody inside had hit it to get out ahmad appeared immediately holding a black m bushmaster the stock racked short his finger outside the trigger guard tony barr pistol in hand was behind him i held up a hand oh no joanne whispered eyes wide she was looking out the window to the side porch where maree stood staring back through the glass the younger sister had heard every hard word uttered about her her face twisted in pain continued to stare for a moment then she turned away and fled down the porch and over the lawn toward the woods no please maree no joanne leapt up stay here i said firmly i told ahmad and barr to secure the principals and sprinted outside tucking my gun away chapter the dea agent i became friendly with in texas told me that when sign cutting and tracking it helps to know the goal of the person youre pursuing some of the people youre after have in mind nothing more than being anywhere that youre not theyll escape wherever they can however they can those are the hardest to track the easiest to find are those who have a destination that you know or can deduce i believed maree had such a place in mind i needed to find her path though because there were a number of specific places she might head for i absolutely had to get there before she did i paused at the edge of the forest and looked around me at the puzzle of tree trunks and branches and foliage much of the greenery had been cut away to provide a clear view around the house a perimeter for security purposes but beyond that a lot of the area was impenetrable i spotted overturned branches leaves disturbed pebbles slightly out of place and then a few good prints from stylish shoes i began to sprint a hundred yards into the trees i gave up on looking for sign i no longer needed to since i heard maree pushing relentlessly through the brush that wasnt all i heard growing in my ears was a roarbearing out my deduction about where she was headed a few moments later i broke from the woods into a clearing and saw the young woman ahead of meknowing how to move quickly through the foliage id closed the distance but she was still a hundred feet away looking back she saw me and stopped as a shepherd ive pursued many people until they cease running usually its because theyve run out of feasible routes or out of gasoline or physical stamina on occasion they stopped simply because theyd reached their destination maree was on the edge of a rock cliff overlooking the source of the noise the potomac river the woman who had twice tried to kill herself was looking down at the water cascading over the stones below it was only thirty or forty feet to the surface but the river here was strewn with rocks and the current was swift and deep this seemed the perfect setting for somebody who wished to take her life i moved in closer slowly i didnt want her to spook she sat down looked back at me with a hollow red face and slipped over the edge i gasped and ran forward but then her head emerged and i realized shed slid down to a rocky outcropping below the side of the cliff she was just sitting there on a shelf jutting over the boulders and speedy water i continued forward slowly noticing some people on the distant shore of the river tourists strolling along the path there which bordered the chesapeake and ohio canal which travels all the way from georgetown to cumberland maryland i got to the edge and looked down at the turbulent brown and gray water the froth the shiny rocks to my right maree was huddled on the ledge legs crossed like a yoga practitioners maree i said she was fiddling with her camera i moved in closer and made sure she saw my slow unthreatening transit toward her i stopped when i was about twenty feet away at the top of the cliff and also satpartly so that i wouldnt be seen as a threat and partly because i myself am not a great fan of heights she glanced toward me and turned her attention back to the canon she lifted it and took some panoramic pictures of the view then aimed down at the rocks below her then curiously she turned the lens to her face which was puffy and damp with tears hopeless even over the roar of the water i could hear the click of the camera maree she said nothing but continued to shoot she then turned toward me and took a picture i gave no reaction and she leaned back against the rock i looked at her haunted eyes was she about to take her own life maree id like you back inside now finally she called its beautiful here you gave me my moneys worth for the tour please how would this be for a photo series eerily the sisters had swapped roles joanne was the emotional one now whipped into a frenzy maree was the opposite numb calm too calm what do you think she continued a series of images of someone falling into the water i wonder how long the camera would keep shooting i could put it on automatic but i suppose the battery would short out pretty soon how long do you think it would last maree come on back not very long but the picturesd be stored on the chip its hard to get a gallery show hard to sell your images but ill bet that seriesd be a winner put me on the map my job is to keep my principals safe from everything even their own selfdestructive behaviors which was often the hardest part in the extreme circumstances of the world i operate in its not unusual for people to consider suicide none of my principals has ever gone forward with the act but ive known shepherds who have lost people to their own hand usually its on longer assignments when the days of seclusion amble slowly into months and the principals begin to hear more and more frequently sounds that are innocent enough but that they take to be lifters or hitters getting close for the kill more insidious is their own reasoning convincing themselves that the life theyve lived is over with that family and friends will fade away that they have nothing to look forward to and for the rest of their days theyll be pursued death is a peaceful alternative in marees case she was starting from a disadvantage her selfdestructive nature falling for abusive boyfriends neglecting to provide for the basics in her life jumping from caretaker to caretaker who in fact only took advantage of her and then got tired when the appeal of the flirt the cuteness the artiness wore off she looked down at the water i rose carefully and walked a little closer then sat down again dont worry im not trained to tackle people and save them from ledges the fact is im fucking scared to be up here her look said spare the jokes mr tour guide then she regarded the distance between us and judged it seemed that she could still leap into the water if i did rush her and continued to aim her camera and press the shutter neither of us said anything for a moment i broke the embargo whatever your sister was saying we dont know for sure that it was your pictures images we call them images im getting more information but it does make sense doesnt it taking pictures of people who wanted to stay anonymous sticking my nose into other peoples business she added bitterly its a possibility i wasnt going to coddle her im surprised you didnt think of that corte you think of everything else im surprised i didnt think of it either i was being honest my investigation into maree had ended when we cleared andrew as the possible primary she took more pictures i want to say something i told her its important under these circumstances she said with a dark grin one wouldnt really expect unimportant now would one one of the hardest things i have to teach my principals is that it doesnt matter if theyre at fault for being targeted or not a lot of times they areits because they did something wrong that im looking after them but yes or no thats irrelevant to me every principal has the right to stay safe and alive if you committed a crime you can pay for that in court if you did something that was morally wrong youll answer one way or another none of thats my business all i care about is keeping you alive so that you can go forward with your lifewhether thats prison or a happy retirement but what about what i want corte i lifted an eyebrow what if i dont want to stay safe whats in it for me whats back there that i could possibly want a nod toward the safe house your family two people who dont care whether i live or die of course they do maree if im involved that means this is the worst time peopleve ever gone through and ever will they say terrible things when theyre under protection but they dont mean it its the fear talking the frustration a few minutes passed and i studied the river ive had principals at this safe house maybe three dozen times and ive walked the entire perimeter looking it over for offensive and defensive positions ordered trees taken down or plantings put in but i must say that for all my love of orienteering and sign cutting and hiking ive never actually taken time to enjoy the place i turned back and noticed she was rubbing her arm why did andrew hurt you her head dipped didnt buy the rude businessman thing hm no howd you guess ive been doing this a long time i suspected shed stonewall but i was surprised she answered almost immediately the question is what didnt i do an odd laugh humorless and stone calm and you know corte the scary thing is i cant remember i probably didnt cook the right dinner or i cooked the right dinner but the wrong way or i drank too much wine when his friends were over i dont know all i know is he grabbed me grabbed and twisted a tendon popped she was gripping the joint i cried that night most of the night not because it hurt but because i was thinking i knew some peoples elbows get hurt doing things like skiing or windsurfing with the people they love but not me no no i got hurt because somebody i loved wanted to hurt me staring down at her camera but lifes all about tradeoffs isnt it i mean who ever gets a hundred percent i get excitement energy passion some women get boredom and drunks she didnt look back to the safe house id rather have the thrill and a bruise now and then a breathy laugh escaped her narrow pink lips how politically incorrect is that but there it is im honest at least i debated a moment a long moment and an intense debate i eased down to the ledge and sat beside her she made no effort to move away it was a very small space and our legs touched firmly i hated being up here and i had to admit i liked the comfort of the proximity i considered how much to tell her i decided on a quantity and said i got married just after i graduated jo said youre single now i wondered if youd ever been married the way you looked at amanda it was the way a father or uncle looks at a child you had children i again hesitated and finally nodded but it was clear from my expression that i wasnt going to talk about that maree sensed shed stepped over a line she started to say something but didnt i continued quickly after wed been married a few years we had a situation there was a man from my wifes past who became a problem maree may have noted that i said wife and not ex which imparted some information to her she was smarter than the package suggested she frowned her sympathy which i didnt respond to theyd worked together i hesitated they were both single they went out a few times they spent the night once or twice maree seemed almost amused at my delicate euphemism this was a few years before peggy and i met temper problem too this guy like andrew no nicest guy in the world i met him you met him they were in the same profession saw each other occasionally peggy and he had done their residencies at the same hospital i didnt give maree these details though they broke up and she met me after a couple of years he showed up again just called to say hi see if they could have coffee a drink for old times sake but little by little it got to be strange he began calling more frequently leaving messages innocent at first then getting slightly more aggressive when she didnt call back then he started calling me and showing up at the house he even called i stopped speaking for a moment i said then the serious stalking began i was silent recalling those days seeing peggys face the faces of the boys too very young but prescient and intuitive the way children are theyd been scared i realized finally what the problem was i told maree it wasnt him it was my wife she was treating him like a normal human being polite giving him the benefit of the doubt humoring him she was a good person just thinking about who hed been when theyd been going out charming and funny but that was the past when all this happened he wasnt a normal human being he was something else you cant be friends with a shark or a rabid dog maree thats where you get into trouble andrews a different kind of danger but that doesnt matter anyone who isnt good for you is as dangerous as henry loving i felt her hand take mine for such delicate appendages her fingers were surprisingly warm on this chill morning can i ask what happened i shrugged looking over the water it finally ended i added it became a police matter neither of us moved for a long moment maree turned and her arms snaked around me and we were gripping each other hard she kissed me gently at first and then with more passion and desperation then with a smile she eased back slightly and slipped my hands inside her jacket against her breasts i felt a complicated bra she pressed closer and kissed me again more playfully this time her tongue flavored with cloves or cinnamon then she sat back and took my hand in both of hers jo says i like bad boys thats one of my problems andrews a bad boy she looked at me and i believed the sparkle in her eyes came from something other than the transit of cloud beneath the hazy sun youre one too corte youre a bad boy but i think youre a good bad boy i recalled that id recently been remembering that peggy had said much the same about me lets go back in you dont want to stay out here and enjoy the view i smiled duty first i rose and pulled her to her feet and we headed back to the house you ever take time off corte sometimes what do you do i like to play games which she seemed to think was very funny chapter when we returned to the house i punched in the code and the door unlocked inside we were greeted by two solemn faces staring our way her face white mouth open joanne looked at her sister and walked forward im so sorry joanne whispered she tentatively touched marees arms and then stepped back marees face was neutral neither accepting nor rejecting the apology mar look i was possessed i was so upset amanda the young woman shrugged walked to her computer picked it up she flopped down on the couch and scanned through it this was something else id noticed that my principals had done more and more recently in the safe house and halfway motels withdrawn into their cyberwombs joanne continued please say something ill be moving out when we get out of prison her voice was eerily soft she continued to look through the files of pictures images we call them images joanne lowered her head about to say something more but couldnt conjure the words it was then that my own computer pinged i stepped into the den it was an email from claire dubois with i hoped an answer to what id had her research when joanne had told us about the colombian diplomat i was prepared for some of the contents the rest was a bit of a shock i stared at the screen for some moments then printed out the documents and returned to the living room as i did my face must have revealed something because i found the mood in the room had changed from recrimination and contritionin varying degrees of sincerityto intense anticipation as they gazed at me i read through the four or five pages carefully once more then i glanced toward my principals its not maree she has nothing to do with loving joanne sighed i just thought because of allende i continued my associate just talked to some people involved in the investigation they know the man in the picture hes allendes mistresss son has nothing to do with any illegal operations he was sharing music downloads on the thumb drive even if they saw maree was taking pictures they wouldnt have an interest in hiring loving to get any information from her and his phones and travel records are clean joanne shook her head she may have continued to speak i didnt know i was reading the rest of the documents dubois had sent a third time now just to make sure they drooped in my hand my associate found something else i told them what ryan wanted to know he was absently massaging his game leg the answerwhy henry lovings been hired i looked up toward joanne she froze her eyes regarded the sheets in my hand as if she were identifying the body of a loved one in a low grim voice very different from her tone throughout the past few days joanne said to me its not a problem corte its been looked into maree stared at her sister ryan took in joannes face flushed lips taut he asked her what are you talking about i was the person who answered henry lovings after your wife not you chapter what he laughed an endless moment followed during which no one spoke no one moved the only sound was the wind and the clatter of the automatic ice maker in the refrigerator shaking her head joanne walked to the window i studied her cool eyes as a number of mysteries fell into place maree asked what do you mean corte what does jo have to do with this i didnt answer jo maree snapped jo say something whats he talking about well i asked her firmly i needed answers and i needed them now again her voice steady and chill she said i told you corte its been looked into theres no problem forget it ryan muttered looked into she ignored him and spoke to me dont you think it was the first thing that occurred to me as soon as i heard there was a possibility of a lifter the minute i heard i made the call thereve been a dozen people looking into it theyve found nothing not a thing henry loving only works for people who make it very very difficult to find out anything about them she answered calmly and the people im talking about are very very good too jo what is this her husband said mystified why didnt you tell me i asked her her face was a mask of disgust why i repeated i am not allowed to tell you she said in a raw tone somebody answer my fucking question ryan snapped his perplexed humor had evaporated honey ry im so sorry i just cant its very complicated uncomplicate it no bullshit tell me joanne asked can i see what you have i handed the pages to her her first reaction was professional squinting she skimmed through the printouts the header on each top secret a cliché yet in fact the highest document security classification that the us government uses a nod how did you get into these servers she shook her head never mind never mind a sigh i suppose i knew from the beginning that it would come to this i said to her sister and husband it looks like someone from joannes past is responsible for hiring henry loving maree said you mean like a boyfriend or something thinking of our prior conversation on the ledge i imagined i glanced toward joanne giving her the option to talk i sensed she was ready to surrender no tearsthat in fact had been another clue to the truth id missed i can count on my principals to cry at least a few times especially after an assault but not joanne i realized now that her expressions and demeanor of the past few daysthe numbness the blank gazewerent because the sheltered housewife with an abhorrence of violence had fallen into this horrific incomprehensible situation she was simply unemotional because of her training or her nature probably both joanne said evenly to her husband and sister hes talking about my job maree said your job you crunched numbers for the department of transportation no i did work for the government but it was with a different group she looked at me grimacing i know how you figured it out i mentioned intelligence assessment right i couldnt believe i said it out loud i was mad i was emotional i didnt think youd notice thats it theyre worried that somebody in national securitythe cia the fbi intelligence assessmentcould identify who allendes with the governments intelligence assessment department is a very small federal agency with very large computers located in sterling virginia the iads purpose is to maintain files of names faces physical attributes and personal preferences of national security threats and to analyze data about all of the above if anybodys ever wondered why the cia or the military can be so certain that one bearded thirtyyearold on the streets of kabul is an innocent businessman and to our western eyes an identical one a block away is an al qaeda operative iad is the reason however nobody outside the highest levels of government security knows it exists no news story would have reported about it there was no way joanne could even have heard of iad let alone know that it could identify the man in the pictures with allende unless she had some clandestine connection with highlevel national security operations it had raised my suspicions my encrypted message to dubois after joanne had found the picture on her sisters computer had been not only to have orc analyze the photos but to see if anybody had made an iad request about allende and his associate in the past twelve hours and if so could that request somehow be linked to joanne kessler dubois had earlier of course run the basic profile of the womanlearning about her scholastic and professional histories as well as things like her car accident but if joanne knew about iad that suggested to me the public information could be a cover and that her real job history and profile would be in classified archives and records so you do your homework do you whatd you find out about me no wonder shed asked the question dubois reported that yes this morning somebody with a high clearance had submitted an iad request to identify two people in a photograph that had been uploaded from an unknown location the analysis was pending regarding joanne kesslers real résumé well that had taken some true finesse to find aaron ellis had helped dubois explained in her email and hed pulled in some markers from langley and fort meade ryan blurted but your job i went to see you we had lunch a half dozen times we went to air and space we went to the national gallery i walked you back to the office the highways analysis bureau on twentysecond street i was there honey the endearment seemed to jar it it was a cover he asked you were with the cia something like that like that maree was getting worked up now nothing flighty or youthful about the woman any longer youre still not giving us any details jo stoic now as if she were speaking before a congressional committee she said my organization was involved in domestic national security projects what does that mean ryan was trying desperately to reconcile this information with accounts of her life shed told him earlier what was true and what wasnt how deep did the lies go hed be thinking of places she said shed been people she said shed known was there some honesty in the stories that could legitimize their marriage and family because thats what was at risk now of course for her part joanne would be considering exactly what and how much she could tell himwhich in theory was nothing the british have their official secrets act which forbids government employees from talking about their activities while they were in the employ of certain agencies we dont have quite such a grandly named law but similar regulations are in effect shed already committed federal offenses by her disclosures here in this rustic cozy living room if she went further the crimes would be compounded significantly i understood but ryan kessler was no fool he investigated crimes and he put people in jail for a living the pieces were coming togetheryes slowly and in a patchwork way but he had a clue as to where this was going in a whisper he asked there was something going on when we met you talked about a boyfriend you were breaking up with youd call him occasionally late at night but he wasnt your lover was he you worked with him right yes i called him my former boyfriend but that was part of the cover joanne was slumped forward shoulders drooping it was a confessional pose we were supposed to talk about each other like exlovers those were operational rules her sister broke in i dont understand any of this jo youre talking like you were in the army like dad used to talk joanne surprised me at least by laughing dad funny you should mention him hes the one who helped me get into my organization right after college but you backpacked through europe no mar the post cards were fake i went to a training center in the states i cant say anything more about it as often happened in this line of work i realized that one of my principals was speaking to someone else in the room through a third party doing this seems easier it was safer for joanne to confess to her sister than to her husbandthe person she was really communicating with id learned that when it comes to deception we believe that the gravity of the sin depends not on the nature of the lie but on the person lied to but ryan asked directly projects jo national security projects she finally turned to face him held his eyes we did risk assessment then she took a deep breath and i knew that the complete truth was about to come out she added in a voice that was barely audible and we did risk elimination you and your partner partners she corrected i was active for eight years i had a number of partners maree said for gods sake jo tell me in english what you mean risk assessment risk elimination ryan kessler said evenly maree your sister killed people chapter ryan dont be crazy thats bullshit of course she didnt jo tell us what were you really doing but it was the truth i understood joannes federal government employment history had been hidden very efficiently of course dubois hadnt found anything specific about what the woman or her coworkers did but you could deduce their mission from what my protégée did uncover the groups funding lavish and murkily channeled through nonexistent government agencies and jurisdictionin the us only office leasing and travel authorizations its history was enlightening too the organization was created two weeks after the first trade towers bombing in new york in the s and their budget and personnel were doubled after the african embassy bombings and tripled after the attack on the cole after the budget increased ten times but the real key was that in the archives dubois had found unsigned legal opinion letters from government attorneys they discussed at length the standards for justifiable homicide in all states and the district of columbia and general guidelines for deciding when to refer a death to the prosecutors office and when not to there were also memos about procedures at hundreds of coroners and medical examiners offices around the country joannes operations would have involved staging deaths to appear to be suicides accidents random crimes of violence and selfdefense i thought back to what ryan had told me when id first arrived at their house on saturday morning you know corte this world what you and i do joanne cant handle it well things freak her out things we dont even think about ryan whispered did you did you do it yourself no shaking her head joanne sucked in a great breath she started to speak and her voice caught then she started again we were anchorstwoperson teams we ran a thirdparty contractor he was the active party but i was on site i gave the order jo her sister gasped you didnt you couldnt have yes i did mar yes i did i was there when it happened a dozen times more i was there absolute silence ryan seemed paralyzed it was maree who moved closer and took her sisters arm its all right its okay you didnt want to do it you got sucked in they do that see businesses and governmentwhat i tell you all the time they suck you right in get you to do things you dont want to do joanne was looking at her sisters hand as it kneaded her forearm she said oh but i did want to do it mar its what dad wanted me to do and what i wanted be a patriot doing something good ryan asked a dozen times more i ran twentytwo assignments you killed twentytwo people some were multiple target assignments but some were also renditions for interrogation oh jesus christ ryan muttered jesus then some silence passed and he asked after we met did you keep doing it no well for about a year i was active but i didnt run any operations i told them no they wanted me to but i told them no theyd want her because she was good i surmised then she turned to me really corte the people in my organization have looked into everything theres no connection between any of my assignments and henry loving i left six years ago it makes no sense for anybody to target me now ryan kessler was then staring out the window and from the icy smile on his face i saw that his thoughts had arrived where mine had been for the past ten minutes or so he asked his wife were you doing this when i met you joanne swallowed her face flushed i told you i was active for a year but i didnt no i mean the day i met you jo when she said nothing he continued oh my god at the deli you were on assignment joanne lowered her eyes i supposed that the owner and his wife were probably key in some terrorist cell joanne and the partner had been ordered to eliminate them they had gone into the deli and as soon as it was clear they called in the contractor who was fronting as a robber for the security camera he killed the couple the plan would have been for him to flee and joanne and the partner would give statements to the police describing the incident as a robbery gone bad only detective ryan kessler had heard the shots and raced into the store the hero it wasnt some crankhead from south east who shot me it was your fucking hit man now emotion bled into joannes voice i checked the police schedule a dozen times nobody was supposed to be nearby you were the one in charge she sighed like me she knew what was coming i was primary anchor on that one yes the anchor gives the whatd you call it a shoot order we dont call it that but i gave the order yes and you also gave him the order to shoot me joanne started to speak but her voice choked to a stop we had to get our contractor out of there i used a code it means to use nonlethal force on an innocent we never would have done it if you hadnt been armed but all of a sudden there you were there was a crash and i jumped at the sound maree had leapt to her feet and a wineglass and coffee cup had tumbled to the floor and shattered she stepped forward and leaned into her sisters face joanne looked down as maree raged you go off on me because i end up with a boyfriend you dont like you say those terrible things about me being irresponsible and you her voice choked you murdered people for a living joanne said nothing but looked away i saw her fists were kneading and fingers white maree spun around and stomped up the hallway to the bedroom ryan shook his head and said to joanne i didnt rescue you i didnt rescue anybody i oh honey a million times i tried to tell you i so you went out with me for sympathy out of guilt no i went out with you because i wanted to change i wanted a real life a normal life i wanted you you were good you did the right thing i couldnt live with what my organization was doing anymore she moved her hand toward him he eased away he stepped into the kitchen snagged the whiskey bottle that had been untouched for a day and vanished down the hall the bedroom door closed though i expected a slam i knew it was shut only because the wedge of light faded to black i didnt hear so much as a latch click chapter i was in the den with joanne alone looking over the topsecret sheets dubois had emailed me much was redacted including the name of her organization which was far less public even than mine though one thing that wasnt redacted was a picture of joanne from eight or ten years ago and her name within the organization lily hawthorne the woman in the picture looked much like the woman in front of me handsome but not pretty unsmiling slim reserved and secretive too i realized a lot of other curiosities over the past few days made sense now joannes desperation to get her stepdaughter away from her afraid that she was in fact the reason the girl might be kidnapped or hurt and her concern about the neighbors in fairfax the knoxesa worry at the time that seemed out of proportion to the situation shed been horrified at the chance that she was the cause of teddys wifes death at the hand of henry loving i recalled too how hard shed been pressing me for information about which of ryans cases could be the reason loving had been hired and her searching marees computer hoping to find any clues that she wasnt the cause shed also supported my choices in the tactical situations pleading or even ordering her husband to follow what id decidedbecause as a pro she knew i was right in a matteroffact voice she said to me have you found out anything more than that she glanced toward the documents which said nothing directly about her job only that you were with the sickle project my associates good but she couldnt get much more than that your archivesre locked pretty tight as for active filesif the group is still active she said nothing if its still active she didnt find anything on record though the nickname of the group was anglicized to the name of the farm implement in fact it came from the israeli defense forces name for assassinationin hebrew sikul memukad which means focused foiling my associate found youve been a target before corte everybody in sickle was permanently targeted because of what we did there were never any operations though just surveillance that report is five years old she continued yes im sure i have enemies but there wasnt a shred of intelligence that suggested id have any information that somebody wantedcertainly nothing that would justify hiring a lifter like henry loving the past i said youve been in touch with your people how id monitored their phone use i have another phone she said its untraceable believe me its untraceable you uploaded the pictures to them on itthe ones from marees computer her eyes took in her purse where i supposed the very fancy shielded device rested now i understood why she kept the handbag so close i transferred them yes everything went encrypted through a half dozen proxies there wont even be bulges in the internet traffic in the area here the system takes care of that my immediate impression was that despite the trauma of being caught joanne was more comfortable now more at peace shed been living a lie for a long time at least she wouldnt have the burden of carting around that secret anymore i understood too that you dont hook up with organizations that run operations like sickle unless the work is at least partly in your blood shed undoubtedly been a good wife and stepmother but i wasnt sure i believed her denials that she was so eager to give up her clandestine side i knew how id feel if i had to abandon the job of being a shepherd it would have destroyed something within me all right you tell me therere no leads but its my job to keep you and your family alive i want to know exactly what your people have focused on every case i worked is closed all the principals were either abducted and resettled or zeroed she said using a verb that id heard from time to time if my principal was in a similar line of work it had become popular among the mossad they liked to use shorthand they thought was american zero the only assignment with a residual actor was my last one in the deli he was a friend of the deli owners we targeted he was a minor player a liaison and runner basically he was cleared years ago tell me about him anyway the couple were collecting and selling nuclear arms intelligence this man put them in contact with a few government contractors and people in helpful positions academics he delivered some files and software to them that was it when they were zeroed he panicked and went completely straight gave us names we monitored him for years then took him off the list name that i cant do corte surveillance on him yesterday and today yes nothing puts him together with loving i considered what shed told me i considered the dwindling leads in the case that might reveal the primary whod hired henry loving alone i stepped into the back enclosed porch of the house gesturing tony barr and lyle ahmad to join me we have a situation i gave them the news about joanne i explained that she was what in our organization would be called point control officer running a small tactical team in her case though she wasnt protecting lives but eliminating them lyle ahmad took the news as unemotionally as i would have expected as if id told him the stock market had dropped a few points or a baseball team score was tied in the third the reaction of freddys fbi agent was different tony barrs face flashed with anger she didnt tell us he whispered he was undoubtedly used to suspects who regularly lied but this deception was from somebody he was risking his life to protect this meeting though wasnt to debate the sin of our principal it was to consider how the new information affected our protection strategy i said shes positive she isnt the target but i think for the time being we have to assume she is and that the primary who hired loving could be funded with big money and has the support of significant foreign interests i reminded the two men about the helicopter at carters house near the potomac ahmad said so its possible they could use a chopper for a tactical assault not just extraction wouldnt be surprised i told him barr said we should liaise with local air traffic control good idea and shift to sixty percent outside patrol and look up a lot lyle run the perimeter now he punched the door code and stepped outside barr and i returned joanne was in the living room looking into the hallway toward the closed bedroom door the director of your group i said the same one you worked for back then yes i want to talk to him she gave a resigned nod she understood it was useless to argue which it was we walked into the den she took her own phone from her purse she set it on my desk and hit speaker then a speeddial button although todays scrambled phones no longer sound like a fax machine i imagined i heard a clatter as there was a click and a voice rose from the black box in front of us this is williams its me joanne said there was a momentary pause while presumably some electronics verified that this was her voice on speaker on speaker williams grumbled that says a lot meaning that wed figured it all out yessir i identified myself and explained that i was in charge of the protection detail for the kesslers williams of the elusive first name said i know who you are i figured it was just a matter of time somebodys been tickling our servers i was certainly angry at the withholding of the information about her prior career but i recalled my mantra about defining goals and coming up with efficient solutions there might be a time for recrimination but the task now was to keep the kesslers safe and to find the primary who had hired loving so i said i need all the details on this man who was involved in joannes last case a pause on the other end which might have been a reaction to my request or it might have arisen because the woman in question wasnt joanne to him but lily hawthorne there is absolutely no shred of evidence that hes involved or anybody else that joanne came in contact with weve been monitoring the situation from the beginning even so i want the name i cant do that i said firmly i hope you understand that i have a job to do part of that is assessing threats on my own i cant just take your word for it part of my job is keeping matters like this very very private i know that i said slowly and let my threat register and spread public announcements can often be a very effective edge williams sighed his name is aslan zagaev he is a chechnyan muslim naturalized as part of the plea deal youve been monitoring him where is he at the moment at home in alexandria whatre his details owns a half dozen carpet stores a restaurant my people have been through everything corte i mean everything com profiles banking accounts travel records corporate holdings investments family brother and sisters associates nothing hes absolutely clean chechnyan muslim does he go to the middle east yes on business to buy rugs but we dont have gps around his neck the folks he was dealing with here the couple in the deli they were pakistani not arabs and recently no phone calls in the past two weeks routine at his office hasnt been affected best as we can tell christ corte were taking this seriously we know what were doing i asked could he be deep cover a sleeper williams asked after six years they dont really work that way he said this with some authority besides sleepers dont volunteer at the georgetown islamic youth center or go near anyplace with the i word in it hed be at presbyterian bake sales you have no other actors it could be thats right presumably because they were dead i said i want the names of your security man and analyst on zagaev corte what could lily what could joanne possibly know that hed have any interest in after all these years the answer seemed obvious to me she knows where to find you doesnt she chapter after we disconnected joanne stood for a long moment looking toward the hallway that led to the closed bedroom door behind which her husband undoubtedly was fuming she took several steps down the hall and then stopped and returned to the couch i called williamss case analyst the director had given him the okay to talk to meabout the joanne kessler security matter only of course not about the sickle partand i got addresses and phone numbers and corporate information about aslan zagaev and his businesses he told me that neither he or the security officer williams had ordered into the field on saturday morning had found anything linking zagaev to loving confirming what joanne and williams had stated i thought well obviously hes not going to be making incriminating calls from those phones did they even think about prepaid mobiles there were limits as to how much digging williamss people could do sure but these were basic elements of tradecraft i disconnected called claire dubois and explained the situation to her drop everything and start running background on zagaev i told her i want everything shoe size to whats on his tivo she said family employees family of his employees travel records concentrate on the past couple of days then go on from there any connection to loving anything that could be a connection to loving i then asked her to transfer me to aaron ellis i briefed him and he coughed a surprised laugh joanne seems so at least ryans cases havent led us anywhere theres one actor still around from her past were going to follow up on it but westerfield called all excited about some dc police scandal he was saying you thought that that was why ryan was targeted some senior official in the department or city hall hired loving id just as soon he kept thinking that aaron silence for a moment corte you mean the police scandals fake too not fake it was a valid theory was correct but by the time you suggested to westerfield it was a possibility you knew it wasnt aaron just try to keep him off me for a while ill do the best i can finally i called and briefed freddy about joannes deception the jokey facade was gone why the fuck didnt the bitch tell us she didnt have an inkling this whole tidal wave of crap might have something to do with the fact she was an assassin i dont think they like to use that word i care this williams just for the record freddy grunted hes not as clever as he thinks he is or would like to be a bunch of us know about him and his sickle band of brothers and sisters i guess we thought it was more dirty tricks but when you think about it shooting somebody in the head is about as dirty as it gets howre you handling it claires doing homework i debated ill need some warrants shell get you the details who and where all right will do then he asked whats zagaevs game you think i dont know williams said sleepers dont work that way but it works that way if it works now thats quotable son think about it williams cleared him five six years ago they drop surveillance that leaves him free to hire loving to snatch joanne and get all kinds of information that sounds like a pretty successful sleeper cell to me he isnt exactly dripping guilt but its all weve got thats my second fastest man theory the second what i asked you know how fast you have to be to outrun a bear corte i was watching joanne stare out the window how fast just a little faster than the guy with you freddy seemed to be waiting when i didnt say anything he said i mean that zagaev doesnt have to be a perfect suspect he just has to be good enough ill have claire call you with what shes learned chapter twenty minutes later claire dubois called with information about aslan zagaev this was perhaps a new record for her i sent freddy everything she explained hes getting the warrants now good brief me he was born outside of grozny came over here to study at american university when he was twentytwo he did postgrad work at mit and came back to the dc area he started to spend some time at a radical mosque in our hometown alexandria he broke with themhe wasnt religious enough apparentlybut what he was good at was being an entrepreneur with his science background and connections he made on embassy row and among government contractors he found there was a marketselling trade secrets whyd he get off with a plea the crime was industrial espionage what he did was illegal yes but very clever technically he didnt steal anything that was directly against national security the pakistani couple that joanne and her partner took out they were consolidators they assembled information from zagaev and others into something more useful i mean something useful in the dangerous sense ive learned a lot about nuclear fuel rods and centrifuges enrichment is fascinating all in twenty minutes before she could start the physics lecture though i asked so zagaev cooperated and went on to live the american dream life he got married had a couple of kids and didnt have anything to do with his old life a lot of that going around nowadays i reflected looking at joanne but for the last few years he seemed to become more religious though the mosque he and his family go to now is moderate he seems to lead a fairly secular life he owns some carpet stores and a restaurant his kids are in a good private school he has been taking a few more trips overseas turkey a lot the rugs i guess saudi and jordan any watchlists no none of ours and none in the uk pakistani india jordanian saudi or israeli databases on the surface yes innocent but i still liked my idea of a deep sleeper cell dubois continued with the rest of the information she knew i would want she rattled off details about gun registrations none because hed pled to a felony years ago and could not own firearms state criminal convictions none traffic stops one crossing the white line prematurely to make a right turn incriminating posts on social networking sites none cars mortgages medical records unusual consumer product purchases travel records and information about his rug operation and the restaurant i knew williamss people had given him a pass but i still wasnt convinced he was clean i disconnected joanne looked at me shed overheard everything you think its zagaev i dont know were looking he seemed so inconsequential i cant see it i sat in an armchair the smell of ancient upholstery rose after a moment she said thank you i lifted an eyebrow about maree you didnt have to go after her that wasnt your job it was yes its not efficient to have your principals separated too much of a risk she looked at me knowingly it was sure a risk to her right my voice lowered though i knew maree couldnt hear she ran to the cliff by the river but i dont think she was going to jump but you couldnt tell no i couldnt tell shes vulnerable but not hopelessly lost not like me i said nothing what was there to say it was my task to keep my principals physical incarnations alive and theirs to protect their own souls and hearts you know what my biggest mistake was corte thinking i could have it all doing what i did for williams and then dropping the job cold like it had never existed and going for a family a nod toward the bedroom when i started running the teams i thought a normal life was out of the question a sigh a while ago one of my jobs went bad i was shot pretty seriously showed up as the car crash in the official documents joanne no longer seemed surprised at what i knew or surmised plastic surgery on the entrance would so it looked like id been cut by a piece of wreckage a shallow smile they think of everything then her mouth straightened but that was it for me having children i see im sorry a shake of her head surely reflecting dismay at what ryans reaction would be to this news after it happened and i was in therapy i didnt care it was like getting shot was a sign that i was meant to keep going with sickle but then i met ryan and his daughter i realized what id missed so i went for it but it was stupid i should neverve gone with the organization in the first place or i shouldve stayed and never gotten married tried to be a wife and mother a weak smile im surprised i lasted six years before i got busted you cant have both lives corte you know that too the difference is youre honest about it you didnt even try i found myself looking down involuntarily joanne added or maybe you did try and it didnt work out either im sorry that was out of line i gave no reaction i was relieved when my phone buzzed i have to take this sure i rose stepped away and hit answer freddy what do you have something good corte the bear theory worked out you were right listen to this about fifteen minutes ago we had a sigint hit on a mobile registered to the brother of somebody who works for annandale carpetzagaevs company our boxes ran a voice print analysis of both callers we had zagaevs voice on tape from way back when and it registered positive which we expected but what we didnt expect was that the fellow he was chatting away with was a guy you mightve heard of henry loving i froze hunched over the desk we ran it through three computers and tested the sample against four snippets from loving in the past theres no doubt its him whatd they say it was typical code zagaev asked how was the delivery coming loving said thereve been a few delays the job site in loudoun whites ferry was closed down that deal fell through trying to kidnap amanda they meant zagaev said hed told loving he didnt want to pursue that part of the job in the first place loving said it didnt matter now anyway hed given up on it then he said he was working hard to find some other options in virginia they would talk again in a few hours he might want to pick up what theyd talked about before just to be safe any triangulation at all no happened too fast they both took their batteries out when they were through talking but weve got zagaevs gps and five minutes after he hung up he started driving weve got people headed in his direction hes going to pick up something i mused what well find out i considered this information okay so hes given up trying for amanda as his edge joanne turned toward me at this i continued to freddy but what does he mean by other options in virginia maybe that loving and his partner are going after friends or relatives of joanne that could be it maybe hes looking for the sister right now maree he might not know shes with you ill let you know when we get a visual we disconnected i said to joanne its zagaev hes been talking to loving positive voice prints a brief flash of dismay in her face recognition of the confirmation that she was in fact responsible for what had happened yet then her eyes grew hopeful the corollary of zagaevs guilt of course was that we had a solid lead whereabouts freddys putting surveillance in place sigint and on the ground for now we wait her laugh was colored with cynicism and perhaps a bit of sorrow waiting ive done my share of that in this business i suppose its the same for you and you mentioned amanda lovings given up looking for her hes going for another edge we dont know who or what joanne was staring at an old photograph on the wall a family in nineteenthcentury clothing ten long long minutes later the phone rang again go ahead freddy i said urgently corte listen to this the mans voice was surprisingly animated for a change getting better we tracked zagaev to a warehouse in springfield he goes inside gets some weapons my heart was racing he cant touch a gun not with his felony plea exactly son hold on a pause freddy then said okay he just left and our peoplere with him where is he headed north inner loop of the beltway was anybody with him even a shadow i asked you mean loving i mean was anybody with him even a shadow feisty as ever corte freddy no he was all by his little old lonesome so what do you think its your call id been considering my strategy all along i said quickly continue the surveillance and let me know the minute he changes direction ill be on the road in three minutes chapter what would my opponent do here i wasnt thinking of henry loving at the moment but of his primary aslan zagaev hed collected weapons hed made this unexpected and purposeful drive after a call from loving what did that mean what did he have in mind i was on route moving south aiming for the same residential and commercial clustertysons cornerthat zagaev seemed to be driving toward from the opposite direction my opponent what is he going to do in game theory analysis the followers of eighteenthcentury statistician thomas bayes hold that the world is made up of constantly changing knowledge and in determining the probability of an eventwhat zagaev was planning in this caseyou have to continually readjust your predictions as you learn new bits of information the odds that hell play rock as opposed to paper or scissors change from percent for instance if you learn that your opponent has a muscle problem that makes it painful for him to form a fist but with zagaev there was very little information at all to narrow my predictions of what he was doing and to come up with a rational strategy on how to deal with him hed have the answers to what joanne kessler knew the identities of other primaries if he wasnt working alone and of course hed know where henry loving was or how to find him should we continue to follow should we arrest him should we set up surveillance on his employees i blew through a red light grateful the county police were busy elsewhere i plugged in the earbud and called freddy yeah corte yeah where is he route seven heading north about five minutes from tysons i was on route heading south and about five minutes from tysons freddy added were a half mile behind him hes being a good citizen stopping for yellows yielding to pedestrians so being inconspicuous was more important to the chechnyan than getting wherever he was going quickly with his weapons this was more information but it wasnt particularly helpful teams i asked two were keeping back relying on gps zagaev make any calls we havent picked up anything since he hung up with loving forty minutes ago youre scanning all his employees phones and their relatives hey corte guess what weve done this before i didnt remind him that nobody at williamss organization or the bureau thought to consider employees family members until i suggested doing so okay freddy said hes still moving steady taking us right into lovings arms was he imperfect information somethings bothering me i said youd be a bad person to go to a ball game with corte youre so negative you ever been to a ball game i dont think hes going to loving why not most primaries want to keep some distance from their lifters safer for them hes delivering the guns i pointed out loving doesnt need armament from a primary hes got plenty of his own his partner certainly does so whatre you saying i made a decision i want to take zagaev not tail him why bayesian game theory analysis wasnt much help i didnt have any information perfect or otherwise i told him the truth a hunch there was silence for a moment freddy said but if we dont stop him fast hell call or text loving and any other primaries theyll vanish we stink of federal cars hell see us coming he was right i asked whats zagaevs vehicle silver bmw sevenforty he gave me the tag numbers and his location now just getting to tysons hes bypassing the business district turning onto holly lane i think hes making for the tollway if he gets on that theres no way you can take him before he gets a message to loving hell see you coming i was now at tysons myself i sped up and turned onto a road that crossed over holly i skidded to a stop climbed out and pretended to look over a roadside produce stand as i scanned the road that zagaev would be approaching on ill call you back freddy in a moment i saw a silver beemer heading toward me in about two minutes hed pass underneath and make the turn that would put him on the dulles tollway i squinted and checked the tag numbervirginia conveniently includes both rear and front plates i caught a fast glimpse of zagaevs bearded unsmiling face i confirmed it was he freddie had uploaded a picture to my mobile there seemed to be nobody else in the car im not known for making spontaneous let alone rash decisions but a game player recognizes that sometimes a bold choice is necessary i turned and began to sprint chapter a pumpkin bomb corte you do have a sense of humor despite what everybody says freddy kicked at a piece of slimy vegetable you just express it different than most people there were two fbi cars in the underpass bracketing zagaevs yellowandorangesmeared vehicle the windshield messy but intact the folks in munich make a solid machine since a traditional takedown wasnt an optionbecause zagaev could warn lovingid decided to stop him myself as he cruised under the overpass i was parked near id bought a ripe pumpkin from the produce stand beside the road and when zagaev sped underneath me i dropped it into the middle of his windshield i then slid down the incline gun drawn and got him out of the car he was stunned but unhurt a fast check of the phone revealed hed placed no calls or sent any texts in the past five minutes i was pretty sure that neither loving nor the partner would be present but not positive so i asked freddy your people notice anybody peel off when he didnt make the turn on the tollway peel thats funny like with fruits and vegetables but i dont suppose you meant it that way i lifted an impatient eyebrow no he was alone in a faintly accented voice zagaev muttered who are you why you did this to me look at my car its ruined i wasnt interested in his complaints i was sore from my jog along the shoulder of the road with my ripe twentyfivepound projectile another agent had gone through the bmws trunk and had assessed the arms haul he reported nothing spectacular mfour ripoffs from russia with magical disappearing serial numbers and a couple of beretta nine mils with numbers theyre stolen surprise surprise lot of bullets nothing that goes bang in the night he transferred the lot of it into the trunk of freddys car i want my lawyer ignoring him still i said to freddy whats around here for a chat the washington dc area is home to dozens of police and national security organizations some as public and visible as the cia some of them sort of anonymous like ours others so anonymous they dont exist like williamss but one thing they all have in common they need facilitiesbuildings to operate from just like insurance companies or computer software startups many of even the most secret take space in high and lowrises in and around tysons where we were now its plenty overbuiltso the general service managers can get good bargains saving us taxpayer dollars besides the areas got clydes and starbucks and arigato sushi even spies need to eat franchise food like the rest of us freddy thought for a moment and turned around nodding at a boringlooking white office building on the other side of the tollway only two hundred yards away thats convenient i said you have a hood the agent produced one no no zagaev blustered you cant do that im a citizen i pulled the hood over his head and guided him to the backseat of freddys car mindful of his head another agent slipped in beside him and asked can you breathe you fucker he shouted motherfucker you cant do this i will see my lawyer now i turned to freddy he can breathe a half hour later i was through security at the building that freddy had indicated it was as it turned out one of the more public federal organizations because of which the fbi agents explained zagaev had been taken through the back i went downstairs and met a slim woman of around forty short dark hair sharp eyes she was wearing a black suit and had a heavy bag slung over her shoulder she worked for our organization and helped us out in what id call unusual situations like this one her name was roberta santoro though she was known around the office simply as bert i greeted her she was characteristically silent i asked ready a nod we went into a conference room and found aslan zagaev sitting in a chair wrists shackled behind him a video camera on a tripod was focused on him the red light glowed he looked up at us indignantly you could have killed me it was a pumpkin i pointed out it wouldntve killed you yes it could have it could have come through the windshield and killed me he snapped why do i not have a lawyer bert walked to the end of the table and sat her hands rested in her lap and her face was passive i didnt say anything about her to zagaev nor did she proffer any id he looked at her once then back to me snuck a glance again and told me you have no right to do this i know how those guns got there you planted them in game theory your opponents personality is irrelevant theres even a type of game in which its understood you can substitute any human being for the other player but for me when playing a board game seeing the person sitting across from me is everything sometimes on my lunch hours or after work ill go to my gaming club in old town and if im not in top form ill just sit and watch others play i study mannerisms their eyes how they hold their cards or roll the die or move their markers or chess pieces im not trying to spot tellsthose are either obvious in unskilled players or nonexistent among the talentedbut i watch to see how players act and react what they enjoy and what they dislike i watch for responses to victory and to defeat i watch for trembling hands now i regarded my opponent carefully as if we were sitting across from each other over a chessboard zagaev had a round head a double chin that his beard obscured pretty well and bristly hair that couldnt decide to be gray or less gray his age dubois had reported was only fortythree his head was large his pallor anemic he nervously gripped and ungripped his hands every few seconds i knew this only because i heard the tinkle of cuffs behind his back he wore a thick gold chain around his neck and an amulet on which was an unlikely icon i was pretty sure it was tsar alexander ii who i knew from my studies was a moderate reformerby absoluteruler standardsin midnineteenthcentury russia still it was curious that a chechnyan would choose this particular image zagaevs clothes were expensive more than i could afford more than i wanted to his suit was cut from vibrant blue silk the color of the sky in a childs fantasy book his snakeskin shoes glittered in the jarring overhead light his sweat was repulsive i could smell body odor and onions from across the table i leaned forward i am not large thats true but ive learned something interesting in my years as a shepherd people tend to fear you more if youre not physically imposing perhaps theyre thinking that the damage i can do to their lives is worse than that of somebody with a lead pipe zagaev who outweighed me by fifty pounds now eased back i need to know who youre working with im not a bad person zagaev looked up at me with imploring eyes claims of ethical purity are a common strategy in games like this but theyre paper forever losing to scissors that doesnt enter into our discussion who are you working with he then grew angry and the softer expression of a moment ago vanished there is no one no conspiracy no airplane hijackers no subway riders with backpacks i glanced toward bert not a blink of response zagaev noticed discomfited hed be wondering who she was i continued we know one person youre working with you were speaking to him on one of your employees relatives phones not long ago his face filled with disgust he muttered some words to himself it was not me an impersonator you people do this all the time ignoring the tired denials i said well aslan we have to assume youre working with a cell and that its a threat to our national security given your misstep six years agoyour relation with the pakistani couple murdered by you i wasnt guilty of anything i confessed only so i wouldnt be hounded or murdered myself i continued calmly we need to know who else is involved involved in what i continued understand me aslan im not an interrogator im just asking you the questions that the interrogators will ask im not trying to trick you its not a strategy im explaining to you that in itself could be a strategy he offered with an oily smile your life as youve lived it is over we can make the case against you the guns the connection with henry loving the fact you want to extract information from joanne kessler the smile faded some hearing what i knew bert continued to watch passively zagaevs eyes slipped to her and back who is your friend he asked me why doesnt she say anything who are you working with i work in my carpet stores and in my restaurant why are you persecuting me you plant guns in my trunk you try to kill me with that projectile you will be in very bad trouble over this i have a right to a lawyer we have you on tape fake as i was saying im bored with this now you are very tedious sir i sighed i looked toward bert she lifted her index finger ever so slightly grimacing i paused then nodded i pushed back and stood bert glanced toward the camera i stepped forward and shut it off unplugged and wound up the cord and started for the door with the camera under my arm zagaev said nothing but his eyes widened hed be wondering why i was taking the camera with me what did i not want preserved for posterity as i pulled the door open bert rose and circled behind zagaev she drew the blinds over the oneway mirror she looked at zagaevs shackled hands then his lap her face revealed some satisfaction then she sat beside him and extracted from her jacket pocket a vinyl box about the size of a paperback book it was bright red as if warning that the contents were very dangerous as she drew the zipper open loudly zagaev gasped i stepped outside letting the door swing shut behind me chapter wait the prisoner cried his face had gone ruddy please you must be patient have a little patience this is all very disorienting to me one moment im driving along and the next bang here i am my life threatened you can understand that surely you can understand i turned just before the door closed i slipped my foot into the jamb stopping it i looked back zagaev stared at the red box bert regarded me her face completely impassive youre stalling i said to zagaev no no i will not waste your time his face collapsed please i stepped back into the room left the camera beside the door and leaned across the table if you help us out im in a position to make sure that no one troubles your family other than to interview them provided none of them has committed any crimes no no my family is innocent you wont have to worry about reprisals against them i can arrange for them to be relocated ill protect you too through trial and if you fully cooperate ill recommend to the fbi and the prosecutor that they take that into account in charging and sentencing can you protect my family he whispered from henry loving yes i said firmly ill protect you from him too a long moment of debate i looked at zagaevs amulet alexander ii with his impressive mustache though arguably the most liberal of the tsars the emancipator of the serfs he was assassinated by revolutionaries all right yes all right he slumped i sat in my original chair and bert returned to hers our organization didnt torture to get information not even water boarding we made this decision for two reasons first it was illegalthis is a country of laws after all second wed studied the subject and found it largely inefficient since processing all the information you got from a tortured prisoner and reassembling it into the truth generally took much longer than using softer methods of interrogation even then torture tends to work with only a small number of subjects nor was bert santoro our resident grand inquisitor she was the office manager of our headquarters in old town the woman who reviewed expense accounts and budgets and ordered furniture and computers she had nothing to do with operations with four wonderful kids and a great husband bert was like any one of thousands of government workers in the dc area but she had a cold beauty that made her perfect to play the steely operative role someone who enjoyed pulling out fingernails or using electrodes to extract information from my interogatees zagaev whispered to me who is she he turned to her why dont you say anything bert probably thinking about something like my overdue expense account silenced him with a look i said aslan with a last glance at the red vinyl case which i knew happened to contain only makeup he sighed and i heard chain tinkle as he lowered his shoulders and hands naturally you thought i was part of some plot some terrible plan to bring down the infidels what nonsense no no my plan was about business you see how much of an american i have become thats what i care about the allpowerful dollar he seemed concerned that my notebook was closed please this is my story please you can write it down every syllable was of course being recorded by a hidden video and audio systemthe sony video by the door was more of a dramatic prop still i thought it best not to remind him he was being taped surreptitiously and so i opened my notebook years ago yes i knew the couple who worked in the deli the couple murdered the couple who died i did not respect them i had no interest in their cause but i did have an interest in the money they paid me which was not inconsiderable you have seen the record yes you know after they died i grievedbut only for the loss of the income i led a more or less successful life here ah but isnt success a moving target i have been having some problems financial in nature the economy who needs rugs when you cant afford your mortgage payments who goes to eat at my wonderful restaurant when you must buy bulk frozen dinners at sams club to feed your children how could i make more money did i have any service i could perform did i have anything valuable that i could sell then it occurred to me what if i could learn more about the operation behind the deaths of the pakistanis in the deli six years ago how valuable would that be i remembered the woman who was the point control officer behind the operation to kill them joanne kessler even if she had retired she would surely have valuable information or lead me to people who did i made some phone calls discreet phone calls to a connection of mine in damascus i learned there was indeed an interest in information of this sort a multimilliondollar interest a man there gave me henry lovings name so that was the answer id anticipated part of ittargeting joanne because of information shed have about secret government organizations i had posited a terrorist motive and sleeper cell in fact it was just business given zagaevs entrepreneurial life i should have guessed whatre you paying loving one million dollars half up front half when we got good information from joanne if you cancel the job i still must pay everything i asked where is loving now i dont know i swear to god praise be to him ive met loving oncelast week in west virginia why there zagaev shrugged out of the way he was afraid hed be recognized if he flew into dulles go on i gave him a deposit he doesnt like wire transfers a mirthless laugh much less a personal check and you havent seen him since then no we leave text messages or speak on the phone he gave me a code to use when we talk about construction jobs and the like what number do you call zagaev gave it to me and i recognized immediately that it was a rerouting service it would be impossible to trace the area code was in the caribbean the helicopter is it yours one of my partners in the restaurant its his what were you doing with the guns he gave them to me for my protection but when he called he gave the code that i should dispose of them he was probably concerned that the people guarding joanne might find them zagaev chewed on his lip staring at the red makeup case i swear i didnt know how dangerous this loving was if i could have gotten the information from that woman the point control woman any other way i would have i swear to god praise be to him that i didnt know he would use the daughter as leverage i remembered hed said something of the sort according to the tap freddyd put on the phone i asked who else is working with him partners hes working with one man former military ive seen him once tall dark blond hair wears a green jacket i dont know his name anyone else not that i know of i said ill be right back i stepped outside leaving zagaev to stare uneasily at bert i found freddy who said hes singing like britney its good hes working solo and the idea originated with him the syrians might buy the finished product but he approached them not the other way around they probably dont even know joannes identity with the chechnyan in custody that meant the only threats to the kesslers were loving and his partner and they wouldnt be much of a threat at all as soon as they found zagaev was in custody theyd probably flee whatre you planning the agent asked there were two strategies to play i debated a moment and decided i really had no choice chapter waiting again at pm we were in a deserted field near the park embracing the site of the first battle of manassas orif youre a northernerthe first battle of bull run not far from where thomas jonathan jackson fought his way through the brushand grape and chain shotto earn the name stonewall in the still overcast day waiting its the most dangerous time of all abe would tell me as i would later lecture my protégés waiting because if youre in this line of work if youre a shepherd youre smart and smart minds need stimulantscrack speed puzzles rubiks cubes waitings going to make you dull but you cant afford to become dull because the hitter or lifter never waits why because hes using all his energy to move in close to you it was a lesson i took to heart especially since loving had the tendency to appear unexpectedly but it didnt lessen the difficulty of waiting i scanned the ground even on short notice freddy had managed to pull together four teams of special ops experts all with military backgrounds and chopper them into a staging area nearby but not so close loving might notice wed arrived a half hour earlier and left our cars in a suburban strip mall parking lot a hundred yards away then had made our way here through bushes and reedy fields birds zipped into the air and grasshoppers sprang away startlingly we assembled near the battlefieldit was surprisingly small hardly able to have hosted the carnage of years agoand moved silently into position in a field and a stand of trees surrounding the deserted parking lot where zagaev had agreed to meet with loving the lot was next to the site of a demolished warehouse or small factory freddy and the tactical officers and i were linked with special com devices earbuds and invisible stalk mikes that could pick up the faintest of whispers the brand name was micromike and they cost two thousand each but as we deployed there was no chatter the ops teams were consummate professionals at the far end of the lot zagaevs car was parked the silhouette of a mans head just visible in the drivers seat the chechnyan had panicked when i told him he was going to call the lifter cancel the job and meet him here to pay the remainder of his fee but i wasnt going to put him in danger i didnt dare risk zagaevs lifefor humanitarian reasons of course but primarily so that he would be able to testify in the eventual prosecution of loving also i liked the idea of handing him over alive to westerfield to keep the prosecutor from devouring me zagaev wasnt exactly behind a frontpage terrorist plot but it would be a good win for the vindictive man who would soon be deprived of his juicy metropolitan police corruption case accordingly the occupant of the car was not aslan zagaev nor was it one of the tactical agents it was omar essentially a robotic head and torso with a few servo motors inside that let himwell itmimic pretty well the movement and gestures of a human being you could program the system so that omar would act bored or drunk orthe mostused settingnervous and fidgety the features werent as good as disney animatronics but inside a vehicle or in the dark he could usually trick a shooter omarand omarina brunette or blonde and dcame in white black and latino no chechnyan models son freddy had told me the best part about omar was that he wasnt simply a decoy surrounding the robot was a grid of ultraviolet and microwave beams when loving or his partner presumably from some distance took up position and fired the typical threeburst round into omars head empty and inexpensively replaceable a computer would instantly correlate trajectory speed and gps coordinates and indicate on our handhelds where the shooter was down to three feet would loving take the bait i believed so back in tysons zagaev had gotten in touch with the lifter in the script i prepared i had him tell loving that he wanted to terminate the job hed pay him the rest of the money and they could go their own ways as id listened in on the conversation id noted what seemed to be disappointment in lovings voice i wondered if that was due to his reluctance to cease playing this game with me personally but that was perhaps projecting my feelings onto him id also had zagaev inquire casually if anybody else knew that he was the one whod hired loving the lifter assured him that he hadnt said anything he never did that would be unprofessional of course id had zagaev ask this seemingly innocent question for a very specific purpose to make loving believe that zagaev might try to kill him and save the rest of the fee so i was betting that loving would meet him here to eliminate the man who knew his identity and perhaps a few other incriminating facts about him was i right you never knew with loving as in the prisoners dilemma prisoner one could never be sure that prisoner two was going to refuse to confess the bank depositor would never be sure that all the other depositors would stand firm and not withdraw their savings but though economists and mathematicians dont admit it game theory is about playing the odds i dont believe in luck but i do believe in circumstance it had not worked to my advantage in rhode island perhaps it would here we heard distant traffic immediate insects a barking dog the cheerful shouting of children at the battlefield where more than thirtyfive thousand men engaged in the summer of and five thousand died or were wounded i was in cover behind thick trees that had not even been seeds when those soldiers fell the meeting had been arranged for we were now a few minutes past that in the distance a lightcolored vehicle quickly turned onto the road that led to the deserted parking lot we surrounded the skidding turn was a standard tactical maneuver not to evade any following cars but to see if you were in fact being followed if you signal your intention to turn a tail will do the same if you skid around a corner keeping an eye in the rearview mirror you can easily judge from the reaction of the driver behind you if its a tail even if he decides to stay on the road the cars rapid turn now suggested that it might be lovings some of the tactical officers werent in view of the road and the commanderfreddys lieutenantalerted everyone to the newly arrived car i found myself tensing flashing back to the sight of loving earlierat the flytrap i reached behind me and rested my hand on my glock this was instinct only there were people present who were more talented at this sort of thing than i lowering my hand i watched the transit of the lightcolored car was it the lifter this road didnt lead to the battlefield it didnt lead anywhere really the occupants could be kids here to smoke grass or drink or make out it could be a civil war buff who wanted to experience the historic site from this angle manassas also had its share of meth cookers maybe a deal was going down before reaching the parking lot where zagaevs car was idling the new vehicle pulled off into the bushes then came a whisper through my earbud team three two males exiting vehicle civilian clothing one is armed handgun proceeding toward parking lot through brush loving and his partner id hoped theyd both be here roger all teams stay in position no motion no sound sniper one can you target the subject vehicle negative roger i wondered momentarily if the partner was lovings protégé as i had been abes and claire dubois mine did loving lecture about the rules of play the way i had been lectured and i lectured now this seemed at first a crazy thought but then i asked myself why tradecraft of all types had to be mastered team two subjects are on western perimeter of the parking lot observing zagaevs vehicle freddys voice whispered move omars head around but not so hes looking back toward them roger that the robot glanced to the side the head dipped whoever guided the mannequin was an artist subjectsre checking out the park okay theyre separating moving up on either side of the car be advised both have weapons now autoloader handguns copy that so they werent going for a sniper shot they were going to take him from behind close just shoot him and have done with it or i reflected this might not be a kill at all maybe their intention was for the partner to cover the transaction as loving collected the money they would shake hands and leave i was breathing hard forcing myself not to strain forward for a glimpse but staying low in the brush suddenly i felt a trickle down my spine and looked behind me fast though i knew loving couldnt have come up behind me here not with the tactical agents arrayed as they were i saw nothing but saplings and brush tac op leader weve got a visual both suspects are in confinement positions freddy said youre greenlighted roger greenlighted on my command teams three and one flashbangs then move in flanking and rear hold hold i wondered what the communications here had been like in july of when troops had been preparing to engage now move in move in i heard a series of explosions and saw flashes as the tactical ops teams sped forward my hand was crampingmy left hand not the one i used for shootingand i was half rising from cover i sucked in air i realized that i hadnt been breathing for a good thirty seconds or more the teams converged screaming as they were instructed to do fbi fbi on the ground let me see your hands let me see your hands weve got one started to radio a long pause team three to tac op leader need you here now what was going on i dont get it shit my heart sank at the transmissions hardly what you would have hoped for in a successful operation and moving from cover i made a deduction that proved to be true the two men sneaking up on omar were displaying what appeared to be law enforcement shields they were of course detectives from prince william county here to investigate the reports of a drug deal or cries for help that loving had undoubtedly called in the minute he hung up from speaking with zagaev a call made to distract us while he orchestrated his escape chapter i was speaking to claire dubois lovings on the run he might be driving but i think he wants to get clear of the area data mine flight reservations i want to know anybody who bought a ticket after he talked to zagaevabout three pmfor travel today maybe from dulles national or bwi but i think hes still going to be avoiding them especially now that he suspects weve turned zagaev amtrak dubois asked freddys told the police at union station to look for him but im betting he wants to put more distance between us faster than taking a train ill get right on it zagaev had no clue where loving might have gone except to add that the flight to charleston west virginia had taken him about five hours which suggested he was based somewhere on the west coast though possibly mexico the caribbean or canada the tactical officers were assembling their gear we talked to the county detectives but it was no surprise that the call that had brought them here had been anonymous and from an untraceable phone the caller said hed seen somebody selling army guns from the back of his car what were we supposed to do jesus you guys scared the shit out of us flashbangs messed up my eyes ill tell you im talking to my commander about this i realized lovings choice of a crime was smart had he reported a drug deal or a girls shouting for help as id thought originally a standard patrol car with uniformed officers would have shown up selling weapons brought plainclothes detectives which tricked us into believing they were loving and the partner and prolonged his chance to escape freddy said howd he know we turned zagaev years and years of doing this shit the agent lifted an eyebrow a sense of humor and youre cursing son ten minutes later dubois called back five minutes after zagaev and loving hung up a man named richard hill bought an eticket to seattle from philly it was the next available flight why do you think its loving thats not a known alias of his well for one thing because richard hill is dead his birth certificate was used to get a drivers license two years after he died ghosting this was a common technique for establishing a false identity exactly but mostly we know because the airline records the calls i got the clip voice print matches flight time little under three hours from now one ticket i was thinking of the sandyhaired partner no two another fake name that persons dead too i told her id get back to her disconnected and then gestured freddy over and told him he grunted your girl data mines bettern my girl tell you corte i might hire her away from you he called the bureaus philly field office and briefed them he disconnected and turned back to me theyll be on site in twenty minutes subtle freddy call them back and tell them to be subtle they need to stay invisible till the last minute theyll be subtle i cocked my eyebrow ill call em back then he gave me a rare grin you coming along for the hunting party i thought of rhode island i thought of abe the idea of being present at lovings arrest was immensely appealing how badly i wanted to go but i said ill leave that to you folks im going to head back to the safe house keep an eye on my principals what for the cases over with corte thats true freddy but the fact is they still need guarding we got the sole primary in custody and the lifters headed for the hills whod they need protecting from themselves chapter the atmosphere in the great falls safe house suggested that what id told freddy was true i walked into the middle of a fight between the sisters it was intense and even my arrival presumably with vital information about the case didnt deflect the jousting ryan was nowhere to be seen i was upset joanne slapped her thighs what do you think people say things when theyre upset they dont mean come on how can you move out id planned it already not with andrew joanne said hes changed oh please mar men like that dont change they say they do they recite crap from twelvestep programs but they dont change i dont want to talk about it he put you in the hospital enough maree snapped waving her hand after a dense silence both women turned toward me i said id like to talk to you for a few minutes tell you whats happened joanne looked once more at her sister a glance both sorrowful and frustrated and turned to me dropping onto the couch wheres ryan i asked here he said walking into the living room he was drinking coffee it seemed though i supposed it could have had whiskey in it i couldnt smell any though he walked past his sisterinlaw and his wife and took a straightback chair in the corner of the room he ignored the women and kept his attention on me i called lyle ahmad and tony barr in as well and told the assembly weve got the primary and lovings on his way out of town we confirmed it was zagaev not a terrorist issue not directly i looked toward joanne he was trying to extract information from you and then sell it ryan kessler said nothing didnt even look at his wife so its over with maree said then she added id like to go homego back to their houseand get my things i said to her im sorry not quite yet we dont have loving or the partner in custody yet im ninetynine percent sure its okay but i want to keep you here until we do i expected to receive a taste of the testy attitude maree was serving up to her sister or at least another tour guide comment but she looked me over with a softening face whatever you think best i didnt know what to make of her agreeable nature or the coy smile ryan asked and my daughter i noted the singular possessive joanne must have too she can join us bill carter too ive already called him and one of the guards i know there is driving them to a pickup location ill go get them myself and bring them here joannes eyes grew still and i guessed she was thinking that either she or her husband would have to have some serious discussions with the girl about stepmoms former career i went into the den and sat in the office chair which gave a comforting squeak i learned from freddy that the chopper had landed at the philadelphia airport with the bureau tactical team and that they were deploying in the garage and inside and around the terminal to begin surveillance assuming loving was driving at legal speeds to the airport in philadelphia which i was sure he would be hed arrive within about ninety minutes i then called aaron ellis to whom i gave the final details of the case he said guess congratulations are in order the word seemed to jar i heard gravity in my bosss voice when he asked corte go ahead senator stevenson yes he called me i asked directly not sandy alberts thats right he called about you hold on i rose shut the door to the den and sat down again took a deep breath another then go ahead aaron he was asking me questions i didnt know the answers to ellis paused i need the truth corte are you in stevensons sights i couldnt forestall it any longer im in his sights go on ellis said grimly i organized my response finally i said after abe was killed i wanted to get loving really bad but he operates off the grid better than anybody ive ever seen so i managed to get lovings name on some lists so it wasnt just watchlists i added him to some wiretap warrant databases you added him ellis was nearly whispering you mean there was no judge involved no i got into the integrated system myself if id waited to go to a judge until we found him it would have been too late look it wasnt to collect evidence aaron it wasnt for trial it was just to find him jesus in the meeting on saturday with westerfield he said they picked up the goahead order on a warranted tap that was one of yours my illegally warranted tap thats right so when alberts came in to my office to talk to you what he was fishing i would guess so id covered my tracks pretty well but in my zeal to get loving i would have left behind trails about what id done he or stevenson are probably tracking down instances of dicey warrants and some of them mustve pointed to me alberts called freddy too about me specifically i heard a creak i pictured my boss rocking in his office chair his shoulders were exactly as wide as the leather back i said its not going to matter to stevenson that the kesslersd be dead now if i hadnt had the wiretap orders in place ive been reading up on him hes ideological hes not holding the hearings because of reelection and hes not doing it to boost his party or for the press he genuinely believes in law and order and warrantless surveillance is a crime as was of course forging warrants i remembered my dismay when i read what id learned about stevenson and realized he was the worst possible enemy a powerful man with a deeply held conviction that he was in the right especially when the person he was targeting me was so clearly wrong id felt dismay too at the fact that id found myself searching for a scandal or impropriety in stevensons life anything i could use to discourage him from subpoenaing meno im not above using an edge like that myself but thered been nothing he liked dating younger women but he was single so there was no problem there his campaigns were largely funded by one of the biggest conservative political action committees in washington but all politicians campaigns were backed by pacs his just happened to be more flush than many others even his aide sandy alberts had been meticulous about severing all ties to all lobbying firms before coming to work for stevenson no edge to threaten him with and there was nothing i could offer him to make him forget about me i was exactly what he wanted to expose an agent of the government working for a shadowy organization and playing fast and loose with the laws of the country where did stevenson leave it i asked he wants to know about cases youve run in the past few years where perps went to trial to find out if any lifters or hitters i helped arrest were convicted on the basis of illegal taps i told my boss it was only loving there werent any others apparently that wont matter to him no it wouldnt a single incident of a crime is still a crime aaron said you know if i dont deliver case files hell subpoena them and hes going get you on the stand in the hearings which would be the end of my career as a shepherd and perhaps the start of a very embarrassing trial which would possibly end in a prison sentence were so close to loving i said sitting forward tensely in the chair please do the best you can to keep stevenson my boss normally as calm as i was now snapped im doing a lot of fucking interferencerunning for you on this job corte i know ill cooperate with stevenson completelywhen lovings in the can ill take whatever the consequences are you know this has put the whole organization in a real awkward position we cant afford to be public corte i know yes ill stall for a day or two if i can but if the subpoenas delivered theres nothing i can do i understand thanks aaron i hung up and sat back rubbing my eyes feeling utterly depleted what could i salvage from this mess even if i avoided jail it seemed my career as a shepherd was soon to be over i couldnt help but think about some of the assignments id run about some of my principals about claire dubois about abe fallow too but then i recalled that whatever happened in the future the kessler job wasnt finished yet we still had loving and the partner to nail and we still had a case to make against the primaryand id make damn sure that it was completely buttoned up independent of any bogus warrants i found the transcript of aslan zagaevs statement opened it and began to read i led a more or less successful life here ah but isnt success a moving target i have been having some problems financial in nature the economy who needs rugs when you cant afford your mortgage payments who goes to eat at my wonderful restaurant when you must buy bulk frozen dinners at sams club to feed your children how could i make more money did i have any service i could perform did i have anything valuable that i could sell then it occurred to me what if i could learn more about the operation behind the deaths of the pakistanis in the deli six years ago how valuable would that be i remembered the woman who was the point control officer behind the operation to kill them joanne kessler even if she had retired she would surely have valuable information or lead me to people who did i made some phone calls discreet phone calls to a connection of mine in damascus i learned there was indeed an interest in information of this sort a multimilliondollar interest a man there gave me henry lovings name when i finished i sat back he seemed pathetic more than that though he was a fool why risk prison where hed be spending the rest of his life for a bit more money it seemed like a curious motive for somebody who wasnt destitute and who had a family whom he will see from now on only through bars or bulletproof windows i could understand it if he were a true terrorist or if he were being blackmailed a thought occurred to me resulting in a ping in my gut i leaned forward fast and reread a portion of the transcript again i remembered the woman who was the point control officer behind the operation to kill them joanne kessler oh no i grabbed my com device and called lyle ahmad now i said i need you now the young clone showed up a moment later his face impassive eyes watchful yessir close the door wherere the principals he eased the thick oak panel shut and stepped to the desk ryans in the back den reading pretending to hes been drinking joannes in the bedroom marees on her computer in her room and barr patrolling the back perimeter i lowered my voice we have a situation about barr i think hes either been turned or hes a plant the officers eyes were still he was undoubtedly as alarmed as i was but like me he was approaching the situation calmly the way id taught him all right i explained my thinking when i told you and barr about joannes job with sickle i described her as a point control officer i remember but thats unique to our organization joanne called herself anchor on the hit teams zagaev though referred to her as point control ahmad was nodding how did he hear that term exactly the only way was if somebody here had told him barr and i added zagaev used joannes name sure he may have been involved with the couple killed at the deli but how could he have learned her name williams and the sickle people wouldve kept it secret i continued so loving got to somebody inside justice and learned that freddy was sending tony barr to the safe house he got to barr and turned him another grim possibility had occurred to me or hes not barr hes an imposter and the real barr is dead the unfortunate but logical conclusion i said to ahmad barror whoever he iscalled loving and told him we suspected joanne was the principal and zagaev might be the primary the lifter would have realized hed been handed the perfect misdirection hed tracked down zagaev and forced him into agreeing to play the role of primaryprobably using his family as an edge loving had briefed zagaev about all aspects of the operationthe helicopter for instanceand told him to convince us that joanne was in fact the target the chechnyan had made calls implicating himself and then when we caught up with him confessed taking the pressure off loving and the real primary but if its true the young officer pointed out why hasnt barr done anything more than give information to loving he couldve told him where the safe house is he couldve shot us all in the back this was true i dont know ive got to find out more but for now weve got to assume we have a hostile on the premises get all the principals into the den and stay with them and call the detention center and get a message to bill carter tell them im not going to pick him and amanda up yet i want them back in the slammer until i figure out whats going on yessir he headed out the door i stared at the transcript point control officer how could i verify my theory in order to get into the safe house barr had passed fingerprint and facial recognition scans so either he really was tony barr or somebody had gotten into the justice departments security serverspossibly an fbi employee or someone from any lawenforcementrelated federal organization i logged on to the bureau personnel server punched in the appropriate pass codes and looked over barrs profile the picture was identical distinguishing characteristics age his prints were therethey were the sample that geoff would have used to verify his identity everything pointed to the fact that the man here in the compound was tony barr i called up another screen and began searching social networking sites typing in tony barr along with relevant demographic information the world of google it took no more than three minutes to verify that we indeed had an imposter the real barr bore only a faint resemblance to the man in our backforty at the moment so barr was dead and the imposter was one of lovings partners i tucked away the shock at this confirmation and tried to figure out what his purpose here was or what loving was really up to i had no answers and to learn this i decided i needed some help i debated for a moment and then placed a call thiss williams rasped the voice its corte i know saw the number im watching the dispatches you got things taken care of meaning whyre you bothering me theres a possibility theyre not as taken care of as wed hoped a grunt i explained the situation williams took this in silently youre still alive so whats your fake agent up to thats the question i need to find out but i cant trust anybody in the bureau theres a mole there and theyre probably monitoring whats going on at my outfit do you have somebody we can use i found it curious he didnt hesitate matter of fact i do he gave me a phone number call him times critical i said how close are they williams offered a very expected chuckle a lot closer than you think chapter twenty minutes later i stepped outside smelling the chill moist air the aroma from a wood fire in the distance kids sometimes lit campfires in the park overlooking the potomac falls i recalled maree and me sitting uneasilyin my case at leaston the rock shelf forty feet above the raging water earlier this morning i recalled her kissing me then i forced myself to concentrate because the man fronting as tony barr was now approaching vigilant as ever and armed with an impressive automatic weapon i needed him to believe i had no inkling he was a partner of henry loving tony i said nodding the intense quiet man joined me his eyes kept scanning the property i asked lyles inside so far i was keeping my voice calm and looking at him in ways i thought appropriate to these circumstance yessir any word from philly he asked what the hell was loving up to i wondered i said nothing yet loving wont be there for another half hour or so at the earliest car keys jangled in my hand im going to pick up the kesslers daughter and their friend a sliver of moon kept appearing and vanishing as the thick clouds scooted by above us maple and oak sloughed silver leaves in the breeze and the tall hemlocks in the side yard swayed the wind breathed easily i looked around the property its a lot different here now with the primary in custody and the lifter about to be nailed you can almost enjoy it i glanced at the imposters black angular machine gun it wasnt pointed near me but if he caught on that i knew who he was id be dead before i could move an inch the man said thats trueexcept for some deer with a suicidal personality who jumped out of the bushes over there a little while ago we almost had venison for breakfast just heard him again the same place theyre not really very bright are they i dont think thats why god made them was he suspicious i couldnt tell i continued listen tony when i get back i want to coordinate getting the kesslers to fairfax in the morning lovingll be in custody by then but i want some protection on them for the next couple of days until everythings resolved agent frederick said you might be willing to take that on i was vamping overdoing it i wondered i wasnt sure a bad performance would kill me yessir if hed like i smiled meaning youre not all that crazy about babysitting detail he grinned too im happy to be of help sir appreciate it then a faint snap came from the front yard both of us shared a troubled look and turned toward the sound tense squinting what do you think that was i asked our deer he asked in a whisper i shook my head not in the front they dont go there the sound was repeated louder we trained the muzzles of our weapons in the direction of the snap the hell is it he asked we got the answer a moment later as we saw another rock sail over the house and land in the driveway diversion i rasped with alarm in my voice we both spun around fastto see a man covering us with a silenced semiautomatic pistol hed come up behind us quietly as we were staring toward the sound after flinging the stones over the roof to distract us the lean sandyhaired man was wearing the same green jacket hed been wearing on saturday at the assault on the kesslers house and at the flytrap i whispered its lovings partner his the barrimposter began to ask but before he finished the sentence the man in the green jacket squinted lifted his weapon toward my leg and fired three times i cried out and went down hard chapter the bullets in fact hadnt hit me at all and the man in the jacket wasnt lovings partner he was williamss security expert a man named jonny poguethe one who was indeed closer than i would have thought as williams had said after his grunting chuckle pogue had been stationed directly across the road and had been shadowing us for days to make certain that joanne and her dark secrets didnt fall into the wrong hands thats what hed been doing at the kesslers house and at the flytrap but since he was operating undercover he never contacted us and wed assumed he was the partner over the phone shortly before pogue and i had worked out the ruse that was now unfolding a strategy that might get to the truth about the imposter and what lovings true plan was a strategy that might also get both pogue and me killed pogue knelt down and pretended to search me carefully as he did so he turned his back to the imposter and was completely vulnerable but the man who could have shot him at any moment was confused that pogue was ignoring him and further disarmed by pogues picking up my glock and handing it to the phony fbi agent here im sorry he said taking the weapons uncertainly but who the fuck are you pogue henry never said loving doesnt know about me i work for the man who hired him this was a gamble that pogue and i had discussed if the imposter himself worked for the primary the whole play would end right nowmaybe bloodily but then i heard him give a brief laugh and say oh sure that explains it ive been keeping an eye on you and henry just to make sure things go according to plan pogue rose and extended his hand whats the name mccall they shook hands briefly then pogue muttered well mccall we got a problem you know the insidergot you the info about barr and your picture up on the bureau website mccall nodded absently looking around i dont know who it is just somebody in that asshole fredericks office so the mole was in freddys department this was bad i didnt react however just clutched my leg and moaned mccall seemed to enjoy it well whoever they are they changed their fucking mind pogue spat out theyre talking shit no shit yeah there was a mocking quality about the comment the sort youd hear between two soldiers on allied armies pogue was acting in top form sickle mccall asked they know about me i dont know maybe not yet but they will its just a matter of time till they figure out that you clipped barr defensively mccall said the bodys in a storm drain take em days to find it you can fucking hope but the point is weve gotta bail get to henry and warn himwe cant use the phones or radio they have all our numbers and frequencies what about him mccall pointed my own glock at me hes coming with us theres things my boss wants to know but the priority is weve got to get to henry i mean now where is he last time i talked to him he was pretty close mccall smirked they bought all that crap about him going to philly well lets get to him before they track him down where is he exactly careful i thought to pogue i was worried he might be overdoing it he was going to facility after he and the crew picked up the target pogue asked the target joanne kessler mccall frowned no no man she doesnt have anything to do with this i mean the real target amanda the daughter chapter amanda she was the kessler they were after not ryan or his wife i desperately tried to piece together how this could be recovering pogue said i know that i just thought henryd want to take joanne and her husband out mccall shrugged maybe but he didnt say anything to me about it pogue muttered i want to get the fuck out of here now well meet him at the facility where is it again this was a good try i probably would have waited a little longer to pry some more details out but there it was and i could tell by the thick silence that followed that the ruse was over mccall had grown suspicious i couldnt take a chance hed discard my glockit was unloadedand go for his machine gun i rolled to my feet now take him gasping mccall reacted fast lifting the only weapon in his grip my glock toward us pogue muttered calmly its empty he targeted mccall with the suppressed beretta i stepped forward and grabbed my glock from mccalls hand reloaded drew the slide and released it i covered mccall gaping at us in shock as pogue slipped restraints onto his hands cinching them tight i took my phone and quickly dialed the detention center lyle ahmad now appeared from the bushes where hed been stationed with his own m a night scope mounted id sent ahmad into the woods to target the imposter while pogue and i put on our little performance to see what we could learn from the man grasping how completely hed been suckered mccall muttered im fucked he was staring at my leg where the bullet holes should have been i am so fucked i spoke to the supervisor at the detention center and learned that he still couldnt get in touch with the guards who were escorting bill carter and amanda back from the rendezvous point i exhaled slowly between gritted teeth now that i realized amanda was the target i knew that mccall would have told loving the girl and bill carter were leaving the detention center he wouldnt know the rendezvous spot specifically but loving or other partners could have been waiting outside the prison for the car to emerge call me the minute you hear anything yessir i disconnected i knew the mole was in the bureau so i couldnt call freddy for a tactical team and i couldnt contact anybody in our organization even claire in case the traitor was in touch with someone there i debated and decided to call local police and county troopers sending them to search the road between the detention center and the rendezvous spota strip mall in sterling virginia there was a possibility of a kidnapping i told them i warned them that the suspect or suspects were armed i slipped the phone away and crouched beside mccall who was sitting slumped forward on the grass his eyes met mine every fourth heartbeat you were the one shooting at us in north east at the warehouse i asked and you were the one who got the trackers onto my car he said nothing but a flicker in his eyes told me that i was on the money and at bill carters place you were in the woods across the road mccalls lips tightened but still he remained silent why do they want amanda no response where is this facility what is it im not saying anything in a raspy voice pogue said you just admitted killing tony barr a federal agent you have no leverage here mccall whispered miserable whatever youd do to me it doesnt come close to what loving would do if he found out i talked ive got family friendslovingd take them out in a minute or do worse well protect them i said from loving mccall laughed coldly right you said you didnt know the primarys name what do you know about him silence my phone buzzed i stepped away and quickly hit answer corte it was a captain with the state police sir some of my troopers found william carter hes alive wounded but alive a security guard from northern virginia detention is dead and the girl afraid shes gone they were about six miles from the prison carter said a black suv ran them onto the shoulder shot out the tires three men inside none of them fit the description of the suspect loving three other actors carter didnt get any look at the tag what happened there amanda kicked one of the suspects you know where then she turned around and shoved carter down a steep hill into a creekto save him you know kid was a real hero carter said she started to jump after him but they got her a hero like her father they fired on him but they didnt want to wait around and took off winged him in the ankle but hell live which direction did they go no idea sir we put it out on the wire but so far nothing follow up no keep it quiet for the time being yessir after we disconnected i looked at the house where the girls father and stepmother waited i looked over the fields around the house growing lighter and darker as passing clouds squelched the moonlight from time to time debating were the three men in the suv the primaries or were they muscle too or other partners of loving i wondered again what information could a primary possibly want to extract from a sixteenyearold girl i glanced at pogue then crouched down in front of mccall calm corte whatever happens you have to stay calm when you look into your opponents face when you talk to him it should be like youre discussing cornflakes never more emotional than that emotions deadly whats the goal i asked myself whats the most efficient way to achieve it i knew these questions i knew them in my heart yet for some reason now i grabbed mccall by the collar gripped until he started to choke and shouted where did they take her he shook his head as best he could whats the facility where is it twisting harder i felt ahmads eyes on me hed never seen me like this spittle formed in the corners of mccalls lips where i raged his terrified eyes turned toward me but he still remained silent i released him stood up i didnt want to take him into the house with my principals i glanced toward the panic house a small outbuilding about the size of a detached threecar garage it didnt look substantial but it was people could flee inside seal the doors and be safe from any kind of armament up to the level of a rocketpropelled grenade get him inside ahmad and pogue dragged mccall roughly into the outbuilding i remained on the dewy grass and looked toward the panic house the heavy steel door was open and the lights were on inside i could see mccall shackled to a kitchen chair his face wasnt defiant he was scared the place was brightly lit and painted in easy colorsyellow and pastel blueon the theory that if there was an extended siege the occupants might be less inclined to surrender if the setting was cheery little things like that make a difference i turned away and walked to the main house i punched in the key to the door i wasnt looking forward to delivering the news all of my principals were clustered around a window staring out i hadnt explained to them about my suspicions of the man posing as barr but i now gave them the details of how hed gotten inside and how zagaev was a feint oh christ maree said he couldve killed us while we were asleep he couldve like cut our throats ryan asked whos the other one the tall guy it was joanne who spoke his names jon pogue he works for my organization then her voice faded as she looked at me why would they need a feint though corte getting a mole inside here shouldve been enough what else is going on i inhaled a little deeper than usual its amanda theyre after and theyve got her joannes mouth tightened and ryan growled where where is she we dont know but theres no doubt amanda was the kessler they wanted no no maree whispered joanne said in a voice as calm as mine why what does she know i shook my head ryans face was red those pricks my little girl what then it seemed forming words became too much for him and bill joanne asked minor injuries hell be okay they killed the detention center guard who was with them we believe theyve taken amanda to a rendezvous site nearby lovings on his way there but we dont know where we tried to find out from mccall but he caught on and hes not saying anything ryan muttered well jesus whatre we going to do i said i could use some help my eyes on joanne she lifted an eyebrow i said part of mccall wants to cooperate i can tell hes on the borderline im thinking if you could talk to him he might help us out appeal to his sense of decency she asked as amandas stepmother yes her eyes swung to the wedge of light falling on the grass from the open door of the panic building ill give it a try chapter pogue and i stood outside the closed door to the outbuilding i observed him closely for the first time the head beneath that sandy hair was long a predators skull his features were pinchedtheyd circled in on themselvesand a scar curved forward from his chin short and narrow from a knife not shrapnel he didnt smile or offer much expression and i doubted that he ever did no wedding ring no jewelry i noted remnants of stitching where insignias had been removed from his green jacket i supposed that it was a personal favorite and that hed had the garment for years his narrow hips were encircled by a worn canvas belt it held a special holstera clamp basically fitted for a silenced pistoland a number of magazine holders along with a knife and several small boxes whose purpose i couldnt guess unlike ryan kessler pogue didnt constantly tap or fidget with his weapons he knew where they were if he needed them on the ground beside him was a battered dark nylon rucksack whose contents were heavy id heard a clank when hed set it down he stood with his arms crossed looking over the property with the eye of a shepherd as if he werent aware of my presence finally he said missed this one meaning barr i assumed he continued i had information bits of it but nothing fit together though that wasnt completely true the bits did fit together like a machinecut jigsaw puzzle id been focused on the individual pieces though not the image as a whole im not much of a jigsaw playerits not really a gamebut i know the strategy generally is to do the outer border first so that you have a framework and then fill in exactly what i hadnt done here id made a lot of assumptions he looked at my back you like that glock i do theyre fine firearms then with a hint of criticism prefer a little longer barrel myself interesting holster nodding down at his hip hmm he replied more silence pogue said evolution there was some thoughtfulness in his voice while pursuing my various college degrees i usually found time to take some courses for no reason other than that i was curious about the topic once id taken a very good class in medical school called darwin and the history of biology also because the lecture hall was next to where peggy was taking anatomy i was curious what pogue meant and i glanced his way weapons reflect efficient evolution more than anything else in society dont you think survival of the fittest in a way but not quite what darwin was thinking of but it proved to be an interesting idea pogue continued youve got medicine and vehicles and paint and clocks computers processed food you name it think about them giving mercury as medicine or leaching blood out of people or making airplanes that crash and bridges that collapse engineers and scientists just flailing around trying to get it right killing people themselves included in the process failure after failure after failure i suppose thats true but weapons theyre efficient from the gitgo an accent slightly southern protruded efficient you couldnt have a sword that broke the first time you used it you couldnt have a musket that blew up in your facethe men who made those made em right the first time no luxury for error thats why you can still shoot gunsre two hundred years old and some of em are pretty damn accurate natural selection pogue said darwinian gunsmithing some heady thinking from a man who even if he wasnt technically a government killer protected them for a living we fell silent not because of the conversation but because ryan kessler was limping down from the house like a bear just out of hibernation pogue and i nodded toward him anything the detective eyed the outbuilding not yet we stood in silence ryans hands were in his pockets he stared down his eyes were red hows maree holding up okay more silence then came the snap of a lock as the door opened ryan jumped pogue and i did not joanne stepped out and announced ive got it i know where amanda is without another word she started for the house walking ahead of us as she used disinfectant wipes to clean the blood off her hands chapter in game theory the concept of the grim trigger is an interesting one this occurs in iterated gamesthose in which the same opponents play the same game against each other over and over again eventually players settle into strategies that achieve the best common good even if its less than perfect for their own selfinterest for instance they learn in the prisoners dilemma the best outcome is to refuse to confess but sometimes player a defects breaks the pattern by confessing which means he gets off scotfree while prisoner b gets a much longer sentence player b then might play grim trigger abandoning any semblance of cooperation and defecting forever another way to put it is that if one player decides even one time not to play by the rules the opponent from then on plays exclusivelyand ruthlesslyfor his own selfinterest there was no cooperation involved between henry loving and me of course in this deadly game we were playing but the same theory applied by kidnapping a teenager to torture her and extract information as far as i was concerned loving had defected i was now playing grim trigger which meant unleashing joanne kesslerin her incarnation as lily hawthorneon lovings associate mccall to lift the information from him whatever that took my interrogation skills are good but it would take time to get somebody like mccall terrified of henry loving to talk i needed somebody he would fear more hence my subtle request to joanne in the living room twenty minutes before using chilling euphemisms which she picked up on instantly i could see from her eyes appeal to his sense of decency as amandas stepmother yes she and i had then gone to the outbuilding wed found mccall looking up from the heavy chair scared yes but resolute in not betraying loving as id gestured ahmad out mccall had barked an uneasy laugh youre giving me that voodoo look corte whats this about joanne kessler definitely wasnt giving him any looks she was just studying him why isnt anybody saying anything his voice caught the sense of threat in the room reminded me of the zagaev interrogation bert santoro and i had conducted not long ago only this was real joanne had nodded to me and id gone to a control panel in the wall and inserted a key and hit several buttons id told her no communication out or in the videos off youre invisible look joanne mccall had said desperately i just cant help you out im sorry i wish i could but i cant i feel for you i really do if there was any way she wasnt paying any attention to him shed turned back to me and asked any tools here under the sink nothing fancy thats all i need joanne had then closed the door another thing about the outbuilding the designers completely soundproofed the place the reason for this was so that the principals couldnt hear threats or demands coming from the outside the corollary was that neither could you hear screams from inside night was around the compound as we gathered on the front porch of the safe house joanne seemed no more agitated than someone whod survived a bargain basement sale at a mall store standing her ground at the popular sizes and snagging the best she said to me theyve taken her to an old military installation on route fifteen near leesburg a mile south of oatlands i knew oatlands a venue for renaissance fairs and dog shows peggy and i had taken the boys there once she continued the facilitys about a hundred yards west of fifteen down an unmarked dirt road in the side of a hill like a bunker mccall doesnt know why they want her its very secret he wouldve told me if he did joanne was speaking loudly she realized this and reached up and extracted the cotton balls from her ears lovingll be there soon and in about an hour the primary or the people who work for him will too nothing at all about why they want her no he said it wasnt hard to find or kidnap amanda anybody could have done that her voice was rock steady as she said the reason they hired loving was that nobody else was willing to torture a teenager if it came to that ryan gasped i noted that joanne and her husband had not looked at each other since shed left the outbuilding hed glanced inside to see her handiwork there was a lot of blood on the floor the reaction on her husbands face was one you dont see often in a police officer joanne continued the three men who took her are minders they might work for the primary or maybe loving hired them mccall doesnt know only the primary knows what information to extract even loving doesnt i asked does loving expect mccall no hes supposed to stay here within cover this was good if hed been required to say report to loving every fifteen minutes that would have been a tactical problem but now it was our move what strategy was best rock paper or scissors joanne turned to pogue a g team id never heard the term but it wasnt hard to deduce the operative said two three hours were not as mobile here as we used to be more new york and la i glanced at pogue you and me id say he cast an eye toward joanne and for a moment it occurred to me that while he may not have been the partner on the pakistani deli hit there was history between them a voice said firmly im going too ryan kessler i said not unsympathetically this isnt your expertise ryan because ive been sitting behind a desk for six years watching my ass spread ive been on tac ops in the past i know what im doing no because youre involved shes your daughter you cant engage a hostile if youre involved its not efficient look the man said sounding reasonable its no risk my being there he doesnt want me corte i pointed out he could use you as an edge to get amanda to talk shes a sixteenyearold girl ryan muttered he doesnt need an edge he barks at her and she tells him what he wants to know that wasnt the amanda kessler id seen youre too emotional theres nothing wrong with that but youll have to stand down thats a dirty word to you corte isnt it emotion tough being a robot isnt it ryan honey please joanne said reverting to the good wife shed been earlier or more accurately the role of the good wife shed been playing i didnt argue with ryan how could i he was percent right he walked close maybe its time to take the gloves off corte and be honest it was all bullshit wasnt it what you said i could see what was coming youve just been patting me on the head havent you the way youve been handling me is it out of the bodyguards manual of tricks give your principal some busywork lie to him tell him hes going to help you save the day well take down loving together just wait till were someplace else then send him off to guard a field of fucking daisies and ragweed in fairfax at my house you knew loving wasnt going to come at us from that direction didnt you you had me guard it to keep me occupied i hesitated yes i did and you still had the balls to tell me what a great job id done he shook his head oh fuck corte and when there actually was somebody to take down heremccallyou didnt consider me did you you called in our friend a contemptuous glance at pogue you have a term for it for keeping us principals busy making sure we sit in the corner with our toys and dont bug the adults come on corte ry honey please you shut up he snapped to joanne then turned back so what do you call it baitandswitch you son of a bitch he muttered guard the side yard ryan aim low avoid his femoral artery youre probably a great shot i needed to get you on my side and sharing your war stories how you got started in the business your sign cutting your orienteering all lies no bullshit my heart went out to him how could it not a man whod been robbed of a career he lovedand by his wife no less whod been robbed of his status as a hero and lied to by me he whispered give me this chance im a good shot and the limps nothing i can move fast if i have to joanne said no ry let them handle it im sorry i told him well im going anyway he was speaking to me you cant stop me i know where she is after youre gone ill just get in somebodys fucking car and go anyway his hand strayed to his weapon a moment of dense silence my eyes needed only to slip toward lyle ahmad and the former marine stepped up behind easing ryan to the floor with a basic wrist grip on his gun hand there was a countermove by which ryan the larger of the men could have escaped but if hed ever known it hed forgotten his eyes on mine he growled fucking coward you couldnt even take me yourself could you had to have somebody get me from behind i stepped forward and slipped nylon restraints around his wrists no he cried im sorry shes my daughter it was joanne i was looking at though for the first time since id met her tears were now streaking down her cheeks ahmad got ryan into a sitting position i leaned down toward his thick damp face dark with anger i said firmly im going to bring her back to you this is what i do ill bring her back safe chapter route is a hilly road through the heart of civil war virginia forty miles outside of washington large private estates on the capillaries of horse country fight against the encroaching cookiecutter developments with streets named according to themes like camelot flora colonial new england youll find oddities along the highway decrepit abandoned farms whose owners arent willing to sell to salivating developers or who have simply disappearedoften because they prefer staying off the grid for any number of reasons there are also ominous structures stained concrete or rusting steel ringed with dire warning signs and sharp equally rusty wire blanketed with kudzu they once supported various attempts at defense systems during the cold war we cant take down intercontinental ballistic missiles nowadays much less fifty years ago but that didnt stop the army or air force from trying some of these buildings were actually for sale but since most of them had served as weapons storage facilities the toxic cleanup costs would be prohibitive id done a thorough rundown of our destination usaflc facility a large concrete building only thirty or forty minutes from the safe house in great falls i piloted my car past the facility now and noted the concrete facade and the forty or fiftyfoot mound of earth grass covered that the building disappeared into it was as mccall had told joanne set back about one hundred yards the gate was closed but the fences around the front and sides werent imposing and didnt appear to be electrified or mounted with sensors i eased to a stop examining the place through my xenonics night vision monocular pogue said two suvs cant tell the tags some lights inside the building one person outside cant tell if hes armed assume he is i continued pulling off the shoulder into bushes then shut the engine off it was and dark normally the stars were striking here but tonight they were invisible thanks to the blanketing clouds pogue and i climbed out waited for a semi to burn along the road spinning up dust and limp leaves in its wake we crossed the road and moved toward the facility using the dense brush and trees for cover pogue studied the place again through the monocular and held up a single index finger only one guard still i looked too a youngish man with a close crew cut he wore dark jeans and a sweatshirt he kept his hand at his side and when he turned and made some brief rounds i could see that he wore a semiautomatic pistol on his hip still thirty yards away pogue slipped an earpiece in and spoke into his collar i couldnt hear the words clearly but i deduced he was reporting in to williams joannes former boss if mccall was right about the times the primary had not yet arrived this conclusion was reasonable since there were only two vehicles herelovings and the suv the minders had used to kidnap the girl amanda would be held for the time being until the primary who wanted the information from her arrived the reason they hired loving was that nobody else was willing to torture a teenager if it came to that what on earth could she possibly know something shed learned about one of her fathers earlier cases or something else like all teens in the dc area shed have friends whose mothers or fathers worked for the government and for government contractors had she and a girlfriend read through files in a parents computer something classified but that question would have to wait our job now was simple save the girl pogue listened for a moment and whispered a few more words then he signed off he eased closer to me and whispered williams says youre in charge how do we handle it i dont want to wait for the primary i want to extract her now use nonlethal if possible at least on one of them i wanted somebody alive to learn who was behind this all right he glanced at my gun you tapped meaning was my glock threaded for a silencer i rarely had reason even to draw my weapon let alone make sure it fired in a whisper no he handed me his one in the bedroom safetys on hed tell me this because glocks dont have a safety lever they have a double trigger that prevents accidental discharges i was familiar with the beretta though and slid the lever smoothly to the fire position the italians made as efficient weapons as the austrians i was curious why hed given me his gun then he said cover me he opened his backpack and extracted some metal and plastic pieces he assembled them into a small crossbow steel the evolution of weapons it took two strokes to cock it the bolt he loaded didnt have a sharp tip but instead an elongated tube i should be a little closer he whispered we moved forward i was in the lead using my training as an orienteer and amateur sign cutter yet again to keep our transit silent i thought back briefly to that very long very hot day outside san antonio leading the illegals to safety as quietly and as unobtrusively as i could pogue and i eased into a compacted stand of weeds about forty feet from the guard with a nod at the bow pogue said stun gun itll immobilize him for about twenty seconds so well have to get to him fast ill go first you come behind and cover me with the beretta youre okay with that right meaning killing somebody i said yes i aimed toward the doorway where any reinforcements would come from go i whispered chapter pogue lifted the weapon looking completely at ease like a man about to cast a fly into a clear stream he was compensating for gravity and the slight breeze when the guard turned away from us pogue pulled the trigger with a faint snap the bolt zipped into the air in a perfect arc hitting the man somewhere in the middle of the back i didnt know how many volts the flying taser had but it was enough the guard went down shivering then we were on our feet running in tandem pogue had dropped the bow and had a backup pistol in his hand with the silenced automatic i scanned the doorway the buildings windows and the area around us for signs of hostiles there were none pogue hogtied the guard with plastic restraints and slapped an adhesive gag over his mouth he bent down and pocketed the mans phone and radio after shutting them off as well as his pistol while i patted him down for other weapons even though tactical ops arent my specialty i knew you never left weapons for the other side to pick up later take or trash the saying went i dug the mans wallet out of his pocket i was disappointed but not surprised to see he was a pro and there was no evidence of his employer or affiliation he had four drivers licensesdifferent names same picturemoney and credit cards in those various names in a moment the man revived he looked up at us fearfully and began to retch pogue and i dragged him around the corner of the building and i ripped the gag off and let him vomit when he was done pogue slapped another gag on him i crouched down and pulled out the small lockingblade buck knife i carry i opened it with a soft click the man stirred i pointed to the gag and held up two fingers terrifying the man even more pogue applied a second i bent close and said is loving here a hesitation pogue gripped one of the mans hands and i scraped the blade across the top of a nail painless but persuasive even with the gag you could hear the terrified scream a yes nod how many people inside total i began to count at four he bobbed his head up and down vigorously and the man who hired loving we know hes on his way when will he get here blinkeach blink is five minutes i tallied them up it came to a half hour who is he a series of desperate nos i believed he didnt know the primarys identity inside those four are they all with the girl a shrug but a terrified one and i suspected he didnt know where i began running through various directions at which he either nodded or shook his head once or twice he shrugged apparently they were in the back of the facility straight down the main corridor though he didnt know or couldnt remember if it was upstairs or down while just one story here at the entrance farther inside the hill there were multiple floors dubois had learned i nodded to pogue and closed my eyes and tilted my head briefly the man extracted a heavyduty hypodermic syringe the guard stirred violently probably thinking we were going to kill him but pogue got the needle into a vein skillfully and a moment later he was asleep how long i whispered two hours give or take i ripped the gag off fearful that the guard might vomit again and choke to death pogue looked at me questioningly as if he didnt care what happened to the man but said nothing at the front door i spit on the hinges to keep them from squealing and we eased it silently open i expected to find batterypowered lamps but the overhead lights were working pogue shrugged at what could be deduced from the functioning power perhaps the facility had been taken over by henry loving a place of businessto ply his trade as a lifter it was intimidating subjects would be terrified to be brought here also the walls were thick enough to withstand a russian assaultwhich meant that any locals passing nearby couldnt hear the screams from inside the linoleumfloored corridor stained from water seepage extended straight to the back of the facility i looked for cameras or other security systems and found none i returned the silenced beretta to pogue and drew my glock we started down the hundredfootlong hallway keeping to the shadows pogue was in front and i watched the rear regularly he tried doorknobs occasionally but the doors were locked apparently there was only this one main way in and out of the facility though there would have to be some fire exits escape would come later though first i had to find the principal that id lost where the corridor ended there were stairs leading both down and up which way i played another game i mentally flipped a coin up won chapter pausing to listen on the secondfloor landing faint noises the source impossible to guess came from unknown directions taps clicks water dripping the air here was raw with the scent of mold and very chill i knew that interrogators regularly use underheated interview rooms the door to the second floor was locked and we continued to the third floor the top at the far end of this corridor we could see illumination about fifty feet ahead we moved quickly along the shabby linoleum to the doorway from which the light filtered we paused outside and glanced in the door opened onto a wide balcony overlooking the second floor a very large room seventyfive by a hundred feet or so the place was a control room of some sort filled with gray desks partitions and metal electronics consoles from which the guts had been removed the smell of musty paper joined that of the mold the overhead lights were off but at the far end on the other side of high partitions were pools of illumination i pointed and with pogue now covering me we went in the direction of the light crouching practically on our knees we came to a stairwell heading down to the main floor but stayed on the balcony soon we could hear voices rising and falling softly from the far end of the room in the direction in which we were headed mens voices i couldnt make out the words but there were some tones of impatience followed by a calm utterance perhaps reassurance if amanda was there she wasnt speaking we continued farther down the balcony moving slowly there was a lot of trash up here including broken glass and scraps of sheet metal which we had to avoid the men were speaking softly they would easily hear the sound made by a careless footfall finally we got to the end of the balcony below us were the pools of light wed seen i rose slowly and peeked over the edge the light i saw was cast by two cheap mismatched lamps sitting on desks incongruously one sported a disney shade torn and stained nemo i noted only ten feet from it sat amanda kessler in dusty jeans and dark blue sweatshirt the girl huddled in a gray metal office chair face grim and defiant her knees were drawn up her wrists were duct taped but theyd let her keep her bear purse with its silly grin her captors were underneath us obscured by the overhanging balcony loving and the three others if we could get the four of them into the open out from under the balcony wed be in an excellent shooting position i raised two fingers and drew my hand across my throat two more raised fingers then the letter l to indicate loving and i pointed to my shoulder i wanted two dead and loving and one other wounded to keep them alive for interrogation a shattered clavicle or scapula will completely disable a hostile unlike a leg shot pogue acknowledged my message while i looked around the floor to find something to fling into the shadows to draw them outas pogue himself had done at the safe house just hours before one of the kidnappers entered our line of sight below walking toward the girl he paused before he got to amanda who watched him with narrowed eyes he picked up a coffee cup the bulky man was in a suit he sipped and looked around the room they fired missiles from here i dont know came another voice not lovings it was nikes what like the shoe like the greek god the voices had no southern drawl there are silos around here someplace in clifton in case the russians attacked the russians why would they attack us jesus i picked up a few bits of broken glass pogue saw and silently took a second magazine for the beretta out of his holster and set it on the floor in front of him i kept my second in my pocket i only had one extra unlike pogue who seemed to have about a hundred rounds on him and if the operation became one of pursuit or escape under fire i didnt want to leave any ammunition behind where is he another voice called be patient i felt a chill hearing the calm voice of henry loving you think they know that we have her not yet mccall wouldve let us know the girl said suddenly youre going to get arrested all of you or shot amanda kessler was not unlike the others whispering her voice was strident the man with the coffee glanced at her but said nothing neither did anybody else my fathers a policeman we know came another voice but loving shushed him chats inefficient be quiet i glanced at pogue from his pocket he withdrew earplugs i was familiar with them they block out the high decibels and pitch of gunfire but allow human voices through he handed a pair to me i shoved them in i took a deep breath and let fly the piece of glass which landed with a tink in the far corner of the room the hostile in view set down the coffee and drew his pistol fuck was that two others appeared from below the balcony one with a dark automatic in his hand moving forward slowly that was three we needed the fourth to make our plan work where was loving come on from directly underneath us the lifter calmly ordered call out front as the three men in front of us looked around one lifted a radio jamie whats up is he here yet we heard something inside receiving no response he looked back uncertainly i let fly another bit of glass and it skidded across the floor both of the armed men below us lifted their weapons shut the radio off loving commanded and stepped into view we now had all four targets in front of us bracketing amanda loving and the man with the radio were to the right of her and the two armed captors on the left pogue pointed to the two with the weapons and drew his finger over his throat then to himself he was after all a professional killer and i was in effect the opposite i prepared to shoot into the shoulder of the man on the right and henry loving i aimed pogue held up three fingers of his left hand and began counting down i trained my sights on loving the image in my mind was abe fallow two it was then that amanda gave a gasp and jerked back oh shit she screamed no she was staring down the men crouched and separated and we momentarily lost our targets one stepped back just out of view pogue and i froze the girl said a rat theres a rat under the chair get it away a the captor nearest her muttered fuck scared the shit out of me he stood and stepped forward close to amanda looking under the chair pogue and i started to aim once more which was when the girls bound hands lifted the bear purse to her mouth she unzipped it with her teeth and manage to pull out a small black canister she aimed awkwardly but fired a stream of orange pepper spray directly into the startled face of her captor from two feet away it shot straight into his eyes he screamed and dropped his gun which amanda dove for the man beside him swung his gun toward her loving shouted no pogue and i simultaneously shot the man who was about to fire at amanda henry loving knew instantly what had happened and as we turned our guns toward him and the others he swept his arm into the lamps which shattered on the floor plunging the room into darkness the only illumination now was the ruddy glow from the three exit signs pogue and i stared down into the murky scene where i had a vague image of amanda scrabbling away from the men into the obstacle course of the room then beneath me i heard the whispers of the three remaining captors as they planned their strategy chapter now it didnt matter if there was a mole in freddys office or not since loving knew about our presence so i hit send transmitting the text id prepared earlier it gave freddy a brief explanation and an urgent request for backup i told him too that the primary was en route so to set up roadblocks around the facility amandas heroics had guaranteed that we now needed all the help we could get eyes growing accustomed to the darkness we made our way down the stairway to the floor of the control room i saw a dim form but whether it was a shadow or a silhouette i didnt know i aimed but was well aware it might be amanda and waited for a clear image i never got one he or she disappeared i heard hard breathing and faint groans from the man amanda had sprayed fuck that hurts okay okay i can see ive got my weapon who the fucks here from somewhere not that far away loving hissed for their silence where was amanda a moment later i heard more whispering loving was playing a bayesian game now one modeled on imperfect information he wouldnt know whom he was up against how many we were who we were what our agenda was but hed be making instantaneous adjustments in assessing the probability of what his enemy would do hed think there might be just one adversary herehe wouldnt have heard the second shot from pogues silenced weapon he knew that the attacker had eliminated the guard out front he knew that the opponent was willing to fire without surrender demands another bit of information was that to distract them wed flung glass into the corner of the control room meaning this was a very limited operation with no swat backup had the bureaus hostage rescue team been on hand this place would have been lit up like times square loving would be thinking he and his men outnumbered the opponents and that they still had some time enough to find the girl and escape a piercing scream filled the black space amanda she was near me i could hear the sounds of a struggle then a loud clank and a man shouted in pain need some help she got me with that fucking spray shit im in the northwest corner quiet loving shouted as pogue and i separated instinctively and moved fast in that direction i fired covering shots high the shadowy figure by the door lifted his gun and fired a round in my general direction pogue returned fire a burst of three and sent the man to the floor though he wasnt hitnot badly at leastsince he continued to fire i tallied one dead one or two hit by pepper spray fuck she got away another voice called were federal agents i called weve got teams outside too pogue shouted we know there are three of you i want all three with hands up standing in the light of the exit door do it now or we will engage you then henry loving spoke again corte youre running a rogue operation we wont kill the girl we just need some information back out fuck you amanda cried amanda i called get on the floor lie down wherever you are stay down be quiet this was greeted with several more shots in my direction stop the firing loving said adamantly where are you amanda cried just get on the floor there are a huge crack of explosion and i was rolling backward blinded a flashbang grenade underestimated them i thought even the earplugs didnt save my hearing this time pogue too hadnt expected the grenade and had been slammed into the desk hard still he struggled to his knees again and looked for a target though the flash had been so bright our vision was fuzzy we both scrabbled away from the place where one of the kidnappers had lobbed the nonlethal stun grenade i was desperate to find amanda but didnt dare call again for fear of giving away my position i could tell from their shadows they were moving in flanking us it was then that i heard a noise behind me and spun around as the attacker only a few feet away lunged forward slamming me to the floor chapter the attacker was kicking and trying desperately to get to my weapon at the same time as my vision began to return i caught a whiff of sweat and perfume amanda i whispered its me corte i pushed her off me the girl backed up squinting and aiming the pepper spray into my face in the red light from the exit sign i could see her grim eyes shes got some grit your daughter itd take a lot to get her rattled the panic bled from her expression oh mr corte her cheeks were damp but not from crying the residual gas from the spray was irritating her like everybody else here i pulled the duct tape off her wrists pogue looked our way and gestured us down then scanned the nearby portions of the office the girl collapsed against me not in panic though she was exhausted nearby the sound of metal hitting the concrete floor eyes and ears pogue snapped i closed my eyes and pulled amanda close her face in my chest covering her ears when the grenade went off this time we were prepared except that this grenade was different there was a hiss and pop rather than an explosion i looked up to see a brilliant white light fill the entire room shooting stark shadows onto the walls at the same time the phosphorous burst out in a small dome and ignited the nearby portion of floor the partitions and the upholstery of the office chairs the brilliant white light died but the fire continuedand it grewand we could just make out shadowy forms moving briefly on the far side of the room then vanishing a moment later another grenade landed closer to us we scrabbled away before it detonated and another sphere of the sticky incendiary rose phosphorous is like napalm it sticks like glue and will burn through clothing and skin we cant stay here pogue whispered looking right and left eyes scanning constantly okay heres what we do we cant all run a defense going back out the main corridor so im going to keep them pinned you and the girl go out the front when help comes tell em where i am pogues approach was the only logical one i said freddys on his way shouldnt be long another grenade flew toward us and we were just able to get out of the way in time it detonated starting a third fire i considered a possible strategy i whispered one minute i eased amanda down under a desk and gestured for pogue to cover her he acknowledged this i made my way a little closer to where i believed the latest grenade had come from i knew the flashbang grenades would have stunned the others hearing too and i was betting that loving might not recognize my voice i took a deep breath and shouted henry hes behind you ten feet loving didnt fall for it in fact he instantly anticipated the strategy and called no everybody down but one of his colleagues had risen from cover and spun around lifting his gun a perfect target i fired a group of three two in the chest one in the head he dropped hard pogue acknowledged this with a nod two down i ducked to cover as the other associate of lovings fired blindly in my direction i bent down you ready amanda im totally ready pogue moved twenty feet away from us to a spot where hed draw their fire he unscrewed the silencer and let go with five or six rounds throughout the room the beretta roared crouching amanda and i dodged sputtering whitehot fires and pushed through the exit door on the secondfloor hallway i was afraid that the door was locked from this side too but it wasnt and i kicked it open a machine pistol started firing along with another flashbang then another loving understood that amanda and i had escaped and the two remaining hostiles were doing all they could to take pogue out and get past him then the girl and i were in the stairwell and speeding down the steps we made it to the corridor on the main floor and started down the endless hallway toward the exit ahead of us i was dizzy from scanning the doorways scanning the corridor behind scanning the corridor ahead mostly looking behind though which was the direction loving or his surviving partner would come from more explosions and automatic weapon fire but growing more muted as we hurried for the exit then i heard a hollow cry of pain it was pogues voice there was no doubt it continued for a moment or two as i supposed the phosphorous burned through his jacket and slacks to the skin finally there was a single shot and the screams and gunfire stopped i wondered if hed ended his own life a horrific thought but i couldnt dwell on it this meant loving and the other man would be after us at any moment we pressed forward the doorways were bothering me they were recessed slightly and as we came to each one i had no way of knowing if a door was ajar i believed the guard outside that there were four people with the girl but it would have been possible that the primary along with other minders had arrived and hearing the shots were hiding here behind one of the doors i decided though that it really didnt matter we had to move forward fast but now amanda was starting to lose it with her adrenaline fading hysteria was flowing in like a riptide she was crying breathing hard and stumbling come on amanda are you with me i gripped her arm she took a deep breath the tears ceased yeah im with you looking behind nothing i could detect the horrific smell of burning flesh and i tried not to think about pogue ten feet from the front door five feet a glance behind the corridor was still empty maybe pogue had taken out loving and the remaining hostile i pushed through the door fast inhaling the sweet damp air my strategy was to shoot the tires out of the other cars and suvs here then get to mine and drive fast id call freddy from the road coordinate the assault here amanda clung to my arm with one hand and clutched her pepper spray in the other i saw a metropolitan police department label on the side my phone buzzed with a text it was freddy reporting that the troops would be here in twenty minutes or so i paused in front of the building and glanced back down the corridor again it was still empty then i turned toward the vehicles i lifted my glock toward the tires whispering cover your ears before i could shoot though i heard a noise behind me i turned fast but saw nothing the corridor was still empty i realized then that the noise was coming from above us i looked up to see henry loving launch himself from the roof he crashed down onto amanda and me sending us sprawling on the concrete apron i landed hard with a stunning painful jolt in my spine air spurted from my lungs and the glock tumbled out of reach through the dirt and weeds chapter his clothing scorchedsome skin tooloving rolled off me onto the sidewalk that led to the facilitys parking lot hed lost his weapon inside and his face was bleeding though the wound didnt seem bad he winced as he gripped his side where his cousin had stitched him up from my gunshot at carters lake house as he struggled to get to the gun i grabbed his leg and jacket i realized hed used a fire door on the other side of the hill and had sprinted here through the grass and foliage of the camouflaged roof amanda crawled forward toward him brandishing her pepper spray i started to tell her not to but it was too late she cried out in rage and pushed it close to his face as hed been expecting his hand shot out grabbed the canister and twisted the nozzle toward us both amandas battle cry turned to a scream of pain as a stream of the orange liquid shot out between us catching both the girl and me in the peripheral mist the pain was excruciating i jammed my eyes shut as the tears started and then opened them squinting amanda had rolled to the ground and was wiping at her face frantically through the damp slit of vision i could see the lump of my weapon ahead of us no more than five feet away from lovings hand he dropped the spray and began to pound on my arm with one hand and claw his way toward the gun with the other he dragged me a foot closer to the weapon how could the unimposing man be so strong i thought at first desperation was driving him but then i realized it was calm determination he began kicking one shoe caught my cheek and i tasted blood lovings whole purpose in life had become reaching that gun which he did just a moment later as he spun toward me i dug my feet into the ground and leapt forward gripping his wrist with one hand i pulled car keys from my pocket with the other can you drive i called to amanda the girl said nothing but was staggering to her feet she looked defiantly at loving i repeated my question shouting yes she gasped wiping her eyes i flung the keys to her my cars up the road the honda theres an address on the front seat go there and wait i now do it she paused only a moment longer and then fled lovings efforts grew more ferocious as he tried to shake me off we were locked in a sweaty agonizing wrestling match fighting fiercely for control of the weapon a moment later i heard my car start and the tires squeal as the girl sped into the night the lifter glanced toward the vanishing taillights without reaction and renewed his battle to escape my grip then i began to feel my grip loosen and finally loving wrenched his gun hand free and swung the boxy glock toward me hard i felt the metal barrel slam in my temple and i was suddenly on my back blood in my eyes making them sting all the more in seconds loving had my hands in restraints then pulled me into a sitting position the lifter staggered to his feet he too nearly spent breathing deeply he hawked and spat he looked in the direction that the girl had gone and gave a blink his expression was as if hed missed a parking space close to his destination he pulled out a phone and placed a call stepping away but watching closely i couldnt hear what he said but i knew the message was to explain to the primary what had happened and tell him not to come here he disconnected we regarded each other for a few seconds he looked around again and then said i know youve called people in but i estimate ive got twenty minutes i recalled that it had taken him only seven to get all the names he needed from abe fallow lying beside that creek in north carolina he continued softly now the address in your car where the girls going its not the safe house you wouldnt write that down where i thought of amanda getting away speeding through the night up and down the hills on route a distant memory of peggy and the boys surfaced sam and jeremy this time i couldnt dispose of it nor did i want to i said nothing to loving he slipped my gun into his waistband and stepped closer he pushed me onto my back and put restraints on my feet too keeping his face back in case i tried to kick him which wasnt going to happen i just didnt have the strength he looked around once more and took a small wellworn manila envelope from his pocket and shook the contents onto the ground so there it was his tools of the trade to get subjects to talk the alcohol was in a small bottle not much bigger than one allowed on airplanes by tsa the sandpaper was fine grained the sort youd use near the end of a refinishing job it all looked so innocent for a moment i expected we would fall into a conversation some repartee after all wed been opponents for years and had in the past two days been playing a game of rock paper scissors over and over again but he was as serious a player as i was and went about his task skillfully whats his goal to find amanda whats the most efficient way to achieve it he pulled my right shoe off then the sock toes like fingers i knew had a plentitude of nerves theyre among the most sensitive parts of the human body he knelt on my calf to keep my leg immobilewhich was in itself excruciatingand then selected a piece of sandpaper he began to work on the front of my big toe nothing for a moment then i felt discomfort and finally an intense searing burn that coursed straight up into my face i gasped involuntarily and finally shouted out in pain my nose hurt my teeth my throat all from his gentle sanding loving reached for the bottle of alcohol and unscrewed the top which he carefully put into his pocket he didnt bother to look at me or say a word the rules of play were obvious either id tell him where amanda had gone or i wouldnt he tilted the bottle and i felt a burst of coldthis too merely irritating at first but then the excruciating agony rose again to my jaw pain like pain id never felt it was a creature moving where it wanted throughout my body living pulsing clever and driven i could see it as colors i could hear it rock paper scissors i muttered between teeth jammed together rock paper scissors through tearfilled eyes i noticed loving put the bottle down and pick up the sandpaper again rock paper scissors peggy peggy peggy rock paper scissors he started on a second toe i screamed rock paper scissors rock paper another scream he picked up the alcohol once again then as i gasped for breath i heard two noises the first was the snap of a branch not far away in the direction of the road the second was a metallic click a particular click that nobody in my line of work would mistake loving knew it too of course and in an instant hed dropped his implements of torture and was pulling my glock from his waistband he fell to his belly wincing as the first shot shook the night it was a missbut close dirt kicked up behind us the lifter rolled away from me seven or eight feethe couldnt afford for me to get killed by a stray shot before he learned where amanda was headedand went prone again we were in a lawn of low grass which offered very poor cover another shot i glanced in the direction it came from and saw a man lumbering through the bushes a revolver held forward in his hand cocking and firing toward loving initially i was surprised to see the newcomers identity but then i realized i shouldnt have been ryan kessler was one of the few people who knew where pogue and i had been going the cop wasnt dodging or crouching he didnt even slow down or cringe when loving fired a burst of three i couldnt see if ryan had been hit he just kept moving forward squinting into the dark to find a clear target then there was silence even in the dim light he was well within range of the glock and yet loving didnt fire again i glanced up and saw why shooting my gun he hadnt known how many rounds were left hed emptied the magazine the slide was locked back awaiting reloading loving realized that i might have a fresh magazine on me which in fact i did he glanced toward ryan making steady progress limping forward trying to find a target loving moved and ryan fired then he too was out of ammo i heard the click of the hammer on spent brass he pulled a speed loader off his belt and flipped open the cylinder of the gun to eject and reload loving scrabbled toward me and reached for my jacket pocket i immediately spun over on my belly ignoring the excruciating pain in my toe to keep him from getting the extra ammo loving glanced at ryan who was inserting the round rack of shells and then he tugged my jacket out from underneath me reaching for the pocket ryan started walking closer now loving was desperate i summoned whatever strength i had left and jerked my knees up striking loving hard in the side where id shot him earlier he gasped in pain and off balance sat back then grimacing he blinked and leaned forward once more for my jacket he fished for and found my full clip he yanked it out and reloaded his face was only a few feet from mine when ryan kessler shot the lifter twice in the chest henry loving blinked and slumped then fell to his side and as he died it was my eyes not the cops he was staring into then ryan kessler too sat down studying a bloody tear in his belly his eyes were dismayed though not it seemed at this woundwhich looked bad to me it was lovings second hit that troubled him most he gave a disgusted sigh as he pressed his bleeding thigh my other leg he looked at me my good one son of a bitch then he passed out chapter a half hour laterthe old government facility lit up like a carnival and populated with a hundred agents and emergency workersi was standing near the front of the compound freddys tac people in respirators and masks were working their way through the building and over the grounds clearing the place for the fire crews theyd found the other three hostiles all dead but the flames were still raging where pogue had made his last stand and they couldnt get to his body yet the guard out front was now conscious and in cuffs nearby medics were preparing to take ryan kessler to leesburg hospital for surgery hed regained consciousness and didnt seem as badly injured as id thought in and out he told me the same phrase dr frank loving had used to describe the course of my bullet through his cousins side id called joanne and told her that her stepdaughter was fine and that her husband had been shot hes stable i told her i gave her the name of a doctor to call then i broke the news to her about pogue there was a beat of a pause and then she thanked me for letting her know i wondered again about their history i asked you let ryan out didnt you another pause yes i kept lyle distracted she must have watched one of us punch the code to deactivate the alarm to the door and memorized the number or maybe she had some special app in her securityblanket purse that cracked locks i explained to her he saved my life i saw freddy approach i told joanne id call her back wait corte she said yes hold on a moment later i heard marees voice corte yes you get hurt nothing serious silence im glad then incongruously she added i just wanted to say i got an image of you when we were by the river remember i digested this for a moment yes its really good an image she hesitated youre sure youre all right im fine yes i have to go all right call me when you can now i hesitated sure we disconnected freddy now joined me i asked whatd you find thiss a mystery wrapped in whatever else that expression says i glanced his way impatiently okay here we go loving we know the others he swept his hand around the compound they were capital c contractors as in formerblackwatertype contractors not that outfit but you get the meaning mercenaries security forces i wasnt surprised given what id seen in the wallet of the guard wed knocked out but i was discouraged groups like that were expert at leaving no traces back to their primaries so we just dont know i offered that pretty much says it son and him i looked toward the revived guard freddy said wants a lawyer like a baby wants a bottle loving made a call im sure he warned the primary off you check his phone no record of anything you didnt expect there would be did you no we got loving freddy pointed out probably thinking id consider this a major victory i muttered but i want the primary i found myself gazing at the tarp covering lovings body i asked the agent you clean out your department freddys lips tightened an assistant in communications i checked her phone records shed been making calls through a dead letter line in the caribbean over the past day loving got the names of her kids and the school they go to so she fed him everything he wanted edge her kids are okay yeah sometimes all you need is to mention a name or two you dont need implements of torture thatll do it aware my toe was still in agony i dont know about bringing charges against her i dont like the idea but i may have to and zagaev his family you were right loving paid them a visit tooto get him to pretend he was the primary but theyre fine a shrug the guy didnt do anything wrong either except lie to us and cart around some guns he shouldntve so i dont know well have to see about charges for him too freddy laughed he apologized for saying bad things to you about the pumpkin he didnt want to he said you seemed like a nice man freddy headed off to consult with his teams and the state police i found myself looking over at henry lovings body all his personal effects had been gathered and were sitting on a tarp next to him i walked over and looked down at them a wallet a small wad of cash a knife the sandpaper and alcohol an empty pistol magazine maps and pens scraps of paper six cell phones all encrypted and missing call logs i knew the models and the software it would take hermes weeks to get information from themif at all and i noted too the shoe box the one hed taken from his family house just before hed burned it to the ground my heart thudded with anticipation as i walked over to one of the bureaus evidence response team agents and asked for a pair of latex gloves i pulled them on and returned to the cache i stood for a moment then crouched over the box did it indeed contain more pictures or was it something else something his sister had given him his father or mother i peeled off several strips of yellowed tape and began to lift the lid then i stopped painfully i rose to my feet and left the box with the rest of the effects taking the gloves off and returning to my car i reflected that whatever might be inside it was nothing that i truly needed to know chapter i saw my hondathe one amanda had escaped inapproach i waved to the driver an fbi agent i knew i couldnt see through the tinted glass but i knew the girl was in the backseat i hadnt in fact given her any directions about where to drive there was no address in the vehicle i figured that even if she didnt find anything shed still drive as fast as she could to the nearest eleven or gas station to call giving her those instructions was the only way i could think of to keep myself alive long enough for freddy to arrive with the troops and take loving into custody id made him believe that only i knew where she was going id turned myself into the principal as it turned out she hadnt gotten very far at all at a gas station a few miles north on route shed pulled in a little fast and taken out a rack of tires the local police had been apprised of the situation and they got in touch with freddy who sent a car to protect her i didnt want amanda to see the bodies i also knew the primary was unaccounted for so i wanted to keep her out of sight i climbed into the backseat with her and shut the door breathlessly she said youre all right i heard you were but i didnt know whats wrong with your foot stubbed my toe your dads going to be okay i know i heard the girl grew silent looking at the compound thats the man we were fighting with loving a glance at the tarp covering the body yes im glad hes dead she said this firmly she meant it got some grit can i go see my dad not quite yet somebody from my offices going to take you to a place to stay with your stepmother and aunt the great falls safe house was compromised so id arranged for ahmad to take joanne and maree to another one the house was in loudoun county not too far away from here also on an old estate though it wasnt as nice as the great falls one uncle bills all right too he had a little problem with his foot too but hell be fine her face was still i was really worried when they were shooting at him by the roadside you saved his life she didnt say anything but was looking at the compound all those guns theyre so loud they dont sound like that in the movies or like the ones we shot at camp that other man who was with you i shook my head he didnt make it im sorry she whispered did he have a family i dont know amanda wiped tears i wished she hadnt attacked the minder but she wouldnt have known pogue and i were there i couldnt help but admire her courage i told her that was good the way you handled yourself in there the pepper spray the girls face ruddy with subtle dots of acne gave a wan smile dad taught me to look out for myself before i left with uncle bill i kind of borrowed some mace from dads dresser to take with me i kept it hidden in my bear bag smart youre sure youre just sixteen thats why i had it she said matteroffactly they didnt bother to search me they were stupid they were like agent corte i kind of messed up your car i hit some tires like im really really sorry weve got insurance she gave a weak smile i gritted my teeth from the toe pain and sat forward taking a pad and pen from my pocket i need to ask you some questions sure you know we thought at first they wanted to kidnap you to get your father to tell them something about one of his cases but it was me they wanted right the people here were just hiredand we need to find out by who so you can throw their ass in jail exactly now did those men mention anything after they kidnapped you anything that might give us an idea of who hired them or why they wanted you she thought for a moment like after they got me in the truck and we were driving here they were talking some but it was like they didnt know anything about me or say anything about anybody else i asked her to tell me essentially everything shed done for the past month amanda understood that her father had been shot and she nearly killed because of some occurrence or someone shed come in contact with recently and she took her assignment seriously launching into a lengthy recitation of her activities the girl led an astonishingly busy life and had a very good memory i took voluminous notes as she described time with friends and their parents her high school classes sporting events concerts trips to shopping malls her involvement on the yearbook a french club outing to the embassy in dc a cooking class a picturetaking expedition with her aunt in rock creek park reporting for her blog about aids awareness and the fellow student whod killed herself despite seeking help in the schools selfharm clinic her facebook activities and friends a lot of notes there her collegelevel computer course in which her weird and totally brilliant chinese professor let the students try out software programs and evaluate them a dozen other entries finally i sat back letting my mind consider possible reasons the girl had been targeted i noted an armored suv arrive driven by geoff the clone from our organization i rolled down the window and waved he pulled up i said to amanda i think i have all i need im going to have my associate here take you to your stepmother and aunt yeah i kinda want to see them im sure you do she surprised me by giving me a hug and we climbed out she got into the suv and with a nod from me geoff eased the big vehicle away from the site i sat down on a log and read through my notes of my interview with amanda a few minutes before closed my eyes partly from the sting partly to help me concentrate then i sent claire dubois an email asking her to do what she did best the replayseconds laterassured me that shed get to the requests immediately i rose and walked stiffly to a fire truck where i got a bottle of water from a cooler and drank most of it down just as id finished i heard a voice behind me gruffly ask you got another one of those i turned and found myself staring at jonny pogue who was examining the cloth and skin on his left forearm more troubled it seemed by his scorched green jacket than the seared flesh chapter pogue what happened i was as delighted to see him as i was surprised hed survived he said nothing and when i continued to look him over he repeated his request water sure sorry i handed him a bottle he drank about half and upended the rest over his head he rubbed his eyes and looked past me at a med tech any chance you could take a look at this a nod at his burned arm he coughed hard and spat made a face at the taste of scorch in his mouth two medics got him sitting he refused requests both to lie down and to take a painkiller a tech began to cut his sleeve dont do that pogue barked and unzipped then pulled off the jacket why cut it the burn looked bad but pogue lost interest as the men went to work what happened i repeated how did you i got trapped in the corner cause of the fire managed to make it up the stairs on the balcony but they tossed another phos grenade up there i took the last hostile out but the flames were pretty intense by then i went down an elevator shaft to the basement conked my noggin came to about a half hour ago and didnt know what id find out front so i tracked down a back fire exit i told him that loving had done much the same whyre you limping i explained ouch you nailed his ass though i heard not me ryan kessler a snicker well now howd that happen joanne pogue grunted hm the wife sprung him he going to be okay seems so pogues face wrinkled up maybe from the pain as the dressing went on his burned arm or maybe from seeing my smile that he was alive thats one feisty girl pepper spray fucked up our plans but it was good to see that prick hurt have to say grit the primary he asked looking over the expanse of fields with a dozen highways beyond loving warned him off but ive got some good leads my associates following them up right now i thanked him again for everything and we agreed to stay in touch if he ever wanted to leave his organization id hire him in a minute though he didnt seem the sort to run away from a threat as a first impulse which is what we shepherds are trained to do i pushed off from the fire truck which i was leaning on for support and put some weight on my foot with the raw toe damn it hurt i exhaled softly thinking if i actually had had information about amandas whereabouts how long could i have held out before i talked i would have talked of course there are differing opinions about whether torture leads to valid information but one thing it definitely leads to is talking people may be intent on remaining silent but in the face of pain they will talk i returned to my car and sat in the drivers seat eyes closed and let the tears from the stinging pepper spray flow which for some reason eased the pain bottled water didnt do much but tears helped fifteen minutes later i got an email i wiped my face and squinting read what claire dubois had sent in response to my request not long before as i read it i was thinking of the phenomenon of endgame although the concept can apply to many games it is most common in chess which is where i study the subject exhaustively as the middle game draws to a close and the endgame approaches a fundamental change occurs in the players attitudes and i swear a macabre eeriness descends over the board the surviving pieces take on different roles and importance for instance pawns become vital not only can they move to the opponents first line and become queens but they provide important defensive barriers that limit the other players moves similarly the king spends most of the game in hiding protected by his minions but in endgame he often must go on the offensive himself each move is intensified the odds of a single error leading to defeat rise dramatically as the match draws to a close endgame is rife with improvisation desperation flashes of brilliance and instances of fatal panic there are many surprises too i stared at my notes from amanda and at claires email for some minutes as pogue had said earlier id had all the bits of information as to why amanda was the target i just hadnt put them together until now i considered my endgame strategy and i composed another email that began with a stern warning to keep the contents absolutely secret the subject had to do with the saturday course that amanda kessler took at a local community college taught by a parttime professor named peter yu he worked during the week for a software developer global software innovations and it was he who distributed to amanda and the other students beta copies of software to try outlike the picture editing program that amanda had given maree but the most interesting fact about yu was that gsi did more than create commercial and consumer software the companyand yus specialty as it turned outhappened to be developing military programs for cuttingedge battlefield imagery analysis the software for those applications was classified at the highest level i finished my email and read through it once more my finger hovered for a moment then i clicked send and sent my words into the ozone tuesday the object of the game is to discover the answer to these three questions st who which one of the several suspects did it nd where rd how from the instructions to the board game clue chapter at am my protégée and i were sitting in one of my organizations suvs on a sedate street in fair oaks virginia a section of fairfax and i asked claire dubois as she was moving her thumb to the disconnect button on her blackberry shed been calling about ryan kessler hes doing okay the doctor said he was stable i never understood those medical condition terms stable serious critical theyre like the homeland security threat warnings orange yellow green taupe or whatever they are is that really helpful i dont think so somebody sits in a room and thinks those up our taxpayer dollars she tucked her trimmed shiny brunette strands behind an ear the gesture was silent she wasnt wearing the jingling charm bracelet this morning for safetys sake jewelry and tac ops dont mix ryan was in a federal detention hospital amanda joanne and maree were tucked away in the new safe house with ahmad and the clone whod collected amanda last night watching over them dubois and i were on the trail of the primary i returned to our surveillance the houses around us reminded me of ryan kesslers place about every fifth one was if not identical then designed from the same mold we were staring through bushes at a splitlevel colonial on the other side of a dogparkcumplayground it was the house of peter yu the parttime professor of computer science at northern virginia college and a software designer for global software innovations the company was headquartered along the dulles technology corridor which was really just a dozen office buildings on the tollway housing corporations whose claim to tech fame was mostly that they were listed on the nasdaq stock exchange i was watching through binoculars observing some ambiguous movement in the backyard of the house i lifted the motorola and asked freddy who was parked nearby we ready to move in im not sure what im looking at i squinted its him im sure youre younger than i am son the eyes are the first to go well not the first unfortunately but pretty close hold on our surveillance boysre calling okay therere two of them at the house i see the second one i told the agent some muscle looks like you in armor i glanced toward claire duboiss navy blue blazer specifically her chest it wasnt the first time i had to admit but the circumstances now were such that there was nothing remotely sexual about the look i was checking that the thick nylon plates velcroed around her were secure i knew that my american body armor vest was were good i told freddy all right lets go my guys and gals tell me they have a visual on the evidence oh and the muscles armed autoloader in a hip holster were moving i disconnected i said to dubois you wont need it but keep your jacket unbuttoned okay the it was her glock in fact i was pretty sure she wouldnt need it but i remembered the men in the old military facility in leesburg i remembered henry loving i knew from my studieshistory not my other degreesthat people can behave unpredictably at desperate times besides even though we believed there were only two individuals here this entire job had been fraught with surprise our suv and four other cars accelerated fast and skidded up over the grass on professor peter yus property tearing up the lawn and destroying shrubs im told that this dramatic entrance which youd think was made up by tvmovie directors is in fact the most efficient way to approach a suspect its all about intimidation we tugged on door levers and jumped out all our jackets fluttering in the wet breeze i was limpingthe toe still stung like crazy dubois and i moved in slowly behind the eight armed tactical officers who were sprinting into yus open garage brandishing weapons on the ground fbi fbi screaming is standard operating procedure too intimidation again in a moment the two men were on their bellies hands bound behind them with monadnock restraints other agents entered the house searched it and then returned calling clear claire and i approached the two suspects now being helped to their feet one of the men stared at me with a gaze of disbelief that immediately turned to pure hated sandy alberts senator lionel stevensons chief of staff spat out corte i corte his partner the muscle was a pro probably connected with the same outfit as the people pogue and i had engaged in the facility on route he simply grimaced and said nothing freddy the senior official law enforcer among us said mr alberts youre under arrest for the kidnapping of a fairfax county resident amanda kessler yesterday and conspiracy counts involving the homicide of a federal agent alberts gasped i dont think id ever heard anything other than a threatened animal make a noise like that but agents searched his partners slacks and jacket but came up with no id you going to tell me who you are freddy asked him the man was completely silent the senior agent shrugged he said to an associate well get his prints track him down conspiracy for him too well add more goodies later freddy then turned to alberts saying therell be state charges too but those are virginias youll be hearing from the commonwealths attorney about them a crime scene tech was inventorying the contents of albertss shoulder bag which had been upended on the floor of yus garage i too looked over the stash documents and pictures and some plastic bags that would have physical evidenceprobably some strands of amanda kesslers hair or something else with her dna on it alberts and his thug had come here to plant the clues to suggest that professor yu was the primary who had hired henry loving sandy i said senator stevenson lets talk about him for a minute desperately the aide said i dont know what you mean freddy snorted a laugh i said we know everything what are you talking about well lets start with we know that the senator likes lecturing at schools we know he likes the company of young ladies albertss eyes grew wide then he recovered and looked down i continued sometime in the past year stevenson met a student after a speaking engagementat a community college in northern virginia her name was susan markus he thought she was a college student but she actually was in high school sixteen years old a classmate of amanda kesslers as dubois had pieced things together it seemed to be the same event that id read about in my research on stevenson the community college where hed given his popular rule of law speech i told alberts whether he invited her to his office or a motel or the back of his limo we dont know yet freddy added we dont know yet but were pretty sure there was some inappropriate behavior on the senators part thats a lie but there was no conviction behind albertss protest i said the senator cant be stupid he didnt think she was under age he met her at a community college and he probably assumed she was a student there not a high school girl in any case whatever happened was statutory rape at the minimum amanda kessler was a volunteer at her schools selfharm prevention program susan was depressed about what happened and she came in to get some help amanda was the girl she talked to susan told her shed been involved with an older man and he was pressuring her not to say anything about the incident amanda set susan up with an adult counselor but before she went to the appointment she killed herself amanda took the death hard and planned to devote her blog to the girls suicide looking into why she killed herself what led up to it she was going to be talking to susans friends her family it was just a matter of time before amanda got to the truth and freddy said were not completely sure that susan actually did take her own life she mightve been helped alberts began to speak but then fell silent freddy better at the dramatics than i said oh going to say something about the coroners report ruling the death a suicide going to say youve looked into it why would youve done that still silence i continued your job was to hire somebody like loving to find out the names of everybody amanda had talked to about susans death get all of amandas notes everything and then kill her too albertss shoulders sagged and he glanced around yus house i gave voice to his thought which was too incriminating for alberts to utter i know you thought we were looking at global software innovations and peter yu no that was just bait to draw you out into the open i suspected you and the senator but i didnt have any real proof i made sure you were on the list to get the interagency alert about global if you were guilty i figured youd come here to plant evidence implicating yu im completely innocent of any wrongdoing thats all ill say i want an attorney help us out here sandy i said in a reasonable voice weve got you cold come on i glanced toward the solid unsmiling suspect with him i know you found him and the other mercenaries through your contacts at the armed services committee right they put you in touch with henry loving they arranged for the helicopter and you were desperate to find out what we knew so you came up with the story about the investigation into warrantless taps his eyes swung desperately i said dont take the heat for this sandy work with us we know you cut your ties to your lobbying outfit before you went to work with stevenson but they were involved too werent they a paltry shake of his head and the political action committee backing stevenson they need him to be the darling of the party they couldnt afford a scandal who thereat the pacwas involved alberts near tears blurted senator stevenson is a great man the protest was both humorous and remarkably sad he didnt know what i asked firmly what didnt he know albertss shoulders slumped i gazed at an fbi van up the street inside was the man whose house this was professor peter yu and his wife theyd agreed to let us use their place as a takedown set after they pretended to leave for work alberts looked that way too and it seemed he finally understood how completely scammed hed been glancing at freddy whose nod gave me carte blanche to take over i stepped a bit closer to alberts we can work a deal if you cooperate alberts muttered to implicate the senator freddy barked a laugh what else would we be interested in i dont think i can do that the word think was critical since it told me he had acknowledged we had an edge over him i articulated my position in general terms all i know is that you could spend the rest of your life in jail or you could spend a lot less than that i let the thought register then i gestured toward another agent who approached to alberts i said were going to take you to detention now just think about what i said his lips tightened and his eyes closed momentarily as he and his partner were led off claire dubois turned to me and actually managed to make me smile nodding toward albertss back and saying what you were telling me about game theory hows that for the prisoners dilemma chapter i was sitting in aaron elliss office again focused on one of the pictures his child had painted maybe it was a haystack with turrets maybe a yellow castle gold or brass hard to say the time was am claire dubois was pulling up a chair beside me my boss said hes on his way up in fact another voice filled the room voilà hes here us attorney jason westerfield paused in the doorway was that a dark tone you were speaking in aaron ha just being amusing okay pour entrer today he was dressed like an attorney very different from his saturday suburbanwarrior guise ellis waved to the chairs across from the coffee table the slim man entered trailed by his assistant chris teasley interesting i couldnt help but observe here were westerfield and i flanked by our seconds attractive women both and a decadeplus younger i noticed that chris teasley slipped her eyes toward duboiss macys suit and silver bracelet i regretted to note also that the loaded glance had also registered with my protégée well to the matter at hand westerfield said i was pretty surprised the whole morass rose as high as it did he caught that mixed metaphor at least and hesitated then a us senator hm his voice and attitude continued to be as irritating as i remembered from the last time we met well every time wed met i shifted my foot gingerly inhaled at the pain focused again so corte dish sil vous plaît i explained to him what id told sandy alberts not long before that loving had been hired because of amandas intention to blog about the death of a student stevenson had molested howd you figure it out the idea had occurred to me i said when id been speaking to amanda last night in my car at the abandoned government facility of everything shed told me about her recent life one thing that stood out as a possible reason for henry lovings assignment was her job as a student volunteer at the selfharm prevention program and the blog about susans suicide teasley asked but howd you make the leap to stevenson the senator himself helped me there it just seemed a little curious that a senatorial aide would contact us about illegal eavesdropping right after wed gotten the assignment last night i had claire find out if stevenson had actually scheduled committee hearings into wiretaps he hadnt id realized that i was the one whod speculated that stevenson had come out against illegal surveillance from an ideological standpoint the senator himself had never even commented on it his speech at the collegepossibly where he met susanwas nothing more than classic rhetoric about the rule of law he and alberts had just made up the issue to look over my shoulder on the kessler job my boss and i shared a glance westerfield apparently didnt know about my lapse in arranging for the illegal taps on loving a few years ago and perhaps stevenson didnt either the issue might arise but then again it might already be dead so i thought more about stevenson a man with a reputation for dating younger women and lecturing regularly at schools hes from ohio which isnt far from charleston west virginia thatd be a good central place for alberts and him to have met loving i had claire look into it checked phone and travel records incidents of complaints in the past about him groping women paying them off afterward i shrugged it was a theory not percent certain so i set up a sting about global software to see if alberts would take the bait and try to lead us toward peter yu yes saw the alert about global westerfield said sourly probably thinking that id yet again taken him in too though in this instance it had nothing to do with keeping him off my back i said alberts im pretty sure hes going to roll over the prisoners dilemma ellis said but kidnapping a girl planning to torture her and security contractors this was a big operation extreme why and what was the deadline all about they needed the information by last night that was obvious to me i explained well in the first place stevenson didnt want to go to jail of course so hed try to silence any witnesses who could tie him to susans death but therere more people involved in this than just stevenson and alberts this perked up westerfields attention conspiracy theories often do how do you mean for one thing the supreme court nominee the confirmation vote in the senates tomorrow amanda was going to be blogging about susan all week looking into her suicide the us attorney said i still dont get the connection i explained that stevenson was the one whod built the coalition of votes to win the confirmation of the rightwing justice hed managed to get a onevote majority if he got arrested or even implicated in a sex abuse scandal that coalition would fall apart and the republicans dream justice doesnt get confirmed im pretty sure some people from the pac supporting stevenson and somebody from albertss lobbying firm were involved a wolfs gleam in westerfields eye thats good i said look at the anger out there look at the partisanship people seem willing to do whatever they need to for their side to win too much screaming in congress too much screaming everywhere westerfield looked toward teasley who wrote furiously in her notebook and then he repeated thats good corte good but he didnt exactly mean good something more was coming only he rocked back on his skinny butt and gazed at the ceiling momentarily regretreal or fauxfilled his face howd you like to retire in a blaze of glory retire aaron ellis asked see you kind of played us the us attorneys office i assumed he meant whatre you saying jason ellis asked that incident about sending the kesslers to the slammer it was pretty awkward therell be some fallout you outright lied to me i supposed that the attorney general himself had been there or some other higherup in justice perhaps hoping to interview ryan kessler the hero cop thered been some damage to westerfields career im thinking your resignation would be in order letter of apology let the powers that be know you intentionally pulled the wool over our eyes clichés again did judges ever reprimand him in court for his clunky figures of speech westerfield continued ill make sure you get full benefits of course but a slipslide into a private security company might be a good idea hey youll double your salary i can even set you up with some nice prospects jason ellis began im sorry i really am westerfield said again a dark face a troubled face but if that doesnt happen hate to say it but there is some issue i heard tell about surveillance warrants i felt several pairs of eyes slide toward me so westerfield did know about them which meant he had an edge on me a pretty damn good one the prosecutor said how bout we shake on it go our separate ways arent you tired of getting shot at corte the nash bargaining game named after the famous mathematician john nash is a favorite among game theorists and one of my favorites too it works this way there are two players who each want a portion of something that can be divided say two bosses who need to share an administrative assistant who can work only forty hours a week total each player writes down on a slip of paper how many hours he wants the assistant to work for him without knowing what the other is asking for if the total amount equals forty hours or less each gets the assistant for the time hes asked if the total exceeds forty hours neither gets the assistant at all i was now apparently the subject of the bargaining game being played between ellis and westerfield but game theory only works when the rules are clearly set out ahead of time in the nash bargaining game here neither of the players was aware of another rule presently at work that what they were bargaining overmemight be a player in the game too as westerfield and ellis were proposing some facesaving compromisei wasnt paying attentioni interrupted jason he paused and looked at me i said im not leaving im not writing any letters of resignation youre going to drop the matter both my boss and westerfield blinked the prosecutor glanced at his equally startled assistant who was fondling her pearls a cool smile parted westerfields tiny lips now youre not he didnt want to say threatening me are you but that was where his ominous sentence flared for a landing ellis said corte its okay we can work out something theres room for compromise here i rose and walked to the door closed it westerfield looked mystified ellis wanted to be elsewhere dubois gave what passed for a smile my kind of smile go ahead i said to her and sat back i teach my protégées about dealing with lifters and hitters and primaries i also teach them about dealing with our compatriots she turned to westerfield and said respectfully sir we thought it would be prudentin shoring up the case against mr alberts and senator stevensonto find out exactly when and how they became aware that our organization was running the protection operation for the kesslers that was the big unanswered question that officer corte and i were wondering about of course there are no official announcements when we take on an assignment its vital that our organization remain as anonymous as possible as you can imagine we can hardly function efficiently if people are dropping in and poking their noses into our work in fact the guidelines that all law enforcement agencies are given specifically state that theyre prohibited from mentioning our existence let alone that were engaged in a specific assignment poking noses westerfield lifted his hands in an irritated fashion meaning your point it seems based on phone recordsobtained with duly issued warrants of coursethat sandy alberts called your office one hour before he came here to discuss the matter of illegal surveillance with director ellis and officer corte on saturday before that phone call neither alberts or senator stevenson had any awareness that we were involved in the kessler case my office ridiculous dubois blinked actually not sir herere the phone records she opened the document and her charm bracelet tinkled like bells she was bejeweled once again i highlighted the relevant portions in yellow its a little lighter than i would have liked can you see them okay i tried blue but that was too dark chris teasley was clutching her own notebook fiercely her pretty pale face went red the color seemingly reflected in the pearls though that was surely my imagination she whispered alberts knew about the kesslers he knew the name i just assumed he only wanted to know who was running the protection detail thats all he asked i thought i thought it was okay claire dubois bless her kept her eyes steadily on westerfield and didnt offer so much as a millisecond of a glance toward her unfortunate counterpart ah yes the us attorney said slowly after a moment during which the only sound in the room was that of duboiss bracelet as she slipped the documents back into her attaché case westerfield jutted out his lower lip looks like we better get to work putting a senator et son ami in jail he rose his assistant did too so long gentlemen and lady the two of them left my edge apparently trumped his chapter in my office i opened my safe and extracted the board game that id received on saturday as i undid the bubble wrap and opened the lid the aroma of old paper and cardboard arose the scent of cedar too which was pleasing to me one of the things i like about board games is their history this particular one had been bought new in it could have passed through several generations of one family or moved laterally to another thanks to a yard sale or perhaps found its way to a new england inn where it would sit in a bedandbreakfast parlor for amusement on saturday afternoons when the rain derailed the leaf viewing the smell of moth deterrent suggested that it had spent its recent days in a closet the board itself was scuffed and stainedone of the reasons it had been such a bargainand i wondered how many people had moved the markers from start to finish who they were what they were doing now if they were still with us for all their cleverness and highdefinition graphics computer games cant match the allure of their elegant threedimensional forebears i slipped the game into a shopping bag it was pm and i was about to go home across my office a small tv sat on my credenza the sound down i glanced up at the screen and saw on cnn a flash breaking news that was something that dubois might comment on breaking news versus news flashes versus news alerts i read the crawl lionel stevenson was announcing he was going to be leaving the senate effective immediately he was under investigation it seemed but no details were forthcoming sandy alberts his chief of staff had been arrested as had the head of the political action committee that alberts was affiliated with and a partner at albertss old lobbying firm whatever else you could say about jason westerfield grass didnt grow under the mans feet a voice from the doorway startled me and i shut the tv off i have it my personal assistant barbara said you ready i took the document from her and read through it it was a release order freeing the kesslers from our care the letter is merely a formality if a lifter who hadnt say heard the primary was in custody and made a move on our principals again of course wed be there in a minute even after the release was signed but were a federal agency like any other and that means paperwork i handed the signed document to barbara and told her id be back in three days maybe four but she could always reach me which she knew but i felt better saying take some time she said in a motherly way which i found heartwarming youre not looking so good the effects of the pepper spray were gone as far as i felt i frowned she explained youre still limping its just a scrape then she said coyly you have to let that toe heal i laughed thinking i never in a million years could have come up with that one maree and freddy were right i dont joke much but id try to remember the heal and toe line though i doubted i would i gathered the board game my computer and gym bag of clothes and walked to duboiss office she was on the phone when i stepped into her doorway her playful tone told me she was probably speaking to the cat man it was the night for a romantic dinner it seemed she was describing to himwith typical dubois detail and digressiona chicken dish she had in mind i waved goodbye she held up a waitaminute finger but i didnt want her to hang up i whispered have to go and thanks good job the smile was faint but her eyes beamed i remembered that when abe fallow would praise me i had the opposite reaction id look down and deflect the compliment i decided that claire dubois had it right she joked occasionally and had her bizarre observations and she talked to herself she was at ease measuring emotion both in and out that was the way it should be if i could go back in time and change things i would have fixed that about myself but thats the past for you not only does it come back at the most unexpected and inconvenient times but its set in stone i left her to her monologue about cooking and i went to the garage to collect my personal car a dark red volvo my career may not be the safest in the world but i drive the same make of vehicle that my insurance attorney father entrusted his familys life to not stylishbut who needs style it also gets pretty good mileage i was just driving out onto king street when i got a text message i paused on the apron and looked down gazing out the window at the masonic temple i stared at the screen debating chapter i found joanne kessler in the galleria at tysons corner the fancier of the two shopping centers joined at the hip near the tollway close to the government building where the interrogation of aslan zagaev had occurred the galleria features the ritzcarlton debeers and versace and i could never figure out how it stayed in business because aside from christmastime it always seemed deserted joanne at a wobbly table was clutching a cup of tea in the cavernous space in the middle of the mall starbucks again for a month or so after a job is over the principals keep their cold phonesjust in case after that time the software overwrites the codes and numbers with nonsense and they can mail them back to a post office box or throw them out it was joannes text id received a half hour ago asking if we could meet i had already called her and ryan and amanda of course and explained everything to them wed said our goodbye and with the release order signed that was the end of the job except apparently not quite i got some coffee and joined the somber woman how are you feeling she asked not comfortable talking about the aches and pains and the raw toe i said briefly fine and ryan coming along well hell be home tomorrow amanda shes good all fired up to take on corruption in washington keep an eye on her blogs i said i need to stay anonymous she smiled ive already had that conversation did you see the news about stevenson i did she continued look corte i was feeling that none of us really thanked you properly i was thinking about that everything you did you were nearly killed we were just strangers to you we were nobodies i was silent for a moment awkward i said you were my job i thank you anyway but i knew this meeting wasnt just about gratitude a pause theres one thing more i wanted to ask you something i shouldnt but i didnt know anybody else to turn to sure go ahead its about maree joanne lowered her head thats something else i blew i waited watching window shoppers she wont talk to me but i overheard her shes going ahead moving in with andrew i tried to talk her out of it but she shut me out completely she grabbed her things and ran out the door hes going to hurt her again and shes going to let him joanne touched my arm an odd sensation when you treat those in your care as game pieces to be protected you arent used to physical contact as abe said its to be avoided which thought of course brought to mind the kiss maree and i had shared on the ledge overlooking the potomac joanne whispered could you talk to her please i know its not your job but she wont listen to me she may never talk to me again i saw tears in her eyes only the second time since id known her i was uncomfortable where is she now shes meeting him in an hour in washington park downtown as id made clear to claire dubois and all my protégés a shepherds involvement with his principals ends the minute the primary and lifter or hitter are arrested or neutralized therapy divorce tragic accidents happily ever afternone of those possible endings has anything to do with us by the time the kesslers lives began to right themselvesone way or the otherfollowing the horrors of the past few days id be in another safe house or on the road somewhere guarding new principals please on the edge i found myself thinking i had a memory of the potomac rivers turbulent foam below me on the edge all right the pressure on my arm increased oh thank you she wiped the tears i rose corte i looked back you remember what we were talking about having the two lives you know your job guarding your principals or my job and then having a family too i said you cant have both but im not so sure maybe you can if you handle it right she gave an uncharacteristic smile and if you want it badly enough i didnt know what to say to that i nodded a goodbye and limping slightly walked off to find my car in forty minutes i was at washington park not far from dupont circle it was small and dated to the early days of the city some park benches in the city are new and ive heard made from recycled tires or milk cartons thats very green and good for humankind but i preferred the older ones like those here they looked like theyd been installed when teddy roosevelt was at work about three miles from here on pennsylvania avenue black ironwork rusty in spots with wooden slats to sit on uneven from years of sloppy overpainting a couple crossed through the park stopped once to look at a bush a camellia i believe in fall bloom and then continued on a moment later the park was empty the day was blustery overcast i parked in a spot where i could have a view of all the benches and spot maree from any angle i shut the engine off and dropped the visor i was invisible enough id tried her phone but gotten voice mail and i suspected shed shut it off to avoid calls from her sister then someone else approached i was discouraged to see it was andrewclaire dubois had sent me his picture when id had her check on him as a possible primary in the kessler job he was on his mobile phone walking leisurely into the park he looked around and stood for a moment and then sat on a bench he crossed his legs i couldnt see his expressioni was about forty feet awaybut he wasnt smiling and gave off the body language of someone whos irritated hed be an easy opponent to defeat at a game in addition to his temper his mind would be elsewhere frequently since hed gotten here first there wasnt much chance of having a conversation with maree unless i could intercept her but that wasnt going to happen either just then she arrived from the opposite side of the park unlike andrew she was smiling clearly looking forward to seeing him there was a lightness in her step and she carried a small shopping bag from neiman marcus and her camera bag the nowfamiliar wheelie suitcase was trailing behind her like a dog did the shopping bag contain a present shed reverted to her uncertain childlike role begging for the mans approval which i recalled from the message wed heard her leave on andrews phone she was so different with him than say someone like me mr tour guide andrew noticed her and nodded but didnt smile or end his call i wondered if hed made an unnecessary call as a show of power animals exhibit dominant behavior like this but they do so for survival not out of ego i knew that andrew had hurt maree in the past and i sensed too seeing this disregard that he was a threat to her now as joanne had believed since my workweek was over id left my glock in my locked desk drawer still i could always call i watched closely tallying up details that might be important he was wearing gloves he had a little stiffness in his hip id noticed earlier he carried a large backpack which could contain or could even be a weapon he was not wearing glasses which would imply a vulnerability that can be helpful to an opponent in flight or fight the man was clearly fit and strong still maree seemed to notice none of the threat and was clearly pleased to be with him smiling still she sat kissed him on the nonphone cheek he gripped her hand ignored her otherwise for a moment or two longer then hung up he slipped the phone away and turned to her with a smile i couldnt hear the words but the conversation seemed harmless enough hed be asking where shed been for the past few days andi could tell from the expression of surpriseshe told him something of the truth he gave a brief laugh but whatever you think is going on corte whatever it seems dont make assumptions stay attentive sure abe andrews grin morphed into a seductive smile and he slipped his arm around her he whispered what would be the invitation to head back to his apartment i knew from duboiss research that he lived not far from here it was then that maree shook her head and shrugged his arm off her shoulder she scooted away she was silent for a moment took a breath and then delivered what seemed to be a speech avoiding his eyes she seemed awkward at first but then she caught her stride and looked into his impassive face as he took in her words he gestured with a gloved hand and leaned closer he spoke a few words and maree shook her head she lifted the bag and took out a framed photograph it was a still life id seen at the kesslers house and realized that it was probably a gift that hed given her earlier one of his own photos maybe she handed it back to him well interesting she was breaking up he stared at the picture then smiled sadly he spoke to her some more making his case he leaned in for a kiss but she backed away further and said something else he nodded then leapt up in a fury and flung the photo to the sidewalk where it shattered maree cringed dodging the shards the he reached out and grabbed her arm she winced and cried out in pain he drew back with his other gloved hand curled into a fist i opened the door and stepped out fast just as maree too stood and slammed her palm straight into his face andrew hadnt expected any aggressive moves and he was caught completely undefended she had connected with his nose the pain would be fiercei knew a panicking principal had once elbowed me accidentally he fell back to the bench hunched over raging gripping his bloody face you fucking bitch i told you its through she said firmly now that i was out of the car i could hear them clearly he rose again and reached for her blindly but she calmly shoved him back hard hampered by tears of pain he stumbled and landed hard on the sidewalk on his side he scrambled to his feet and stepped back digging for a kleenex you attacked me bitch im calling the police thats fine she said the epitome of calm just remember my brotherinlaws a cop i know hed love to talk to you about it he and some of his friends i was pleased to note that under my care maree had learned about gettingand usingan edge she looked down with some pity it seemed dont ever call me again then she hiked up her camera bag on her shoulder turned and wheeling her suitcase behind her walked slowly away i waited to see if andrew would follow her he seemed to debate he grabbed what was left of the shattered frame and flung it to the ground once more then he strode off in the opposite direction his gloved hand pressed against his bleeding nose i dropped back into the drivers seat and started the car then turned in the direction maree had gone i found her at the next intersection pausing for the light she ran her hand through her hair and leaned back looking up into the deepening sky shed be smelling what i was through the open window of the volvo the sweet scent of autumn leaves and the sweeter smell of a fireplace log from a brownstone somewhere nearby the light changed maree crossed the street and walked to the tall glassy hyatt i eased up to the curb in front of the hotel and stopped flashed my federal id to a traffic cop who nodded and walked on i shut the engine off i watched maree walk through the revolving door it paddled slowly to a stop she looked around and approached the front desk handing off her suitcase to a bellboy she greeted the clerk and opened her purse proffering id and credit card i studied her for a moment then the last of my principals finally safe i started the engine and put the car in gear i eased into traffic away from the hotel to return home endgame when driving on the job i didnt allow myself the luxury of listening to music too distracting as id told bill carter but on my own time i always had the radio a cd or a download playing i liked oldtime music but what i meant by that was the period from the s through the s nothing before and little after performers like fats waller sinatra billie holiday louis armstrong rosemary clooney ella sammy davis jr dean martin if the lyrics werent stupid words were important that was a concept that the beatles say for all their musicality just didnt get great music but i always thought they would have created transcendent art if only theyd stopped and thought about what they were writing now as i sped away from the district i was on the sinatra channel on sirius satellite radio which plays a good mix of artists of that era not just frank the voice coming through the speakers was that of harry connick jr enjoying the music enjoying the driving too id left the city behind id left maree and joanne behind ryan and amanda henry loving too they were all in different ways permanent farewells other people too had ceased to exist for meonly temporarily of course freddy was gone as were aaron ellis and claire dubois who i hoped was cooking up a storm just now with cat man jason westerfield had departed earlier from my mental cast and crew as had the woman with the pearls a sign flashed past fifteen miles to annapolis maryland twenty minutes later i pulled up in front of a modest white colonial house not far from the chesapeake bay the wind was tame tonight but i could still hear the wavesone of the things i liked best about the area here i slowed signaled though no one was behind me and turned up a narrow drive flush with leaves which bail out earlier here than in the city i enjoyed raking themnot blowing but rakingand would get to the task tomorrow the start of my weekend i braked to a stop then climbed out stretched and gathered my computer gym bag and the shopping bag containing the precious board game juggling these items i made my way along the serpentine strip of concretecrunching leaves underneathto the front door i started to set the suitcase down to dig in my pocket for the keys but suddenly it burst open i blinked in surprise peggy barked a laugh small but strong face dusted with freckles even into her fourth decade the brunette flung her arms around me and with the packages i nearly went over backward she steadied us bothstrong i was sayingand her arm hard around my lower back we walked into our house youre back early she frowned should i tell my lover to get out by the bedroom window can he cook i said ask him to stay peggy gigged me in the ribs laughing again setting down the bundles i gripped her hard our lips met and kissed for a lengthy moment so the project finished up early i noted that she glanced at herself in the mirror and straightened her dark wiry hair she hadnt been expecting me home until tomorrow she usually got dolled up for my arrival after id been away this was one of the things i loved about her i hadnt called because i didnt want her to go to any trouble and because i liked to surprise herlike this as well as for birthdays and anniversaries our fifteenth was coming up in two weeks what happened to your head im a klutz you know that crawling around in a construction site hardhat she admonished i usually do i asked are your mom and dad still coming this weekend yep with oscar who their dog did i know they got a dog i asked i honestly couldnt remember they mentioned it what kind a pickapoo or something i dont know a corgadoodle i looked around the boys jeremys in his room on the phone with your brother sams in bed ill make you some supper a sandwich maybe some wine a big glass of wine come on peggy stowed the luggage in the hallway id been meaning to retile ever since a bathroom pipe committed suicide a month ago she led me into the kitchen and dug in the refrigerator before she started assembling the food she dimmed the lights and lit several candles she poured a french chardonnay a côte dor for both of us we touched glasses how long you home for four days really she stepped forward pressed her entire body against mine and kissed me hard her hand sliding down my back and pausing in the exact spot where my holster had been only a few hours before after a moment or two when she stepped back i said did i mention im home for five days what do i have to do to make it a week she whispered lips against my ear i smiled though even with peggy i wasnt the best smiler in the world a few more kisses and when she finally escaped from my arms i said look what i found i stepped into the hall grabbed the shopping bag and pulled out the game that had been delivered on saturday i unwrapped it and set the box between us oh my peggy isnt the board game aficionado that i am but since there are more games in the house than books shes become something of an expert by osmosis is that what i think it is an original we were looking down at a first edition of candy land the simplest and arguably the most popular of all childrens board games one i had grown up playing with my brothers and our friends you draw cards and move your pieces around a landscape that includes a chocolate swamp and a gumdrop mountain jers too old id guess but sammyll like it no with you jeremy will play i realized she was right now go sit and relax peggy told me then the smile faded i was sized up you working out or something and not telling me youve lost weight no good fast food where they sent me hm as she pulled open the refrigerator door i walked into the den i eased into my wheezing armchair surrounded by the games on the shelves a thought occurred to me a thought directed to one of my recent principals youre more right than you know joanne its not impossible to have the two lives the public the private the dark the light the madness the dear sanity but that balancing act takes so very much work superhuman it sometimes seems you have to force aside every memory and thought of your other life your life with your loved ones when they pop into your head if you dont the distraction could be fatal you have to accept the loneliness of a secret life like the one i live four or five days at a time or more on the road in safe houses and in the alexandria town house which the government subsidizes so i can be on call near the office even though its near my beloved gaming club even though its filled with some of the favorite games in my collection even though its decorated with certificates and commendations ive received from the diplomatic service and from my present organization its essentially an empty place smelling of cardboard and paint it just isnt home and most difficult of allif you want to lead this double lifeyou must deceive peggy knows i work for the government but because of my degree in math she thinks it has something to do with scientific analysis of secure federal facilities here and abroad ive told her i cant say anything more and i assure her its not dangerous just highly classified a lot of numbers crunching boring she understands i think and accepts that i have to be tightlipped and conversely i share little about my home life with my coworkersall but the closest like freddy buried deep somewhere in federal government human resource departments of course are full records about me and about peggy the boys my mothershe lives in san diegoand my three older brothers one an insurance executive and two college professors those files will be relevant should benefits and retirement and beneficiary issues arise but like so much else in my life ive done everything i humanly can to make sure facts about me are ntk needtoknow to most of the people i come across in my job im single childless a resident of old town alexandria and probably a widower with a tragic past the stalker story i told maree was true though it didnt end as dramatically as i suggested when making my point to the young woman im a stiff federal employee who doesnt tell jokes or smile much i prefer to be called by the pretentious onesyllable corte gratefully i was now drawn from these thoughts by a highpitched shout of youthful joy from behind me i rose turning and smiling my youngest sammy had awakened and stood in the doorway daddy youre home he was in spongebob pajamas and his hair was tousled and he looked adorably cute i immediately set the wineglass down i knew the boy was going for a running leap greeting me this way had become a recent tradition and sure enough bare feet thumping he sped toward me ignoring his mothers laughing plea from the kitchen to be careful but i encouraged him sammy come on come on i called sounding im sure as enthusiastic as i felt and as he took off into the air i braced myself firmly and made absolutely certain that my son landed safe and unharmed in my waiting arms
