michael connelly echopark book in the harry bosch series this is for jane woodwho keeps harry bosch well fed and close to the heart many many thanks the hightower i t was the car they had been looking for the license plate was gone but harry bosch could tell a honda accord its maroon paint long faded by the sun it had been updated in with the green clinton bumper sticker and now even that was faded the sticker had been made with cheap ink not meant to last back when the election was a long shot the car was parked in a singlecar garage so narrow it made bosch wonder how the driver had been able to get out he knew he would have to tell the forensics people to be extra diligent while checking for prints on the outside of the car and the garages inner wall the forensics people would bristle at being told this but he would become anxious if he didnt the garage had a pulldown door with an aluminum handle not good for prints but bosch would point that out to forensics as well who found it he asked the patrol officers they had just strung the yellow tape across the mouth of the culdesac which was made by the two rows of individual garages on either side of the street and the entrance of the high tower apartment complex the landlord the senior officer replied the garage goes with an apartment hes got vacant so its supposed to be empty a couple days ago he opens it up because hes got to store some furniture and stuff and he sees the car thinks maybe its somebody visiting one of the other tenants so he lets it go a few days but then the car stays put and so he starts asking his tenants about it nobody knows the car nobody knows whose it is so then he calls us because he starts thinking it might be stolen because of the missing plates me and my partner have got the gesto bulletin on the visor once we got here we put it together pretty fast bosch nodded and stepped closer to the garage he breathed in deeply through his nose marie gesto had been missing ten days now if she was in the trunk he would smell it his partner jerry edgar joined him anything he asked i dont think so good good i dont like trunk cases at least wed have the victim to work with it was just banter as boschs eyes roamed over the car looking for anything that would help them seeing nothing he took a pair of latex gloves out of his coat pocket blew them up like balloons to stretch the rubber and then pulled them onto his hands he held his arms up like a surgeon coming into the operating room and turned sideways so that he could try to slide into the garage and get to the drivers door without touching or disturbing anything he slid into darkness as he moved into the garage he batted spider threads away from his face he moved back out and asked the patrol officer if he could use the maglite on his equipment belt once he was back in the garage he turned the light on and put its beam through the windows of the honda he saw the backseat first the riding boots and helmet were on the seat there was a small plastic grocery bag next to the boots with the mayfair supermarket insignia on it he couldnt tell what was in the bag but knew that it opened an angle on the investigation they hadnt thought of before he moved forward on the front passenger seat he noticed a small stack of neatly folded clothing on top of a pair of running shoes he recognized the blue jeans and the longsleeved tshirt the outfit marie gesto was wearing when last seen by witnesses as she was heading to beachwood canyon to ride on top of the shirt were carefully folded socks panties and bra bosch felt the dull thud of dread in his chest not because he took the clothing as confirmation that marie gesto was dead in his gut he already knew that everybody knew it even the parents who appeared on tv and pleaded for their daughters safe return it was the reason why the case had been taken from missing persons and reassigned to hollywood homicide it was her clothes that got to bosch the way they were folded so neatly did she do that or had it been the one who took her from this world it was the little questions that always bothered him filled the hollow inside with dread after surveying the rest of the car through the glass bosch carefully worked his way out of the garage anything edgar asked again her clothes the riding equipment maybe some groceries theres a mayfair at the bottom of beachwood she couldve stopped on her way up to the stables edgar nodded a new lead to check out a place to look for witnesses bosch stepped out from beneath the overhead door and looked up at the high tower apartments it was a place unique to hollywood a conglomeration of apartments built into the extruded granite of the hills behind the hollywood bowl they were of streamline moderne design and all linked at the center by the slim structure that housed the elevatorthe high tower from which the street and complex took its name bosch had lived in this neighborhood for a time while growing up from his home on nearby camrose he could hear the orchestras practicing in the bowl on summer days if he stood on the roof he could see the fireworks on the fourth and at the close of the season at night he had seen the windows on the high tower glowing with light hed see the elevator pass in front of them on its way up delivering another person home he had thought as a boy that living in a place where you took an elevator home had to be the height of luxury wheres the manager he asked the patrol officer with two stripes on his sleeves he went back up he said take the elevator to the top and his place is the first one across the walkway okay were going up you wait here for sid and the opg dont let the tow guys touch the car until forensics takes a look you got it the elevator in the tower was a small cube that bounced with their weight as edgar slid the door open and they stepped in the door then automatically closed and they had to slide an interior safety door closed as well there were only two buttons and bosch pushed and the car lurched upward it was a small space with enough room for four people at the most before everybody would start tasting each others breath tell you what edgar said nobody in this place has a piano thats for sure brilliant deduction watson bosch said on the top level they pulled the doors open and stepped out onto a concrete runway that was suspended between the tower and the separate apartments built into the hillside bosch turned and looked past the tower to a view that took in almost all of hollywood and had the mountain breeze to go with it he looked up and saw a redtailed hawk floating above the tower as if watching them here we go edgar said bosch turned to see his partner pointing to a short set of stairs that led to one of the apartment doors there was a sign that said manager below a doorbell the door was opened before they got to it by a thin man with a white beard he introduced himself as milano kay the manager of the apartment complex after they badged him bosch and edgar asked if they could see the vacant apartment to which the garage with the honda in it was assigned kay led the way they walked back past the tower to another runway that led to an apartment door kay started working a key into the door lock i know this place edgar said this complex and the elevator its been in the movies right thats right kay said over the years it stood to reason bosch thought a place as unique as this could not escape the eye of the local industry kay opened the door and signaled bosch and edgar in first the apartment was small and empty there was a living room kitchen with a small eatin space and a bedroom with an attached bathroom no more than four hundred square feet and bosch knew that with furniture it would look even smaller but the view was what the place was about a curving wall of windows looked out on the same view of hollywood seen from the walkway to the tower a glass door led to a porch that followed the curve of glass bosch stepped out and saw the view was expanded out here he could see the towers of downtown through the smog he knew the view would be best at night how long has this apartment been vacant he asked five weeks kay answered i didnt see a for rent sign down there bosch looked down at the culdesac and saw the two patrol officers waiting for forensics and the flatbed from the police garage they were on opposite sides of their cruiser leaning on the hood with their backs to each other it didnt look like a thriving partnership i never need to put up signs kay said the word that we have a vacancy usually gets out a lot of people want to live in this place its a hollywood original besides ive been in the process of getting it ready repainting and small repairs i havent been in any hurry whats the rent edgar asked a thousand a month edgar whistled it seemed high to bosch too but the view told him there would be somebody who would pay it who would have known that that garage down there was empty he asked getting back on track quite a few people the residents here of course and in the last five weeks ive shown the place to several interested parties i usually point out the garage to them when i go on vacation theres a tenant here who sort of watches things for me he showed the apartment too the garage is left unlocked its left unlocked theres nothing in it to steal when the new tenant comes in they can choose to put a padlock on it if they want to i leave it up to them but i always recommend it did you keep any kind of records on who you showed the apartment to not really i might have a few callback numbers but there is no use in keeping anybodys name unless they rent it and as you can see i havent bosch nodded it was going to be a tough angle to follow many people knew the garage was empty unlocked and available what about the former tenant he asked what happened to him it was a woman actually kay said she lived here five years trying to make it as an actress she finally gave up and went back home its a tough town where was home i sent her deposit back to austin texas bosch nodded she live here alone she had a boyfriend who visited and stayed a lot but i think that ended before she moved out well need that address in texas from you kay nodded the officers they said the car belonged to a missing girl he said a young woman bosch said he reached into an inside pocket of his jacket and pulled out a photograph of marie gesto he showed it to kay and asked if he recognized her as someone who might have looked at the apartment he said he didnt recognize her not even from tv edgar asked shes been missing ten days and its been in the news i dont have a tv detective kay said no television in this town that qualified him as a freethinker bosch thought she was in the newspapers too edgar tried i read the papers from time to time kay said i get them out of the recycle bins downstairs theyre usually old by the time i see them but i didnt see any story about her she went missing ten days ago bosch said that would have been thursday the ninth you remember anything from back then anything unusual around here kay shook his head i wasnt here i was on vacation in italy bosch smiled i love italy whered you go kays face brightened i went up to lake como and then over to a small hill town called asolo its where robert browning lived bosch nodded like he knew the places and knew who robert browning was weve got company edgar said bosch followed his partners gaze down to the culdesac a television truck with a satellite dish on top and a big number painted on the side had pulled up to the yellow tape one of the patrol officers was walking toward it harry looked back at the landlord mr kay well need to talk more later if you can see what numbers or names you can find of people who looked at or called about the apartment well also need to talk to the person who handled things while you were in italy and get the name and forwarding address of the former tenant who moved back to texas no problem and were going to need to talk to the rest of the tenants to see if anybody saw that car being dropped off in the garage we will try not to be too intrusive no problem with any of that ill see what i can dig up on the numbers they left the apartment and walked with kay back to the elevator they said goodbye to the manager and went down the steel cube lurching again before smoothing out on the descent harry i didnt know you love italy edgar said ive never been edgar nodded realizing it had been a tactic to draw kay out to put more alibi information on record you thinking about him he asked not really just covering the bases besides if it was him why put the car in his places own garage why call it in yeah but then maybe hes smart enough to know wed think hed be too smart to do that see what i mean maybe hes outsmarting us harry maybe the girl came to look at the place and things went wrong he hides the body but knows he cant move that car because he might get pulled over by the cops so he waits ten days and calls it in like he thinks it might be stolen then maybe you should run his italian alibi down watson why am i watson why cant i be holmes because watson is the one who talks too much but if you want ill start calling you homes maybe that would be better whats bothering you harry bosch thought of the clothing neatly folded on the front seat of the honda he felt that pressure on his insides again like his body was wrapped in wire being tightened from behind whats bothering me is that ive got a bad feeling about this one what kind of bad feeling the kind that tells me were never going to find her and if we never find her then we never find him the killer the elevator jerked to a hard stop bounced once and came to a rest bosch pulled open the doors at the end of the short tunnel that led to the culdesac and the garages he saw a woman holding a microphone and a man holding a television camera waiting for them yeah he said the killer part one the killer the call came in while harry bosch and his partner kiz rider were sitting at their desks in the openunsolved unit finishing the paperwork on the matarese filing the day before they had spent six hours in a room with victor matarese discussing the murder of a prostitute named charisse witherspoon dna that had been extracted from semen found in the victims throat and stored for ten years had been matched to matarese it was a cold hit his dna profile had been banked by the doj in after a forcible rape conviction it had taken another four years before bosch and rider came along and reopened the witherspoon case pulled the dna and sent it to the state lab on a blind run it was a case initially made in the lab but because charisse witherspoon had been an active prostitute the dna match was not an automatic slam dunk the dna could have come from someone who was with her before her killer turned up and hit her repeatedly on the head with a twobyfour so the case didnt come down to the science it came down to the room and what they could get from matarese at am they woke him up at the halfway house where he had been placed upon his parole in the rape case and took him to parker center the first five hours in the interview room were grueling in the sixth he finally broke and gave it all up admitting to killing witherspoon and throwing in three more all prostitutes he had murdered in south florida before coming to la when bosch heard his name called out for line one he thought it was going to be miami calling him back it wasnt bosch he said after grabbing the phone freddy olivas northeast division homicide im over in archives looking for a file and they say youve already got it signed out bosch was silent a moment while his mind dropped out of the matarese case bosch didnt know olivas but the name sounded familiar he just couldnt place it as far as signedout files went it was his job to review old cases and look for ways to use forensic advances to solve them at any given time he and rider could have as many as twentyfive files from archives ive pulled a lot of files from archives bosch said which one are we talking about gesto marie gesto its a ninetythree case bosch didnt respond right away he felt his insides tighten they always did when he thought about gesto even thirteen years later in his mind he always came up with the image of those clothes folded so neatly on the front seat of her car yeah ive got the file whats happening he noticed rider look up from her work as she registered the change in his voice their desks were in an alcove and pushed up against one another so bosch and rider faced each other while they worked its kind of a delicate matter olivas said eyes only relates to an ongoing case ive got and the prosecutor just wants to review the file could i hop on by there and grab it from you do you have a suspect olivas olivas didnt answer at first and bosch jumped in with another question whos the prosecutor again no answer bosch decided not to give in look the case is active olivas im working it and have a suspect if you want to talk to me then well talk if youve got something working then i am part of it otherwise im busy and you can have a nice day okay bosch was about to hang up when olivas finally spoke the friendly tone was gone from his voice tell you what let me make a phone call hotshot ill call you right back he hung up without a goodbye bosch looked at rider marie gesto he said the da wants the file thats your own case who was calling a guy from northeast freddy olivas know him rider nodded i dont know him but ive heard of him hes lead on the raynard waits case you know the one now bosch placed the name the waits case was high profile olivas probably viewed it as his ticket to the show the lapd was broken into nineteen geographic divisions each with a police station and its own detective bureau divisional homicide units worked the less complicated cases and the positions were viewed as steppingstones to the elite robberyhomicide division squads working out of the police headquarters at parker center that was the show and one of those squads was the openunsolved unit bosch knew that if olivass interest in the gesto file was even remotely tied to the waits case then he would jealously guard his position from rhd encroachment he didnt say what he has going rider asked not yet but it must be something he wouldnt even tell me which prosecutor hes working with ricochet what she said it slower rick oshea hes on the waits case i doubt olivas has anything else going they just finished the prelim on that and are heading to trial bosch didnt say anything as he considered the possibilities richard ricochet oshea ran the special prosecutions section of the das office he was a hotshot and he was in the process of getting hotter following the announcement in the spring that the sitting district attorney had decided against seeking reelection oshea was one of a handful of prosecutors and outside attorneys who filed as candidates for the job he had come through the primary with the most votes but not quite a majority the runoff was shaping up as a tighter race but oshea still held the inside track he had the backing of the outgoing da knew the office inside and out and had an enviable track record as a prosecutor who won big casesa seemingly rare attribute in the das office in the last decade his opponent was named gabriel williams he was an outsider who had credentials as a former prosecutor but he had spent the last two decades in private practice primarily focusing on civil rights cases he was black while oshea was white he was running on the promise of watchdogging and reforming the countys law enforcement practices while members of the oshea camp did their very best to ridicule williamss platform and qualifications for the position of top prosecutor it was clear that his outsider stance and platform of reform were taking hold in the polls the gap was closing bosch knew what was happening in the williamsoshea campaigns because this year he had been following local elections with an interest he had never exhibited before in a hotly contested race for a city council seat he was backing a candidate named martin maizel maizel was a threeterm incumbent who represented a westside district far from where bosch lived he was generally viewed as a consummate politician who made backroom promises and was beholden to bigmoney interests to the detriment of his own district nevertheless bosch had contributed generously to his campaign and hoped to see his reelection his opponent was a former deputy police chief named irvin r irving and bosch would do whatever was within his power to see irving defeated like gabriel williams irving was promising reform and the target of his campaign speeches was always the lapd bosch had clashed numerous times with irving while he served in the department he didnt want to see the man sitting on the city council the election stories and wrapups that ran almost daily in the times had kept bosch up to date on other contests as well as the maizelirving contest he knew all about the fight oshea was involved in the prosecutor was in the process of bolstering his candidacy with highprofile advertisements and prosecutions designed to show the value of his experience a month earlier he had parlayed the preliminary hearing in the raynard waits case into daily headlines and topofthebroadcast reports the accused double murderer had been pulled over in echo park on a latenight traffic stop officers spied trash bags on the floor of the mans van with blood leaking from them a subsequent search found body parts from two women in the bags if ever there was a safe slambang case for a prosecutorcandidate to use to grab media attention the echo park bagman case appeared to be it the catch was that the headlines were now on hold waits was bound over for trial at the end of the preliminary hearing and since it was a death penalty case that trial and the attendant renewal of headlines were still months off and well after the election oshea needed something new to grab headlines and keep momentum going now bosch had to wonder what the candidate was up to with the gesto case do you think gesto could be related to waits rider asked that name never came up in ninetythree bosch said neither did echo park the phone rang and he quickly picked it up openunsolved this is detective bosch how can i help you olivas bring the file over to the sixteenth floor at eleven oclock youll meet with richard oshea youre in hotshot well be there wait a minute whats this we shit i said you you be there with the file i have a partner olivas ill be with her bosch hung up without a goodbye he looked across at rider were in at eleven what about matarese well figure it out he thought about things for a few moments then got up and went to the locked filing cabinet behind his desk he pulled the gesto file and brought it back to his spot since returning to the job from retirement the year before he had checked the file out of archives three different times each time he read through it made some calls and visits and talked to a few of the individuals who had come up in the investigation thirteen years before rider knew about the case and what it meant to him she gave him the space to work it when they had nothing else pressing but nothing came of the effort there was no dna no fingerprints no lead on gestos whereaboutsthough to him there still was no doubt that she was deadand no solid lead to her abductor bosch had leaned repeatedly on the one man who came closest to being a suspect and got nowhere he was able to trace marie gesto from her apartment to the supermarket but no further he had her car in the garage at the high tower apartments but he couldnt get to the person who had parked it there bosch had plenty of unsolved cases in his history you cant clear them all and any homicide man would admit it but the gesto case was one that stuck with him each time he would work the case for a week or so hit the wall and then return the file to archives thinking he had done all that could be done but the absolution only lasted a few months and then there he was at the counter filling out the file request form again he would not give up bosch one of the other detectives called out miami on two bosch hadnt even heard the phone ring in the squad room ill take it rider said your heads somewhere else she picked up the phone and once more bosch opened the gesto file bosch and rider were ten minutes late because of the backup of people waiting for elevators he hated coming to the criminal courts building because of the elevators the wait and the jostling for position just to get on one of them put a layer of anxiety on him that he could live without in reception in the das office on the sixteenth floor they were told to wait for an escort back to osheas office after a couple minutes a man stepped through the doorway and pointed to the briefcase bosch was holding you got it he asked bosch didnt recognize him he was a darkcomplected latino in a gray suit olivas yeah you brought the file i brought the file then come on back hotshot olivas headed back toward the door he had come through rider made a move to follow but bosch put his hand on her arm when olivas looked back and saw they were not following him he stopped you coming or not bosch took a step toward him olivas lets get something clear before we go anywhere you call me hotshot again and im going to shove the file up your ass without taking it out of my briefcase olivas raised his hands in surrender whatever you say he held the door and they followed him into the internal hallway they went down a long corridor and took two rights before coming to osheas office it was a large space particularly by district attorneys office standards most of the time prosecutors shared offices two or four to a room and held their meetings in strictly scheduled interview rooms at the end of each hallway but osheas office was doublesized with room for a pianocrate desk and a separate seating area being the head of special prosecutions obviously had its perks being the heir apparent to the top job did as well oshea welcomed them from behind his desk standing up to shake hands he was about forty and handsome with jetblack hair he was short as bosch already knew even though he had never met him before he had noticed while catching some of the tv coverage of the waits prelim that most of the reporters who gathered around oshea in the hallway outside the courtroom were taller than the man they pointed their microphones at personally bosch liked short prosecutors they were always trying to make up for something and usually it was the defendant who ended up paying the price everybody took seats oshea behind his desk bosch and rider in chairs facing him and olivas to the right side of the desk in a chair positioned in front of a stack of rick oshea all the way posters leaning against the wall thank you for coming in detectives oshea said lets start by clearing the air a little bit freddy tells me you two got off to a rough start he was looking at bosch as he spoke i dont have any problem with freddy bosch said i dont even know freddy enough to call him freddy i should tell you that any reluctance on his part to fill you in on what we have here came directly from me because of the sensitive nature of what we are doing so if you are angry be angry with me im not angry bosch said im happy ask my partnerthis is me when im happy rider nodded hes happy she said definitely happy okay then oshea said everybodys happy so lets get down to business oshea reached over and put his hand above a thick accordion file placed on the right side of his desk it was open and bosch saw that it contained several individual files with blue tabs on them bosch was too far away to read themespecially without putting on the glasses he had recently begun carrying with him are you familiar with the raynard waits prosecution oshea asked bosch and rider nodded it would have been kind of hard to miss bosch said oshea nodded and offered a slight smile yes we have pushed it out in front of the cameras the guys a butcher a very evil man weve said from the start that we are going for the death penalty on it from what ive heard and seen hes a poster boy for it rider said encouragingly oshea nodded somberly thats one reason why you are here before i explain what we have going let me ask you to tell me about your investigation of the marie gesto case freddy said youve had the file out of archives three times in the past year is there something active bosch cleared his throat after deciding to give first and then receive you could say ive had the case for thirteen years i caught it back in ninetythree when she went missing but nothing ever came of it bosch shook his head we had no body all we ever found was her car and that was not enough we never made anybody for it not even a suspect we looked at a lot of people one in particular but we couldnt make the connections and so nobody rose to the level of active suspect then i retired in ohtwo and it went into archives a couple years go by and things dont work out the way i thought they would in retirement and i come back on the job that was last year bosch didnt think it was necessary to tell oshea that he had copied the gesto file and taken it with him along with several other open cases when he left his badge behind and walked out the door in copying the files had been an infraction of department regs and the fewer people who knew that the better in the last year i pulled the gesto file every time i had a little time to work it he continued but theres no dna no latents theres only legwork ive talked to all the principals againeverybody i could find theres still the one guy out there who i always felt could be the guy but i never could make anything out of it i talked to him twice this year leaned pretty hard and nothing who is it his names anthony garland he comes from hancock park money you ever heard of thomas rex garland the oilman oshea nodded well t rex as he is known is anthonys father whats anthonys connection to gesto connection might be too strong a word marie gestos car was found in a single garage attached to a hollywood apartment building the apartment it corresponded to was empty our sense of things at the time was that it wasnt just coincidence that the car ended up in there we thought whoever hid the car there knew the apartment was vacant and that hed get a decent ride out of hiding it there okay anthony garland knew about the garage or he knew marie he knew about the garage his former girlfriend had lived in the apartment she had broken up with him and then moved back to texas so he knew the apartment and the garage were empty thats pretty thin thats all you had pretty much we thought it was thin too but then we pulled the exgirlfriends dmv mug and it turned out she and marie looked a lot alike we started to think that maybe marie had been some sort of replacement victim he couldnt get to his exgirlfriend because she had left so he got to marie instead did you go to texas twice we talked to the ex and she told us that the main reason she split with anthony was because of his temper was he violent with her she said no she said she left before it got to that point oshea leaned forward so did anthony garland know marie he asked we dont know we are not sure he did until his father brought his lawyer into it and he stopped talking to us he denied ever knowing her when was thisthe lawyer i mean back then and now i came at him again a couple times this year i pressed him and he lawyered up again different lawyers this time they were able to get a restraining order reissued against me they convinced a judge to order me to stay away from anthony unless he had a lawyer with him my guess is that they convinced the judge with money its the way t rex garland gets things done oshea leaned back nodding thoughtfully does this anthony garland have any kind of criminal record before or after gesto no not a criminal record he hasnt been a very productive member of societyhe lives off his old mans handouts as near as i can tell he runs security for his father and his various enterprises but theres never been anything criminal that i could find wouldnt it stand to reason that someone who had kidnapped and killed a young woman would have other criminal activity on his record these things usually arent aberrations are they if you went with the percentages yeah but there are always exceptions to the rule plus theres the old mans money money smooths a lot of things over makes a lot of things go away oshea nodded again like he was learning about criminals and crime for the first time it was a bad act what was your next move going to be he asked bosch shook his head i didnt have one i sent the file back to archives and thought that was it then a couple weeks ago i went down and pulled it again i dont know what i was going to do maybe talk to some of garlands more recent friends see if he ever mentioned marie gesto or anything about her all i knew for sure was that i wasnt going to give up oshea cleared his throat and bosch knew he would now get down to the reason they were there did the name ray or raynard waits ever come up in all these years of investigating gestos disappearance bosch looked at him for a moment his stomach twisting no it didnt should it have come up oshea pulled one of the folders out of the accordion file and opened it on the desk he lifted a document that looked like a letter off the top as i said weve made it public that were going for the death penalty on waits he said after the prelim i think he realized the writing was on the wall hes got an appeal on the probable cause for the traffic stop but it will go nowhere and he and his lawyer know it an insanity defense is a nonstarter as well this guys as calculating and organized as any killer ive ever prosecuted so they responded last week with this before i show it to you i have to know that you understand that this is a letter from an attorney it is a proffer no matter what happens whether we move forward with this or not the information contained in this letter is off the record if we choose to ignore this offer no investigation can come of the information in this letter do you understand that rider nodded bosch didnt detective bosch oshea prompted maybe i shouldnt see it then bosch said maybe i shouldnt be here you were the one who wouldnt give freddy the file if the case means that much to you then i think you should be here bosch finally nodded okay he said oshea slid the paper across the desk and bosch and rider leaned forward to read it together bosch first unfolded his glasses and put them on sept richard oshea assistant district attorney los angeles county district attorneys office office west temple street los angeles ca re california v raynard waits dear mr oshea this letter is intended to open discussions regarding a disposition in the abovereferenced case all statements made herein and hereafter in connection with these discussions are made with the understanding that they are inadmissible under california evidence code california penal code and people v tanner cal appd cal rptr i suggest to you that mr waits would be willing on terms and conditions outlined below to share with you and investigators of your choice information regarding nine homicides excluding the two in the abovereferenced case and to plead guilty to the charges in the abovereferenced case in exchange for the peoples agreement not to seek the death penalty on the instant homicide charges or to file charges in regard to the homicides about which he would provide information furthermore in return for the cooperation and information mr waits would provide you must agree that any and all statements by mr waits and any information derived therefrom will not be used against him in any criminal case no information provided pursuant to this agreement may be divulged to any other state or federal law enforcement agencies unless and until those agencies through their representatives agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement no statements made or other information provided by mr waits during any offtherecord proffer or discussion may be used against him in the prosecutions caseinchief nor may you make derivative use of or pursue any investigative leads suggested by any statements made or information provided by the defendant in the event the abovereferenced case goes to trial if mr waits offers testimony materially different from any statements made or other information provided during any proffers or discussion then you may of course impeach him concerning such prior inconsistent statements or information i suggest that the families of eight young women and one male victim will attain some form of closure with the knowledge of what transpired in regard to their loved ones and in eight of these instances be able to conduct proper religious ceremonies and burials after mr waits leads your investigators to the places where these victims now rest additionally these families will find perhaps some comfort in knowing that mr waits is serving a prison sentence of life without the possibility of parole mr waits offers to provide information in regard to nine known and unknown homicides between and as an initial offer of credibility and good faith he suggests that investigators review the investigation into the death of daniel fitzpatrick who was burned to death in his hollywood boulevard pawnshop on april investigative files will reveal that mr fitzpatrick was armed and standing behind the rolldown security fence at the front of his store when he was set afire by an assailant using lighter fluid and a butane lighter the can of easylight lighter fluid was left behind standing upright in front of the security fence this information was never made public further mr waits suggests that police investigative files in regard to the september disappearance of marie gesto be reviewed as an additional showing of his credibility and good faith the records will reveal that while the whereabouts of ms gesto were never determined her car was located by police in a garage at a hollywood apartment complex known as the high tower the car contained ms gestos clothing and equestrian equipment plus a grocery bag containing a onepound package of carrots ms gesto intended to use the carrots to feed the horses she groomed in exchange for riding time at the sunset ranch stables in beachwood canyon again this information was never made public i would suggest that if an agreement of disposition could be achieved such an agreement would fall within the exceptions to californias prohibition against plea bargaining serious felonies inasmuch as absent mr waitss cooperation there are insufficient evidence and material witnesses to prove the peoples case in regard to these nine homicides moreover the peoples forbearance regarding the death penalty is entirely discretionary and does not represent a substantial change in sentence california penal code a please contact me at your earliest convenience if the foregoing is acceptable sincerely maurice swann pa broadway suite los angeles ca bosch realized he had read almost the entire letter without taking a breath he now gulped down some air but it did not displace the cold tightness that was forming in his chest youre not going to agree to this are you he asked oshea held his gaze for a moment before responding as a matter of fact i am negotiating with swann right now that was the initial proffer ive improved the states take substantially since that arrived in what way hell have to plead to all the cases well get eleven murder convictions and youll get more headlines in time for the election bosch thought but didnt say but he still walks he asked no detective he doesnt walk he never sees the light of day again have you ever been up to pelican bay the place they send sex offenders it only sounds like a nice place but no death penalty youre giving him that olivas smirked as if bosch didnt see the light yes that is what we are giving oshea said thats all were giving no death penalty and he goes away forever and a day bosch shook his head looked at rider and then back at oshea he said nothing because he knew it wasnt his decision to make but before we agree to such a deal oshea said we need to make damn sure he is good for those nine waits is no dummy this could all be a trick to avoid the needle or it could be the real thing i want to bring you two into this to work with freddy in finding out which it is ill make the calls and you will be cut loose that will be the assignment neither bosch nor rider responded oshea pressed on it is obvious he knows things about the two bait cases cited in the letter freddy confirmed the fitzpatrick thing he was killed during the riots after the rodney king verdict came in burned to death behind the rolldown fence in his pawnshop he was heavily armed at the time and what is not clear is how his killer got close enough to set him on fire the can of easylight was found just like waits said standing upright in front of the security fence the mention of the gesto case we could not confirm because youve got the file detective bosch youve already confirmed the part about the garage did he get that right about the clothes and the carrots bosch reluctantly nodded the car was public information he said the media was all over it but the bag of carrots was our ace in the hole nobody knew about that except me my partner at the time and the evidence tech who opened the bag we held it back because thats where we ended up thinking she crossed his path the carrots came from a mayfair supermarket on franklin at the bottom of beachwood canyon turned out it was her routine to stop there before going up to the stables the day she disappeared she followed the routine she came out with the carrots and probably her killer as a trailer we found witnesses who put her in the store nothing else after that until we found her car oshea nodded he pointed to the letter which was still on the desk in front of bosch and rider then this is looking good no its not bosch said dont do this dont do what dont make the deal why shouldnt we because if he is the one who took marie gesto and killed her and he killed those eight other people maybe even chopped them up like the two they caught him with then he isnt someone who should be allowed to live whether in a prison cell or not they ought to strap him down put the juice in him and send him on down the hole to where he belongs oshea nodded as if it were a valid consideration what about all of those open cases he countered look i dont like the idea of this guy living out his life in a private room at pelican bay any more than you do but we have a responsibility to clear those cases and provide answers to the families of those people also you have to remember we have announced that we are seeking the death penalty that doesnt mean its automatic we have to go to trial and win and then we have to do it all over again to get the jury to recommend death im sure you know that there are any number of things that could go wrong it only takes one juror to hang a case and it only takes one to stop the death penalty it only takes one soft judge to ignore the jurys recommendation anyway bosch didnt respond he knew how the system worked how it could be manipulated and how nothing was a sure thing still it bothered him he also knew that a life sentence didnt always mean a life sentence every year people like charlie manson and sirhan sirhan got their shot nothing lasts forever not even a life sentence plus there is the cost factor oshea continued waits doesnt have money but maury swann took the case for publicity value if we take this to trial he will be ready for battle maurys a damn good lawyer we can expect experts to cancel out our experts scientific analysis to cancel out our analysisthe trial will last months and cost the county a fortune i know you dont want to hear that money is a consideration here but that is the reality i have the budget management office already on my back about this one this proffer could be the safest and best way to make sure this man harms no one else in the future the best way bosch asked not the right way if you ask me oshea picked up a pen and drummed it lightly on his desk before responding detective bosch why did you sign out the gesto file so many times bosch felt rider turn and look at him she had asked him the same thing on more than one occasion i told you he said i pulled it because it had been my case it bothered me that we never made anybody for it in other words it has haunted you bosch nodded hesitantly did she have family bosch nodded again she had parents up in bakersfield they had a lot of dreams for her think about them and think about the families of the others we cant tell them that waits was the one unless we know for sure my guess is that they will want to know and that they are willing to trade that knowledge for his life its better that he plead guilty to all of them than that we get him for only two bosch said nothing he had registered his objection he now knew it was time to go to work rider was on the same vibe what is the time frame on this she asked i want to move quickly oshea said if this is legit i want to clean it up and get it done gotta get it in before the election right bosch asked he then immediately regretted it osheas lips formed a tight line blood seemed to collect beneath the skin around his eyes detective he said i will give you that im running for election and clearing eleven murders with convictions would be helpful to my cause but do not suggest the election is my only motivation here every night that those parents who carried dreams for their daughter go to bed not knowing where she is or what happened to her is a night of terrible pain as far as i am concerned even after thirteen years so i want to move quickly and assuredly and you can keep your speculations about anything else to yourself fine bosch said when do we talk to this guy oshea looked at olivas and then back at bosch well i think we should have an exchange of files first you should come up to speed on waits and id like freddy to familiarize himself with the gesto file once that is done well set something up with maury swann what about tomorrow tomorrows fine bosch said swann will be there during the interview oshea nodded maurys riding this one all the way hell milk every angle probably end up with a book and a movie deal before this things over maybe even a guest anchor slot on court tv yeah well bosch said at least then hed be out of the courtroom never thought of it that way oshea said did you bring the gesto records bosch opened his briefcase on his lap and took out the investigation file which was contained in a threeinchthick binder generally known as a murder book he handed it to oshea who turned and gave it to olivas and i will give you this in return oshea said he slid the file back into the accordion folder and handed it all across the desk happy reading he said are you sure about tomorrow bosch looked at rider to see if she had an objection they had another day before they needed to walk the matarese filing to the da but the work was mostly finished and he knew rider could handle the rest when rider said nothing bosch looked back at oshea well be ready he said then i will call maury and set it up where is waits right here in the building oshea said weve got him in highpower on keepaway status good rider said what about the other seven bosch asked what about them are there no files the proffer as well as maury swann indicates that these were women who were never found and possibly never reported missing in the first place oshea said waits is willing to lead us to them but there is no prep work we can do for them bosch nodded any other questions oshea asked signaling that the meeting was over well let you know bosch said i know i am repeating myself but i feel i need to oshea said this investigation is all off the record that file is a proffer that is part of a plea negotiation nothing in that file or anything that he tells you can ever be used to make a case against him if this falls apart then you will not be able to use the information to pursue him is that clearly understood bosch didnt answer its clear rider said there is one exception that i have negotiated if he lies if you catch him at any time in a lie or if any piece of information he gives you during this process proves to be knowingly false all bets are off and we can go after him for all of it he has been made quite aware of this too bosch nodded he stood up rider did too do you need me to call someone to free you two up oshea asked i can flex a muscle if needed rider shook her head i dont think so she said harry was already working the gesto case the seven women might be unknown victims but theres got to be a file in archives on the man in the pawnshop it all cuts openunsolved in we can handle our supervisor okay then as soon as i have the interview set up i will call meantime all of my numbers are in the file freddys too bosch nodded to oshea and threw a glance at olivas before turning to the door detectives oshea said bosch and rider turned back to him he was standing now he wanted to shake their hands i am hoping you are on my side on this oshea said bosch shook his hand unsure whether oshea was talking about the case or the election he said if waits can help me bring marie gesto home to her parents then im on your side it wasnt a completely accurate summation of his feelings but it got him out of the office back at openunsolved they sat in their supervisors office and brought him up to date on the days developments abel pratt was four weeks away from retirement after twentyfive years on the job he was attentive to them but not overly so on the side of his desk was a stack of fodors guidebooks for caribbean islands his plan was to pull the pin leave the city and find an island to live on with his family it was a common retirement dream among law enforcement officersto pull back from all the darkness witnessed for so long on the job the reality however was that after about six months on the beach the island got pretty boring a detective three from rhd named david lambkin was set to be the squads top after pratt split he was a nationally recognized sex crimes expert chosen for the job because so many of the cold cases they were working in the unit were sexually motivated bosch was looking forward to working with him and would have liked to be briefing him instead of pratt but the timing was off they went with who they had and one of the positive things about pratt was that he was going to give them free rein until he was out the door he just didnt want any waves no blowback in his face he wanted a quiet uneventful last month on the job like most cops with twentyfive years in the department pratt was a throwback he was old school he preferred working on a typewriter over a computer rolled halfway up in the ibm selectric next to his desk was a letter he had been working on when bosch and rider stepped in bosch had grabbed a quick glance at it while he was sitting down and saw it was a letter to a casino in the bahamas pratt was trying to line up a security gig in paradise and that about said it all when it came to where his mind was at these days after hearing their briefing pratt gave his approval for them to work with oshea and only became animated when he issued a warning about raynard waitss attorney maury swann let me tell you about maury pratt said whatever you do when you meet him do not shake his hand why not rider asked i had a case with him once this is way back it was a gangbanger on a oneeightyseven every day when we started court maury made a big deal of shaking my hand and then the prosecutors he probably would have shaken the judges hand too if hed gotten the chance so so after his guy was convicted he tried to get a reduced sentence by snitching out the others involved in the murder one of the things he told me during the debriefing was that he thought i was dirty he said that during the trial maury had told him he could buy all of us me the prosecutor everybody so the banger had his homegirl get him the cash and maury explained to him that every time he was shaking our hands he was paying us off you know passing the cash palm to palm he always did those twohanded shakes too he was really selling it to his guy while all along he was keeping the cash holy shit rider exclaimed didnt you guys work up a case on him pratt dismissed the idea with a wave it was after the fact and besides it was a bullshit hesaidhesaid case it wouldnt have gone anywherenot with maury being a member of the bar in good standing and all but ever since then i heard that maury likes shaking hands a lot so when you get in that room with him and waits dont shake his hand they left pratts office smiling at the story and returned to their own workstation the division of labor had been worked out on their walk back from the courthouse bosch would take waits and rider would take fitzpatrick they would know the files inside and out by the time they sat across the table from waits in the interview room the following day since rider had less to read in the fitzpatrick case she also would finish the filing on matarese this meant bosch was cleared to study fulltime the world of raynard waits after pulling out the fitzpatrick file for rider he chose to take the accordion folder oshea had given them down to the cafeteria he knew the lunch crowd would be thinning out and he would be able to spread the files out and work without the distractions of the constantly ringing phones and chatter of the openunsolved squad room he had to use a napkin to clean a table in the corner but then quickly settled into his review of the materials there were three files on waits they included the lapd murder book compiled by olivas and ted colbert his partner in the northeast division homicide squad a file on a prior arrest and the prosecution file compiled by oshea bosch decided to read the murder book first he quickly became acquainted with raynard waits and the details of his arrest the suspect was thirtyfour years old and lived in a groundfloor apartment on sweetzer avenue in west hollywood he wasnt a large man standing five foot six and weighing pounds he was the owneroperator of a oneman businessa residential windowcleaning company called clearview residential glass cleaners according to the police reports he came to the attention of two patrol officers a boot named arnolfo gonzalez and his training officer ted fennel at am on the night of may the officers were assigned to a crime response team which was watching a hillside neighborhood in echo park because of a recent rash of home burglaries that had been occurring on the nights of dodgers home games though in uniform gonzalez and fennel were in an unmarked cruiser near the intersection of stadium way and chavez ravine place bosch knew the location it was at the remote edge of the dodger stadium complex and above the echo park neighborhood that the crt teams were watching he also knew that they were following a standard crt strategy to stay out on the perimeter of the target neighborhood and follow in any vehicle or persons who looked suspicious or out of place according to the report filed by gonzalez and fennel they grew suspicious as to why a van marked on the sides with signs that said clearview residential glass cleaners was out and about at two in the morning they followed at a distance and gonzalez used nightvision binoculars to get the vans plate number he then entered it into the cars mobile digital terminalthe officers choosing to use the onboard computer rather than the radio in case the burglar working the neighborhood was equipped with a police radio scanner the computer kicked back a flag the plate was registered to a ford mustang with an address out in claremont believing that the license plate on the van was stolen and that they now had probable cause to stop it fennel accelerated put on the uc cars grille lights and stopped the van on figueroa terrace near the intersection of beaudry avenue the driver of the vehicle appeared agitated and leaned out of the vans window to talk to officer gonzalez an effort to block the officer from conducting a visual survey of the interior of the vehicle the arrest summary read officer fennel approached the vehicles passenger side and beamed his flashlight into the van without entering the vehicle officer fennel was able to notice what appeared to be several black plastic trash bags on the floorboard in front of the front passenger seat of the vehicle a substance appearing to be blood could be seen leaking from the cinched mouth of one of the bags and onto the floor of the van according to the report the driver was asked if that was blood leaking from one of the bags and he stated that he had cut himself earlier in the day when a large plate glass window he was cleaning shattered he stated that he had used several glasscleaning rags to clean up the blood when asked to show where he was cut the driver smiled and then suddenly made a move to restart the vehicles ignition officer gonzalez reached through the window to restrain him after a short struggle the driver was removed from the vehicle and placed on the ground and handcuffed he was then moved to the backseat of the unmarked car officer fennel opened the vehicle and inspected the bags at this time officer fennel found the first bag he opened contained human body parts investigative units were immediately summoned to the scene the drivers license of the man taken out of the van identified him as raynard waits he was booked into the holding tank at northeast division while an investigation of his van and the plastic trash bags carried on through the night on figueroa terrace only after detectives olivas and colbert the oncall team that night took over the investigation and retraced some of the steps taken by gonzalez and fennel was it learned that the rookie officer had typed the wrong license plate number into the mdt typing an f for an e and getting the plate registration for the mustang out in claremont in law enforcement terms it was a good faith error meaning the probable cause to have stopped the van should still hold because the officers had been acting in good faith when an honest mistake was committed bosch assumed that this was the point of the appeal rick oshea had mentioned earlier bosch put aside the murder investigation file and opened the prosecution file he quickly looked through the documents until he found a copy of the appeal he scanned it quickly and found what he had expected waits was claiming that typing in the wrong plate number was a custom and practice within the lapd and often employed when officers on specialty squads wanted to pull over and search a vehicle without legitimate probable cause to do so though a superior court judge found that gonzalez and fennel had acted on good faith and upheld the legality of the search waits was appealing that decision to the district court of appeal bosch went back to the investigative file no matter the question of the legality of the traffic stop the investigation of raynard waits had moved rapidly the morning after the arrest olivas and colbert obtained a search warrant for the apartment on sweetzer where waits lived alone a fourhour search and forensics examination of the apartment produced several samples of human hair and blood taken from the bathrooms sink and tub traps as well as a hidden space beneath the floor containing several pieces of womens jewelry and multiple polaroid photos of nude young women who appeared to be sleeping unconscious or dead in a utility room was an upright freezer which was empty except for the two samples of pubic hair found by an sid tech meantime the three plastic bags found in the van had been transported to the coroners office and opened they were found to contain the body parts of two young women each of whom had been strangled and dismembered after death in the same way of note was the fact that the parts from one of the bodies showed indications of having been thawed after being frozen though no cutting tools were found in waitss apartment or van it was clear from the evidence gathered that while officers gonzalez and fennel were looking for a burglar they had stumbled onto what appeared to be a serial killer at work the belief was that waits had already discarded or hidden his tools and was in the process of disposing of the bodies of the two victims when he drew the attention of the crt officers the indications were that there might be other victims as well the reports in the file detailed the efforts made in the next several weeks to identify the two bodies as well as the other women in the polaroids found in the apartment waits of course offered no help in this regard engaging the services of maury swann on the morning of his capture and choosing to remain silent as the law enforcement processes continued and swann mounted an attack on the probable cause of the traffic stop only one of the two known victims was identified fingerprints taken from one of the dismembered women drew a hit on the fbis latent database she was identified as a seventeenyearold runaway from davenport iowa lindsey mathers had left home two months before being found in waitss van and had not been heard from during that time by her parents with photos supplied by her mother detectives were able to piece together her trail in los angeles she was recognized by youth counselors at several hollywood shelters she had been using a variety of names to avoid being identified and possibly sent home there were indications she was involved in drug use and street prostitution needle marks found on her body during the autopsy were believed to have been the result of a long and ongoing practice of injecting drugs a blood screen taken during the autopsy found heroin and pcp in her bloodstream the shelter counselors who helped identify lindsey mathers were also shown the polaroid photographs found in waitss apartment and were able to provide a variety of different names for at least three of the women their stories were similar to matherss journey they were runaways possibly engaged in prostitution as a means of earning money for drugs it was clear to bosch from the gathered evidence and information that waits was a predator who targeted young women who would not be immediately missed fringe dwellers who were unaccounted for by society in the first place and therefore not missed when they disappeared the polaroids from the hidden space in waitss apartment were in the file encased in plastic sheets four to a page there were eight pages with multiple shots of each woman an accompanying analysis report stated that the photo collection contained shots of nine different womenthe two women whose remains were found in waitss van and seven unknowns bosch knew that the unknowns were likely to be the seven women waits was offering to tell authorities about in addition to marie gesto and the pawnshop man but he studied the photos anyway for the face of marie gesto she wasnt there the faces in the photos belonged to women who had not caused the same sort of stir that marie gesto had bosch sat back and took off his reading glasses to rest his eyes for a few moments he remembered one of his early teachers in homicide detective ray vaughn had a special sympathy for the ones he called murders nobodies the victims who didnt count he taught bosch early on that in society all victims are not created equal but to the true detective they must be every one of them was somebodys daughter ray vaughn had told him every one of them counted bosch rubbed his eyes he thought about waitss offer to clear up nine murders including marie gestos and daniel fitzpatricks and those of seven women who never caused a blip on anybodys radar something seemed not right about that fitzpatrick was an anomaly because he was a male and the killing didnt appear to be sexually motivated he had always assumed that marie gesto was a sex killing but she was not a throwaway victim she had hit the radar big time had waits learned from her had he honed his craft after her killing to make sure he never drew such police and media heat again bosch thought that maybe the heat he had applied on the gesto case was what caused waits to change to become a more skilled and cunning killer if that was so then he would have to deal with that guilt at a later time for now he had to focus on what was in front of him he put his glasses on again and went back to the files the evidence against waits was solid nothing like being caught in possession of body parts a defense attorneys nightmare a prosecutors dream the case sailed through a preliminary hearing in four days and then the das office upped the ante with oshea announcing he would go for the death penalty bosch had a legal pad to the side of the open file so that he could write down questions for oshea waits or others it was blank when he came to the end of his review of the investigation and prosecution files he now wrote the only questions that came to mind if waits killed gesto why was there no photo of her in his apartment waits lived in west hollywood what was he doing in echo park the first question could be easily explained bosch knew killers evolved waits could have learned from the gesto killing that he needed reminders of his work the photos could have started after gesto the second question was more troubling to him there was no report in the file that dealt with this question it was thought simply that waits had been on his way to get rid of the bodies possibly to bury them in the parklands that surrounded dodger stadium no further investigation of this was contemplated or called for but to bosch it was something to consider echo park would have been at least a half hour away by car from waitss apartment in west hollywood that was a long time to be driving with body parts in bags additionally griffith park which was larger and had more pockets of isolated and difficult terrain than the area around the stadium was far closer to the west hollywood apartment and would have been the better choice for a body dump to bosch it meant that waits had a specific destination in mind in echo park this had been missed or dismissed as unimportant in the original investigation he next wrote two words psych profile no psychological study of the defendant had been conducted and bosch was mildly surprised by this perhaps he thought it had been a strategic decision by the prosecution oshea might have chosen not to take this route because he didnt know exactly where it would lead he wanted to try waits on the facts and send him to the death chamber he didnt want to be responsible for opening a door to a possible insanity defense still bosch thought a psychological study could have been useful for understanding the defendant and his crimes it should have been done whether the subject was cooperative or not a profile could have been drawn from the crimes themselves as well as from what was known about waits through his history appearance the findings in his apartment and interviews conducted with those he knew and worked for such a profile might have also been useful to oshea as an edge against a move by the defense to claim insanity now it was too late the department had a small psych staff and there would be no way for bosch to get anything done before the interview with waits the next day and farming a request out to the fbi would result in a twomonth wait at best bosch suddenly had an idea about that but decided to grind it over for a little while before acting on anything he put the questions aside for the moment and got up to refill his coffee mug he was using a real coffee mug he had brought down from the openunsolved unit because he preferred it over styrofoam his mug had come from a famous writer and television producer named stephen cannell who had spent time with the ou unit while researching a project printed on the side of the mug was cannells favorite piece of writing advice it said whats the bad guy up to bosch liked it because he thought it was a good question for a real detective to always be considering as well he came back to the cafeteria table and looked at the last file it was thin and the oldest of the three he put aside thoughts of echo park and psychological profiles sat down and opened the file it involved the reports and investigation related to waitss arrest in february for prowling it was the only blip on the radar involving waits until his arrest in the van with the body parts thirteen years later the reports said waits was arrested in the backyard of a home in the fairfax district after a neighbor with insomnia happened to look out her window while walking through her dark house she saw a man looking in the rear windows of the house next door the woman woke her sleeping husband and he promptly snuck out of the house jumped the man and held him until police arrived the man was found in possession of a screwdriver and charged with prowling he carried no identification and gave the name robert saxon to the arresting officers he said he was only seventeen but his ruse crumbled and he was identified as raynard waits twentyone a short time later when a thumbprint taken during the booking process scored a match in dmv records to a drivers license issued nine months earlier to raynard waits that license carried the same day and month of birth with one change it said raynard waits was four years older than he had claimed to be as robert saxon once identified waits admitted to police during questioning that he had been looking for a home to burglarize however it was noted in the report that the window he had been seen looking through corresponded to the bedroom of a fifteen yearold girl who lived in the house still waits avoided any sort of sex offender jacket in a plea agreement negotiated by his attorney mickey haller he was sentenced to eighteen months probation which according to the reports he completed with high marks and no violations bosch realized that the incident was an early warning of what was to come but the system was too overburdened and inefficient to recognize the danger that was in waits he worked the dates and realized that while waits was successfully completing probation in the eyes of the justice system he was also graduating from prowler to murderer marie gesto was taken before he cleared his tail howzit going bosch looked up and quickly took off his glasses so he could focus on distance rider had come down to get coffee she was holding an empty whats the bad guy up to mug the writer had given one to everybody in the squad almost done he said how about you im done with what oshea gave us i called evidence archives for the box on fitzpatrick whats in there i dont know for sure but the inventory in the book just lists the contents as pawn records thats why im having it pulled and while im waiting im going to finish up on matarese and have it ready to walk over tomorrow depending on when we get to talk to waits ill walk matarese in either first thing or last thing did you eat lunch forgot what did you see in the fitzpatrick file she pulled out the chair opposite bosch and sat down the case was handled by the shortlived riot crimes task force remember them bosch nodded they had a clearance rate of like ten percent she said basically anybody who did anything during those three days got away with it unless they were caught on camera like that kid who bricked the truck driver while a news chopper was right on top of him bosch remembered that there were more than fifty deaths during the three days of riots in and very few were ever solved or explained it had been a freeforall a lawless time in the city he remembered walking down the middle of hollywood boulevard and seeing flaming buildings on both sides of the street one of those buildings probably contained fitzpatricks pawnshop it was an impossible task he said i know rider said putting together cases out of that chaos i can tell from the file on fitzpatrick that they didnt spend a lot of time with it they worked the crime scene with a swat line guarding the place the whole thing was pretty quickly written off as random violence even when there was some stuff they should have routinely looked at like what well for starters fitzpatrick looks like he was a straight arrow he took thumbprints off of everybody who brought in stuff to pawn his edge against taking in stolen property exactly and what pawnbroker do you know of back then who voluntarily did that he also kept an eightysix listcustomers who were persona non grata for various reasons and customers who complained or threatened him apparently it isnt uncommon for people to come back in to buy back the property theyve pawned only to find they are past the holding period and its been sold they get mad sometimes they threaten the pawnbroker and so on most of this came from a guy who worked for him in the store he wasnt there the night of the fire so was the eightysix list checked out it looks like they were going down the list when something happened they stopped and wrote the case off as random violence associated with the riot fitzpatrick was set on fire with lighter fluid half the stores on the boulevard that were burned down were started the same way so they stopped spinning their wheels on it and went on to the next one there were two guys on it ones retired and the other works pacific hes a patrol sergeant now pm watch i left a message bosch knew he didnt have to ask if raynard waits was a name on the list that would have been the first thing rider said you might have an easier time getting to the retired guy bosch suggested retired guys always want to talk rider nodded thats an idea she said the other thing is waits used an alias when he got popped in ninetythree on a prowling charge robert saxon i know you checked for waits on the eightysix list you might want to check saxon as well got it look i know you have all of that going but do you have time to do an autotrack run on waits today the division of labor in their partnership had her doing most of the computer work autotrack was a computer database that could provide an individuals address history through utility and cable hookups dmv records and other sources it was tremendously useful in tracing people back through time i think i can swing it i just want to see where hes lived i cant figure out why he was in echo park and it looks like nobody else has given it much thought to dump the bags i thought right yeah we know that but why echo park he lived closer to griffith park and that wouldve probably been a better place for burying or dumping bodies i dont know something is missing or doesnt fit right i think he was going somewhere he knew he could have wanted the distance you know he thought the farther away from him the better bosch nodded but he wasnt convinced i think im going to ride over there and what you think youll find where he was going to bury those bags you turning psychic on me now harry not yet i just want to see if i can get a feel for waits before we actually talk to the guy saying the name made bosch grimace and shake his head what rider asked you know what were doing here were helping to keep this guy alive a guy who cuts women up and keeps them in the freezer until he runs out of room and has to take them out like trash thats our job find the way to let him live rider frowned i know how you feel harry but i have to tell you i kind of come down on osheas side on this i think its better that all the families know and we clear all the cases its like with my sister we wanted to know when rider was a teenager her older sister was murdered in a driveby shooting the case was cleared and three bangers went away for it it was the main reason she became a cop its probably like you with your mother too she added bosch looked up at her his mother had been murdered when he was a boy more than three decades later he solved the crime himself because he wanted to know youre right he said but it just doesnt sit right with me at the moment thats all why dont you take that ride and clear your head a little bit ill call you if anything comes up on the autotrack i guess i will he started closing the files and putting them away in the shadows of downtowns spires and under the glow of lights from dodger stadium echo park was one of las oldest and everchanging neighborhoods over the decades it had been the destination of the citys immigrant underclassthe italians coming first and then the mexicans the chinese the cubans ukrainians and all of the others by day a walk down the main drag of sunset boulevard might require skills in five or more languages to read all of the storefronts by night it was the only place in the city where the air could be split by the sound of gang gunfire the cheers for a homerun ball and the baying of the hillside coyotesall in the same hour these days echo park was also a favored destination of another class of newcomerthe young and hip the cool artists musicians and writers were moving in cafés and vintage clothing shops were squeezing in next to the bodegas and mariscos stands a wave of gentrification was washing across the flats and up the hillsides below the baseball stadium it meant the character of the place was changing it meant realestate prices were going up pushing out the working class and the gangs bosch had lived for a short time in echo park when he was a boy and many years back there had been a police bar on sunset called the short stop but cops were no longer welcome there the place offered valet parking and catered to the hollywood crowdtwo things sure to keep the offduty officer away for bosch the neighborhood of echo park had dropped off the radar to him it wasnt a destination it was a drivethrough neighborhood a shortcut on his way to the medical examiners office for work or to a dodgers game for fun from downtown he took a quick jog on the freeway north to echo park road and then took that north again toward the hillside neighborhood where raynard waits had been arrested as he passed echo lake he saw the statue known as the lady of the lake watching over the water lilies her hands palms up like the victim of a holdup as a boy he had lived for almost a year with his mother in the sir palmer apartments across from the lake but it had been a bad time for her and him and the memory was all but erased he vaguely remembered that statue but almost nothing else at sunset he turned right and took it down to beaudry from there he drove up the hillside to figueroa terrace he pulled to the curb near the intersection where waits had been pulled over a few old bungalow homes built in the thirties and forties were still there but for the most part the houses were postwar concreteblock construction they were modest with gated yards and barred windows the cars in the driveways were not new or flashy it was a workingclass neighborhood that bosch knew would be largely latino and asian now from the back of the homes on the west side there would be nice views of the downtown towers with the dwp building front and center the homes on the east side would have backyards that stretched up into the rugged terrain of the hills and at the top of those hills would be the far parking lots of the baseball stadium complex he thought about waitss windowwashing van and wondered again why he had been on this street in this neighborhood it wasnt the kind of neighborhood where he would have customers it wasnt the kind of street where a commercial van would be expected at two in the morning anyway the two crt officers had been correct in taking notice bosch pulled over and put the car in park he stepped out and looked around and then leaned against the car as he contemplated the questions he still didnt get it why had waits chosen this place after a few moments he opened his cell phone and called his partner you run that autotrack yet he asked just did where are you echo park anything come up near here uhuh i was just looking the farthest east it puts him is the montecito apartments on franklin bosch knew that the montecito wasnt near echo park but it was not far from the high tower apartments where marie gestos car had been found when was he at the montecito he asked after gesto he moved in lets see in ninetynine and out the next year a oneyear stay anything else worth mentioning no harry just the usual the guy moved house every one or two years didnt like staying put i guess okay kiz thanks you coming back to the office in a little while he closed the phone and got back in the car he took figueroa lane to chavez ravine place and hit another stop sign at one time the whole area up here was known only as chavez ravine but that was before the city moved all the people out and bulldozed the bungalows and shacks they had called home a grand housing project was supposed to rise in the ravine with playgrounds and schools and shopping plazas that would invite back those who had been displaced but once they cleared it all out the housing project was scratched from the citys plans and it was a baseball stadium that went in instead to bosch it seemed that as far back as he could remember in la the fix was always in bosch had been listening lately to the ry cooder cd called chávez ravine it wasnt jazz but that was okay it was its own kind of jazz he liked the song its just work for me a dirge about a bulldozer driver who came to the ravine to knock down the poor peoples shacks and refused to feel guilty about it you got to go where they send you when youre a dozerdrivin man he took a left on chavez ravine and in a few moments he came to stadium way and the spot where waits had first drawn the attention of the crt patrol as he passed on his way down into echo park at the stop sign he surveyed the intersection stadium way was the feeder line to the stadiums huge parking lots for waits to have come into the neighborhood this way as the arrest report stated he would have to have come in from downtown the stadium or the pasadena freeway this would not have been the way in from his home in west hollywood bosch puzzled with this for a few moments but determined there was not enough information to draw any conclusion waits could have driven through echo park making sure he was not followed and then drawn the crt tail after turning around to go back he realized that there was much about waits he didnt know and it bothered him that he would come facetoface with the killer the next day bosch felt unprepared he once again considered the idea hed had earlier but this time he didnt hesitate he opened his phone and called the fbi field office in westwood im looking for an agent named rachel walling he told the operator im not sure what squad shes with hold one by one she had apparently meant a minute as he waited he was honked at by a car that had come up from behind bosch moved through the intersection made a uturn and then pulled off the road into the shade of a eucalyptus tree finally near the twominute mark his call was transferred and picked up and a male voice said tactical agent walling please hold one right bosch said after he heard the click but this time the transfer was made quickly and bosch heard rachel wallings voice for the first time in a year he hesitated and she almost hung up on him rachel its harry bosch now she hesitated before responding harry so whats tactical mean its just the squad designation he understood she didnt answer because it was eyesonly stuff and the line was probably on tape somewhere why are you calling harry because i need a favor i could use your help actually with what im sort of in the middle of something here then dont worry about it i thought maybe youd well never mind rachel its no big deal i can handle it you sure yeah im sure ill let you get back to tactical whatever that is you take care he closed the phone and tried not to let her voice and the memory it conjured distract him from the task at hand he looked back across the intersection and realized he was probably in the same position the crt car had been in when gonzalez and fennel spotted waitss van the eucalyptus tree and night shadows had provided them cover bosch was hungry now having missed lunch he decided he would cross over the freeway into chinatown and grab takeout to bring back to the squad room he pulled back onto the street and was debating whether to call the office to see if anybody wanted anything from chinese friends when his cell rang he checked the screen but saw the id was blocked he answered anyway its me rachel i wanted to switch to my cell there was a pause bosch knew he had been right about the phones at tactical how have you been harry ive been fine so you did like you said you were going to do you went back to the cops i read about you last year with that case up in the valley yeah my first case back everythings been below the radar since then until this thing ive got working now and thats why you called me bosch noted the tone in her voice it had been more than eighteen months since they had spoken and that was at the end of an intense week when they had crossed paths on a case bosch working on a private ticket before coming back to the department and walling working on resuscitating her career with the bureau the case led bosch back to the blue fold and walling to the la field office whether tactical whatever that was constituted an improvement over her previous posting in south dakota was something bosch didnt know what he did know was that before she had fallen from grace and been cast out to the reservation beat in the dakotas she had been a profiler in the behavioral science unit at quantico i called because i thought maybe youd be interested in putting some of your old skills to work again he said you mean a profile sort of tomorrow i have to go head to head in a room with an admitted serial killer and i dont know the first thing about what makes him tick this guy wants to confess to nine murders in a deal to avoid the needle i have to make sure hes not playing us i have to figure out if hes telling the truth before we turn around and tell all the familieswhat families we know ofthat weve got the right guy he waited a moment for her to react when she didnt he pressed on ive got crimes a couple crime scenes and forensics ive got his apartment inventory and photos but i dont have a handle on him i was calling because i was wondering if i could show you some of this stuff and you know maybe get some ideas from you on how to handle him there was another long silence before she answered where are you harry she finally asked right now right now im heading into chinatown to pick up some shrimp fried rice i missed lunch im downtown i could meet you i missed lunch too you know where chinese friends is of course how about a half hour ill order before you get there bosch closed the phone and felt a thrill that he knew came from something other than the idea that rachel walling might be able to help him with the waits case their last encounter had ended badly but the sting of it had eroded over time what was left in his memory was the night they had made love in a las vegas motel room and he had believed he had connected with a kindred soul he looked at his watch he had time to kill even if he was going to order food before she got there in chinatown he pulled to the curb outside the restaurant and opened up his phone again before he had turned the gesto murder book over to olivas he had written down names and numbers he might need he now called bakersfield and the home of marie gestos parents the call would not be a complete shock to them his habit had always been to call them every time he pulled the file to take another look at the case he thought it was some measure of comfort for them to know he had not given up the missing womans mother answered the phone irene its harry bosch oh there was always that initial note of hope and excitement when one of them answered nothing yet irene he responded quickly i just have a question for you and dan if you dont mind of course of course its just good to hear from you its nice to hear your voice too it had been more than ten years since he had actually seen irene and dan gesto after two years they had stopped coming to la in hopes of finding their daughter had given up her apartment and gone home after that bosch always called what is your question harry its a name actually do you remember marie ever mentioning someone named ray waits maybe raynard waits raynard is an unusual name you might remember it he heard her breath catch and he immediately knew he had made a mistake the recent arrest and court hearings involving waits had made it into the media in bakersfield he should have known that irene would have a keen eye on such things in la she would know what waits was accused of she would know they were calling him the echo park bagman irene he guessed that her imagination had taken terrible flight irene its not what you think im just running some checks on this guy it sounds like youve heard of him from the news of course those poor young girls ending up like that i he knew what she was thinking maybe not what she was feeling can you think back before you saw him on the news the name do you remember if your daughter ever mentioned it no i dont remember it thank god is your husband there can you check with him hes not here hes still at work dan gesto had given everything of himself to the search for his missing daughter after two years when he had nothing left spiritually physically or financially he went home to bakersfield and went back to work at a john deere franchise selling farmers their tractors and tools kept him alive now can you ask him when he comes home and then call me back if he remembers the name i will harry one other thing irene maries apartment had that tall window in the living room you remember that of course that first year we came down for christmas instead of her coming up we wanted her to feel like it was a twoway road dan put up the tree in that window and you could see its lights from up and down the block yes do you know if she ever hired a window washer to keep that window clean there was a long silence while bosch waited it was a hole in the investigation an angle he should have followed thirteen years before but hadnt even thought of i dont remember harry im sorry its okay irene its okay do you remember when you and dan went back to bakersfield and you took everything from the apartment yes she said it in a strangled voice he knew that she was crying now and that the couple had felt that in some way they were abandoning their daughter as well as their hope when they had gone home after two years of searching and waiting did you keep it all all the records and bills and all of the stuff we gave you when we were finished with it he knew that if there had been a receipt for a window washer it would have been a lead that was checked out but he had to ask her anyway to confirm the negative to make sure it hadnt slipped through the cracks yes we have it its in her room we have a room with her things in it in case she ever came home bosch knew their hope would not be fully extinguished until marie was found one way or the other i understand he said i need you to look through that box irene if you can i want you to look for a receipt from a window washer go through her checkbooks and see if she paid a window washer look for a company called clearview residential glass cleaners or maybe an abbreviation of that call me if you find anything okay irene do you have a pen there i think i got a new cell number since the last time i gave it to you okay harry irene said i have a pen the number is threetwothree twofourfour fivesixthreeone thank you irene im going to go now please give your husband my best i will hows your daughter harry he paused over the years it seemed like he had told them everything about himself it was a way of keeping solid the bond and his promise to find their daughter shes fine shes great what grade now third but i dont get to see her that much shes living in hong kong with her mother at the moment i went over last month for a week theyve got a disneyland over there now he didnt know why he threw in that last line it must be very special when you are with her yes she is also sending me email now shes better at it than me it was awkward speaking about ones daughter to a woman who had lost her own and didnt know where or why i hope she comes back soon irene gesto said me too goodbye irene call me on the cell whenever you want goodbye harry good luck she always said good luck at the end of every conversation bosch sat in the car and thought about the contradiction in his desire for his daughter to live here in los angeles with him he feared for her safety in the faroff place where she lived now he wanted to be close so that he could protect her but would bringing her to a city where young girls disappeared without a trace or ended up in pieces in trash bags be a move toward safety he knew deep down that he was being selfish and that he couldnt really protect her no matter where she lived everybody had to make their own way in this world it was darwins rules out there and all he could do was hope that her path didnt cut across the path of someone like raynard waits he gathered up the files and got out of the car bosch didnt see the closed sign until he got to the door of chinese friends it was only then that he realized the restaurant closed in the late afternoon before the dinner rush started he opened his phone to call rachel walling but remembered she blocked her number when she had called him back with nothing to do but wait he bought a copy of the times out of a box at the curb and paged through it while leaning against his car he scanned the headlines quickly feeling that he was somehow wasting time or losing momentum by reading the paper the only story he read with any interest was a brief item reporting that district attorney candidate gabriel williams had picked up the endorsement of the south county fellowship of christian churches it wasnt much of a surprise but it was significant because it was an early indication that the minority vote was going with williams the civil rights attorney the story also mentioned that williams and rick oshea would be appearing the next night at a candidate forum being sponsored by another coalition representing the south side the citizens for sensitive leadership the candidates would not debate each other but would give speeches and take questions from the audience the csl would announce its endorsement afterward also appearing at the forum would be city council candidates irvin irving and martin maizel bosch lowered the paper and daydreamed for a moment about showing up at the forum and sandbagging irving from the audience asking him how his skills as a police department fixer qualified him for elective office he came out of the reverie when an unmarked federal cruiser pulled to the curb in front of his car he watched rachel walling step out she was dressed casually in black slacks and blazer with a creamcolored blouse her dark brown hair was down to her shoulders now and that was probably what was most casual of all she looked good and bosch jumped back to that night in vegas rachel he said smiling harry he walked toward her it was an awkward moment he didnt know whether to hug her or kiss her or just shake her hand there was that night in vegas but it had been followed by that day in la on the back deck of his house when everything had come apart and things had ended before they really started she saved him from making a choice by reaching out and touching him lightly on the arm i thought you were going to go in and order food for some reason theyre closed they dont open up for dinner until five you want to wait or go somewhere else where i dont know theres philippes she shook her head emphatically im tired of philippes we eat there all the time in fact i didnt eat lunch today because everybody in the squad was going there tactical huh if she was tired of a downtown place then bosch knew she wasnt working out of the main field office in westwood i know a place ill drive and you can look at the files he walked back over and opened the door of his car he had to grab the files off the passenger seat so she could get in he then handed her the files and went around to the drivers side he tossed his newspaper onto the backseat wow this is so steve mcqueen she said of the mustang what happened to the suv bosch shrugged just needed a change he revved the engine to humor her and then pulled away from the curb he went down to sunset and turned toward silver lake the route would take them through echo park on the way so what exactly do you want from me harry she opened the top file that was on her lap and started reading i want you to take a look and then tell me your impressions of this guy im talking to him tomorrow and i want to have any edge i can get i want to make sure that if anybody is manipulated its him and not me ive heard about this guy hes the echo park butcher right actually they call him the bagman got it i have a previous connection to the case which is back in ninetythree i was working out of hollywood division i caught a case involving a missing girl her name was marie gesto and she was never found it was big at the time a lot of media this guy im going into the room with raynard waitshe says thats one of the cases hell trade us she looked over at him and then back down at the file knowing how i have seen you take a case straight to heart harry i wonder then if it is wise for you to be dealing with this man now im fine its still my case and taking it straight to heart is the way of the true detective the only way he glanced over at her in time to see her roll her eyes spoken like the zen master of homicide where are we going a place called duffys in silver lake well be there in five minutes and youll love it just dont start taking your bureau buddies there thatll ruin it i promise you still have the time i told you i didnt take lunch but i do need to go back to check out at some point so are you working out of the federal courthouse she answered while continuing to scan and turn pages in the file no were off campus one of those secret federal locations huh you know the story if i told you id have to kill you bosch nodded at the joke that mean you cant tell me what tactical is its nothing short for tactical intelligence were gatherers we analyze raw data we pull off the internet cell transmissions satellite feeds its actually quite boring but is it legal for now sounds like a terrorism gig except more often than not we end up feeding leads to the dea and last year we came up with more than thirty different internet scams involving hurricane relief like i said its raw data it can lead anywhere and you traded the wideopen spaces of south dakota for downtown la as far as the career choice goes it was the right move i dont regret it but i do miss some things about the dakotas anyway let me concentrate on this you do want my take on it right yes sorry have at it he drove silently for the last few minutes and then pulled to a stop in front of the small storefront restaurant he brought the newspaper in with him she told him to order her what he was having but when the waiter came and bosch ordered an omelet she changed her mind and started scanning the menu i thought you said we were having lunch not breakfast i missed breakfast too and the omelets are good she ordered a turkey sandwich and handed back the menu my warning is that my take is going to be very superficial she said when they were left alone there is obviously not going to be enough time for me to do a full psychological ill only be scratching the surface bosch nodded i know that he said but i dont have the time to give you so i will take whatever you can give me she said nothing else and went back to the files bosch glanced at the sports pages but wasnt that interested in the rundown on the dodgers game the night before his appreciation for the game had dropped markedly in recent years he used the newspaper section mostly as a blind so that he could hold it up and appear to be reading while he was actually looking at rachel other than the longer hair she had changed little since he had last been with her still vibrantly attractive with an intangible sense of damage about her it was in the eyes they werent the hardened cops eyes he had seen in so many other faces including his own when he looked in the mirror they were eyes that were hurt from the inside out she had a victims eyes and that drew him to her why are you staring at me she suddenly said what youre so obvious i was just he was saved by the waiter who appeared and put down plates of food walling moved the files aside and he detected a small smile on her face they continued their silence as they began to eat this is good she finally said im starving yeah me too so what were you looking for when when you were acting like you were reading the newspaper but you really werent um i i guess i was trying to see if you were really interested in looking at this you know it sounds like you have a lot going maybe you dont want to get into this sort of stuff again she held up half her sandwich but stopped herself from taking a bite i hate my job okay or rather i hate what i am doing right now but it will get better another year and it will be better fine and this this is okay he pointed to the files on the table next to her plate yes but there is too much i cant even begin to help you its information overload i only have today why cant you delay the interview because its not my interview to delay and because its got politics on it the prosecutor is running for da he needs headlines hes not going to wait for me to get up to speed she nodded all the way with rick oshea i had to push my way into the case because of gesto theyre not going to slow down to let me catch up she put her hand on top of the stack of files as if taking some sort of measure from them that would help her make a decision let me keep the files when you drive me back ill finish my work clock out and continue with this ill come see you tonight at your place and give you what ive got everything he stared at her looking for the hidden meaning when i dont know as soon as i get through it nine oclock at the latest i have an early start tomorrow will that work he nodded he wasnt expecting this do you still live in that house up on the hill she asked yeah im there woodrow wilson good my place is down off beverly not too far ill come up to your place i remember the view bosch didnt respond he wasnt sure what he had just invited into his life can i give you something to think about until then she asked maybe do some checking sure what the name is that his real name bosch frowned he had never considered the name he assumed it was real waits was incarcerated his fingerprints would have been run through the system to confirm identity i assume so his fingerprints matched a previous arrest that previous time he tried to give a false name but a dmv thumbprint made him as waits why do you know what a reynard is reynard spelled rey instead of ray bosch shook his head this was coming from left field he hadnt even been thinking about the name no what is it its a name for a young male fox a young female is a vixen and the male is a reynard i studied european folklore in collegeback when i thought i wanted to be a diplomat in medieval french folklore there is a character that is a fox named reynard he is a trickster there are stories and epics about the scheming fox named reynard the character has appeared repeatedly through the centuries in bookschildrens books mostly you can google it when you get back to the office and i am sure you will get many hits bosch nodded he wasnt going to tell her he didnt know how to google he barely knew how to email his eightyearold daughter she tapped a finger on the stack of files a young fox would be a small fox she said in the description mr waits is small in stature you take it all in context of the full name and the little fox waits bosch said the young fox waits the trickster waits for the vixen maybe thats how he saw it with his victims bosch nodded he was impressed we missed that i can do some checking on the id as soon as i get back and hopefully i will have more for you tonight she went back to eating and bosch went back to watching her as soon as bosch dropped rachel walling at her car he opened his phone and called his partner rider reported that she was finishing up the paperwork on the matarese case and that they would soon be good to go on it and able to file charges at the das office the following day good anything else i got the box on fitzpatrick from evidence archives and it turned out to be two boxes containing what mostly old pawn records that i can tell were never even looked at they were sopping wet back then from when the fire was put out the guys from riot crimes put them in plastic tubs and theyve been moldering in them ever since and man do they stink bosch nodded as he computed this it was a dead end and it didnt matter raynard waits was about to confess to the killing of daniel fitzpatrick anyway he could tell that rider was looking at it the same way an uncoerced confession is a royal flush it beats everything have you heard from olivas or oshea rider asked not yet i was going to call olivas but wanted to talk to you first do you know anybody in city licensing no but if you want me to call over there i can in the morning theyre closed now what are you looking for bosch checked his watch he didnt realize how late it had gotten he guessed that the omelet at duffys was going to count as breakfast lunch and dinner i was thinking we should run waitss business and see how long hes had it whether there were ever any complaints that sort of thing olivas and his partner should have done it but there is nothing in the files about it she was silent for a while before speaking you think that could have been the connection to the high tower maybe or maybe to marie she had a nice big picture window in her apartment it isnt something i remember coming up back then but maybe we missed it harry you never miss a thing but ill get on it right away the other thing is the guys name it could be phony how so he told her about contacting rachel walling and asking her to look at the files this was initially met with resounding silence because bosch had crossed one of those invisible lapd lines by inviting the fbi into the case without command approval even if the invitation to walling was unofficial but when bosch told rider about reynard the fox she dropped her silence and became skeptical you think our windowwashing serial killer was schooled in medieval folklore i dont know he answered walling says he could have picked it up from a childrens book doesnt matter there is enough there that i think weve got to look at birth certificates make sure there is someone named raynard waits in the first file when he was popped for prowling in ninetythree he was booked under the name robert saxonthe name he gavebut then they got raynard waits when his thumbprint hit the dmv computer what are you seeing there harry if they had his thumb on file back then im thinking maybe the name isnt phony after all maybe but you know it isnt impossible to get a dl with a false name on it in this state what if saxon actually was his real name but the computer spit out his alias and he just went with it weve seen it happen before then why keep the name after he had a record under waits why not go back to saxon or whatever his real name is good questions i dont know but weve got to check it out well weve got him no matter what his name is ill google raynard the fox right now spell it with an e he waited and could hear her fingers on the computer keyboard got it she finally said theres a lot of stuff about reynard the fox thats what walling said there was silence for a long moment while rider read then she spoke says here that part of the legend is that reynard the fox had a secret castle that nobody could find he used all kinds of trickery to draw his victims close then he would take them back to the castle and eat them that hung out there untouched for a while finally bosch spoke do you have time to run another autotrack and see if you can get anything on robert saxon sure there was not a lot of conviction in her tone but bosch wasnt going to let her off the hook he wanted to keep things in motion read me his dob off the arrest report rider said i cant i dont have it here where is it i dont see it on your desk i gave the files to agent walling ill get them back later tonight youll have to go on the computer to pull the arrest report a lengthy silence went by before rider responded harry those are official investigative files you know you shouldnt have parted with them and were going to need them tomorrow for the interview i told you ill have them back tonight lets hope so but ive gotta tell you partner youre doing the cowboy thing again and i dont like it very much kiz im just trying to keep things moving and i want to be ready for this guy in that room tomorrow what walling is giving me will give us an edge fine i trust you maybe at some point you will trust me enough to ask my opinion before you go off and make decisions that affect both of us bosch felt his cheeks flare hot mostly because he knew she was right he didnt say anything because he knew that apologizing for leaving her out of the loop wasnt going to cut it call me back if olivas gives us a time for tomorrow she said you got it after closing the phone bosch thought about things for a moment he tried to move on from his embarrassment over riders indignation he focused on the case and what he had left out of the investigation so far after a few minutes he reopened the phone called olivas and asked if a time and place had been set for the waits interview tomorrow morning ten oclock olivas said dont be late were you going to tell me olivas or was i supposed to pick it up telepathically i just found out myself you called me before i could call you bosch ignored his excuse where the das office well have him brought down from highpower and set him up in an interview room here youre at the das now i had some things to go over with rick bosch let that float out there without a response anything else olivas asked yeah i have a question bosch said wheres your partner in all of this olivas what happened to colbert hes in hawaii hell be back next week if this thing carries over till then hell be part of it bosch wondered if colbert even knew what was happening or that he was missing out on a potentially careermaking case while he was off on vacation from everything bosch knew about olivas there would be no surprise if he was scheming to ace out his own partner on a glory case ten oclock then bosch asked ten anything else i should know olivas he was curious about why olivas was at the das office but didnt want to directly ask why matter of fact there is one more thing sort of a delicate thing you could say ive been talking to rick about it whats that well take a guess at what im looking at here bosch blew out his breath olivas was going to string it out bosch had known him less than one day and already knew without a doubt that he didnt like the man and never would i have no idea olivas what your fiftyones from gesto he was referring to the investigative chronology a master listing kept by date and time of all aspects of a case ranging from an accounting of detectives time and movements to notations on routine phone calls and messages to media inquiries and tips from citizens usually these were handwritten with all manner of shorthand and abbreviations employed as they were updated throughout each day sometimes hourly then when a page became full it was typed up on a form called a which would be complete and legible when and if the case ever moved into the courts and lawyers judges and juries needed to review the investigative files the original handwritten pages were then discarded what about them bosch asked im looking at the last line on page fourteen the listing is for september twentyninth nineteen ninetythree at sixforty pm mustve been quitting time the initials on the entry are je bosch felt the bile rising in his throat whatever it was olivas was getting at he was enjoying milking it obviously he said impatiently that wouldve been my partner at the time jerry edgar whats the entry say olivas it says ill just read it it says robert saxon dob eleventhreeseventyone saw times story was at mayfair and saw mg alone nobody following it gives saxons phone number and thats all it says but thats enough hotshot you know what it means bosch did he had just given the name robert saxon to kiz rider to background it was either an alias or perhaps the real name of the man known currently as raynard waits that name on the s now connected waits to the gesto case it also meant that thirteen years ago bosch and edgar had at least a shot at waitssaxon but for reasons he didnt recall or didnt know about they never took it he did not recall the specific entry in the s there were dozens of pages in the investigative chronology filled with one and twoline entries remembering them alleven with his frequent returns to the investigation over the yearswould have been impossible it took him a long moment to find his voice thats the only mention in the murder book he asked that ive seen olivas said ive been through everything twice i even missed it the first time through then the second time i said hey i know that name its an alias waits used back in the early nineties it should be in the files you have i know i saw it it meant he called you guys bosch the killer called you and you and your partner blew it looks like nobody ever followed up with him or ran his name through the box you had the killers alias and a phone number and didnt do anything course you didnt know he was the killer just some citizen calling in about what he saw he mustve been trying to play you guys in some way trying to find out about the case only edgar didnt play it was late in the day and he probably wanted to get to that first martini bosch said nothing and olivas was only too happy to continue to fill the void too bad you know maybe this whole thing couldve ended right then i guess well ask waits about it in the morning olivas and his petty world no longer mattered to bosch the barbs couldnt penetrate the thick dark cloud that was already coming down on him for he knew that if the name robert saxon had come up in the gesto investigation then it should have been routinely run through the computer it would have scored a match in the alias database and taken them to raynard waits and his prior arrest for prowling that would have made him a suspect not just a person of interest like anthony garland a strong suspect and that would have undoubtedly taken the investigation in a whole new direction but that never happened apparently neither edgar nor bosch had run the name through the box it was an oversight that bosch now knew had probably cost the lives of the two women who ended up in trash bags and the seven others waits was going to tell them about the next day olivas bosch said what bosch make sure you bring the book with you tomorrow i want to see the fiftyones oh i will well need it to do the interview bosch closed his phone without another word he felt the pace of his breathing increase soon he was close to hyperventilating his back felt hot against the car seat and he was starting to sweat he opened the windows and tried to slow the measure of each breath he was close to parker center but pulled to a stop at the curb it was every detectives nightmare the worstcase scenario a lead ignored or bungled allowing something awful to be loose in the world something dark and evil destroying life after life as it moved through the shadows it was true that all detectives made mistakes and had to live with the regrets but bosch instinctively knew that this one was malignant it would grow and grow inside until it darkened everything and he became the last victim the last life destroyed he pulled out from the curb and into traffic to get air moving through the windows he made a screeching uturn and headed home from the rear deck of his house bosch watched the sky start to dim he lived up on woodrow wilson drive in a cantilevered house that clung to the side of the hill like a cartoon character hanging on to the edge of a cliff sometimes bosch felt like that character like on this night he was drinking vodka sprinkled liberally over ice the first time hed gone with hard liquor since coming back on the job the year before the vodka made his throat feel as though he had swallowed a torch but that was okay he was trying to burn away his thoughts and cauterize his nerve endings bosch considered himself a true detective one who took it all inside and cared everybody counts or nobody counts thats what he always said it made him good at the job but it also made him vulnerable the mistakes could get to him and this one was the worst of all mistakes he shook the ice and vodka and took another deep drink until he finished the glass how could anything so cold burn so intensely hot on the way down he walked back inside the house to put more vodka on the ice he wished he had some lemon or lime to squeeze in the drink but he had made no stops on his way home in the kitchen with fresh drink in hand he picked up the phone and called jerry edgars cell phone he still knew the number by heart a partners number was something you never forgot edgar answered and bosch could hear tv noise in the background he was at home jerry its me i gotta ask you something harry where are you home man but im working on one of our old ones oh well let me go down the list of harry bosch obsessions lets see fernandez no that kid spike whateverhernamewas nope i give up man youve got too many ghosts for me to keep track of gesto shit i shouldve gone with her first i know youve been working it on and off since youve been back whats the question theres an entry in the fiftyones its got your initials on it says a guy named robert saxon called and said he saw her in the mayfair edgar waited a moment before replying thats it thats the entry thats it you remember talking to the guy shit harry i dont remember entries in cases i worked last month thats why we have the fiftyones who is saxon bosch shook his glass and took a drink before answering the ice tumbled against his mouth and vodka spilled down his cheek he wiped it with the sleeve of his jacket and then brought the phone back to his mouth hes the guy i think youve got the killer harry pretty sure but we couldve had him back then maybe i dont remember anybody named saxon calling me he mustve been trying to get his rocks off calling us harry are you drunk man gettin there whats wrong man if you got the guy its better late than never you should be happy im happy did you call her parents yet bosch was leaning against the kitchen counter and felt the need to sit down but the phone was on a cord and he couldnt go out to the living room or the deck being careful not to spill his drink he slid down to the floor his back against the cabinets no i havent called them what am i missing here harry youre fucked up and that means somethings wrong bosch waited a moment whats wrong is that marie gesto wasnt the first and she wasnt the last edgar was silent as it registered the background sound of television went quiet and he then spoke in the weak voice of a child asking what his punishment will be how many came after looks like nine bosch said in an equally quiet voice ill probably know more tomorrow jesus edgar whispered bosch nodded part of him was angry with edgar and wanted to blame him for everything but the other part said they were partners and they shared the good and the bad those s were in the murder book for both of them to read and react to so you dont remember the call no nothing its too far back all i can say is that if there was no followup then the call didnt sound legit or i got all there was to get from the caller if he was the killer he was probably just fucking with us anyway yeah but we didnt put the name in the box it would have drawn a match in the alias files maybe thats what he wanted they were both silent as their minds sifted the sands of disaster finally edgar spoke harry did you come up with this who knows about it a homicide guy from northeast came up with it he has the gesto file he knows and a da working the suspect knows it doesnt matter we fucked up and people are dead he thought but didnt say who is the da edgar asked can this be contained bosch knew that edgar had already moved on to thinking about how to limit the career damage something like this could cause bosch wondered whether edgars guilt over the nine victims that came after marie gesto had simply vanished or just been conveniently compartmentalized edgar was not a true detective he kept his heart out of it i doubt it bosch said and i dont really care we should have been onto this guy in ninetythree but we missed it and hes been out there cutting up women ever since what are you talking about cutting up is this the echo park bagman youre talking about whats his name waits he was our guy bosch nodded and held the cold glass against his left temple thats right hes going to confess tomorrow eventually it will get out because rick oshea is going to run with it there will be no way to hide it because some smart reporter is going to ask whether waits ever came up way back when in the gesto case so we say no because thats the truth waitss name never came up it was an alias and we dont need to tell them about that you have to make oshea see that harry his voice had an urgent tone to it bosch now regretted making the call he wanted edgar to share the burden of guilt with him not figure out a way to avoid blame whatever jerry harry thats easy for you to say youre downtown on your second ride im up for one of the dtwo slots in rhd and this thing will fuck up any chance i have if it gets out bosch now wanted to get off the line like i said whatever ill do what i can jerry but you know sometimes when you fuck up you have to take the consequences not this time partner not now it angered bosch that edgar had pulled the old partner act calling on bosch to protect him out of loyalty and the unwritten rule that the bond of partnership lasts forever and is stronger than even a marriage i said id do what i can he told edgar i have to go now partner he got up off the floor and hung the phone on the wall before returning to the back deck he educated the ice in his glass once more with vodka outside he went to the rail and leaned his elbows down on it the traffic noise from the freeway far down the hill was a steady hiss that he was used to he looked up at the sky and saw that the sunset was a dirty pink he saw a redtailed hawk floating on an upper current it reminded him of the one he had seen way back on the day they had found marie gestos car his cell phone started to chime and he struggled to pull it out of his jacket pocket finally he got it out and opened it before he lost the call he hadnt had time to look at the caller id on the screen it was kiz rider harry did you hear yeah i heard i just talked to edgar about it all he cares about is protecting his career and his chances at rhd harry what are you talking about bosch paused he was confused didnt that asshole olivas tell you i thought by now he would have told the whole world told me what i was calling to see if you heard whether the interviews been set for tomorrow bosch realized his mistake he walked to the edge of the deck and dumped his drink over the side ten oclock tomorrow at the das office theyll put him in a room there im sorry kiz i guess i forgot to call you are you all right it sounds like youve been drinking im home kiz im entitled what did you think i was calling about bosch held his breath and composed his thoughts then spoke edgar and i we should have had waits or saxon or whatever his name is back in ninetythree edgar spoke to him on the phone and he used the name saxon but neither of us ran the name on the computer we screwed up bad kiz now she was silent as she tracked what he had said it didnt take her long to realize the connection the alias would have given them to waits im sorry harry tell it to the nine victims that followed he was staring down at the brush beneath the deck you going to be all right im all right i just have to figure out how to get past this so im ready for tomorrow do you think you should stick with it at this point maybe one of the other ou teams should take over for us bosch responded immediately he wasnt sure how he was going to deal with the fatal mistake of thirteen years ago but he wasnt going to walk away now no kiz im not leaving the case i might have missed him in ninetythree but im not going to miss him now okay harry she didnt hang up but she didnt say anything after that bosch could hear a siren from far down in the pass below harry can i make a suggestion he knew what was coming sure i think you should put away the booze and start thinking about tomorrow when we get into that room its not going to matter what mistakes were made in the past it will be all about the moment with this man well need to be frosty bosch smiled he didnt think hed heard that term since hed been on a patrol in vietnam stay frosty he said thats right you want to meet in the squad and walk over from there yeah ill be there early i want to go by the hall of records first bosch heard a knock at his front door and started into the house me too then rider said ill meet you in the squad are you going to be all right tonight bosch opened the front door and rachel walling was standing there holding the files with both hands yes kiz he said into the phone ill be fine good night he closed the phone and invited rachel in since rachel had been in his home before she didnt bother looking around she put the files down on the small table in the dining area and looked at bosch whats wrong are you all right im fine i sort of forgot you were coming by i can leave if no im glad youre here did you find more time to look at the stuff a little bit i have some notes and some thoughts that might help you tomorrow and if you want me to be there i can make arrangements to be thereunofficially bosch shook his head officially unofficially doesnt matter this is rick osheas ticket and if i bring an fbi agent into it then that will be my ticket out she smiled and shook her head everybody thinks that all the bureau wants are the headlines its not always like that i know but i cant turn this into the test case for oshea do you want something to drink he gestured to the table so that she could sit down what are you having i was having vodka i think im going to switch to coffee now can you make a vodka tonic he nodded i can make one without tonic he said tomato juice nope cranberry juice just vodka hardcore harry i think ill have coffee he went into the kitchen to get a pot brewing he heard her pull out a chair at the table and sit down when he came back he saw that she had spread the files out and had a page of notes in front of her did you do anything about the name yet she asked in motion well start early tomorrow and hopefully well know something before we get into the room with this guy at ten she nodded and waited for him to sit down across from her ready she asked ready she leaned forward and looked at her notes talking at first without looking up from them whoever he is whatever his name is hes obviously smart and manipulative she said look at his size short and slightly built this means he had a good act he somehow was able to get these victims to go with him thats the key thing it is unlikely he used physical forceat least not at the start he is too small for that instead he employed charm and cunning and he was practiced and polished at it even if a girl is just off the bus on hollywood boulevard she is going to be wary and have some measure of street smarts he was smarter bosch nodded the trickster he said she nodded and referred to a short stack of documents i did a little internet work on that she said in the reynard epic he is often depicted as a member of the clergy and he is able to woo his audience closer to him that way so that he can grab them the clergy at the timewere talking about the twelfth centurywas the ultimate authority today it would be different the ultimate authority would be the government notably represented by the police youre saying he might have posed as a cop just a thought but its possible he had to have had something that worked what about a weapon or money he could have just flashed the green these women these girls would have gone for money i think it was more than a weapon and more than money to use either of them you still need to get close money doesnt lower the safety threshold it had to be something else his style or patter something more than or in addition to money when he got them close then he would use the weapon bosch nodded and wrote a few notes on a page of a notebook he grabbed off a shelf behind where he sat what else he asked do you know how long hes had his business no but well know tomorrow morning why well because it shows another dimension of his skills but my interest in it is not just because he ran his own business im also curious about the choice of business it allowed him to be mobile and to travel throughout the city if you saw his van in your neighborhood there would be no cause for concernexcept late at night which obviously led to his downfall and the job also allowed him inside peoples homes im curious as to whether he started the job to help him fulfill his fantasiesthe killingsor already had the business before he began acting on these impulses bosch made a few more notes rachel had a good point with her questions about the job he had questions that ran along the same lines could waits have had his business thirteen years before had he cleaned windows at the high tower and known about the vacant apartment maybe it was another mistake a connection they had missed i know i dont need to tell you this harry but you are going to have to be careful and cautious with him he looked up from his notes why something about what i see hereand obviously this is a very rushed response to a lot of materialbut something doesnt fit right about this what she composed her thoughts before answering you have to remember that it was a fluke that he was even caught officers looking for a burglar stumbled onto a killer up until the moment those officers found the bags in his van waits was completely unknown to law enforcement he had been flying below the radar for years as i said it shows he had a certain level of cunning and skill and it says something about the pathology as well he wasnt sending notes to the police like the zodiac or btk he wasnt displaying his victims as an affront to society or a taunt to police he was quiet he moved below the surface and he chose victims with the exception of the first two killings who could be pulled under without leaving so much as a ripple behind you understand what i mean bosch hesitated for a moment not sure he wanted to tell her about the mistake he and edgar had made so many years ago she read him what he didnt answer harry i dont want to be spinning my wheels here if there is something you know that i need to know then tell me or i might as well get up and go just hold on until i get the coffee i hope you like it black he got up and went into the kitchen and poured coffee into two mugs he found some packets of sugar and sweetener in a basket where he threw condiments that came with togo orders and brought them out for rachel she put sweetener in her mug okay she said after the first sip what arent you telling me my partner and i made a mistake back when we worked this in ninetythree i dont know if it contradicts what you just said about waits staying beneath the radar but it looks like he called us back then about three weeks into the case he talked to my partner on the phone and he used an alias at least we think it was an alias with this reynard the fox thing youve brought up maybe he used his real name anyway we blew it we never checked him out what do you mean he slowly reluctantly told her in detail about the call from olivas and his finding of waitss alias in the s she cast her eyes down at the table and nodded as he told it she worked the pen she was holding in a circle on the page of notes in front of her and the rest is history he said he kept right on going and killing people when did you find this out she asked right after i left you today she nodded which explains why you were hitting the vodka so hard i guess so i thought never mind what i thought no it wasnt because of seeing you rachel seeing you wasi mean isactually very nice she took up her mug and drank from it then looked down at her work and seemed to steel herself to move on well i dont see how his calling you back then changes my conclusions she said yes it does seem out of character for him to have made contact under any name but you have to remember the gesto case took place in the early stages of his formation there are a number of aspects involving gesto that dont fit with the rest so for it to be the only case where he made contact would not be all that unusual okay she referred to her notes again continuing to avoid his eyes since he had told her of the mistake so where was i before you brought that up you said that after the first two killings he chose victims he could pull beneath the surface without notice exactly what im saying is that he was getting his satisfaction in the work he didnt need anybody else to know he was doing it he wasnt getting off on the attention he wanted no attention his fulfillment was selfcontained it needed no outside or public component so then what bothers you she looked up at him what do you mean i dont know but you look like something about your own profile of the guy bothers you something you dont believe she nodded acknowledging that he had read her correctly its just that his profile doesnt support someone who would cooperate at this stage of the game who would tell you about the other crimes what i see here is someone who would never admit to it any of it he would deny it or at the very least keep quiet about it until they put the needle in his arm all right so thats a contradiction dont all of these guys have contradictions theyre all messed up in some way no profile is ever a hundred percent right she nodded thats true but it still doesnt fit and so i guess what i am trying to say is that from his point of view there is something else a higher goal if you will a plan this whole confession thing is indicative of manipulation bosch nodded like what she had said was obvious of course it is hes manipulating oshea and the system hes using this to avoid the needle maybe so but there may be other motives as well be careful she said the last two words sternly as if she were correcting a subordinate or even a child dont worry i will bosch said he decided not to dwell on it what do you think about the dismemberment he asked whats it say i actually spent most of my time studying the autopsies i have always believed that you learn the most about a killer from his victims cause of death in each case was determined to be strangulation there were no stab wounds on the bodies there was just the dismemberment these are two different things i think the dismemberment was simply part of the cleanup it was a way for him to easily dispose of the bodies again it shows his skills planning and organization the more i read the more i realized how lucky we were to get him that night she ran a finger down the sheet of notes she had written and then continued i find the bags very intriguing three bags for two women one bag held both heads and all four hands it was as if he possibly had a separate destination or plan for the bag containing the identifiers the heads and the hands have they been able to determine where he was going when they pulled him over bosch shrugged not really the assumption was that he was going to bury the bags somewhere around the stadium but that doesnt really work because they saw him drive off of stadium way and into a neighborhood he was driving away from the stadium and the woods and the places he could bury the bags there were some open lots down in the neighborhood and access to the hillsides below the stadium but it seems to me that if he was going to bury them he would not have gone into a neighborhood he would go deep into the park where there was less chance of being noticed exactly she glanced at some of her other documents what bosch asked well this reynard the fox thing might have nothing to do with all of this it may all be coincidence but in the epic reynard had a castle that was his secret hideaway she raised her eyebrows i didnt think you had a computer let alone knew how to research on line i dont my partner did the search but i gotta tell you i was over in the neighborhood right before i called you today i didnt see any castle she shook her head dont take everything so literally she said well theres still a big question about the reynard stuff he said which is did you look at the booking sheet in the file he wouldnt talk to olivas and his partner but he did answer the protocol questions at the jail when he was booked he listed his education level as high school no higher education i mean look the guys a window washer how would he even know about this medieval fox i dont know but as i said the character has popped up repeatedly in all cultures childrens books television shows there are any number of ways the character could have made an impact on this man and dont underestimate this mans intelligence because he washed windows for a living he owned and operated a business that is significant in terms of showing some of his capabilities the fact that he operated as a killer with impunity for so long is another strong indicator of intelligence bosch wasnt completely convinced he fired off another question that would take her in a new direction how do the first two fit in he went from public spectacle with the riots and then a big media splash with marie gesto to as you say diving completely beneath the surface every serial killers mo changes the simple answer is that he was on a learning curve i think the first killingwith the male victimwas an opportunity killing like a spree killing he had thought about killing for a long time but wasnt sure he could do it he found himself in a situationthe chaos of the riotswhere he could test himself it was an opportunity to see if he could actually kill someone and then get away with it the sex of the victim was not important the identity of the victim was not important at that moment he just wanted to find out if he could do it and almost any victim would do bosch could see that he nodded so he did he said and then we come to marie gesto he picks a victim who draws the police and the medias attention he was still learning forming she said he knew he could kill and now he wanted to go out and hunt she was his first victim she crossed his path something about her fit his fantasy program and she simply became prey at that time his focus was on victim acquisition and selfprotection in that case he chose badly he chose a woman who would be sorely missed and whose disappearance would draw an immediate response he probably didnt know this going into it but he learned from it from the heat he brought upon himself bosch nodded anyway after gesto he learned to add a third element to his focus victim backgrounding he made sure that he chose victims who not only met the needs of his program but who would also come from a societal fringe where their comings and goings would not be cause for notice let alone alarm and he went beneath the surface exactly he went under and he stayed there until we got lucky in echo park bosch nodded all of this was helpful it makes you wonder doesnt it he asked about how many of these guys are out there the underthesurface killers walling nodded yes sometimes it scares me to death makes me wonder how long this guy would have gone on killing if we hadnt gotten so lucky she checked her notes and said nothing further is that all youve got bosch asked walling looked up at him sharply and he realized he had chosen his words poorly i didnt mean it like that he said quickly this is all great and its going to help me a lot i just meant is there anything else you wanted to talk about she held his eyes for a moment before replying yes there is something else its not about this though then what is it youve got to give yourself a break on that phone call harry you cant let that bring you down the work ahead is too important bosch nodded insincerely it was easy for her to say that she wouldnt have to live with the ghosts of all the women raynard waits would begin to tell them about the next morning dont just nod it off like that rachel said do you know how many cases i worked in behavioral where the guy kept killing how many times we got calls and notes from these creeps but still couldnt get to them before the next victim was dead i know i know we all have ghosts its part of the job with some jobs its a bigger part than with others i had a boss once he used to say if you cant stand the ghosts get out of the haunted house he nodded again this time while looking directly at her he meant it this time how many murders have you solved harry how many killers have you put away i dont know i dont keep track maybe you should whats the point the point is how many of those killers would have done it again if you hadnt taken them down more than a few i bet probably there you go youre way ahead in the long run think about that okay his mind flashed on one of those killers bosch had arrested roger boylan many years before he drove a pickup with a camper shell on the back he had used marijuana to entice a couple young girls into the back while parked up at hansen dam he raped and killed them injecting them with an overdose of a horse tranquilizer he then threw their bodies into the dry bed of the nearby slough when bosch put the cuffs on him boylan had only one thing to say too bad i was just getting started bosch wondered how many victims there would have been if he hadnt stopped him he wondered if he could trade roger boylan for raynard waits and call it even on the one hand he thought he could on the other hand he knew it wasnt a zerosum game the true detective knew that coming out even in homicide work was not good enough not by a long shot i hope ive helped rachel said he looked up from the memory of boylan to rachels eyes i think you did i think ill know better who and what i am dealing with when i go into the room with him tomorrow she stood up from the table i meant about the other thing bosch stood that too youve helped a lot he came around the table so he could walk her to the door be careful harry i know you said that but you dont have to worry it will be a fullsecurity situation i dont mean the physical danger as much as i mean the psychological guard yourself harry please i will he said it was time to go to the door but she was hesitating she looked down at the contents of the file spread across the table and then at bosch i was hoping you would call me sometime she said but not about a case bosch had to take a few moments before coming back i thought because of what i saidwhat we saidthat he wasnt sure how to finish he wasnt sure what he was trying to say she reached up and put her hand lightly on his chest he took a step closer coming into her space he then put his arms around her and pulled her close later after they had made love bosch and rachel remained in bed talking about anything they could think of except what they had just done eventually they came back around to the case and the next mornings interview with raynard waits i cant believe that after all this time im going to sit down facetoface with her killer bosch said its kind of like a dream i actually have dreamed of catching the guy i mean it was never waits in the dream but i dreamed about closing out the case who was it in the dream she asked her head was resting on his chest he couldnt see her face but he could smell her hair under the sheets she had one leg over one of his it was this guy i always thought could be good for it but i never had anything on him i guess because he was always an asshole i wanted it to be him well did he have any connection to gesto bosch tried to shrug but it was difficult with their bodies so entwined he knew about the garage where we found the car and had an exgirlfriend who was a ringer for gesto and he had angermanagement issues no real evidence i just thought it was him i followed him once way back during the first year of the investigation he was working as a security guard up in the oil fields behind baldwin hills you know where that is you mean where you see the oil pumps when youre coming in on la cienega from the airport yeah right thats the place well this kids family owned a chunk of those fields and his old man was trying to straighten him out i guess you know make him work for a living even though they had all the money in the world so he was working security up there and i was watching him one day he came across these kids who were fooling around up in there just trespassing and messing around they were just kids maybe thirteen or fourteen two boys from the nearby neighborhood what did he do to them he drew down on them then handcuffed them to one of the pumps their backs were to each other and they were cuffed around this pole that was sort of like an anchor for the pump and then he got back in his pickup and drove away he just left them there thats what i thought he was doing but he was coming back i was watching with binoculars from a ridge all the way across la cienega and could see the whole oil field from up there he had another guy with him and they drove over to this shack where i guess they kept samples of the oil they were pumping out of the ground they went in there and came out with two buckets of this stuff put em in the back of the pickup and drove back they then dumped that shit all over the two kids rachel got up on one elbow and looked at him and you just watched this happen i told you i was clear across la cienega on the next ridge before they built houses up there if he went any further i was going to try to intervene somehow but then he let them go besides i didnt want him to know i was watching him at that point he didnt know i was thinking of him for gesto she nodded like she understood and no longer questioned his lack of action he just let them go she asked he uncuffed them kicked one of them in the butt and let them go i could tell they were crying and scared rachel shook her head in disgust whats this guys name anthony garland his father is thomas rex garland you might have heard of him rachel shook her head not recognizing the name well anthony might not have been gestos killer but he sounds like a complete asshole bosch nodded he is you want to see him what do you mean ive got a greatest hits video ive had him in an interview room three times in thirteen years each interview was on tape you have the tape here bosch nodded knowing that she might find it strange or offputting that he studied interrogation tapes at home i had them copied onto one tape i brought it home to watch the last time i worked the case rachel seemed to consider his answer before she responded then pop it in lets take a look at this guy bosch got out of bed slipped on his boxer shorts and turned on the lamp he went out to the living room and looked in the cabinet beneath the television he had several crime scene tapes from old cases as well as various other tapes and dvds he finally located a vhs tape marked garland on the box and took it back to the bedroom he had a television with a builtin vcr on the bureau he turned it on slid in the tape and sat on the edge of the bed with the remote he kept his boxers on now that he and rachel were working rachel stayed under the covers and as the tape was cuing up she reached a foot toward him and tapped her toes on his back is this what you do with all the girls you bring here show them your interrogation techniques bosch glanced back at her and was almost serious with his response rachel i think youre the only person in the world i could do this with she smiled i think i get you bosch he looked back at the screen the tape was playing he hit the mute with the remote this first one is march eleventh of ninetyfour its about six months after gesto disappeared and we were grasping for anything we didnt have enough to arrest himit wasnt even closebut i was able to convince him to come into the station to give a statement he didnt know i had the bead on him he thought he was just going to talk about the apartment where his exgirlfriend had lived on the screen was a grainy color picture of a small room with a table at which two men sat one was a much youngerlooking harry bosch and the other was a man in his early twenties with wavy surferwhite hair anthony garland he was wearing a tshirt that said lakers across the chest the sleeves were tight on his arms and tattoo ink was visible on his left biceps black barbed wire wrapped the muscles of the arm he came in voluntarily he came in looking like he was headed to a day at the beach anyway he brought up the sound on the screen garland was looking all around the room with a slight smile on his face so this is where it happens huh he asked where what happens bosch asked you know you break the bad guys down and they confess to all the crimes he smiled coyly sometimes bosch said but lets talk about marie gesto did you know her no i told you i didnt know her never saw her before in my life before what before you showed me her picture so if somebody told me you knew her then theyd be lying fuckinga right who told you that shit but you knew about the empty garage at the high tower right yeah well my girlfriend had just moved out and so yeah i knew the place was empty that doesnt mean i stashed the car in there look you asked me all of this stuff at the house i thought there was something new going on here am i under arrest or something no anthony you are not under arrest i just wanted you to come down so we could go over some of this stuff ive already gone over it with you but that was before we knew some other things about you and about her now its important to go over the same ground again make a formal record of it garlands face seemed to momentarily contort in anger he leaned across the table what things what the fuck are you talking about i had nothing to do with this ive told you that at least twice now why arent you out there looking for the person who did it bosch waited until garland calmed a bit before answering because maybe i think im with the person who did it fuck you man youve got nothing on me because theres nothing to get ive told you this from day one im not the guy now bosch leaned across the table their faces were a foot apart i know what you told me anthony but that was before i went to austin and talked to your girlfriend she told me some things about you that frankly anthony require me to pay a little more attention fuck her shes a whore yeah if shes all of that then whyd you get angry with her when she left you why did she have to run from you why didnt you just let her go because nobody leaves me i leave them okay bosch leaned back and nodded okay so in as much detail as you can remember tell me what you did on september ninth of last year tell me where you went and who you saw using the remote bosch started fastforwarding the tape he didnt have an alibi for the time we believed marie was grabbed outside the supermarket but we can skip ahead here because that part of the interview took forever rachel was now sitting up in the bed behind him with the sheet wrapped around her bosch looked back at her what do you think of this guy so far she shrugged her bare shoulders he seems like a typical rich asshole but that doesnt make him a murderer bosch nodded this now is two years later the lawyers from his daddys firm slapped a tro on me and i could only interview the kid if he had counsel present so theres nothing much here but theres one thing i want you to see his lawyer in this is dennis franks an associate of cecil dobbs a bigshot century city guy who handles things for t rex t rex the father thomas rex garland likes to be called t rex figures bosch slowed the fastforward down a notch so he could better see where the action on the tape was on the screen was garland sitting at a table with a man right next to him as the image moved in fast motion the lawyer and his client conferred many times in mouthtoear communications bosch finally slowed it to normal speed and the audio came back up it was franks the lawyer doing the talking my client has fully cooperated with you but you continue to harass him at work and home with these suspicions and questions that have not one ounce of evidentiary support im working on that part of it counselor bosch said and when i get it there wont be a lawyer in the world who can help him fuck you bosch garland said you better hope you never come for me alone man ill put you down in the dirt franks put a calming hand on garlands arm bosch was silent for a few moments before responding you want to threaten me now anthony you think im like one of those teenagers you cuff out in the oil fields and dump crude on you think im going to go away with my tail between my legs garlands face pinched together and turned dark his eyes looked like frozen black marbles bosch hit the pause button on the vcr remote there he said to rachel pointing at the screen with the remote thats what i wanted you to see look at his face pure perfect rage thats why i thought it was him walling didnt respond bosch glanced at her and she looked as though she had seen the face of pure perfect rage before she looked to be almost intimidated by it bosch wondered if she had seen it in one of the killers she had faced or in someone else bosch turned back to the television and hit the fastforward button again now we jump almost ten years to when i brought him in last april franks was gone and a new guy had the case in dobbss office he dropped the ball and never went back to the judge when the first restraining order expired so i took another shot at him he was surprised to see me i grabbed him when he came out of kate mantilinis at lunch one day he probably thought i was long gone from his life he stopped the fastforward and played the tape on the screen garland looked older and wider his face had spread and he wore his nowthinning hair cropped short he wore a white shirt with a tie the taped interviews had followed him from the end of boyhood to well into manhood this time he sat in a different interview room this one was at parker center if im not under arrest then i should be free to go he said am i free to go i was hoping youd answer a few questions first bosch replied i answered all your questions years ago this is a vendetta bosch you will not give up you will not leave me alone am i free to go or not where did you hide her body garland shook his head my god this is unbelievable when will this end it will never end garland not until i find her and not until i lock you up this is fucking crazy youre crazy bosch what can i say to make you believe me what can you can tell me where she is and then ill believe you well thats the one thing i cant tell you because i dont bosch suddenly killed the tv with the remote for the first time he realized how caseblind he had been going after garland as relentlessly as a dog chasing a car he was unaware of the traffic unaware that right in front of him in the murder book was the clue to the real killer watching the tape with walling had heaped humiliation upon humiliation he had thought by showing her the tape she would see why he had focused on garland she would understand and absolve him of the mistake but now seeing it through the prism of waitss impending confession he couldnt even absolve himself rachel leaned toward him and touched his back her soft fingers tracing down his spine it happens to all of us she said bosch nodded not to me he thought i guess when this is all over im going to have to find him and apologize he said fuck him hes still an asshole i wouldnt bother bosch smiled she was trying to make it easy for him you think she pulled back the elastic waistband on his boxers and then snapped them against his back i think i have at least another hour before i should be thinking about getting home bosch turned to look at her and she smiled the next morning bosch and rider walked from the hall of records to the ccb and despite the wait for an elevator still got to the das office twenty minutes early oshea and olivas were ready for them everyone took the same seats as before bosch noticed that the posters that had been leaning against the wall were gone they had probably been put to good use somewhere maybe sent to the public hall where the candidates forum was scheduled for that night as he sat down bosch saw the gesto murder book on osheas desk he took it without asking and immediately opened it to the chronological record he combed through the s until he found the page for september he looked at the entry olivas had told him about the evening before it was as it had been read to bosch the last entry of the day bosch felt the deep sense of regret tug at him all over again detective bosch we all make mistakes oshea said lets just move on from it and do the best we can today bosch looked up at him and eventually nodded he closed the book and put it back on the desk oshea continued i am told that maury swann is in the interview room with mr waits and is ready to go i have been thinking about this and i want to take the cases one at a time and in order we start with fitzpatrick and when we are satisfied by the confession we move on to the gesto case and when we are satisfied there we move on to the next one and so on everybody nodded except for bosch i am not going to be satisfied until we have her remains he said now oshea nodded he lifted a document off his desk i understand that if you can locate the victim based on the statements from waits then fine if it is a matter of him leading us to the body i have a release order ready to go to the judge i would say that if we reach a point where we are taking this man out of lockup then the security should be extraordinary there will be a lot riding on this and we cannot have any mistakes oshea took the time to look from detective to detective to make sure they understood the gravity of the situation he would be gambling his campaign and political life on the security of raynard waits well be ready for anything olivas said the look of concern on osheas face didnt change youre going to have a uniformed presence right he asked i dont think it is necessaryuniforms draw attention olivas said we can handle him but if you want it well have it i think it would be good to have yes no problem then well either get a car from metro to go with us or a couple deputies from the jail oshea nodded his approval then are we ready to start theres one thing bosch said were not sure who that is in the interview room waiting for us but were pretty sure his name isnt raynard waits a look of surprise played off osheas face and immediately became contagious olivas dropped his mouth open an inch and leaned forward we made him on fingerprints olivas protested on the prior bosch nodded yes the prior as you know when he was popped thirteen years ago for prowling he first gave the name robert saxon along with the birth date of eleventhreeseventyfive this is the same name he used later that year when he called about gesto only then he gave the birth date of eleventhreeseventyone but when he was pulled in on the prowling and they ran his prints through the computer they matched the thumb to the dl of raynard waits with a birth date of eleventhreeseventyone so we keep getting the same month and day but different years anyway when confronted with the thumbprint he copped to being raynard waits saying he had given the false name and year because he was hoping to be handled as a juvenile this is all in the file but where does all of it go oshea said impatiently just let me finish he got probation for the prowling because it was a first offense in the probation report bio he said he was born and raised in la okay we just came from the hall of records there is no record of raynard waits being born in la on that date or any other there have been a lot of robert saxons born in la but none on november third of either of the years mentioned in the files the bottom line rider said is we dont know who the man we are about to talk to is oshea pushed back from his desk and stood up he paced around the spacious office as he thought and spoke about this latest information okay so what are you saying that the dmv had the wrong prints on file or there was some sort of a mixup bosch turned in his seat so he could look at oshea while he answered im saying that this guy whoever he really is could have gone to the dmv thirteen fourteen years ago to set up a false id what do you need to get a drivers license proof of age back then you could buy phony ids and birth certificates on hollywood boulevard no problem or he could have bribed a dmv employee could have done a lot of things the point is there is no record of him being born here in la as he said he was that puts all the rest in doubt maybe thats the lie olivas said maybe he is waits and he lied about being born here its like when youre born out in riverside you tell everybody youre from la bosch shook his head he didnt accept the logic olivas was slinging the name is false bosch insisted raynard is a take on a character from medieval folklore known as reynard the fox its spelled with an e but its pronounced the same put that with the last name and you have the little fox waits get it you cant convince me somebody gave him that name at birth that brought a momentary silence to the room i dont know oshea said thinking out loud seems a little farfetched this medieval connection its only farfetched because we cant nail it down bosch countered you ask me its more farfetched that this would be his given name so what are you saying olivas asked that he changed his name and continued to use it even after he had an arrest tail on it that doesnt make sense to me doesnt make a lot of sense to me either but we dont know the story behind it yet okay so what are you suggesting we do oshea asked not much bosch said im just bringing it up but i do think we ought to go on the record with it up there you know ask him to state his name dob and place of birth as if it is the routine way to start one of these interviews if he gives us waits then we might be able to catch him in the lie down the road and prosecute him for everything you said that was the deal if he lies he fries we can turn it all against him oshea was standing by the coffee table behind where bosch and rider sat bosch turned again to watch him take in the suggestion the prosecutor was grinding it over and nodding i dont see where it could hurt he finally said just get it on the record but let it go at that real subtle and routine we can come back to him on it laterif we find out more about this bosch looked at rider youll be the one starting out with him asking about the first case your first question can be about his name fine she said oshea came back around the desk okay then he said are we ready its time to go i will try to stay with it as long as my schedule allows dont be offended if i jump in from time to time with a question bosch answered by standing up rider followed suit and then olivas one last thing bosch said we picked up a maury swann story yesterday that maybe you guys ought to know both bosch and rider took turns telling the story abel pratt had told them by the end olivas was laughing and shaking his head and bosch could tell by osheas face that he was trying to count how many times he had shaken maury swanns hand in court maybe he was worrying about potential political fallout bosch headed to the door of the office he felt a mixture of excitement and dread rising he was excited because he knew he was finally about to find out what had happened to marie gesto so long ago at the same time he dreaded finding out and he dreaded the fact that the details he would soon learn would place a heavy burden on him a burden he would have to transfer to a waiting mother and father up in bakersfield two uniformed sheriffs deputies stood at the door to the interview room in which sat the man who called himself raynard waits they stepped aside and allowed the prosecutorial entourage to enter the room contained one long table waits and his defense attorney maury swann were sitting on one side of it waits was directly in the middle and swann was to his left when the investigators and the prosecutor entered only maury swann stood waits was held to the arms of his chair with plastic snap cuffs swann a thin man with blackframed glasses and a luxurious mane of silver hair offered his hand but no one shook it rider took the chair directly across the table from waits and bosch and oshea sat on either side of her since olivas would not be up in the interview rotation for some time he took the last remaining chair which was next to the door oshea handled the introductions but again nobody bothered shaking anybody elses hand waits was in an orange jumpsuit that had black letters stenciled across the chest la county jail keep away the second line was not intended as a warning but it was just as good as one it meant that waits was on keepaway status within the jail indicating he was housed by himself and not allowed into the general inmate population this status was taken as a protective measure for both waits and the other inmates as bosch studied the man he had been hunting for thirteen years he realized that the most frightening thing about waits was how ordinary he looked slightly built he had an everymans face pleasant with soft features and short dark hair he was the epitome of normality the only hint of the evil that lay within was found in the eyes dark brown and deeply set they carried an emptiness that bosch recognized from other killers he had sat facetoface with over the years nothing there just a hollowness that could never be filled no matter how many other lives he stole rider turned on the tape recorder that was on the table and started the interview perfectly giving waits no reason to suspect he was stepping into a trap with the very first question of the session as was probably explained to you already by mr swann we are going to record each session with you and then turn the tapes over to your attorney who will hold them until we have a completed agreement is that understood and approved by you yes it is waits said good rider said then lets begin with an easy one can you state your name birth date and place of birth for the record waits leaned forward and made a face like he was stating the obvious to schoolchildren raynard waits he said impatiently born november third nineteen seventyone in the city of anglesoh i mean angels the city of angels if you mean los angeles could you please say it yes los angeles thank you your first name is unusual could you spell it for the tape waits complied again it was a good move by rider it would make it even more difficult for the man in front of them to argue later that he had not knowingly lied during the interview do you know where the name came from my father pulled it out of his ass i guess i dont know i thought we were here to talk about dead people not the piddly basic shit we are mr waits we are bosch felt an enormous sense of relief inside he knew that they were about to sit through a retelling of horrors but he felt they already had waits caught in a lie that might spring a fatal trap on him there was now a chance that he was not going to walk away from this to a private cell and a life of public maintenance and celebrity we want to take these in order rider said your attorneys proffer suggests that the first homicide you were ever involved in was the death of daniel fitzpatrick in hollywood on april thirtieth nineteen ninetytwo is that correct waits answered with the sort of matteroffact demeanor one would expect from someone giving directions to the nearest gas station his voice was cold and calm yes i burned him alive behind his security cage it turned out that he wasnt so secure back there not even with all of his guns why did you do that because i wanted to see if i could i had been thinking about it for a long time and i just wanted to prove myself bosch thought about what rachel walling had said to him the night before she had called it a spree killing it looked like she had been right what do you mean by prove yourself mr waits rider asked i mean there is a line out there that everybody thinks about but not many have the guts to cross i wanted to see if i could cross it when you say you had been thinking about it for a long time had you been thinking about mr fitzpatrick in particular annoyance flared in waitss eyes it was as if he were putting up with her no you stupid cunt he replied calmly i had been thinking about killing someone you understand all my life i had wanted to do it rider shook off the insult without a flinch and kept moving why did you choose daniel fitzpatrick why did you choose that night well because i was watching tv and i saw the whole city coming apart it was chaos out there and i knew the police couldnt do anything about it it was a time when people were doing just what they wanted i saw a guy on the tube talking about hollywood boulevard and how places were burning and i decided to go out to see it i didnt want the tv showing it to me i wanted to see it for myself did you drive there no i could walk back then i lived on fountain near labrea i just walked up rider had the fitzpatrick file open in front of her she glanced down at it for a moment while collecting her thoughts and formulating the next set of questions that gave oshea the opportunity to jump in where did the lighter fluid come from he asked did you take it with you from your apartment waits shifted his focus to oshea i thought the dyke was asking the questions he said were all asking the questions oshea said and could you please keep the personal attacks out of your responses not you mr district attorney i dont want to talk to you only her and them he pointed to bosch and olivas let me just back up a little bit before we get to the lighter fluid rider said smoothly pushing oshea to the side you said you walked up to hollywood boulevard from fountain where did you go and what did you see waits smiled and nodded at rider i got that right didnt i he said i can always tell i can always smell it on a woman when she likes pussy mr swann rider said can you please tell your client that this is about him answering our questions not the other way around swann put his hand on waitss left forearm which was bound to the arm of his chair ray he said dont play games just answer the questions remember we want this we brought it to them its our show bosch saw a slow burn move across waitss face as he turned and looked at his lawyer but then it quickly disappeared and he looked back at rider i saw the city burning thats what i saw he smiled after giving the answer it was like a hieronymus bosch painting he turned to bosch as he said this it froze bosch for a moment how did he know waits nodded toward boschs chest its on your id card bosch had forgotten that theyd had to clip their ids on once they entered the das office rider moved in quickly with the next question okay which way did you walk once you got to hollywood boulevard i took a right and headed east the bigger fires were down that way what was in your pockets the question seemed to give him pause i dont know i dont remember my keys i guess cigarettes and a lighter that was all did you have your wallet no i didnt want to have id with me in case the police stopped me did you already have the lighter fluid with you thats right i did i thought i might join in the fun help burn the city to the ground then i walked by that pawnshop and got a better idea you saw mr fitzpatrick yeah i saw him he was standing inside his security fence holding a shotgun he also was wearing a holster like he was wyatt earp or something describe the pawnshop waits shrugged a small place it was called irish pawn it had this neon sign out front that flashed a green threeleaf clover and then the three balls you know that are like the symbol for a pawnshop i guess fitzpatrick was standing there watching me when i passed by and you kept walking at first i did i passed by and then i thought about the challenge you know how could i get to him without getting shot by that big fucking bazooka he was holding what did you do i took the can of easylight out of my jacket pocket and filled my mouth with it squirted it right in like those flame breathers do on the venice boardwalk i then put the can away and got out a cigarette and my lighter i dont smoke anymore its a terrible habit he looked at bosch as he said this then what rider asked i went back to the assholes shop and walked into the alcove in front of the security fence i acted like i was just looking for a blind to try to light my smoke it was windy that night you understand yes so he started yelling at me to get the fuck away he came right up to the fence to yell at me and i was counting on that he smiled proud of how well his plan worked the guy hit the stock of his shotty against the steel fence to get my attention you see he saw my hands so he didnt realize the danger and when he was about two feet away i got a flame on the lighter and looked him right in the eyes i took the cigarette out of my mouth and spit all of that lighter fluid into his face of course it hit the lighter on the way and i was a fucking flamethrower he had a face full a flames before he knew what hit him he dropped the shotty pretty fast so he could try to slap at the flames but his clothes went up and pretty soon he was one crispy critter it was like being hit by napalm man waits tried to raise his left arm but couldnt it was bound to the armrest at the wrist he turned and raised his hand instead unfortunately i burned my hand a little bit blisters the whole thing it really hurt too i cant imagine what that asshole wyatt earp felt not a good way to go if you ask me bosch looked at the upraised hand he saw a discoloration in the skin tone but not a scar the burn had not gone deep after a long measure of silence rider asked another question did you seek medical attention for your hand no i didnt think that would be too smart considering the situation and from what i heard the hospitals were overflowing so i went on home and took care of it myself when did you place the can of lighter fluid in front of the store oh that was when i was walking away i just took it out wiped it off and put it down did mr fitzpatrick call out for help at any time waits paused as if to ponder the question well thats hard to say he was yelling something but i am not sure it was for help he just kind of sounded like an animal to me i closed the door on my dogs tail once when i was kid it sort of reminded me of that what were you thinking as you were walking home i was thinking farfuckingout i finally did it and i knew i was going to get away with it too i felt like i was pretty goddamn invincible if you want to know the truth how old were you i was i was twenty man and i fuckin did it did you ever think about the man you killed who you burned to death no not really he was just there there for the taking like the rest of them that came after it was like they were there for me rider spent another forty minutes questioning him eliciting smaller details that nonetheless matched those contained in the investigative reports finally at she seemed to relax her posture and pull back from her place at the table she turned to look at bosch and then at oshea i think i have enough for the moment she said maybe we could take a short break at this point she turned off the tape recorder and the three investigators and oshea stepped out into the hallway to confer swann stayed in the interview room with his client what do you think oshea said to rider she nodded im satisfied i dont think there is any doubt that he did it he solved the mystery of how he got to him i dont think hes telling us everything but he knows enough of the details he either did it or he was right there oshea looked at bosch should we move on bosch thought about this for a moment he was ready as he had watched rider interview waits his anger and disgust had grown the man in the interview room showed such a callous disregard for his victim that bosch recognized it as the classic profile of a psychopath as before he dreaded what he would next hear from the man but he was ready to hear it lets do it he said they all moved back into the interview room and swann immediately suggested that they break for lunch my client is hungry gotta feed the dog waits added with a smile bosch shook his head taking charge of the room not yet he said hell eat when we all eat he took the seat directly across from waits and turned the recorder back on rider and oshea took the wing positions and olivas sat once again in the chair by the door bosch had taken the gesto file back from olivas but had it closed in front of him on the table were going to move on now to the marie gesto case he said ah sweet marie waits said he looked at bosch with a brightness in his eyes your attorneys proffer suggests that you know what happened to marie gesto when she disappeared in nineteen ninetythree is that true waits frowned and nodded yes im afraid so he said with mock sincerity do you know the current whereabouts of marie gesto or the location of her remains yes i do here it was the moment bosch had waited on for thirteen years shes dead isnt she waits looked at him and nodded is that a yes bosch asked for the tape that is a yes shes dead where is she waits broke into a broad smile the smile of a man who had not an atom of regret or guilt in his dna shes right here detective he said shes right here with me just like all the others right here with me his smile turned into a laugh and bosch almost went across the table at him but rider moved her hand under the table and put it on his leg it immediately calmed him hold on a second oshea said lets step out again and this time i would like you to join us maury oshea charged into the hallway first and managed to pace back and forth twice before all the others were out of the interview room he then instructed the two deputies to go into the room and keep an eye on waits the door was then closed what the fuck maury oshea barked were not going to spend our time in there laying the groundwork for an insanity defense for you this is a confession not a defense maneuver swann turned his palms up in a whatcanido gesture the guy obviously has issues he said bullshit hes a stonecold killer and hes in there vamping like hannibal lecter this isnt a movie maury this is real you hear what he said about fitzpatrick he was more worried about a little burn on his hand than he was about the guy whose face he spit flames into so ill tell you what you go back in there and take five minutes with your client set him straight or we walk away from this and everybody takes their chances bosch was unconsciously nodding he liked the anger in osheas voice he also liked the way this was going ill see what i can do swann said he went back into the interview room and the deputies came back out to give the attorney and his client privacy oshea continued to pace while he cooled down sorry about that he said to no one in particular but im not going to let them control this thing they already are bosch said waits is at least oshea looked at him ready for a fight what are you saying i mean were all here because of him the bottom line is we are engaged in an effort to save his lifeat his own request oshea emphatically shook his head im not going to go back and forth on that issue with you again bosch the decision has been made at this point if youre not on board the elevators right down the hall to the left ill handle your part of the interview or freddy will bosch waited a beat before answering i didnt say i wasnt on board gesto is my case and i will see it through nice to hear it oshea said with full sarcasm too bad you werent so attentive back in ninetythree he reached over and knocked harshly on the interview room door bosch stared at his back with anger welling up from some place deep inside swann opened the door almost immediately were ready to continue he said as he stepped back to let them in after everyone retook their seats and the recorder was turned back on bosch shook off his anger at oshea and locked eyes with waits again he repeated the question where is she waits smiled slightly like he was tempted to set things off again but then the smile turned into a smirk and he answered up in the hills where in the hills up near the stables thats where i got her right when she was getting out of her car is she buried yes she is buried exactly where is she buried i would have to show you its a place i know but i cant describe i would just have to show you try to describe it its just a place in the woods near where she parked you go in and theres a path and then i went off the path way off the path you could go look and either find it right away or maybe never find it theres a lot of territory up there you remember they searched up there but they never found her and after thirteen years you believe you could lead us to this spot it hasnt been thirteen years a sudden rush of horror came over bosch the idea that he had held her captive was too abhorrent to think about its not what you think detective waits said how do you know what i am thinking i just do but its not what you think marie has been buried for thirteen years but it has not been thirteen years since i was there thats what im saying i visited her detective i visited her there quite often so i can certainly lead you there bosch paused took out a pen and wrote a note on the inside flap of the gesto file it wasnt a note of any importance it just gave him a moment to disengage from the emotions that were coming up lets go back to the beginning he said did you know marie gesto before september nineteen ninetythree no i didnt had you ever seen her before the day you abducted her not that i remember where did you first cross paths with her at the mayfair i saw her in there shopping and she was just my type i followed her where she got in her car and drove up beachwood canyon she parked in the gravel lot below the stables i believe it is called sunset ranch there was no one around when she was getting out so i decided to take her it wasnt planned before you saw her in the store no i went there to buy some gatorade it was a hot day i saw her and decided right then that i had to have her you know it was an impulse i couldnt do anything about it detective you approached her in the lot below the stables he nodded i pulled in right next to her in my van she didnt think a thing about it the parking area is down the hill from the ranch from the stables there was no one around no one who could see it was perfect it was like god said i could have her what did you do i went into the back of the van and i opened the sliding door on the side where she was i had a knife and i just stepped out and told her to get in she did it was a simple operation really she was no trouble at all he spoke as if he were a babysitter reporting on a childs behavior when the parents have returned home then what bosch asked i asked her to remove her clothes and she complied she told me she would do whatever i wanted as long as i didnt hurt her i agreed to that deal she folded her clothes very nicely as if she thought she would get the chance to put them back on again bosch rubbed a hand over his mouth the most difficult part of his job were the times he was facetoface with a killer when he saw firsthand the intersection of their warped and terrifying world with reality go on he said to waits well you know the rest we had sex but she was no good at it she couldnt relax so i did what i had to do which was what waits locked eyes with bosch i killed her detective i put my hands around her neck and i squeezed and then i squeezed harder and i watched her eyes go still then i finished up bosch stared at him but couldnt bring himself to open his mouth it was moments like these that made him feel inadequate as a detective moments when he was cowed by the depravity that was possible in the human form they stared at each other for a long moment until oshea spoke you had sex with her body he asked thats right while she was still warm i always say a woman is at her best when she is dead but still warm waits glanced at rider to see if he had gotten a reaction she showed nothing waits bosch said you are a worthless piece of trash waits looked back at bosch and put the smirk back on his face if that is your best shot detective bosch then youll have to do much better because it will only get worse for you from here sex is nothing alive or dead it is transitory but i took her soul and no one will ever get that back from me bosch looked down at the open file in front of him but did not see the words printed on the documents lets move on he finally said what did you do next i tidied up the van i always had plastic drop sheets in the back i wrapped her up and prepared her for burial i then got out and locked the van i took her things back to her car i had her keys too i got in her car and drove it away i thought that would be the best way to throw the police off where did you go you know where i went detective the high tower i knew there was an empty garage that i could use there a week or so before i had gone to look for work there and the manager happened to mention there was an open apartment he showed it to me because i acted like i was interested he showed you the garage too no just pointed it out on my way out i noticed that there was no lock on the latch so you drove marie gestos car there and stashed it in the garage thats right did anyone see you did you see anyone no and no i was very careful remember i had just killed someone what about your van when did you go back up beachwood to get it i waited until that night i thought that would be better because i had some digging to do you understand im sure was this van painted with the name of your business no not then i had just started and was not trying to draw attention yet i worked mostly off referrals i didnt have a city license yet all of that came later in fact that was another van altogether that was thirteen years ago ive gotten a new van since then how did you get back up to the stables to get your van took a cab you remember which cab company i dont remember because i didnt call for it after dropping off the car at the high tower i walked over to a restaurant i used to enjoy when i lived on franklin birdshave you ever been there good roasted chicken anyway it was a long walk i had dinner and when it was late enough i had them call me a cab i went up to my van only i had him drop me up at the stables so it wouldnt look like the van was mine when i was sure there was no one around i went to the van and i found a nice private spot to plant my little flower and this is a spot you will still be able to find absolutely you dug a hole i did how deep i dont know not too deep what did you use to dig it i had a shovel you always carried a shovel in your windowwashing van no actually i found it leaning against the barn up at the stables i think it was for cleaning out the stalls that sort of thing you put it back when you were finished of course detective i steal souls not shovels bosch looked at the files in front of him when was the last time you were at the place where you buried marie gesto mmmm a little over a year ago i usually made the trip every september ninth you know to celebrate our anniversary this year i was a bit tied up as you know he smiled goodnaturedly bosch knew he had covered everything in general terms it would all come down to whether waits could lead them to the body and if forensics would then match his story there came a time after the murder when the media paid a lot of attention to marie gestos disappearance bosch said do you remember that of course that taught me a good lesson i never acted so impulsively again i was more careful about the flowers i picked after that you called the investigators on the case didnt you as a matter of fact i did i remember that i called and told them that i had seen her in the mayfair store and that she hadnt been with anybody why did you call waits shrugged i dont know i just thought it would be fun you know to actually talk to one of the men who was hunting me was it you my partner yes i thought i might be able to shift the focus away from the mayfair after all i had been in there and i thought who knows maybe someone could describe me bosch nodded you gave the name robert saxon when you called why waits shrugged again it was just a name i used from time to time its not your real name no detective you know my real name what if i told you i dont believe a fucking word youve said here today what would you say to that i would say take me to beachwood canyon and i will prove every word of what i have said here yeah well well see about that bosch pushed back his chair and told the others he would like to confer with them in the hallway leaving waits and swann behind they stepped out of the room into the cooler air of the hallway can you guys give us some space oshea said to the two deputies when everybody else was in the hallway and the interview room door was closed oshea continued getting stuffy in there he said yeah with all of his bullshit bosch said what now bosch the prosecutor asked what now is that i dont believe him why not because he knows every answer and some of them dont work we spent a week with the cab companies going over records for every pickup and drop we knew that if the guy moved her car to the high tower then he needed some kind of ride back to his own car the stables were one of the points we checked every cab company in the city nobody made a pickup or a dropoff up there that day or night olivas injected himself into the conversation by stepping up next to oshea thats not a hundred percent and you know it bosch he said a cabbie couldve given him a ride off the books they do it all the time theres also gypsy cabs they hang outside restaurants all over the city i still dont buy his bullshit stories hes got an answer for everything the shovel just happens to be leaning against the barn how was he going to bury her if he didnt happen to see it oshea spread his arms wide theres one way to test him he said we take him out on a field trip and if he leads us to that girls body then the little details that bother you arent going to matter on the other hand if there is no body then there is no deal when do we go bosch asked ill go see the judge today well go tomorrow morning if you want wait a minute olivas said what about the other seven we still have a lot to talk to this bastard about oshea held one hand up in a calming motion lets make gesto the test case he either puts up or shuts up with this one then well go from there oshea turned and looked directly at bosch you going to be ready for this he asked bosch nodded ive been ready for thirteen years that night rachel brought dinner up to the house after calling first to see if bosch was home bosch put some music on the stereo and rachel laid the dinner out on the dining room table on plates from the kitchen the dinner was pot roast with a side of creamed corn shed brought a bottle of merlot too and it took bosch five minutes of hunting through kitchen drawers to find a corkscrew they didnt talk about the case until they were sitting across from each other at the table so she said how did it go today bosch shrugged before answering it went okay your take on everything was very helpful tomorrows the field trip and in rick osheas words it will be putup or shutup time field trip where to the top of beachwood canyon he says thats where he buried her i drove up there today after the interview and looked aroundcouldnt find anything even using his description back in ninetythree we had the cadets looking in the canyon for three days and they found nothing the woods are thick up there but he says he can find the spot do you believe hes the guy it looks like it hes convinced everybody else and theres that call he made to us back then thats pretty convincing but what i dont know maybe its my ego not being ready to accept i was so wrong that for thirteen years i was looking at one guy and i was wrong about him nobody wants to face that i guess bosch concentrated on eating for a few moments he then chased a mouthful of pot roast with some wine and wiped his mouth with a napkin man this stuff is great whered you get it she smiled just another restaurant no this is the best pot roast i think ive ever had its a place called jar they say it stands for just another restaurant oh i get it its off beverly near my place theyve got a long bar where you can eat after moving out here i ate there a lot at first alone suzanne and preech always take care of me they let me take food to go and its not that kind of place theyre the cooks chefs suzannes also the owner i love sitting there at the bar and watching the people come in watching their eyes scanning the place to see whos who a lot of celebrities go there you also get the foodies and you get the regular people theyre the most interesting somebody once said that if you circle around a murder long enough you get to know a city maybe its the same with sitting at the counter in a restaurant and easier to do harry are you changing the subject or are you going to tell me about raynard waitss confession im getting to it i thought wed finish eating first that bad huh its not that i think i just need a break from it i dont know she nodded like she understood she poured more wine into their glasses i like the music who is this bosch nodded his mouth full once again i call this miracle in a box its john coltrane and thelonious monk at carnegie hall the concert was recorded in nineteen fiftyseven and the tape sat in an unmarked box in archives for almost fifty years just sat there forgotten then some library of congress guy was going through all the boxes and performance tapes and recognized what they had there they finally put this out last year its nice its more than nice its a miracle to think it was there all that time it took the right person to find it to recognize it he looked at her eyes for a moment he then looked down at his plate and saw he was down to his last bite what would you have done for dinner if i hadnt called rachel asked bosch looked back at her and shrugged he finished eating and started telling her about raynard waitss confession hes lying she said when he was finished about the name weve got that covered no about the plan rather the lack of a plan he tells you he just saw her in the mayfair followed her and grabbed her uhuh no way i dont buy that the whole thing doesnt feel like a spurofthemoment thing there was a plan to this whether hes telling you or not bosch nodded he had the same misgivings about the confession well know more tomorrow i guess he said i wish i could be there bosch shook his head i cant make a federal case out of this besides its not what you do anymore your own people wouldnt let you go even if you were invited i know i can still wish bosch got up and started clearing the plates they worked side by side at the sink and after everything was cleaned and put away they took the bottle out on the deck there was enough left for them each to have a half glass the evening chill drew them close to one another as they stood at the railing and looked down at the lights in the cahuenga pass are you staying tonight bosch asked yes you dont have to call you know ill give you a key just come up she turned and looked at him he put his arm around her waist that fast are you saying all is forgiven theres nothing to forgive the past is past and lifes too short you know all of those clichés she smiled and they sealed it with a kiss they finished their wine and went inside to the bedroom they made love slowly and quietly at one point bosch opened his eyes and looked at her and lost his rhythm she noticed what she whispered nothing its just that you keep your eyes open im looking at you no youre not she smiled and turned her face away from him this is sort of an awkward time for a discussion she said he smiled and used his hand to turn her face to his he kissed her and they both kept their eyes open now halfway through the kiss they started laughing bosch craved the intimacy and reveled in the escape it brought he knew she knew this too her gift to him was in taking him away from the world and that was why the past no longer mattered he closed his eyes but didnt stop smiling part two the field trip it seemed to bosch to take forever to amass the motorcade but by wednesday morning the entourage was finally pulling out of the basement garage of the criminal courts building the first car in line was unmarked it was driven by olivas a sheriffs deputy from the jail division was riding shotgun while in the back bosch and rider were positioned on either side of raynard waits the prisoner was in a bright orange jumpsuit and was bound by shackles on his ankles and wrists the manacles on his wrists were secured in front to a chain that went around his waist another unmarked car driven by rick oshea and carrying maury swann and a das office evidence videographer was second in the motorcade it was followed by two vans one from the lapds scientific investigation division and the other from the coroners office the group was prepared to locate and disinter the body of marie gesto in was a perfect day for a field trip a brief overnight rain shower had cleared the sky and it was a brilliant blue with just the last wisps of upperlevel clouds in view the streets were still wet and shiny the precipitation had also kept the temperature from climbing with the suns ascent though there can never be a good day to dig up the body of a twentytwoyearold woman the glory of the weather would offer a counterbalance to the grim duty at hand the vehicles stayed in a tight formation as they made their way onto the north freeway off the broadway ramp traffic was heavy in downtown and moving at a slower than usual pace because of the wet streets bosch asked olivas to crack a window to let in some fresh air and hopefully wash out the funk of waitss body odor it had become apparent that the admitted killer had not been allowed a shower or issued a laundered jumpsuit that morning why dont you just go ahead and light up detective waits said since they were sitting shoulder to shoulder bosch had to turn awkwardly to look at waits i want the window open because of you waits you stink i havent had a smoke in five years im sure why do you think you know me weve never met what makes you think you know me waits i dont know you i know your type you have an addictive personality detective murder cases cigarettes maybe even the alcohol i smell coming out of your pores youre not that hard to read waits smiled and bosch looked away he thought about things for a moment before speaking again who are you he asked are you talking to me waits asked yes im talking to you i want to know who are you bosch olivas quickly interjected from the front the deal is we dont question him without maury swann being present so leave him alone this isnt an interrogation im just making conversation back here yeah well i dont care what you want to call it dont bosch could see olivas looking at him in the rearview mirror they held each others stare until olivas had to put his eyes back on the road bosch leaned forward so that he could turn and look past waits and over at rider she rolled her eyes at him it was her dontmaketrouble look maury swann bosch said yeah hes a good goddamn lawyer all right got this man the deal of a lifetime bosch olivas said im not talking to him im talking to my partner bosch leaned back deciding to drop it next to him the manacles clinked as waits tried to adjust his position you didnt have to take the deal detective bosch he said quietly it wasnt my choice bosch said without looking at him if it had been we wouldnt be doing this waits nodded an eye for an eye man he said i could have guessed youre the kind of man who would waits olivas said sharply just keep your mouth shut olivas reached toward the dash and turned on the radio loud mariachi music blared from the speakers he immediately slapped the button to kill the sound who the fuck was driving this last he asked of no one in particular bosch knew olivas was covering up he was embarrassed that he had not changed the channel or lowered the volume when he brought the car back last time the car remained silent they were cutting through hollywood now and olivas put on his turn signal and moved into the exit lane for gower avenue bosch turned around to look out the back window and see if they still had the other three vehicles with them the group remained intact but bosch could now see a helicopter trailing above the motorcade it had a large number on its white underbelly bosch jerked back around and looked at olivas in the rearview who called out the media olivas was that you or your boss my boss i dont know what youre talking about olivas glanced at him in the mirror but then quickly back at the road it was too furtive a move bosch knew he was lying yeah right whats in this for you ricochets going to make you chief of investigations after he wins is that it now olivas held his eyes in the mirror im not getting anywhere in the department i might as well go where im respected and my skills are valued what is that the line you say to yourself in the mirror each morning fuck you bosch gentlemen gentlemen waits said cant we all just get along here shut up waits bosch said you might not care that this is being turned into a commercial for candidate oshea but i do olivas pull over i want to talk to oshea olivas shook his head no way not with a custody in the car they were coming down the exit ramp to gower olivas took a quick right and they came to the light at franklin it turned green as they got there and they crossed franklin and started up beachwood drive olivas would not have to stop until they got to the top bosch pulled out his cell phone and called the number oshea had given everyone in the ccb garage that morning before heading off oshea its bosch i dont think it was a smart thing to call the media out on this oshea held for a moment before answering theyre a safe distance theyre in the air and whos going to be waiting for us at the top of beachwood no one bosch i was very specific with them they could track us from the air but anyone on the ground would compromise the operation you dont have to worry they are working with me they know they have to establish the relationship whatever bosch closed his phone and jammed it back into his pocket you need to calm down detective waits said and waits you need to keep quiet just trying to be helpful then shut the fuck up the car turned silent again bosch decided that his anger over the trailing media chopper and everything else was a distraction he didnt need he tried to put it out of his mind and think about what was ahead beachwood canyon was a quiet neighborhood on the slope of the santa monica mountains between hollywood and los feliz it didnt have the rustic wooded charm of laurel canyon to the west but it was preferred by its inhabitants because it was quieter safer and selfcontained unlike most of the canyon passes to the west beachwood reached a dead end at the top it was not a route for going over the mountains and consequently the traffic in beachwood did not consist of people just passing through it consisted of people who belonged that made it feel like a real neighborhood as they ascended they saw that the hollywood sign atop mount lee was directly in view through the windshield it had been put up on the next ridge more than eighty years ago to advertise the hollywoodland realestate development at the top of beachwood the sign was eventually shortened and now advertised a state of mind more than anything else the only official indication left of hollywoodland was the fortresslike stone gateway halfway up beachwood the gateway with its historical plaque commemorating the development led to a small village circle with shops a neighborhood market and the enduring hollywoodland realestate office further up at the dead end at the top was the sunset ranch the starting point of more than fifty miles of horse trails that stretched over the mountains into and throughout griffith park this was where marie gesto traded menial work in the stables for time on horseback this was where the grim motorcade of investigators body recovery experts and a manacled killer finally came to a stop the sunset ranch parking lot was merely a level clearing located on the slope below the ranch itself gravel had been dumped and spread visitors to the ranch had to park here and then leg it up to the stables at the top the parking lot was isolated and surrounded by dense woods it could not be seen from the ranch and that was what waits had counted on when he had stalked and abducted marie gesto bosch waited impatiently in the car until olivas disabled the rear door locks he then got out and looked up at the helicopter circling above he had to work hard to keep his anger in check he closed the car door and made sure it was locked the plan was to leave waits locked inside until everyone was sure the area was secure bosch walked directly to oshea as he was getting out of his car call your contact at channel four and ask them to take the chopper up another five hundred feet the noise is a distraction we dont i already did bosch okay look i know you dont like the media presence but it is an open society we live in and the public has a right to know what is going on here especially when it can help with your election right oshea spoke to him impatiently educating voters is what a campaign is all about excuse me we have a body to find oshea abruptly walked away from him and over to olivas who was maintaining a vigil next to the car containing waits bosch noticed that the sheriffs deputy was also standing guard at the rear of the car he was holding a shotgun at ready position rider came up to bosch harry are you all right never better just watch your back with these people he was watching oshea and olivas they were now conferring about something the sound of the helicopters rotor blades prevented bosch from hearing their exchange rider put her hand on his arm in a calming gesture lets just forget about the politics and get this over with rider said theres something more important than all of that lets find marie and bring her home thats what is important bosch looked down at her hand on his arm realized she was right and nodded okay a few minutes later oshea and olivas convened everyone except waits in a circle in the gravel parking lot in addition to the lawyers investigators and the sheriffs deputy there were two body recovery experts from the coroners office along with a forensic archaeologist named kathy kohl and an lapd forensic tech as well as the videographer from the das office bosch had worked with almost all of them before oshea waited until the videographer had his camera going before he addressed the troops okay people we are here on a grim duty to find and collect the remains of marie gesto he said somberly raynard waits the man in the car is going to lead us to the place where he has told us he buried her our primary concern here is the security of the suspect and the safety of all of you people at all times be careful and be alert four of us are armed mr waits will be manacled and under the watchful eyes of the detectives and deputy doolan with the shotgun mr waits will lead the way and we all will be watching his every move i would like the video and the gas probe to go along with us while the rest of you wait here when we find the location and confirm the body we will back away until we can secure mr waits and then all of you will come to the location which will of course be handled as the crime scene it is any questions so far maury swann raised his hand i am not staying here he said i am going to be with my client at all times thats fine mr swann oshea said but i dont think you are dressed for it it was true inexplicably swann had worn a suit to a body excavation everyone else was dressed for the job bosch wore blue jeans hiking boots and an old academy sweatshirt with cutoff sleeves rider wore similar attire olivas was in jeans a tshirt and nylon windbreaker that said lapd across the back the others in the troop were dressed the same way i dont care swann said if i ruin my shoes ill write them off as a business expense but i stay with my client not negotiable fine oshea said just dont get too close or get in the way not a problem okay then people lets do this olivas and the deputy went to the car to retrieve waits bosch heard the noise of the circling helicopter getting louder as the news crew came down for a better angle and a closer look with their camera after waits was helped up out of the car his manacles were checked by olivas and he was led into the clearing the deputy stayed six feet behind him at all times with the shotgun up and ready olivas kept a grip on waitss upper left arm they stopped when they reached the others in the group mr waits fair warning oshea said if you make an attempt to run these officers will shoot you down do you understand that of course waits said and they would do it gladly im sure then we understand each other lead the way waits led them toward a dirt path that fed off the lower end of the gravel parking lot it disappeared beneath a canopy created by a grove of acacia trees white oaks and heavy brush he walked without hesitation like he knew just where he was going soon the troop was in shadow and bosch figured the cameraman in the helicopter wasnt getting much usable video from above the canopy the only one who spoke was waits not too much farther he said as though he were a nature guide leading them to a secluded waterfall the path became narrower as the trees and brush encroached and the trail evolved from the welltrodden to the seldom used they were in a stretch where few hikers ventured olivas had to change position from holding waits by the arm and walking next to him to following the killer with a hand grasping the waist chain from behind it was clear that olivas was not going to let go of his suspect and this was comforting to bosch what wasnt comforting was that the new position blocked everybody elses shot at waits should he try to run bosch had traversed numerous jungles in his life most often they were the kind where you kept your eyes and ears on the distance alert and waiting for ambush and at the same time watched each step you took wary of the booby trap this time he kept his eyes focused on the two men moving in front of him waits and olivas without waver the terrain grew more difficult as the path followed the downslope of the mountain the soil was soft and moist from the overnight precipitation as well as all the rain in the past year in some places bosch felt his hiking boots sink and catch and at one point there was the sound of breaking branches behind him and then the thud of a body hitting the mud though olivas and deputy doolan stopped and turned to see what the commotion was about bosch never moved his eyes from waits from behind him he heard swann curse and the others ask if he was okay as they helped him up after swann stopped swearing and the troop regrouped they moved farther down the slope progress was slow as swanns mishap caused everyone to step even more carefully than before in another five minutes they stopped at the precipice of a steep dropoff it was a place where the weight of water that pooled in the ground had caused a small mud slide in recent months the ground had sheared away next to an oak tree exposing half of its root system the drop was almost ten feet down well this wasnt here last time i came waits said in a tone that indicated he was put out by the inconvenience is that the way olivas asked pointing to the bottom of the dropoff yes waits confirmed we go down there all right wait a minute olivas turned and looked at bosch bosch why dont you go down first and then ill send him down to you bosch nodded and moved past them he grabbed one of the lower branches of the oak for balance as he tested the stability of the soil on the steep slope it was loose and slippery no good he said this is going to be like a sliding board going down and once we get down how do we get back up olivas blew out his breath in frustration then what do there was a ladder on top of one of the vans waits suggested they all looked at him for a long moment hes right forensics has a ladder on top of the truck rider said we get it put it down on the incline and go up and down on it like stairs simple swann broke into the huddle simple except my client is not going up and down that slope or up and down a ladder with his hands chained to his waist he said after a momentary pause everyone looked at oshea i think we can work something out he said wait a minute olivas said were not taking the then hes not going down there swann said its that simple im not allowing you to endanger him hes my client and my responsibility to him is not only in the arena of the law but in all oshea held his hands up in a calming manner one of our responsibilities is the safety of the accused he said maury makes a point if mr waits falls going down the ladder without being able to use his hands then were responsible and then weve got a problem i am sure that with all of you people holding guns and shotguns we can control this situation for the ten seconds it takes him to go down a ladder ill go get the ladder said the forensic tech can you hold this her name was carolyn cafarelli and bosch knew most people called her cal she handed the gas probe a yellow tshaped device to bosch and started back through the woods ill help her with it rider said no bosch said everybody carrying a weapon stays with waits rider nodded realizing he was right i can handle it cafarelli called out its lightweight aluminum i just hope she can find her way back oshea said after she was gone for the first few minutes they waited in silence then waits spoke to bosch anxious detective he asked now that were so close bosch didnt respond he wasnt going to let waits get inside his head waits tried again i think about all the cases you have worked how many are like this one how many are like marie i bet she waits shut the fuck up olivas commanded ray please swann said in a soothing voice just making conversation with the detective well make it with yourself olivas said the silence returned until a few minutes later when they all heard the sound of cafarelli carrying the ladder through the woods she banged it a few times on lowlevel limbs but finally got it to their position bosch helped her slide it down the slope and they made sure it was steady on the steep incline when he stood up and turned back to the group bosch saw that olivas was uncuffing one of waitss hands from the chain running around the prisoners waist he left the other hand secured the other hand detective swann said he can climb with one hand free olivas insisted i am sorry detective but i am not going to allow that he has to be able to hold on and break a fall if he happens to slip he needs both hands free he can do it with one while the posturing and debate continued bosch swung himself onto the ladder and went down the slope backwards the ladder was steady at the bottom he looked around and realized that there was no discernible path from this point the trail to marie gestos body was not as obvious as it had been above he looked back up at the others and waited freddy just do it oshea instructed in an annoyed tone deputy you go down first and be ready with that shotgun in case mr waits gets any ideas detective rider you have my permission to unholster your weapon you stay up here with freddy and be ready as well bosch climbed back up a few steps on the ladder so the deputy could carefully hand him the shotgun he then stepped back down and the uniformed man came down the ladder bosch gave him back the weapon and returned to the ladder toss me the cuffs bosch called up to olivas bosch caught the cuffs and then took a position two rungs up on the ladder waits began to go down while the videographer stood at the edge and recorded his descent when waits was three rungs from the bottom bosch reached up and grabbed the waist chain to guide him the rest of the way to the lower ground this is it ray he whispered in his ear from behind your only chance you sure you dont want to make a run for it safely at the bottom waits stepped off the ladder and turned to bosch holding his hands up for the cuffs his eyes held on boschs no detective i think i like living too much i thought so bosch cuffed his hands to the waist chain and looked back up the slope at the others okay were secure one by one the others came down the ladder once they had regrouped at the bottom oshea looked around and saw that there was no longer a path they could go in any direction okay which way he said to waits waits turned in a half circle as if seeing the area for the first time ummmm olivas almost lost it you better not be pulling that way waits said coyly as he nodded to the right of the slope lost my bearings there for a second no bullshit waits olivas said you take us to the body right now or we go back go to trial and you get the hot shot of jesus juice youve got coming you got that i got it and like i said this way the group moved off through the brush with waits leading the way olivas clinging to the chain at the small of his back and the shotgun never more than five feet behind the ground on this level was softer and more muddy bosch knew that runoff from last springs rains had likely gone down the slope and collected here he felt his thigh muscles begin to tighten as every step was a labor to pull his work boots from the sucking mud in five minutes they came to a small clearing shaded by a tall fully mature oak bosch saw waits looking up and followed his eyes a yellowishwhite hair band hung limply from an overhead branch its funny waits said it used to be blue bosch knew that at the time of marie gestos disappearance she was believed to have had her hair tied back with a blue hair band known as a scrunchy a friend who had seen her earlier on that last day had provided a description of what she was wearing the scrunchy was not with the clothing found neatly folded in her car at the high tower apartments bosch looked up at the hair band thirteen years of rain and exposure had taken its color bosch lowered his eyes to waits and the killer was waiting for him with a smile were here detective youve finally found marie where waitss smile broadened youre standing on her bosch abruptly stepped back a pace and waits laughed dont worry detective bosch i dont think she minds what was it the great man wrote about sleeping the big sleep about not caring about the nastiness of how you died or where you fell bosch looked at him for a long moment wondering once again about the literary airs of the window washer waits seemed to read him ive been in jail since may detective ive done a lot of reading step back bosch said waits opened his cuffed hands in a surrender move and stepped toward the trunk of the oak bosch looked at olivas you got him i got him bosch looked down at the ground he had left footprints in the muddy earth but it also looked like there was another recent disturbance in the soil it looked as though an animal had made a small dig in the ground either foraging or burying its own dead bosch signaled the forensics tech over to the center of the clearing cafarelli stepped forward with the gas probe and bosch pointed to the spot directly below the colorless hair band the tech pushed the point of the probe into the soft soil and easily sank it a foot into the earth she clicked on the reader and began studying the electronic display bosch stepped toward her to look over her shoulder he knew that the probe measured the level of methane in the soil a buried body releases methane gas as it decomposes even a body wrapped in plastic were getting a read cafarelli said were above normal levels bosch nodded he felt strange inside out of sorts he had been with the case for more than a decade and a part of him liked holding on to the mystery of marie gesto but while he didnt believe in something called closure he did believe in the need to know the truth he felt that the truth was about to reveal itself and yet it was disconcerting he needed to know the truth to move on but how could he move on once he no longer needed to find and avenge marie gesto he looked at waits how far down is she not too far waits replied matteroffactly back in ninetythree we were in drought remember the ground was hard and man i wore my ass out digging a hole for her i was lucky she was just a little thing but anyway thats why i changed it up no more digging big holes for me after that bosch looked away from him and back at cafarelli she was taking another probe reading she would be able to delineate the grave site by charting the highest methane readings they all watched the grim work silently after taking several readings in a grid pattern cafarelli finally moved her hand in a northsouth sweep to indicate how the body was likely positioned she then marked the limits of the grave site by dragging the point of the probe in the dirt when she was finished she had marked out a rectangle about six feet by two feet it was a small grave for a small victim okay oshea said lets get mr waits back and secured in the car and then bring in the excavation group the prosecutor told cafarelli that she should stay at the site so there would be no crime scene integrity issues the rest of the group headed back toward the ladder bosch was last in the singlefile line his mind deep in thought about the ground they were traversing there was something sacred about it it was hallowed ground he hoped that waits had not lied to them he hoped that marie gesto had not been forced to make the walk to her grave while alive at the ladder rider and olivas went up first bosch then walked waits to the ladder uncuffed him and started him up as the killer climbed the deputy trained the shotgun finger on the trigger on his back in that moment bosch realized he could slip on the muddy soil fall into the deputy and possibly cause the shotgun to discharge and hit waits with the deadly fusillade he looked away from the temptation and up at the top of the sheer facing his partner was looking down at him with eyes that told him she had just read his thoughts bosch tried to put an innocent look on his face he spread his hands while mouthing the word what rider shook her head with disapproval and moved back from the edge bosch noticed that she was holding her weapon at her side as waits got to the top of the ladder he was welcomed by olivas with opened arms hands olivas said certainly detective from boschs angle below he could only see waitss back he could tell by his posture that he had brought his hands together at his front for recuffing to the waist chain but then there was a sudden movement a quick twist in the prisoners posture as he leaned too far into olivas bosch instinctively knew something was wrong waits was going for the gun holstered on olivass hip under the windbreaker hey olivas shouted in panic hey but before bosch or anyone else could react waits used his hold and leverage on olivas to spin their bodies so that the detectives back was now at the top of the ladder the deputy had no angle for a shot neither did bosch with a pistonlike move waits raised his knee and drove it twice into olivass crotch olivas started to collapse and there were two quick gunshots muffled by his body waits pushed the detective off the edge and olivas came crashing down the ladder onto bosch waits then disappeared from view olivass weight took bosch down hard into the mud as he struggled to pull his weapon bosch heard two more shots from above and shouts of panic from those on the lower ground behind him he heard the sound of running with olivas still on top of him he looked up but could not see waits or rider then the prisoner appeared at the edge of the precipice calmly holding a gun he fired down at them and bosch felt two impacts on olivass body he had become boschs shield the blast of the deputys shotgun split the air but the slug thwacked into the trunk of an oak tree to the left of waits waits returned fire at the same moment and bosch heard the deputy go down like a dropped suitcase run you coward waits yelled hows your bullshit deal looking now he fired twice more indiscriminately into the woods below bosch managed to free his gun and fire up the ladder at waits waits ducked back out of sight as he used his free hand to grab the ladder by the top rung and yank it up to the top of the embankment bosch pushed olivass body off and got up his gun aimed and ready for waits to show again but then he heard the sound of running from above and he knew waits was gone kiz bosch yelled there was no reply bosch quickly checked both olivas and the deputy but saw they were both dead he holstered his weapon and scrambled up the incline using exposed roots as handholds the ground gave way as he dug his feet into it a root snapped in his hand and he slid back down kiz talk to me again no response he tried again this time going at an angle across the steep incline instead of by a straightup assault grabbing roots and kicking his feet into the soft facing he finally made it to the top and crawled over the edge as he pulled himself up he saw waits moving off through the trees in the direction of the clearing where the others waited he pulled his gun again and fired five more shots but waits never slowed bosch got up ready to give chase but then he saw his partners body lying crumpled and bloody in the nearby brush kiz rider was faceup clutching her neck with one hand while the other lay limp at her side her eyes were wide and searching but not focusing it was as if she were blind her limp arm was so bloody it took a moment for bosch to spot the bullet entrance in the palm of her hand just below the thumb it was a throughandthrough shot and he knew it wasnt as serious as the neck wound blood was steadily seeping from between her fingers the bullet must have hit the carotid artery and bosch knew that blood loss or depletion of oxygen in the brain could kill his partner in minutes if not seconds okay kiz he said as he knelt next to her im here he could see that her left hand holding the wound on the right side of her neck was creating insufficient pressure to stop the bleeding she was losing the strength to hold on let me take over here he said he moved his hand under hers and pressed against what he now realized were two wounds bullet entry and exit he could feel the blood pulsing against his palm oshea he shouted bosch oshea called back from below the dropoff where is he did you kill him hes gone i need you to get on doolans rover and get us a medevac up here now it took a moment before oshea responded in a panicked voice doolans shot so is freddy theyre dead oshea you need to get on the radio rider is alive and we need to get her in the distance there were two gunshots followed by a shout it was a female voice and bosch thought about kathy kohl and the people up at the parking lot there were two more shots and bosch heard a change in the overhead sound of the helicopter it was banking away waits was shooting at it come on oshea he shouted were running out of time when he heard nothing in response he brought riders hand back up and pressed in against the neck wounds again hold it there kiz press as hard as you can and ill be right back bosch jumped up and grabbed the ladder waits had pulled up he lowered it back into place between the bodies of olivas and doolan and quickly climbed down oshea was on his knees next to olivass body the prosecutors eyes were as wide and as blank as those of the dead cop next to him swann was standing in the lower clearing with a dazed look on his face cafarelli had come from the grave site and was on her knees next to doolan trying to turn him over to get to the radio the deputy had fallen chest down after being shot by waits cal let me do it bosch ordered you go up and help kiz weve got to stop the bleeding from her neck without a word the forensics tech scurried up the ladder and out of sight bosch turned doolan over and saw that he had been hit in the forehead his eyes were open and looked surprised bosch grabbed the radio off doolans equipment belt and made the officer down call and requested a medical airship and paramedics to the lower parking lot at sunset ranch once he was assured that medical help was on the way he reported that an armed murder suspect had escaped custody he gave a detailed description of raynard waits then shoved the radio into his belt he went to the ladder and as he climbed back up he called down to oshea swann and the videographer who was still holding the camera up and recording the scene all of you get up here we need to carry her out to the parking lot for the evac oshea continued to look down in shock at olivas theyre dead bosch shouted from the top theres nothing we can do for them i need you up here he turned back to rider cafarelli was holding her neck but bosch could see that time was growing short the life was leaving his partners eyes bosch bent down and grabbed and held her unhurt hand he rubbed it between his two hands he noticed that cafarelli had used a hair band to wrap the wound on riders other hand come on kiz hang in there weve got an airship coming and were going to get you out of here he looked around to see what was available to them and got an idea as he saw maury swann come up the ladder he quickly moved to the edge and helped the defense attorney off the last rung oshea was coming up behind him and the videographer was waiting his turn leave the camera bosch ordered i cant im respons you bring it up here and im going to take it and throw it as far as i can the cameraman reluctantly put his equipment on the ground popped out the digital tape and put it in one of the big equipment pockets on his cargo pants he then climbed up the ladder once everyone was on top bosch pulled the ladder up and carried it over to rider he put it down next to her okay were going to use the ladder as a stretcher two men on each side and cal i need you to walk beside us and keep that pressure on her neck got it she said okay lets put her on the ladder bosch moved by riders right shoulder while the other three men took positions at her legs and other shoulder they carefully lifted her onto the ladder cafarelli kept her hands in place on riders neck we have to be careful bosch urged we tip the thing and shell fall cal keep her on the ladder got it lets go they raised the ladder and started moving back up the trail riders weight distributed among the four carriers was not a problem but the mud was two times swann in his courthouse shoes slipped and the makeshift stretcher almost went over each time cafarelli literally hugged rider to the ladder and kept her in place it took less than ten minutes to get to the clearing bosch immediately saw that the coroners van was now missing but kathy kohl and her two assistants were still there standing unharmed by the sid van bosch scanned the sky for a helicopter but saw none he told the others to put rider down next to the sid van carrying it the last distance with one hand hooked under the ladder he used his free hand to operate the radio wheres my airship he yelled at the dispatcher the response was that it was on the way with a oneminute eta they softly lowered the ladder to the ground and looked around to make sure there was enough open space in the lot to set a helicopter down behind him he heard oshea interrogating kohl what happened where did waits go he came out of the woods and shot at the news helicopter then he took our van at gunpoint and headed down the hill did the chopper follow him we dont know i dont think so it flew away when he started shooting bosch heard the sound of an approaching helicopter and hoped it wasnt the channel chopper coming back he walked to the middle of the most open area of the parking lot and waited in a few moments a silverskinned medevac airship crested the mountaintop and he started waving it down two paramedics jumped from the aircraft the moment it landed one carried an equipment case while the other brought a folding stretcher they knelt on either side of rider and went to work bosch stood and watched with his arms folded tightly across his chest he saw one put a breathing mask over her face while the other inserted an iv into her arm they then began to examine her wounds to himself bosch repeated the mantra come on kiz come on kiz come on kiz it was more like a prayer one of the paramedics turned toward the chopper and made a hand signal to the pilot spinning an upraised finger in the air bosch knew it meant that they had to get going time would be of the essence on this run the helicopters engine started to rev higher the pilot was ready the stretcher was unfolded and bosch helped the paramedics move rider onto it he then took one of the handles and helped them carry it to the waiting airship can i go bosch yelled loudly as they moved toward the open door of the helicopter what yelled one of the paramedics can i go the paramedic shook his head no sir we need room to work on her its going to be close bosch nodded where are you taking her st joes bosch nodded again st josephs was in burbank by air it was just on the other side of the mountain five minutes flying time at most by car it would be a lengthy drive around the mountain and through the cahuenga pass rider was carefully loaded into the airship and bosch stepped back as the door was being closed he wanted to yell something to his partner but he couldnt come up with any words the door snapped closed and it was too late he decided that if kiz was conscious and even cared about such things she would know what he had wanted to say the helicopter took off as bosch was moving backwards wondering if he would ever again see kiz rider alive just as the airship banked away a patrol car came roaring up the hill to the parking lot its blue lights flashing two uniforms out of hollywood division jumped out one of them had his gun out and he pointed it at bosch covered with mud and blood bosch understood why im a police officer my shields in my back pocket then lets see it said the man with the gun slowly bosch pulled out his badge case and flipped it open it passed inspection and the gun was lowered get back in the car he ordered we have to go bosch ran to the rear door of the car the two officers piled in and bosch told them to head back down beachwood then where the driver asked you have to take me around the mountain to st joes my partner was in that airship you got it code three baby the driver hit the switch that would add the siren to the already flashing emergency lights and pinned the accelerator the car uturned in a screech of tires and a spray of gravel then headed downhill the suspension was shot as with most of the cars the lapd put out on the street the car swerved dangerously around the curves on the way down but bosch didnt care he had to get to kiz at one point they almost collided with another patrol car that was moving with the same speed up to the crime scene finally halfway down the hill the driver slowed when they were passing through the pedestriancrowded shopping area of the hollywoodland village stop bosch yelled the driver complied with screeching efficiency on the brakes back it up i just saw the van what van just back it up the patrol car reversed and moved back past the neighborhood market there in the side lot bosch saw the pale blue coroners van parked in the back row our custody got loose and got a gun he took that van bosch gave them a description of waits and the warning that he was unhesitant about using the weapon he told them about the two dead cops back up the hill in the woods they decided to sweep the parking lot first and then enter the market they called for backup but decided not to wait for it they got out with their weapons drawn they searched and cleared the parking lot quickly coming to the coroners van last it was unlocked and empty but in the back bosch found an orange jailissue jumpsuit on the floor waits had either been wearing another set of clothes beneath the jumpsuit or he had found clothes to change into in the back of the van be careful bosch announced to the others he could be wearing anything stay close to me i know what he looks like in a tight formation they moved into the store through the automatic doors at the front once inside bosch quickly realized that they were too late a man with a managers tag on his shirt was consoling a woman who was crying hysterically and holding the side of her face the manager saw the two uniforms and signaled them over he didnt even seem to notice all the mud and blood on boschs clothes were the ones who called the manager said mrs shelton here just got carjacked mrs shelton nodded tearfully can you give us a description of your car and what the man who did this was wearing bosch asked i think so she whined okay listen bosch said to the two officers one of you stays here gets the description of what hes wearing and the car and puts it out on the air the other leaves now and gets me to st joes lets go the driver took bosch and the other patrolman stayed behind in another three minutes they came screeching out of beachwood canyon and were moving toward the cahuenga pass on the radio they heard a bolo broadcast for a silver bmw wanted in connection with a leomurder of a law enforcement officer the suspect was described as wearing a baggy white jumpsuit and bosch knew he had found the change of clothes in the back of the forensics van the siren was clearing a path for them but bosch estimated that they were still fifteen minutes away from the hospital he had a bad feeling about it he had a bad feeling about everything he didnt think that they were going to get there in time he tried to push that thought out of his mind he tried to think about kiz rider alive and well and smiling at him scolding him the way she always did and when they got to the freeway he concentrated on scanning all eight lanes of northbound traffic looking for a carjacked silver bmw with a killer at the wheel bosch strode through the emergency room entrance with his badge out an intake receptionist sat behind a counter taking information from a man huddled over on a chair in front of her when bosch came close he saw that the man was cradling his left arm like a baby the wrist was bent at an unnatural angle the police officer who was brought in on a medevac he said not caring about interrupting i have no information sir the desk woman said if youll take where can i get information wheres the doctor the doctor is with the patient sir if i asked him to come out to speak to you then he wouldnt be taking care of the officer would he then shes still alive sir i cant give out any information at this time if youll bosch walked away from the counter and over to a set of double doors he pushed a button on the wall that automatically swung them open behind him he heard the desk woman yelling to him he didnt stop he stepped through the doors into the emergency treatment area there were eight curtained patient bays four on each side of the room and the nurses and physicians stations were in the middle the place was abuzz outside a patient bay on the right bosch saw one of the paramedics from the helicopter he went to him how is she shes holding on she lost a lot of blood and he stopped when he turned and saw that it was bosch next to him im not sure youre supposed to be in here officer i think you better step out to the waiting room and shes my partner and i want to know what is happening shes got one of the best er attendings in the city trying to keep her alive my bet is that he will do just that but you cant stand here and watch sir bosch turned a man in a private security uniform was approaching with the desk woman bosch held his hands up i just want to be told what is happening sir you will have to come with me please the guard said he put his hand on boschs arm bosch shrugged it off im a police detective you dont need to touch me i just want to know what is happening with my partner sir you will be told all you need to know in good time if you will please come the guard made the mistake of attempting to take bosch by the arm again this time bosch didnt shrug it off he slapped the mans hand away i said dont hold on hold on said the paramedic tell you what detective lets go to the machines and get a coffee or something and ill tell you everything thats happening with your partner okay bosch didnt answer the paramedic sweetened the offer ill even get you some clean scrubs so you can get out of those muddy and bloody clothes sound good bosch relented the security man nodded his approval and the paramedic led the way first to a supply closet where he looked at bosch and guessed that he would need mediums he pulled pale blue scrubs and booties off the shelves and handed them over they then went down a hallway to the nurses break room where there were coinoperated machines serving coffee sodas and snacks bosch took a black coffee he had no change but the paramedic did you want to clean up and change first you can use the lav right over there just tell me what you know first have a seat they sat at a round table across from each other the paramedic reached his hand across the table dale dillon bosch quickly shook his hand harry bosch good to meet you detective bosch the first thing i need to do is thank you for your efforts out there in the mud you and the others there probably saved your partners life she lost a lot of blood but shes a fighter theyre putting her back together and hopefully shell be all right how bad is it its bad but its one of those cases where they wont know until she stabilizes the bullet hit one of her carotid arteries thats what they are working on nowgetting her ready to take to the or so they can repair the artery meantime since she lost a lot of blood the risk right now is stroke so shes not out of the woods yet but if she avoids going into stroke she should come out of this okay okay meaning alive and functioning with a lot of rehab ahead of her bosch nodded thats the unofficial version im not a doctor and i shouldnt have told you any of that bosch felt his cell phone vibrating in his pocket but he ignored it i appreciate that you did he said when will i be able to see her i have no idea man i just bring em in here i told you all i know and that was probably too much if youre going to wait around i suggest you wash your face and change out of those clothes youre probably scaring people with the way you look bosch nodded and dillon stood up he had defused a potentially explosive er situation and his work was done thanks dale no problemo take her easy and if you see the security guard you might want to he left it at that i will bosch said after the paramedic left bosch went into the lavatory and stripped off his sweatshirt because there were no pockets in the surgical clothes and no place for him to carry his weapon phone badge and other things he decided to leave his dirty jeans on he looked at himself in the mirror and saw that he had blood and dirt smeared on his face he spent the next five minutes washing up running the soap and water over his hands until he finally saw the water running clear into the drain when he stepped out of the lavatory he noticed that someone had come into the break room and either taken or thrown out his coffee he checked his pockets again for change but still didnt find any bosch walked back to the er reception area and now found it crowded with police both uniformed and not his supervisor abel pratt was there among the suits he looked as though the blood had completely drained from his face he saw bosch and immediately came over harry how is she what happened theyre not giving me anything official the paramedic who brought her in said it looks like shell be okay unless something new happens thank christ what happened up there im not sure waits got a gun and started shooting anything on whether theyve got a bead on him he dumped the car he jacked by the red line station on hollywood boulevard they dont know where the fuck he is bosch thought about that he knew that if waits had gone underground on the red line he could have gone anywhere from north hollywood to downtown the downtown line had a stop near echo park are they looking in echo park theyre looking everywhere man ois is sending a team here to talk to you i didnt think youd be willing to leave to go to parker right well you know how to handle it just tell it like it was right the officer involved shooting squad would not be a problem as far as bosch could see he had not personally done anything wrong in the handling of waits ois was a rubberstamp squad anyway theyll be a while pratt said theyre up at sunset ranch right now interviewing the others how the fuck did he get a gun bosch shook his head olivas got too close to him while he was coming up a ladder he grabbed it then and started shooting olivas and kiz were up top it happened so fast and i was down below them jesus christ pratt shook his head and bosch knew he wanted to ask more questions about what had happened and how it could have happened he was probably worried about his own situation as much as he was worried about rider pulling through bosch decided he needed to tell him about the thing that could be a containment problem he wasnt cuffed he said in a low voice we had to take off the cuffs so he could go up a ladder the cuffs were going to be off for thirty seconds at the max and thats when he made his move olivas let him get too close thats how it started pratt looked stunned he spoke slowly as if not understanding you took the cuffs off oshea told us to good they can blame him i dont want any blowback on openunsolved i dont want any on me its not my idea of the way to go out after twentyfive fucking years what about kiz youre not going to cut her loose are you no im not going to cut her loose ill stand behind kiz but im not standing behind oshea fuck him boschs phone vibrated again and this time he took it out of his pocket to check the screen it said unknown number he answered it anyway to get away from pratts questions judgments and asscovering strategies it was rachel harry we just got the bolo on waits what happened bosch realized he was going to be telling the story over and over for the rest of the day and possibly the rest of his life he excused himself and stepped into an alcove where there were pay phones and a water fountain so he could speak privately as concisely as possible he told her what had happened at the top of beachwood canyon and what the situation was with rider as he told the story he replayed the visual memories of the moment he saw waits go for the gun he replayed their efforts to stop the bleeding and save his partner rachel offered to come to the er but bosch talked her out of it saying he wasnt sure how long he would be there and reminding her he would likely be taken into a private interview with ois investigators will i see you tonight she asked if i get done with everything and kiz is stable otherwise i might stay here im going to go to your place call me and let me know what you know i will bosch stepped out of the alcove and saw that the er waiting room was beginning to fill with media now as well as cops bosch guessed this probably meant the word had gone out that the chief of police was on his way bosch didnt mind maybe the leverage of having the chief in the er would get the hospital to open up with some information about his partners condition he walked up to pratt who was standing with his boss captain norona the head of the robberyhomicide division whats going to happen with the excavation he asked both of them ive got rick jackson and tim marcia headed up there pratt said theyll handle it its my case bosch said a mild protest in his voice not anymore norona said youre with ois until they finish this thing up youre the only one with a badge who was up there and is still able to talk about it thats front burner the gesto dig is back burner and marcia and jackson will handle it bosch knew there would be no use arguing the captain was right though there were four others present at the shooting who were unharmed it would be boschs description and memory that would count the most there was a commotion at the er entrance as several men with tv cameras on their shoulders jostled one another for position on either side of the double doors when the doors came open an entourage entered with the chief of police at the center the chief strode to the reception desk where he was met by norona they spoke to the same woman who had rejected bosch earlier this time she was the picture of cooperation immediately picking up a phone and making a call she obviously knew who counted and who didnt inside of three minutes the hospitals chief surgeon came through the er doors and invited the chief back for a private consultation as they moved through the doors bosch hitched a ride joining the group of sixthfloor commanders and assistants in the chiefs wake excuse me dr kim a voice from behind the group called they all stopped and turned it was the desk woman she pointed at bosch and said hes not with that group the chief noticed bosch for the first time and corrected her he most certainly is he said in a tone that invited no disagreement the desk woman looked chastened the group moved forward and dr kim ushered them into an unused er patient bay they gathered around an empty bed chief your officer is being detective shes a detective im sorry your detective is being cared for in icu by drs patel and worthing i cannot interrupt their care to have them update you so i am prepared to answer what questions you might have fine is she going to make it the chief said bluntly we think so yes that is really not the question the question is about permanent damage and we wont know that for some time one of the bullets damaged one of the carotid arteries the carotid delivers blood and oxygen to the brain we dont know at this point what the interruption of the flow was or is and what damage might have occurred arent there tests that can be conducted yes sir there are and preliminarily we are seeing routine brain activity at this time that is very good news so far is she able to talk not at this time she was anesthetized during surgery and it is going to be several hours before she might be able to talk accent on might we wont know what we have until late tonight or tomorrow when she comes out of it the chief nodded thank you dr kim the chief started to make a move toward the opening in the curtain and everyone else turned to leave as well then he turned back to the head surgeon dr kim he said in a low voice at one time this woman worked directly for me i dont want to lose her we are doing our very best chief we wont lose her the police chief nodded as the group then shuffled toward the doors to the waiting room bosch felt a hand grasp his shoulder he turned to see that it was the chief he pulled bosch aside and into a private discussion detective bosch how are you doing im okay chief thank you for getting her here so quickly it didnt seem that quick at the time and it wasnt just me there were a few of us we worked together right yes i know osheas already on the news talking about carrying her out of the jungle making hay out of his part it didnt surprise bosch to hear that walk with me for a moment detective the chief said they walked through the waiting area and out to the ambulance driveup area the police chief didnt speak until they were out of the building and out of earshot of all others were going to take a big hit for this he finally said weve got a goddamn admitted serial killer running around loose in the city i want to know what happened up on that mountain detective how did things go so awfully wrong bosch nodded his contrition he knew that what had happened in beachwood canyon would be like a bomb detonating and sending a shock wave through the city and the department thats a good question chief he replied i was there but im not sure what happened once again bosch began to tell the story little by little the media and the police left the er waiting room in a way kiz rider was a disappointment because she didnt die if she had died everything would have been an immediate sound bite get in go live and then move on to the next spot and the next press conference but she hung on and people couldnt wait around as the hours went by the number of people in the waiting room got smaller until only bosch was left rider was not currently in a relationship and her parents had left los angeles after the death of her sister so there was no one but bosch to wait for the chance to see her shortly before pm dr kim came through the double doors looking for the chief of police or at least someone in uniform or above the rank of detective he had to settle for bosch who stood up to receive the news shes doing well shes conscious and nonverbal communication skills are good she is not talking because of the trauma to the neck and we have her intubated but the initial indications are all positive no stroke no infection everything looks good the other wound is stabilized and well deal further with that tomorrow shes had enough surgery for one day bosch nodded he felt a tremendous relief begin to flood through him kiz was going to make it can i see her for a few minutes but as i said shes not talking at this time come with me bosch followed the chief surgeon once more through the double doors they walked through the er to the intensive care unit kiz was in the second room on the right her body seemed small in the bed surrounded with all the equipment and monitors and tubes her eyes were at halfmast and showed no change when he entered her focal range he could tell she was conscious but just barely kiz bosch said how are ya partner he reached down and grabbed her good hand dont try to answer i shouldnt have asked anything i just wanted to see you the chief surgeon just told me that you are going to be okay youll have some rehab but then youll be as good as new she couldnt talk or make a sound because of the tube going down her throat but she squeezed his hand and bosch took that as a positive response he pulled a chair over from the wall and sat down so he could keep her hand in his over the next half hour he said very little to her he just held her hand and she squeezed it from time to time at a nurse entered the room and told bosch that two men had asked for him in the er waiting room bosch gave riders hand a final squeeze and told her he would be back in the morning the two men waiting for him were ois investigators their names were randolph and osani randolph was the lieutenant in charge of the unit he had been investigating cop shootings so long that he had supervised the investigations the last four times bosch had fired his weapon they took him out to their car so they could speak privately with a tape recorder on the seat next to him he told his story beginning with the start of his part of the investigation randolph and osani asked no questions until bosch began recounting that mornings field trip with waits at that point they asked many questions obviously designed to elicit answers that went with the departments preconceived plan for dealing with the days disaster it was clear that they wanted to establish that the important decisions if not all the decisions came through the das office and rick oshea this was not to say that the department planned to announce that the disaster should be placed at the door of osheas office but the department was getting ready to defend itself against attack so when bosch recounted the momentary disagreement over whether waits should be uncuffed to descend the ladder randolph pressed him for exact quotes of what was said and by whom bosch knew that he was their last interview they presumably had already talked to cal cafarelli maury swann and oshea and his videographer have you looked at the video bosch asked when he was finished telling his view of things not yet we will well it should have everything on it i think the guy was rolling video when the shooting started in fact id like to see that tape myself well to be honest we are having a bit of a problem with that randolph said corvin says he must have lost the tape in the woods corvins the camera guy right says it mustve come out of his pocket when you people were carrying rider on the ladder we havent found it bosch nodded and did the political math corvin worked for oshea the tape would show oshea instructing olivas to take the handcuffs off waits corvins lying bosch said he was wearing the kind of pants with all the pockets right for carrying equipment cargo pants i definitely saw him pop the tape out of the camera and put it in one of those pockets with the flap on the side of his leg it was when he was the last one left at the bottom only i saw it but it wouldnt have fallen out he closed the flap hes got the tape randolph just nodded as though hed assumed all along that what bosch had said was the situation as though being lied to was simply par for the course in the ois unit the tapes got oshea telling olivas to take off the cuffs bosch said thats not the kind of video oshea would want on the news or in the lapds hands during an election year or any year so its a question of whether corvins keeping the tape to run his own play on oshea or oshea has told him to hang on to the tape my bet would be on oshea randolph didnt even bother nodding to any of that okay lets go over it all once more from the top and then we can get you out of here he said instead sure bosch said understanding that he was being told that the tape was not his concern whatever you need bosch finished the second runthrough of the story before seven oclock and asked randolph and osani if he could ride with them back to parker center so he could retrieve his car on the ride back the ois men did not discuss the investigation randolph turned on kfwb at the top of the hour and they listened to the media version of the events in beachwood canyon and the latest update on the search for raynard waits a third report was on the growing political fallout from the escape if the elections needed an issue bosch and company had certainly provided it everyone from city council candidates to rick osheas opponent weighed in with criticism of the way the lapd and district attorneys office had handled the fatal field trip oshea sought to distance himself from the potentially electionkilling catastrophe by releasing a statement that characterized him as merely an observer on the trip an observer who made no decisions concerning the security and transport of the prisoner he said he relied on the lapd for all of that the report concluded with a mention of osheas bravery in helping to save a wounded police detective carrying her to safety while the armed fugitive was at large in the wooded canyon having heard enough randolph turned the radio off that guy oshea bosch said hes got it down hes going to make a great da no doubt randolph said bosch said good night to the ois men in the garage behind parker center and then walked to a nearby pay lot where he kept a parking space reserved to retrieve his car he was drained from the day but there was almost an hour of daylight left he headed back up the freeway toward beachwood canyon along the way he plugged his dead cell phone into its charger and called rachel walling she was already at his house it will be a while he said im going back up to beachwood why because its my case and theyre up there working it right you should be there he didnt respond he just listened to the silence after that it was comforting ill get home as soon as i can he finally said bosch closed the phone as he was exiting the freeway at gower and a few minutes later he was heading up beachwood drive near the top he rounded a curve just as a pair of vans were passing on their way down he recognized them as a body wagon followed by the sid van with the ladder on top he felt a space open up in his chest he knew they had come from the excavation marie gesto was in that front van when he got to the parking lot he saw marcia and jackson the two detectives who had been assigned to take over the excavation peeling off the jumpsuits they had worn over their clothes and throwing them into the open trunk of their car they were finished for the day bosch parked next to them and got out harry hows kiz marcia asked immediately they say shes going to be okay thank goodness what a mess huh jackson said bosch just nodded what did you find we found her marcia said or i should say we found a body its going to be a dental identification youve got dental records right in the file on the top of my desk well get it and take it over to mission the coroners office was on mission road a medical examiner with dental expertise would compare marie gestos dental xrays with those taken from the body reclaimed at the spot waits had led them to that morning marcia closed the trunk of the car and he and his partner looked at bosch you doing all right jackson asked long day bosch said and from what i hear they might get longer marcia said until they catch this guy bosch nodded he knew they wanted to know how it could have happened two cops dead and another in icu but he was tired of telling the story listen he said i dont know how long im going to be hung up on this im going to try to get clear tomorrow but obviously its not going to be up to me either way if you get the id id appreciate it if youd let me make the call to the parents ive been talking to them for thirteen years theyll want it to come from me i want it to come from me you got it harry marcia said ive never complained about not having to make a notification jackson added they spoke for another few moments and then bosch looked up and appraised the dying light of the day in the woods the path would already be in deep shadows he asked if they had a flashlight in the car that he could borrow ill bring it back tomorrow he promised though they all knew he might not be back the following day harry theres no ladder in the woods marcia said sid took it with them bosch shrugged and looked down at his mudcaked boots and pants i might get a little dirty he said marcia smiled as he popped the trunk and reached in for a maglite you want us to stick around he asked as he gave bosch the heavy light you slip in there and break an ankle itll be just you and the coyotes all night no ill be fine ive got my cell anyway and besides i like coyotes be careful in there bosch stood by while they got into their car and drove off he checked the sky again and headed down the path waits had taken them on that morning it took him five minutes to get to the dropoff where the shooting had occurred he turned on the flashlight and for a few moments played the beam over the area the place had been trampled by the coroners people ois investigators and forensics techs there was nothing left to see eventually he slid down the incline using the same tree root he had used to climb up that morning in another two minutes he came to the final clearing now delineated by yellow policeline tape tied from tree to tree at the edges in the center was a rectangular excavation hole no more than four feet deep bosch ducked under the tape and entered the hallowed ground of the hidden dead part three hallowed ground in the morning bosch was making coffee for rachel and himself when he got the call it was his boss abel pratt harry youre not coming in i just got the word bosch had half expected it from who the sixth floor ois hasnt wrapped it up and because the thing is so hot with the media they want you to cool it on the sidelines for a few days until they see how its going to go bosch didnt say anything the sixth floor was where the department administration was located the they pratt had referred to was a collective of groupthink commanders who became frozen whenever a case hit big on tv or in politics and this one had hit both bosch wasnt surprised by the call just disappointed the more things changed the more they stayed the same did you watch the news last night pratt asked no i dont watch the news maybe you should start weve now got irvin irving all over the box weighing in on this mess and hes zeroed in on you specifically gave a speech last night on the south side saying that hiring you back was an example of the chiefs ineptitude and the departments moral corruption i dont know what you did to the guy but hes got a real hardon for you man moral corruption thats taking the gloves off yeah soon hell be blaming me for his hemorrhoids is the sixth floor sidelining me in reaction to him or to ois come on harry you think id be privy to that conversation i just got the call where i was told to make the call know what i mean yeah but look at it this waywith irving punking you like that the last thing the chief would do is cut you loose because it would look like irving was right so the way i would read this thing is that they want to go by the numbers and nail it down tight before they close it down so enjoy home duty and stay in touch yeah and what do you hear about kiz well they dont have to worry about home duty with her shes not going anywhere thats not what i mean i know what you mean and it was like peeling a label off a beer bottle it never came all at once and i think kiz could be in some trouble she was up on top with olivas when waits made his move the question is why didnt she take his ass out when she had the chance it looks like she froze harry and that means she could get hurt in this thing bosch nodded pratts political take on the situation seemed on target it made bosch feel bad right now rider had to fight to stay alive later shed have to fight to keep her job he knew that no matter what the fight was he would stand beside her the whole way okay he said anything new on waits nothing man hes in the wind probably down in mexico by now if that guy knows whats best for him hell never raise his head above sea level again bosch wasnt so sure about that but didnt express his disagreement something some instinct told him that waits was lying low yes but that he had not gone very far he thought about the red line subway waits had apparently disappeared into and its many stops between hollywood and downtown he remembered the legend of reynard the fox and the secret castle harry i gotta go pratt said you cool yeah right cool thanks for running it down for me top all right man technically you are supposed to check in with me every day until we get the word youre back on active you got it bosch hung the phone up a few minutes later when rachel came into the kitchen he poured coffee into an insulated cup that came with the lexus she had leased when she transferred to la she had brought the cup in with her the night before she was dressed and ready for work i dont have anything here for breakfast he said we could go down the hill to dupars if you have time no thats okay i need to get going she tore open a pink packet of sugar substitute and dumped it into the coffee she opened the refrigerator and took out a quart of milk she had brought with her the night before as well she whitened the coffee and put the top on the cup what was the call you just got she asked my boss i just got sidelined while all of this is going on oh baby she came over and hugged him in a way its routine the media and politics of the case make it a necessity im on home duty until the ois wraps things up and clears me of any wrongdoing you going to be okay i already am what are you going to do i dont know home duty doesnt mean i have to stay home so im going to the hospital to see if theyll let me hang with my partner for a while take it from there i guess want to have lunch yeah sure that sounds good they had quickly slipped into a domestic comfort that bosch liked it was almost as though they didnt have to talk look im fine he said you go to work and ill try to come down around lunchtime ill call you okay ill talk to you she kissed him on the cheek before leaving through the kitchen door to the carport he had told her to use the space in the carport on the days she came to stay with him bosch drank a cup of coffee on the back deck while looking over the cahuenga pass the skies were still clear from the rain two days earlier it would be another beautiful day in paradise he decided to go to dupars on his own to eat breakfast before heading to the hospital to check on kiz he could pick up the papers see what was reported about the events of the day before and then bring them to kiz maybe read them to her if she wanted he walked back inside and decided to leave on the suit and tie he had dressed in that morning before getting the call from pratt home duty or not he was going to act and look like a detective he did however go into the closet in the bedroom and from the shelf above pull down the box containing the case file copies he had made four years earlier when he had retired he looked through the stacks until he found the copy of the marie gesto murder book jackson and marcia would have the original since they were running with the investigation now he decided to take the copy with him in case he needed something to read while visiting with rider or if jackson or marcia called with any questions he drove down the hill and up to ventura boulevard and followed it west into studio city at dupars he bought copies of the los angeles times and the daily news out of racks in front of the restaurant then went in and ordered french toast and coffee at the counter the beachwood canyon story was on the front page of both papers both displayed color booking photos of raynard waits and the articles played up the hunt for the mad killer the formation of an lapd task force and a tollfree telephone tip line just for finding waits the editors of the newspapers apparently considered that angle more important to the readers and a better selling point than the killing of two cops in the line of duty and the wounding of a third the stories contained information released during the numerous press conferences held the day before but very few details about what had actually happened in the woods at the top of beachwood canyon according to the stories it was all under continuing investigation and information was being jealously guarded by those in charge the short bios of the officers involved in the shooting and deputy doolan were sketchy at best both of the victims killed by waits had been family men the wounded detective kizmin rider had recently separated from a life partnercode for reporting that she was gay bosch didnt recognize the names of the reporters on the stories and thought maybe they were new to the police beat and without sources close enough to the investigation to reveal the inside details on the jump pages of both papers he found sidebar stories that focused on the political response to the shooting and escape both papers quoted a variety of local pundits who for the most part said it was too early to tell whether the beachwood incident would help or hinder rick osheas candidacy for district attorney while it was his case that went horribly awry the reports of his selfless efforts to help save the wounded law officer while an armed killer was loose in the very same woods could be a balancing positive said one pundit in this city politics are like the movie business nobody knows anything this could be the best thing that happens to oshea it could be the worst of course osheas opponent gabriel williams was quoted liberally in both papers calling the incident an unpardonable disgrace and laying all blame at osheas feet bosch thought about the missing videotape and wondered how much it would be worth to the williams camp perhaps he thought corvin the videographer had already found out in both papers irvin irving got his licks in and in doing so took a specific swipe at bosch for being the epitome of what was wrong in the police department something irving as a city councilman would right he said bosch should never have been hired back into the department the year before and that irving as a deputy chief at the time had lobbied hard against it the papers said bosch was under investigation by the departments ois squad and could not be reached for comment neither noted that the ois routinely conducted an investigation of every shooting that involved a police officer so what was presented to the public seemed unusual and therefore suspicious bosch noticed that the sidebar in the times had been written by keisha russell who had worked the cop beat for a number of years before finally reaching a level of burnout that led her to ask for a new beat she had landed in politicsa beat with its own high burnout rate she had called and left a message for bosch the night before but he had been in no mood to talk to a reporter even one he trusted he still had her numbers programmed in his cell when she worked cops he had been her source on a number of occasions and she had provided him with help several times in return he put the papers aside and took his first bites of french toast his breakfast had both powdered sugar and maple syrup on it and he knew the sugar high would help charge him into the day after getting through about half of the meal he pulled out his cell and called the reporters number she answered right away keisha he said its harry bosch harry bosch she said well long time no see well with you being a big shot on the political scene now ah but now it is politics and police coming together in a violent collision isnt it how come you didnt call me back yesterday because you know i cant comment on an ongoing investigation especially an investigation involving myself besides that you called after my phone died i didnt get your message until i got home and it was probably after your deadline how is your partner she said putting the banter aside for a serious tone hanging in and you came away unscathed as reported in the physical sense but not the political thats right well the story is already in the paper calling to comment and defend yourself now doesnt exactly work im not calling to comment or defend myself i dont like my name in the paper oh then i get it you want to go off the record and be my deep throat on this not quite he heard her blowing out her breath in frustration then why are you calling harry first of all i always like hearing your voice keisha you know that and second on the political beat you probably have direct lines to all of the candidates you know so you can get them to give a quick comment on any issue that comes up in the course of a day right just like yesterday she hesitated before answering trying to get a read on where this was going yes were known to be able to get hold of people when we have to except cantankerous police detectives sometimes they can be a problem bosch smiled there you go he said which brings us to the reason you are calling right i want the number that will get me directly to irvin irving this time the pause was longer harry i cant give you that number it was entrusted to me and if he knows i gave come on entrusted to you and every other reporter covering the campaign and you know it he wouldnt know who gave it to me unless i told him and im not going to tell him you know you can trust me when i say that still i just dont feel comfortable giving it out without his permission if you want me to call him and ask if i can he wont want to talk to me keisha thats the point if he wanted to talk to me i could leave a message at campaign headquarterswhich is where by the way on broxton in westwood i still dont feel comfortable just giving you the number bosch quickly grabbed the daily news which was folded to the page with the political fallout story he read the byline okay well maybe sarah weinman or duane swierczynski will feel comfortable giving it to me they might want to have an iou from somebody whos in the middle of this thing all right bosch all right you dont have to go to them okay i cant believe you i want to talk to irving all right but you dont say where you got the number obviously she gave him the number and he committed it to memory he promised to call her back when there was something relating to the beachwood canyon incident that he could give her look it doesnt have to be political she urged anything to do with the case okay i can still write a cop story if im the one who gets the story got it keisha thanks he closed his phone and left money for the bill and tip on the counter as he stepped out of the restaurant he reopened the phone and punched in the number the reporter had just given him irving answered after six rings without identifying himself irvin irving yes who is this i just wanted to thank you for confirming everything i always thought about you you are nothing but a political opportunist and hack thats what you were in the department and thats what you are out of it is this bosch is this harry bosch who gave you this number one of your own people i guess somebody in your own camp doesnt like the message youre putting out dont worry about it bosch dont worry about a thing when i get in you can start counting the days until you message delivered bosch closed his phone it felt good to have said what he said and to not worry that irving was a superior officer who could say and do whatever he wanted without retribution from those he slighted happy with his response to the newspaper stories bosch got in his car and drove to the hospital on the way down the hallway in icu bosch passed a woman who had just left kiz riders room he recognized her as riders former lover they had met briefly a few years earlier when bosch happened to see rider at the playboy jazz festival at the hollywood bowl he nodded to the woman as she passed but she didnt stop to talk he knocked once on riders door and went in his partner looked much better than she had the day before but still not even close to a hundred percent she was conscious and alert when bosch entered her room and her eyes tracked him to the side of her bed there was no longer a tube in her mouth but the right side of her face drooped and bosch immediately feared that she had suffered a stroke during the night dont worry she said in slow slurred words theyve made my neck numb and its working on half of my face too he squeezed her hand okay he said other than that how do you feel not so good it hurts harry it really hurts he nodded yeah i have surgery on my hand in the afternoon thats going to hurt too but then youll be on the road to recovery rehab and all of that good stuff i hope so she sounded depressed and bosch didnt know what to say fourteen years earlier when he had been about her age bosch had woken up in the hospital after taking a bullet in his left shoulder he still remembered the screaming pain that had set in every time the morphine started to wear off i brought the papers he said you want me to read em to you yeah nothing good i suppose no nothing good he held the times front page up so she could see the mug shot of waits he then read the lead story and then the sidebar when he was finished he looked over at her she looked distressed you okay you shouldve left me harry and gone after him what are you talking about in the woods you couldve gotten him instead you saved me now look at the shit youre in it comes with the territory kiz the only thing i could think about out there was getting you to the hospital i feel really guilty about everything what exactly do you have to feel guilty about a lot when i came out of retirement last year i made you leave the chiefs office and partner with me again you wouldnt have been there yesterday if i oh please would you shut your fucking mouth he didnt remember ever hearing her use such language he did what she told him just shut up she said no more of that what else did you bring me bosch held up the copy of the gesto murder book oh nothing i brought this for me to read if you were asleep or something its the copy of the gesto file i made back when i retired the first time so what are you going to do with that like i said i was just going to read it i keep thinking theres something we missed we me something i missed ive been listening a lot lately to a recording of coltrane and monk playing together at carnegie hall it was right there in the carnegie archives for like fifty years until somebody found it the thing is the guy who found it had to know their sound to know what they had in that box in the archives and that relates to the file how bosch smiled she was in a hospital bed with two bullet wounds and she was still giving him shit i dont know i keep thinking theres something in here and im the only one who can find it good luck why dont you sit on that chair and read your file i think im going to go to sleep for a while okay kiz ill be quiet he pulled the chair away from the wall and brought it closer to the bed as he sat down she spoke again im not coming back harry he looked at her it was not what he wanted to hear but he wouldnt object not now at least whatever you want kiz sheila my old girl was just visiting she saw the news and came in she says shell take care of me until i get better but she doesnt want me going back to the cops which explained why she hadnt wanted to talk to bosch out in the hallway that was always a point of contention with us you know i remember you told me look you dont have to tell me any of this stuff now its not just sheila though its me i shouldnt be a cop i proved that yesterday what are you talking about you are one of the best cops i know he saw a tear roll down her cheek i froze out there harry i fucking froze and i let him just shoot me dont do this to yourself kiz those men are dead because of me when he grabbed olivas i couldnt move i just watched i should have put him down but i just stood there i just stood there and i let him shoot me next instead of raising my gun i raised my hand no kiz you didnt have an angle on him if you had fired you might have hit olivas after that it was too late he hoped she understood that he was telling her what to say when the ois came around no i have to own up to it i kiz you want to quit thats fine ill back you one hundred percent but i wont back you on this other shit you understand she tried to turn her face away from him but the bandages on her neck prevented her from turning okay she said more tears came down and bosch knew that she had wounds that were far deeper than those in her neck and hand you know you should have gone up top she said what are you talking about out there with the ladder if you had been up top instead of me none of this wouldve happened because you wouldnt have hesitated harry you wouldve blown his shit away bosch shook his head nobody knows how theyre going to react in a situation until theyre in that situation i froze look go to sleep kiz get better and then make your decision if you dont come back i will understand but im always going to be your backup kiz no matter what happens and where you go she used her left hand to wipe her face thanks harry she closed her eyes and he watched as she finally gave it up she mumbled something he couldnt understand and then was asleep bosch watched her for a while and thought about not having her as a partner anymore they had worked well together like family he would miss it he didnt want to think about the future right now he opened the murder book and decided to start reading about the past he started from page one the initial crime report a few minutes later he had it covered and was about to turn to the witness reports when his phone began vibrating in his pocket he walked out of the room to answer the call in the hallway it was lieutenant randolph from the officer involved shooting unit sorry were holding you off active while we take our time with this thing he said its all right i know why yeah a lot of pressure what can i do for you lieutenant i was hoping maybe youd take a ride down here to parker center and look at this videotape weve got you have the tape from osheas cameraman there was a pause before randolph answered we have a tape from him yes im not sure its a complete tape and thats what i want you to look at you know tell us what might be missing can you come down ill be there in fortyfive minutes good ill be waiting hows your partner bosch wondered if randolph knew where he was shes still hanging in im at the hospital now but shes still out of it he hoped to delay riders ois interview as long as possible in a few days once she was off the painkillers and clear of mind maybe shed think better of volunteering that she had frozen when waits made his move were waiting to hear when we can interview her randolph said probably be a few days i would think probably anyway see you soon thanks for coming down bosch closed the phone and went back into the room he picked the murder book up off the chair where he had left it and checked on his partner she was asleep he quietly left the room he made good time on the drive in and called rachel to tell her that lunch looked good since he was already going to be downtown they agreed to go fancy and she said she would make a reservation at the water grill for noon he said he would see her there the ois squad was on the third floor at parker center it was at the opposite end of the building from the robberyhomicide division randolph had a private office with video equipment set up on a stand he was sitting behind the desk while osani was working with the equipment and getting ready to play the tape randolph motioned bosch to the only other seat when did you get the tape bosch asked it was delivered this morning corvin said it took him twentyfour hours to remember he had put it in one of those cargo pockets you mentioned this of course came after i had reminded him i had a witness who saw the tape go in the pocket and you think its been doctored well know for sure after i give it to sid but yeah its been edited we found his camera at the crime scene and osani here was bright enough to write down the number on the counter when you roll this tape the counter on the tape doesnt match about two minutes of tape are missing why dont you roll it reggie osani started the tape and bosch watched as it began with the huddle of investigators and techs in the sunset ranch parking lot corvin had stayed close to oshea at all times and there was an uninterrupted flow of raw video footage which seemed to always keep the candidate for district attorney at center this continued as the group followed waits into the woods and until they all stopped at the top of the steep dropoff then it was clear there was a cut where it was to be presumed that corvin had turned the camera off and then back on again there was no discussion on the tape of whether the handcuffs should be removed from waitss wrists the video cut from kiz rider saying they could use the sid ladder to cafarelli returning to the spot with the ladder osani stopped the tape so they could discuss it its likely that he did stop the camera while we were waiting for the ladder bosch said that probably took ten minutes max but he probably didnt stop it until after the back and forth about the cuffs on waits are you sure no im just assuming but i wasnt watching corvin i was watching waits right sorry dont be i dont want you to give me anything that wasnt there did any of the other witnesses back me on this did they say they heard the discussion about uncuffing him cafarelli the sid tech heard it corvin said he didnt and oshea said it never happened so you got two from the lapd saying yes and two from the das office saying no and no tape to back it up either way classic pissing match what about maury swann hed be the tiebreaker except hes not talking to us says it is in his clients best interest to remain mute that didnt surprise bosch coming from a defense lawyer is there another edit you wanted to show me possibly go ahead reggie osani started the video again and it took them through the descent on the ladder and then to the clearing where cafarelli methodically used the probe to mark the location of the body the shot was uninterrupted corvin simply turned the camera on and shot everything probably with the idea that he would edit it later if the tape was ever needed in a court hearing or possibly a campaign documentary the tape continued and documented the groups return to the ladder rider and olivas went up to the top and waits was uncuffed by bosch but as the prisoner started his climb up the ladder the tape cut off just as he reached the upper rungs and olivas was leaning down to grab him thats it bosch asked thats it randolph said i remember after the shooting when i told corvin to leave the camera and come up the ladder to help with kiz he had it on his shoulder he was rolling yeah well we asked about why the tape ended and he claimed that he thought he was going to run short on tape he wanted to keep some for when the diggers came in and excavated the body so he turned the camera off when waits was going up the ladder that make sense to you i dont know you nope i think thats bullshit he had the whole thing on tape thats just an opinion whatever bosch said the question is why cut the tape at this point what was on it you tell me you were there i told you everything i could remember well you better remember more youre not in such good shape here what are you talking about theres no discussion on the tape of whether the man should or shouldnt be cuffed what is on the tape is olivas uncuffing him for the climb down and you uncuffing him for the climb back up bosch realized that randolph was right and that the tape made him look like he had uncuffed waits without even discussing it with the others osheas setting me up i dont know if anyone is setting anyone up let me ask you something when the shit hit the fan out there and waits grabbed the gun and started shooting do you remember seeing oshea at that point bosch shook his head i ended up on the ground with olivas on top of me i was worried about where waits was not oshea i dont know where oshea was all i can tell you is that he wasnt in my picture he was behind me somewhere maybe thats what corvin had on the tape oshea running away like a coward randolphs use of the word coward sparked something in bosch he now remembered from on top of the embankment waits had called someone presumably oshea a coward bosch remembered hearing the sound of running behind him oshea had run bosch thought about this first of all oshea had no weapon with which to protect himself from the man he was going to put in prison for life by all rights running from the gun would not be unexpected or unreasonable it would have been an act of selfpreservation not cowardice but since oshea was a candidate for top prosecutor in the county running away under any circumstances would probably not look so goodespecially if it was on video on the six oclock news i remember now bosch said waits called somebody a coward for running it mustve been oshea mystery solved randolph said bosch turned back to the monitor can we back it up and look at that last part again he asked just before it cuts off i mean osani worked the video and they watched it silently from the moment waits was uncuffed for the second time can you stop it right before the cut bosch asked osani froze the image on the screen it showed waits past the halfway point on the ladder and olivas reaching down to grab him the angle of olivass body had caused his windbreaker to fall open bosch could see his pistol in a pancake holster on his left hip grips out so that he could take the gun with an acrossthebody pull bosch stood up and walked to the monitor he took out a pen and tapped it on the screen you notice that he said it looks like hes got the snap on his holster open randolph and osani studied the screen the safety snap was something they obviously hadnt noticed before couldve been that he wanted to be ready if the prisoner made a move osani said its within regs neither bosch nor randolph responded whether it fell within department regulations or not it was a curiosity that could not be explained since olivas was dead you can turn it off reg randolph finally said no can you show it one more time bosch asked just this part at the ladder randolph nodded to osani and the tape was backed up and replayed bosch tried to use the images on the monitor to build momentum and carry him into his own memory of what happened when waits got to the top he remembered looking up and watching olivas being swung around so that his back was to those below and there was no clear shot at waits he now remembered wondering where kiz was and why she wasnt reacting then there were shots and olivas was falling backwards down the ladder toward him bosch raised his hands to try to lessen the impact on the ground with olivas on top of him he heard more shots and then the yelling the yelling forgotten in all the adrenaline rush and panic waits had come to the precipice and fired down at them and he had yelled he called oshea a coward for running but he had said more than just that run you coward hows your bullshit deal looking now bosch had forgotten the taunt in the commotion and confusion of the shooting escape and effort to save kiz rider in the charge of fear that came with those moments what did that mean what was waits saying by calling the agreement a bullshit deal what is it randolph asked bosch looked at him coming out of his thoughts nothing i was just trying to concentrate on what happened during the moments where theres no tape it looked like you remembered something i just remembered how close i came to getting killed like olivas and doolan olivas landed on me he ended up shielding me randolph nodded bosch wanted to get out of there he wanted to take his discoveryhows your bullshit deal looking nowand work it he wanted to grind it down to a powder and analyze it under the microscope lieutenant you have anything else for me right now not right now then im going to go call me if you need me you call me when you remember what you cant remember he gave bosch a knowing look bosch looked away right bosch left the ois office and went out to the elevator lobby he should have left the building then but instead he pushed the button to go up remembering what waits had yelled changed things to bosch it meant something had been going on up there in beachwood canyon and it was something hed had no clue about his first thought now was to retreat and consider everything before making a move but the appointment at ois had given him a reason to be in parker center and he planned to make the most of it before leaving he entered room the offices of the openunsolved unit and headed toward the alcove where his desk was located the squad room was almost vacant he checked the workstation shared by marcia and jackson and saw that they were out bosch had to walk by the open door of abel pratts office to get to his own workstation so he decided to be upfront he stuck his head in the door and saw his boss ensconced at his desk he was eating raisins out of a little red box that looked like it was meant for a child he looked surprised to see bosch harry what are you doing here he asked ois called me down to look at the video osheas guy took of the beachwood field trip hes got the shooting on it not quite he claimed the camera was off pratts eyebrows arched randolph doesnt believe him hard to tell the guy sat on the tape until this morning and it looks like it might have been altered randolphs going to have sid check it anyway listen i thought that while i was here i would take a bunch of files and stuff back to archives so its not all lying around kiz had some files out too and it will be a while before she gets back to them thats probably a good idea bosch nodded hey pratt said his mouth full of raisins i just heard from tim and rick theyre leaving mission right now the autopsy was this morning and they got the id marie gesto confirmed they got it on the dental bosch nodded again as he considered the finality of this news the search for marie gesto was over i guess thats it then they said you were going to make the nextofkin call on it you wanted to do it yeah but ill probably wait until tonight when dan gesto comes home from work itll be better if both parents are together however you want to handle it well keep the lid on it from this end ill call the me and tell them not to put it out until tomorrow thanks did tim or rick tell you if they got a cause of death looks like manual strangulation hyoid was fractured he touched the front of his neck in case bosch didnt remember where the fragile hyoid bone was located bosch had only worked about a hundred strangulation cases in his time but he didnt bother saying anything sorry harry i know youre close to this one when you started pulling the file every couple of months i knew it meant something to you bosch nodded more to himself than to pratt he went to his desk thinking about the confirmation of the bodys identification and remembering how thirteen years earlier he had been all but convinced that marie gesto would never be found it was always strange how things turned out he started gathering all the files associated with the waits investigation marcia and jackson had the gesto murder book but this didnt bother bosch because he had his own copy in his car he walked around to his partners desk to gather the files she had on daniel fitzpatrick the hollywood pawnbroker waits said he murdered during the riots and saw two plastic cartons on the floor he opened one and found it contained the pawn records salvaged from the burnedout pawnshop bosch remembered rider mentioning these the musty smell of the oncewet documents hit him and he quickly snapped the top back on the carton he decided he would take these as well but it would mean two trips past pratts open door to get everything down to his car and that would give his boss two opportunities to become curious about what bosch was really up to bosch was considering leaving the cartons behind when he got lucky pratt stepped out of his office and looked over at him i dont know who decided raisins are a good snack food he said im still hungry you want anything from downstairs harry a doughnut or something no thanks im fine im going to take this stuff over and then get out of here bosch noticed that pratt was holding one of the guidebooks usually stacked on his desk it said west indies on the cover doing some research he asked yeah checking things out you ever heard of a place called nevis uhuh bosch had heard of few of the places pratt asked about during his researches says here you can buy an old sugar mill on eight acres for less than four hundred shit ill clear more than that on my house alone it was probably true bosch had never been to pratts home but knew that he owned a property up in sun valley that was big enough to keep a couple horses on hed lived there nearly twenty years and was sitting on a gold mine in realestate value there was only one problem though a few weeks earlier rider had been at her desk and had overheard pratt on the phone in his office asking questions about child custody and communal property she told bosch about the call and they both assumed that pratt had been talking to a divorce lawyer you want to make sugar bosch asked no man its just what the property was used for at one time now youd probably buy it fix it up and make it a bedandbreakfast or something bosch just nodded pratt was moving into a world he knew and cared nothing about anyway pratt said sensing he didnt have an audience ill see you and by the way its nice that you got dressed up for the ois most guys on home duty wouldve slogged in here in jeans and a tshirt looking more like a suspect than a cop yeah no problem pratt left the office and bosch waited thirty seconds for him to get the elevator he then put a stack of files on one of the evidence cartons and carried it all out the door he was able to take it down and out to his car and get back before pratt returned from the cafeteria he then took the second carton and left no one questioned what he was doing or where he was going with the materials after pulling out of the pay lot bosch checked his watch and saw that he had less than an hour to kill before he was supposed to meet rachel for lunch it wasnt enough time to drive home drop the documents and come backbesides that would be a waste of time and gas he thought about canceling the lunch so he could go home right away and get going on the review of the records but he decided against it because he knew rachel would be a good sounding board and might even have some ideas about what waits had meant when he yelled during the shooting he could also get to the restaurant early and start his review while waiting at the table for rachel but he knew that might cause a problem if a customer or waiter happened to catch a glimpse of some of the photos in the murder books the citys main library was located in the same block as the restaurant and he decided he would go there he could do some file work in one of the private cubicles and then meet rachel on time at the restaurant after parking in the garage beneath the library he carried the murder books from the gesto and fitzpatrick cases with him onto the elevator once inside the confines of the sprawling library he found an open cubicle in a reference room and set to work reviewing the documents he had brought since he had begun rereading the gesto files in riders hospital room he decided to stick with them and finish his review moving through the book in the order the documents and reports were filed he didnt reach the investigative chronologyusually filed at the back of a murder bookuntil the end he casually read through the forms and nothing about the investigative moves made the subjects interviewed or the calls received hit him as any more important than when they had been originally added to the chrono then suddenly he was struck by what he had not seen in the chronology he quickly flipped pages backwards until he came to the for september and looked for the entry on the call jerry edgar had taken from robert saxon it wasnt there bosch leaned forward to read the document more clearly this made no sense in the official murder book the entry was there raynard waitss alias robert saxon the entry date was september and the time of the call was pm olivas had found it during his review of the case and the next day in osheas office bosch had seen it clear as day he had studied it knowing that it was confirmation of an error that allowed waits another thirteen years of freedom to kill but the entry was not in boschs copy of the murder book what the hell at first bosch couldnt put it together the copy of the chronology in front of him was made four years earlier when bosch had decided to retire he had secretly copied murder books from a handful of open cases that still gnawed at his insides they were his retirement cases his plan had been to work them on his own and at his leisure to solve them before he could finally let the mission go and sit on a beach in mexico with a fishing pole in one hand and a corona in the other but it didnt work out that way bosch learned that the mission was best served with a badge and he came back to the job after he was assigned with rider to the openunsolved unit one of the first murder books he pulled out of archives was the gesto case the book he pulled was the live record the investigative file that was updated each time he or anybody else worked it what he had in front of him was a copy that had sat on a shelf in his closet and had not been updated in four years even so how could one have a notation entered on a form in while the other one didnt the logic of it dictated only one answer the official record of the investigation had been tampered with the notation entering the name robert saxon into the murder book was added after bosch had made his copy of the book that of course left a fouryear window during which the false notation could have been added but common sense told bosch he was dealing with days not years just a few days earlier freddy olivas had called him looking for the murder book olivas took possession of the book and then became the one who discovered the robert saxon entry it was olivas who had brought it to light bosch flipped through the chronology almost all of the pages corresponding with the dates of the initial investigation were filled in completely with timemarked notations only the page marked september had space at the bottom this would have allowed olivas to remove the page from the binder type in the saxon entry and then return it to its place setting the stage for his supposed discovery of this link between waits and gesto back in bosch and edgar did the s on a typewriter in the hollywood squad room it was all done on computer now but there were still plenty of typewriters around most squad rooms for the oldschool copslike boschwho couldnt quite grasp the idea of working on a computer bosch felt a heavy mixture of relief and anger start to overtake him the burden of guilt over the mistake he and edgar had supposedly made was lifting they were in the clear and he needed to tell edgar as soon as he could but bosch couldnt embrace the feelingnot yetbecause of the growing rage he felt at being victimized by olivas he stood up and walked away from the cubicle he stepped out of the reference room and into the librarys main rotunda where a circular mosaic high up on the walls told the story of the citys founding bosch felt like yelling something exorcising the demon but he kept quiet a security guard walked quickly across the floor of the cavernous structure maybe on his way to put the collar on a book thief or a flasher in the stacks bosch watched him go and then went back to his own work back in the cubicle he tried to think through what had happened olivas had tampered with the murder book typing a twoline entry into the chronology that would make bosch believe he had made a profound mistake in the early stages of the investigation the entry said that robert saxon had called to report seeing marie gesto at the mayfair supermarket on the afternoon she had disappeared that was all it wasnt the content of the call that was important to olivas it was the caller olivas had wanted to somehow get raynard waits into the murder book why to put bosch on some sort of a guilt trip that would allow olivas the upper hand and control of the current investigation bosch dismissed this olivas already had the upper hand and control he was lead investigator in the waits case and boschs proprietary hold on the gesto case would not change that bosch was along for the ride yes but he wasnt steering the car olivas was steering and therefore the robert saxon name plant was not necessary there had to be another reason bosch worked it over for a while but only came to the weak conclusion that olivas needed to connect waits to gesto by putting the killers alias into the book he was going back thirteen years in time and firmly tying raynard waits to marie gesto but waits was about to admit he murdered gesto there could be no stronger tie than an uncoerced confession he was even going to lead authorities to the body the notation in the chronology would be a minor connection compared with these two so then why put it in ultimately bosch was confounded by the risk olivas had taken he had tampered with the official record of the murder investigation for seemingly little reason or gain he had run the risk that bosch would discover the deceit and call him on it he had run the risk of the deceit possibly being revealed by a smart lawyer like maury swann in court one day and he did all of this knowing that he didnt have to knowing that waits would be tied solidly into the case with a confession now olivas was dead and could not be confronted there was no one to answer why except maybe raynard waits hows your bullshit deal looking now and maybe rick oshea bosch thought about everything and all in a moment it came together bosch suddenly knew why olivas had taken the risk and put the specter of raynard waits into the marie gesto murder book he saw it with a clarity that left him no room for doubt raynard waits didnt kill marie gesto he jumped up and started gathering the files together clutching them with both hands he hurried through the rotunda toward the exit his footfalls echoed behind him in the great room like a crowd of people chasing him he looked back but there was nobody there bosch had lost track of time while in the library he was late rachel was already seated and waiting for him she was holding a large onesheet menu that obscured the look of annoyance on her face as bosch was led to the table by a waiter sorry bosch said as he sat down its okay she replied but i already ordered for myself i didnt know if you were going to show or not she handed the menu across to him he immediately handed it to the waiter ill have what shes having he said and just the water is fine he drank from the glass already poured for him while the waiter hurried away rachel smiled at him but not in a nice way youre not going to like it youd better call him back why i like seafood because i ordered the sashimi you told me the other night that you like your seafood cooked the news gave him momentary pause but he decided he deserved to pay for his mistake of arriving late it all goes to the same place he said dismissing the issue but why do they call this place the water grill if theyre not grilling the food good question forget about it we need to talk i need your help rachel with what whats wrong i dont think raynard waits killed marie gesto what do you mean he led you to her body are you saying that wasnt marie gesto no id was confirmed today at the autopsy it was definitely marie gesto in that grave and waits was the one who led you to it right right and waits was the one who confessed to killing her right right at autopsy was the cause of death in agreement with that confession yeah from what i hear it was then harry youre not making sense with all of that how can he not be the killer because something is going on that we dont know about that i dont know about olivas and oshea had some sort of play going with him im not sure what it was but it all went to shit in beachwood canyon she held up her hands in a holditrightthere gesture why dont you start at the beginning only tell me facts no theory no conjecture just give me what youve got he told her everything starting with the tampering with the murder book by olivas and concluding with the detailbydetail accounting of what had happened when waits started to climb up the ladder in beachwood canyon he told her what waits had yelled at oshea and what had been edited out of the field trip video it took him fifteen minutes and during that time their lunch was served of course it came fast bosch thought it didnt have to be cooked he felt lucky to be the one doing all the talking it gave him a ready excuse not to eat the raw fish put down in front of him by the time he was finished recounting the story he could see that rachels mind had gone to work on everything she was grinding it down putting waits in the murder book doesnt make sense she said it connects him to the case yes but he is already connected through his confession and his leading you to the body so why bother with the murder book bosch leaned across the table to respond two things one olivas thought he might need to sell the confession he had no idea if id be able to punch holes in it so he wanted some insurance he put waits in the file and it put me in a position of being preconditioned to believe the confession okay and two this is where it gets tricky he said putting waits in the book was a way of preconditioning me but it was also about knocking me off my game she looked at him but what he was saying didnt register youd better explain that this is where we go off the known facts and talk about what the facts might mean theory conjecture whatever you want to call it olivas put that line in the chronology and then threw it in my face he knew that if i saw it and believed it then i would believe that my partner and i had horribly messed up back in ninetythree that i would believe people were dead because of our mistake the weight of all those women waits killed since then would be on me okay and it would connect me with waits on an emotional level of pure hate yes ive wanted the guy who killed marie gesto for thirteen years but adding in all those other women and putting their deaths on me would bring things to a raw edge when i finally came facetoface with the guy it would distract me from what from the fact that waits didnt kill her he was confessing to killing marie gesto but he didnt kill her he made some sort of deal with olivas and probably oshea to take the fall for it because he was already going down for all the others i was so overcome with my hatred that i didnt have my eyes on the prize i wasnt paying attention to the details rachel all i wanted to do was jump across the table and choke the guy out you are forgetting something what now she leaned across the table keeping her voice down so as not to disturb the other diners he led you to her body if he didnt kill her how did he know where to go in the woods how did he lead you right to her bosch nodded it was a good point but one he had already thought about it could have been done he could have been schooled in his cell by olivas it couldve been a hansel and gretel trick a trail marked in such a way that only he would notice the markers im going back up to beachwood this afternoon my guess is that when i go through there this time ill find the markers bosch reached over and took her empty plate and exchanged it with his untouched plate she didnt object so youre saying that the whole field trip was a setup to convince you she said that waits was fed the basic information about the marie gesto murder and he just regurgitated it all in the confession then happily led you like little red riding hood through the woods to the spot where she was buried he nodded yeah thats what i am saying when you boil it all down to that it sounds a little farfetched i know but more than a little what more than a little farfetched first of all how did olivas know the details to give waits how did he know where she was buried so he could mark a trail for waits to follow are you saying olivas killed marie gesto bosch shook his head emphatically he thought she was going over the top with her devils advocate logic and he was getting annoyed no im not saying that olivas was the killer i am saying he was gotten to by the killer he and oshea the real killer came to them and made some sort of a deal harry this just sounds so she didnt finish she pushed the sashimi on her plate around with her chopsticks but ate very little of it the waiter used the moment to approach the table you didnt like your sashimi he said to her in a trembling voice no i she stopped when she realized she had almost a full portion on the plate in front of her i guess i wasnt very hungry she doesnt know what shes missing bosch said smiling i thought it was great the waiter took the plates off the table and said he would be back with dessert menus i thought it was great walling said in a mocking voice you jerk sorry the waiter brought the dessert menus and they both handed them back and ordered coffee walling remained quiet after that and bosch decided to wait her out why now she finally asked bosch shook his head i dont know exactly when was the last time you pulled the case and actively worked it about five months ago the last video i showed you the other nightthat was the last time i worked it i was just about to make another run at it what did you do besides pull garland in again everything i talked to everybody i knocked on all the same doors again i only brought garland in at the end you think it was garland who got to olivas for olivas and maybe oshea to make a deal it would have had to be somebody with juice lots of money and power the garlands have both the waiter came with their coffee and the check bosch put a credit card on it but the waiter had already left you want to at least split it rachel asked you didnt even eat its okay hearing what you have to say makes it worth it i bet you say that to all the girls only the ones who are federal agents she shook her head he saw the doubt creep back into her eyes what i dont know its just just what what if you look at it from waitss view of things and its such a long shot harry its like one of those mumbojumbo conspiracies you take all the facts after its over and move them around to fit some farfetched theory marilyn monroe didnt overdose the kennedys used the mob to kill her like that so what about waitss point of view im just saying why would he do it why would he confess to a murder he didnt commit bosch made a dismissive gesture with his hands as if he were pushing something away thats an easy one rachel he would do it because he had nothing to lose he was already going down as the echo park bagman if he went to trial he was no doubt going to get the jesus juice just like olivas reminded him out there yesterday so his only shot at living was to confess to his crimes and if say the investigator and the prosecutor wanted him to add another killing in for good measure what was waits going to say about that no deal dont kid yourself they had the leverage and if they told waits to jump he wouldve nodded his head and said on who she nodded and there was something else bosch added he knew there would be a field trip and ill bet that gave him hope he knew he might get a shot at an escape once they told him that hed be leading us through the woods that shot got a little bigger and no doubt his cooperation got a little better his whole motivation was probably getting to the field trip she nodded again he couldnt tell whether he had convinced her of anything they were silent for a long moment the waiter came and took his credit card lunch was over so what are you going to do she asked like i told you next stop beachwood canyon after that im going to find the man who can explain everything to me oshea hell never talk to you i know thats why im not going to talk to him not yet at least youre going to find waits he could hear the doubt in her voice thats right hes long gone harry you think he would stay around here he killed two cops his life expectancy in la is zero you think hed stick around with every person with a gun and badge in this county looking for him with a license to kill he nodded slowly hes still here he said with conviction everything you said is right except you forgot one thing hes got the leverage now when he escaped the leverage shifted to waits and if he is smart and it appears he is hell use it hell stick around and hell use oshea to maximum potential you mean blackmail whatever waits carries the truth he knows what went down if he can make it believable that hes a danger to oshea and his whole election machine and if he can contact oshea he can now make the candidate do the jumping she nodded you raise a good point about leverage she said what if this grand conspiracy of yours had gone down as planned you know waits takes the fall for gesto and all the others and heads off to pelican bay or san quentin to do his life without then the conspirators have this guy sitting in a cell and he has all the answersand the leverage hes still a danger to oshea and his whole political machine why would the future district attorney of los angeles county put himself in that position the waiter brought back the credit card and the final bill bosch added a tip and signed it it had to be the most expensive lunch he had never eaten he looked up at rachel when he was finished scribbling his name good question rachel i dont know the exact answer to it but i assume oshea or olivas or somebody had a plan for an endgame and maybe thats why waits decided to run she frowned you cant be talked out of this can you not yet well good luck i think you are going to need it thanks rachel he stood up and so did she did you valet she asked no im over in the library garage it meant they would leave the restaurant by different doors will i see you tonight he asked if im not held up theres word of a case coming our way from washington headquarters how about if i call you he said that was fine and walked with her to the door that led to the garage where the valets waited he hugged her there and said goodbye on the way out of downtown bosch took hill street up to caesar chavez and turned left it soon became sunset boulevard and he drove it through echo park he wasnt expecting to see raynard waits crossing at the light or coming out of a medicina clinic or one of the migra offices that lined the street but bosch was running way out on his instincts on this case and they told him echo park was still in play the more he drove through the more he would get a feel for the neighborhood and the better he would be at his search instincts or not he was sure of one thing waits had originally been arrested while on his way to a specific destination in echo park bosch was going to find it he pulled into a noparking zone near quintero street and walked up to the pescado mojado grill he ordered camarones a la diabla and showed the booking photo of waits to the man who took his order and to the patrons waiting in line he got the usual shake of the head from each customer and the spanish conversation among them died off bosch took his shrimp plate to a table and finished his food quickly from echo park he drove home to change from his suit into jeans and a pullover shirt then he drove over to beachwood canyon and made his way to the top of the hill the parking clearing below sunset ranch was empty and bosch wondered if all the activity and media attention from the day before had kept riders away he got out of his car and went to its trunk he pulled out a coiled thirtyfoot length of rope and headed into the brush on the same path he had taken behind waits the day before he was only a few steps down the path when his cell phone started vibrating he stopped dug the phone out of his blue jeans and saw on the screen that it was jerry edgar calling bosch had left him a message earlier while driving home hows kiz doing better you ought to go visit her man get over whatever it is you two need to get over and visit her you didnt even call yesterday dont worry i will in fact i was thinking about cutting out of here early and dropping by you going to be there i might give me a call when youre going and ill try to meet you anyway thats not really why i called theres a couple things i wanted to tell you first they got a confirmation on the id at the autopsy today it was marie gesto edgar was silent a moment before responding have you talked to her parents no not yet dans got that job selling tractors i was going to call up there tonight when hes home and theyre together thats what id do what else you got harry i got a guy in a room here and im about to go in and break his ass down on a murderrape were working sorry to interrupt i thought you called me i did man but i was calling you back real quick in case it was important it is important i thought youd want to know i think that line that was found in the fiftyones on this case was phonied i think when it all shakes out well be clear on it this time there was no hesitation in his old partners response what are you saying waits never called us back then thats right then howd that entry get in the chrono somebody added it recently somebody trying to fuck with me goddamn it bosch could hear the anger and relief in edgars voice i havent slept since you called me up and told me that shit harry they didnt only fuck with you man thats what i figured thats why i called i havent figured it all out but thats the way its looking when i get the whole story ill let you know now go back to your interview and nail that guy harry my man you just made my day im going to go into the room and crunch this assholes bones im glad to hear that call me if youre going to see kiz you got it but bosch knew edgar was just paying lip service to the idea he wouldnt be visiting kiz not if he was in the middle of a breaking case like he said after closing and pocketing the phone bosch looked around and took in his surroundings he looked high and low from the ground to the overhead canopy and didnt see any obvious markings he guessed that there wouldve been no need for a hansel and gretel trail while waits had been on the clearly defined path if there were markers they would be at the bottom of the mud slide embankment he headed that way at the top of the precipice he looped the rope around the trunk of the white oak at the top and was able to rappel down the sheer surface to the lower level he left the rope in place and once again assessed the area from floor to canopy he saw nothing that readily marked the way to the grave site where marie gesto had been found he started walking toward the grave site looking for carvings in the trunks of the trees ribbons in the branches anything that waits might have used to lead the way bosch got to the grave site without seeing a single indication of a marked trail he was disappointed his lack of findings went against the theory he had outlined for rachel walling but bosch was sure he was right in his thinking and he refused to believe there was no trail he thought it was possible that whatever markings had been there had been trampled over and obliterated by the army of investigators and technicians who had descended on the woods the day before refusing to give up he made his way back to the embankment and then turned and looked toward the grave site he tried to put his mind into the position waits was in he had never been to the spot before yet he had to readily choose a direction to go in while everyone else watched how did he do it bosch stood motionless thinking and looking off into the woods in the direction of the grave site he did not move for five minutes after that he had the answer in the middle distance on the sight line to the grave site was a tall eucalyptus tree it was split at ground level and two fully mature trunks rose at least fifty feet through the canopy of other trees in the split about ten feet off the ground was a branch that had fallen and become lodged horizontally between the trunks the formation of split trunk and branch created an inverted a that was clearly recognizable and could have been noticed quickly by someone scanning the woods and looking specifically for it bosch headed toward the eucalyptus certain that he had the first marker that waits had followed when he reached the position he looked again in the direction of the grave site he slowly scanned until he again picked up on an anomaly that was obvious and unique in terms of the immediate vicinity he walked toward it it was a young california oak what made it noticeable to bosch from a distance was that its natural balance was off it had lost the symmetrical spread of its branches because one of the lower limbs was missing bosch walked to it and looked up at a broken outcropping on the trunk where a fourinchthick limb had been attached about eight feet up by grabbing a lower branch and pulling himself up into the tree he was able to examine the break more closely and found that it was not a natural break the outcropping showed a smooth cut through the top half of the branch someone had sawed across the top of the branch and then pulled down on it to break it bosch was no tree surgeon but he thought the cut and break looked recent the exposed inner wood was light in color and there was no indication of regrowth or natural repair bosch dropped to the ground and looked around in the brush the fallen limb was nowhere to be found it had been dragged away so as not to be noticed and cause suspicion to him it was further proof that a hansel and gretel trail had been left for waits to follow he turned and looked in the direction of the final clearing he was less than twenty yards from the grave site and he was easily able to pick out what he believed to be the last marker high up in the oak tree that shaded the grave site was a nest that looked like the home of a large bird an owl or a hawk he walked to the clearing and looked up the hair scrunchy waits had said marked the spot had been removed by the forensics team looking further up into the tree bosch could not see the nest from directly beneath olivas had planned it well he had used three markers recognizable only from a distance nothing that would draw a second glance from those following waits yet three markers that could easily lead him to the grave site as his eyes dropped to the open grave at his feet he remembered that he had noticed a disturbance in the soil the day before he had credited it to animals foraging in the dirt now he believed the disturbance had been left by the first digging into the soil to confirm the grave site olivas had been out here before any of them he had come out to mark the trail and confirm the grave he had either been told where to find it or had been led to it by the real killer bosch had been staring at the grave and putting the scenario together for several seconds before he realized he was hearing voices at least two men in conversation their voices approaching bosch could hear them moving through the brush their footfalls heavy in the mud and on the bed of fallen leaves they were coming from the same direction bosch had come from he moved quickly across the small clearing and got behind the massive trunk of the oak tree he waited and soon he could tell that the men had reached the clearing right here said the first voice she was right here for thirteen years no shit this is spooky bosch didnt dare look around the tree and risk exposing himself no matter who it wasmedia cops or even touristshe didnt want to be seen here the two men stayed in the clearing and batted meaningless conversation back and forth for a few moments luckily neither approached the trunk of the oak and boschs position then finally bosch heard the first voice say well lets go get this done and get out of here the men trod off in the direction from which they had come bosch looked around the tree and caught a glimpse of them just before they disappeared back into the brush he saw osani and another man he assumed was also from the ois unit after giving them a head start bosch moved from around the tree and crossed the clearing he took a position behind an old eucalyptus and watched as the ois men walked back to the sheer facing left by the mud slide osani and his partner made so much noise walking through the brush that it was quite easy for bosch to pick and move his way toward the embankment as well under cover of their noise he got to the eucalyptus that was waitss first marker and watched the two men as they set up to take measurements from the bottom of the embankment to the top there was a ladder on the facing now positioned much like the ladder had been the day before bosch realized that the two men were cleaning up the official report they were taking distance measurements that had either been forgotten or deemed unnecessary the day before today in light of the political fallout involved everything was necessary osani climbed the ladder to the top while his partner remained below he then took a tape measure off his belt and pulled out several lengths passing the end down to his partner they took measurements with osani calling out the lengths and his partner writing them down in a notebook it looked to bosch as though they were measuring various lengths from the spot on the ground where he had been the day before to the positions where waits olivas and rider had been bosch had no idea what the importance of such measurements would be to the investigation boschs phone started to vibrate in his pocket and he quickly pulled it out and shut it off as the screen died he saw that the incoming number had a prefix which he knew meant parker center a few seconds later bosch heard the ringing of a cell phone in the clearing where osani and the other man were working bosch peeked around the tree and saw osani take a phone off his belt he listened to the caller and then took a sweeping look around the woods doing a degree turn bosch ducked back no lieutenant osani said we dont see him the cars in the lot but we dont see him we dont see anybody out here osani listened some more and said yes several times before closing the phone and returning it to his belt he went back to work with the tape measure and within another minute or so the two ois men had what they needed osanis partner climbed the ladder and then both men pulled it up the embankment it was at that moment that osani noticed the rope looped around the trunk of the white oak at the edge of the embankment he put the ladder down on the ground and went to the tree he pulled the rope from around the trunk and started coiling it he looked out into the woods as he did this and bosch moved back behind one of the eucalyptuss two trunks a few minutes later they were gone loudly trudging back through the woods to the parking clearing the ladder carried between them bosch went to the embankment but waited until he could no longer hear the ois men before using the roots as handholds to climb up when he got to the parking clearing there was no sign of osani and his partner bosch turned his phone back on and waited for it to boot up he wanted to see if the caller from parker center had left a message before he could listen the phone started vibrating in his hand he recognized the number as one of the lines from the openunsolved unit he took the call this is bosch harry where are you it was abel pratt there was an urgency in his voice nowhere why where are you something told bosch that pratt knew exactly where he was im in beachwood canyon whats going on there was a moment of silence before pratt responded the urgent tone replaced with one of annoyance whats going on is that i just got a call from lieutenant randolph at ois he says theres a mustang registered to you sitting in the lot up there i tell him thats really strange because harry bosch is on home duty and is supposed to be staying a million miles away from the investigation in beachwood canyon thinking quickly bosch came up with what he thought was a way out look im not investigating anything im looking for something i lost my challenge coin out here yesterday im just looking for it what my rhd chip it mustve come out of my pocket when i was sliding down the embankment or something i got home last night and it wasnt in my pocket as he spoke bosch reached into his pocket and pulled out the coin he was claiming to have lost it was a heavy metal coin about the size and width of a casino chip one side showed a gold detectives badge and the other side showed the caricature of a detectivesuit hat gun and exaggerated chinset against an american flag background it was known as a challenge coin or chip and was a carryover from the practice of elite and specialized military units upon acceptance into the unit a soldier is given a challenge coin and is expected to carry it always at any time or place a fellow unit member can ask to see the coin this most often takes place in a bar or canteen if the soldier fails to be carrying the coin then he picks up the tab the tradition had been observed for several years in the rhd bosch had been given his coin upon returning from retirement fuck the coin harry pratt said angrily you can replace it for ten bucks stay away from the investigation go home and stay home until you hear from me am i clear youre clear besides what the fuck if you lost your coin out there the forensics people would have found it already they went over that scene with a metal detector looking for cartridges bosch nodded yeah i sort of forgot about that yeah harry you forgot are you bullshitting with me no top im not i forgot i was bored and decided to come look for it i saw randolphs people and decided to keep my head down i just didnt think theyd call in my plate well they did and then i got the call i dont like blowback like this harry you know that im going home right now good stay there pratt didnt wait for boschs response he clicked off and bosch closed his phone he flipped the heavy coin into the air caught it in his palm badge side up and pocketed it he then walked to his car something about being told to go home made bosch not go home after leaving beachwood canyon he made a stop at st joes to check in on kiz rider she had changed locations again she was now out of icu and on a regular patient floor she didnt have a private room but the other bed in the room was empty they often did that for cops speaking was still difficult for her and the malaise of depression she exhibited that morning had not lifted bosch didnt stay long he passed on a getwell from jerry edgar and then left finally going home as instructed and hauling in the two cartons and files he had collected earlier from the openunsolved unit he put the cartons on the floor in the dining room and spread the files out on the table there was a lot and he knew he could probably occupy himself for at least a couple days with what he had taken from the office he went over to the stereo and turned it on he knew that he already had the coltranemonk collaboration from carnegie hall in the machine the player was on shuffle and the first song out was called evidence bosch took that as a good sign as he went back to the table to begin he had to take an inventory of exactly what he had so he could decide how to approach his review of the material first and foremost was the copy of the investigative record in the current case raynard waits was being prosecuted for this had been turned over by olivas but not studied closely by bosch and rider because their assignments and priorities were the fitzpatrick and gesto cases on the table bosch also had the fitzpatrick murder book rider had pulled out of archives as well as his secret copy of the gesto murder book of which he had already completed a review finally on the floor were the two plastic cartons containing whatever pawn records had been salvaged after fitzpatricks business was torched and then soaked by fire hoses during the riots there was a small drawer in the side of the dining room table bosch figured that it had been designed for silverware but since he used the table more often to work on than to eat on the drawer contained an assortment of pens and legal pads he withdrew one of each deciding that he needed to write down the important aspects of the current investigation after twenty minutes and three tornoff and crumpled pages his freeform thoughts had filled less than half a page arrest echo park escape red line who is waits where is the castle destination echo park beachwood canyonsetup false confession who benefits why now bosch studied the notes for a few moments he knew that the last two questions he had written were actually the starting point if things had gone according to plan who would have benefited from waitss false confession waits for one by avoiding a death sentence but the real winner was the real killer the case would have been closed all investigations halted the real killer would escape justice bosch looked at the two questions again who benefits why now he considered them carefully and then reversed their order and considered them again he came to a single conclusion his continued investigations of the marie gesto case had created a need for something to be done now he had to believe that he had knocked too hard on someones door and that the entire beachwood canyon plan had come about because of pressure he was continuing to exert on the case this conclusion led to the answer to the other question at the bottom of the sheet who benefits bosch wrote anthony garlandhancock park for thirteen years boschs instinct had told him garland was the one but beyond his instincts there was no evidence directly connecting garland to the murder bosch had not yet been made privy to the evidence if any that was developed during the excavation of the body and the autopsy but he doubted that after thirteen years there would be anything usableno dna or forensics that could tie the killer to the body garland was a suspect under the replacement victim theory that is his rage toward the woman who had dropped him led him to kill a woman who reminded him of her the shrinks would call it a longshot theory but bosch now moved it front and center do the math he thought garland was the son of thomas rex garland wealthy oil baron from hancock park oshea was in a highly contested election battle and money was the gasoline that kept a campaign engine running it was not inconceivable that a quiet approach had been made to t rex a deal struck and a plan enacted oshea gets the money he needs to win the election olivas gets the head investigator nod in osheas office and waits takes the fall for gesto while garland takes a ride on it it was said that la was a sunny place for shady people bosch knew that better than most he had no hesitation in believing olivas had been part of such a scheme and the thought of oshea a career prosecutor selling his soul for a shot at the top slot didnt give him pause for very long either run you coward hows your bullshit deal looking now he opened his phone and called keisha russell at the times after several rings he checked his watch and saw it was a few minutes after five he realized she was probably on deadline and ignoring her calls he left a message at the prompt asking her to call back since it was so late in the day bosch decided he had earned a beer he went to the kitchen and got an anchor steam out of the box he was happy he had gone high end the last time he bought beer he took the bottle out on the deck and watched as the heart of rush hour gripped the freeway below the traffic slowed to a crawl and the incessant sound of car horns of every variety began it was just far enough away to be less than intrusive bosch was glad he was not down there in the fight his phone buzzed and he pulled it out of his pocket it was keisha russell calling back sorry i was going over tomorrows story with the copyeditor i hope you spelled my name right actually youre not in this one harry surprise glad to hear it what can you do for me uh i was actually going to ask you to do something for me of course you were what could it be youre a political reporter now right does that mean you look at campaign contributions i do i review every filing by every one of my candidates why he walked back inside and muted the stereo this is off the record keisha id like to know who has been supporting rick osheas campaign oshea why ill tell you when i can tell you i just need the information right now why do you always do this to me harry it was true they had danced like this many times in the past but their history was that bosch was always true to his word when he said he would tell her when he could tell her he hadnt doublecrossed her once and so her protests were banter a mere prequel to her doing what bosch wanted her to do that was part of the dance as well you know why he said playing his part just help me out and there will be something for you when the time is right someday i want to decide when the time is right hold on she clicked off and was gone for almost a minute as he waited bosch stood over the spread of documents on the dining room table he knew that he was spinning his wheels with this angle on oshea and garland they could not be touched at the moment they were guarded by money and the law and the rules of evidence bosch knew the correct angle of investigation was to go at raynard waits his job was to find him and break open the case okay russell said after getting back on the line i have the most uptodate filing what do you want to know how uptodate is uptodate this was filed last week friday who are his main contributors theres nobody who is really big if that is what you mean hes mostly running a grassroots campaign most of his contributors are fellow lawyers almost all of them bosch thought of the century city law firm that handled things for the garland family and had gotten the court orders preventing bosch from questioning anthony garland about marie gesto without an attorney present the head of the firm was cecil dobbs is one of those lawyers cecil dobbs um yes c c dobbs century city address he gave a thousand bosch remembered the lawyer in his collection of videotaped interviews with anthony garland what about dennis franks franks yes a lot of people from that firm contributed what do you mean well according to election law you give your home and work address when you make a contribution dobbs and franks have a century city work address and lets see nine ten eleven other people gave the same address they each gave a thousand too its probably all the lawyers in the same firm so thirteen thousand dollars from there is that it thats it from there yes bosch thought about whether to specifically ask if the name garland was on the contributors list he didnt want her making phone calls or snooping around in his investigation no big corporate contributors nothing of major consequence why dont you tell me what you are looking for harry you can trust me he decided to go for it you have to hold on to it until you hear from me no phone calls no inquiries you just sit on this right right until i hear from you garland thomas rex garland anthony garland anybody like that on there mmmm no isnt anthony garland the kid you were looking at once for marie gesto bosch almost cursed out loud he was hoping she wouldnt make the connection a decade earlier when she was a hellion on the cop beat she had come across a search warrant application he had filed in an effort to search anthony garlands home the application had been rejected for lack of probable cause but the filing was public record and at the time russell the ever industrious reporter routinely combed through the search warrants at the courthouse bosch had talked her out of writing a story identifying the scion of the local oil family as a suspect in the gesto murder but here it was a decade later and she remembered the name you cant do anything with this keisha he responded what are you doing raynard waits confessed to gesto are you saying that was bullshit im not saying anything i was simply curious about something thats all now you cannot do anything with this we have a deal you sit on this until you hear from me youre not my boss harry how come you are talking to me like youre my boss im sorry i just dont want you running off and going crazy on this it could hurt what ive got going we have a deal right you just said i can trust you it was a long time before she answered yes we have a deal and yes you can trust me but if this is going where i think you are going with it i want updates and reports im not just going to sit around waiting to hear from you after you get the full package put together if i dont hear from you harry im going to get nervous when i get nervous i do some crazy things make some crazy phone calls bosch shook his head he should never have made the call to her i understand keisha he said youll be hearing from me he closed the phone wondering what fresh hell he might have just unleashed on earth and when it would come back to bite him he trusted russell but only to the limit he could trust any reporter he finished his beer and went to the kitchen for another as soon as he popped the top his phone buzzed it was keisha russell again harry have you ever heard of go industries he had go industries was the current corporate titling of a company started eighty years earlier as garland oil industries the company had a logo in which the word go had wheels and was slanted forward to look as if it were a speeding car what about it he responded headquartered downtown in the arco plaza i count twelve employees of go making onethousanddollar contributions to oshea hows that thats fine keisha thanks for calling back did oshea take a payoff to put gesto on waits is that it bosch groaned into the phone no keisha thats not what happened and thats not what i am looking at if you make any calls in this regard you will compromise what i am doing and could be putting yourself me and others in danger now would you please drop it until i can tell you exactly what is going on and when you can run with it once again she hesitated before answering and it was in that space of silence that bosch began to wonder if he could still trust her maybe her move from police to politics had changed something in her maybe as with most who worked in the realm of politics her sense of integrity had been sanded down by exposure to the worlds oldest profession political whoring okay harry i got it i was just trying to help but you remember what i said i want to hear from you soon you will keisha good night he closed the phone and tried to shake off his concerns about the reporter he thought about the information he had gotten from her between go and the law firm of cecil dobbs oshea had received at least twentyfive thousand in campaign contributions from people who could be directly tied to the garlands it was spread out and legal but nevertheless it was a strong indication that bosch was on the right track he felt a satisfying tug in his guts he had something to work with now he just had to find the right angle from which to work it he went to the table in the dining room and looked at the array of police reports and records spread out in front of him he picked up the file marked waitsbackground and started to read f rom the standpoint of law enforcement raynard waits was a rarity as a murder suspect when his van was pulled over in echo park the lapd in effect had captured a killer the department wasnt even looking for in fact waits was a killer no department or agency was looking for there was no file on him in any drawer or computer anywhere no fbi profile or background briefing existed to refer to they had a killer and they had to start from scratch with him this presented a whole new angle of investigation for detective freddy olivas and his partner ted colbert the case came to them with a momentum that simply dragged them with it everything was about moving forward toward prosecution there was little time or inclination to go backwards waits was arrested in possession of bags containing the parts of two murdered women it was a slam dunk and that precluded the need to know exactly who they had in custody and what had brought him to be in that van on that street at that time consequently little in the file on the present case helped bosch the file contained records of the investigative work related to attempts to identify the victims and drawing the physical evidence together for the impending prosecution the background information in the file was simply basic data on waits either provided by the suspect himself or culled by olivas and colbert during routine computer searches the bottom line was that they knew little about the man they were prosecuting but what they knew was enough bosch completed his readthrough of the file in twenty minutes when he was finished once again he had less than a half page of notes on his pad he had constructed a short timeline that charted the suspects arrests admissions and use of the names raynard waits and robert saxon daniel fitzpatrick murdered hollywood raynard waits dob dl issued hollywood robert saxon dob arrested prowling ided as raynard waits dob through dl thumbprint marie gesto abducted hollywood raynard waits dob arrested echo park bosch studied the timeline he found two things worth noting waits supposedly didnt get a drivers license until he was twenty and no matter which name he used he always gave the same month and day of birth while he once offered as his year of birth in an attempt to be considered a juvenile he uniformly gave at other times bosch knew that the latter was a practice often employed by people switching identities change the name but keep some of the other details the same to avoid getting confused or forgetting basic informationan obvious giveaway especially if its a cop asking for it bosch knew from the record searches earlier in the week that there was no birth record of raynard waits or robert saxon with the corresponding birth date in los angeles county the conclusion he and kiz rider had reached from this was that both names were false but now bosch considered that maybe the birth date of was not false maybe waits or whoever he was kept his real date of birth as he changed his name bosch now looked at the close proximity between the date of the fitzpatrick murder and the date of issue of waitss drivers license it was less than a month he added to this the fact that according to the records waits did not apply for a drivers license until he was twenty he thought it was unlikely that a boy growing up in the autotopia of la would wait until he was twenty to get his drivers license it was yet one more indication that raynard waits was not his name bosch started to feel it like a surfer waiting for the right swell before starting to paddle he felt his wave coming in he thought that what he was looking at was the birth of a new identity eighteen days after he murdered daniel fitzpatrick under cover of the riots the man who killed him walked into a dmv office in hollywood and applied for a drivers license he gave november as a date of birth and the name raynard waits he would have had to provide a birth certificate but that would not have been too hard to come up with if he knew the right people not in hollywood not in la getting a phony birth certificate would have been an easy almost riskfree task bosch believed that the fitzpatrick murder and the change of id were connected it was a causeandeffect something about the murder caused the killer to change his identity this belied the confession given two days earlier by raynard waits he had characterized the murder of daniel fitzpatrick as a thrill kill an opportunity to indulge a longheld fantasy he went out of his way to depict fitzpatrick as a victim chosen at random chosen simply because he was there but if that was truly the case and if the killer had no previous connection to the victim then why did the killer act almost immediately to reinvent himself with a new identity within eighteen days the killer procured a false birth certificate and got a new drivers license raynard waits was born bosch knew there was a contradiction in what he was considering if the killing of fitzpatrick had taken place as waits had confessed then there would have been no reason for him to quickly create a new identity but the factsthe timeline of the murder and the issuance of the drivers licensecontradicted this the conclusion to bosch was obvious there was a connection fitzpatrick was not a random victim he could in fact be linked in some way to his killer and that was why his killer changed his name bosch got up and took his empty bottle to the kitchen he decided that two beers was enough he needed to stay sharp and up on the wave he went back out to the stereo and put in the masterpiece kind of blue it never failed to give him the charge all blues was the first song out of the shuffle and it was like being dealt blackjack at a twentyfivedollar table it was his favorite and he let it ride back at the table he opened the fitzpatrick murder book and started to read kiz rider had handled it earlier but she had simply been engaged in a review to prepare for taking waitss confession she wasnt looking for the hidden connection bosch was now seeking the investigation of fitzpatricks death had been carried out by two detectives temporarily assigned to the riot crimes task force their work was cursory at best few leads were followed because there werent many to follow in the first place and because of the overriding pall of futility that fell over all the cases associated with the riots almost all acts of violence associated with the three days of widespread unrest were random people robbed raped and murdered indiscriminately and at willsimply because they could no witnesses to the attack on fitzpatrick were located no forensic evidence was found other than the can of lighter fluidand it had been wiped clean most of the shops records had been destroyed by fire or water what was left was put in two cartons and ignored the case was treated as a dead end from the moment it was born it was orphaned and archived the murder book was so thin that bosch finished his fronttoback readthrough in less than twenty minutes he had taken no notes gotten no ideas seen no connections he felt the tide ebbing his ride on the wave was coming to an end he thought about getting another beer out of the box and attacking the case all over again the next day then the front door opened and rachel walling walked in carrying takeout cartons from chinese friends bosch stacked the reports on the dining room table so there would be room to eat rachel brought plates from the kitchen and opened the cartons bosch got the last two anchors out of the refrigerator they smalltalked for a while and then he told her what he had been doing since lunch and what he had learned he could tell by her reserved comments that she was not convinced by his description of the trail he had found in beachwood canyon but when he showed her the timeline he had worked up she readily agreed with his conclusions about the killers changing of id after the fitzpatrick murder she also agreed that while they didnt have the killers real name they might have his real birth date bosch looked down at the two plastic cartons on the floor then i guess its worth the shot he said she leaned to the side so she could see what he was looking at what are those pawn slips mostly all the records salvaged after the fire back in ninetytwo they were all wet they dropped them in these boxes and forgot about them nobodys ever looked through them all is that what were doing tonight harry he looked up at her and smiled he nodded after they were finished eating they decided that they would take a carton each bosch suggested that they take them out onto the back deck because of the musty smell that would come from the cartons once they were opened rachel readily agreed bosch lugged the cartons out and then got two empty cardboard boxes from the carport they sat down in deck chairs and began the work taped to the top of the carton bosch chose was a x card that said main file cabinet bosch took the top off and used it to try to wave away the fumes that came out the carton contained mostly pink pawn slips and x cards that had been haphazardly put in the container as if with a shovel there was nothing ordered or neat about the records water damage was high many of the slips had stuck together while wet and the ink on others was smeared and unreadable bosch looked over at rachel and saw her dealing with the same issues this is bad harry she said i know just do the best you can it might be our last hope there was no way to begin but simply to dig in bosch pulled out a wad of slips brought them up to his lap and started going through them attempting to make out the name address and birth date of each customer who had pawned something through fitzpatrick each time he looked at a slip he checked the top corner with a red pencil from the dining room table drawer and dropped it into the cardboard box on the other side of his chair they were at it a solid half hour working without conversation when bosch heard the phone in the kitchen ring he thought about letting it go but knew it might be a call from hong kong he got up i didnt even know you had a landline walling said not many people do he grabbed the phone on the eighth ring it wasnt his daughter it was abel pratt just checking on you he said i figure if i get you on the house line and you say you are home then youre really home what am i under house arrest now no harry im just worried about you thats all look there will be no blowback from me okay but home duty does not mean i have to be at home twentyfourseven i checked with the union i know i know but it does mean you do not take part in any jobrelated investigation fine what are you doing then im sitting on the back deck with a friend were having a beer and enjoying the night air is that okay with you top anybody i know i doubt it she doesnt like cops pratt laughed and it seemed that bosch had finally put him at ease about what he was doing then ill let you get back to it have a good one harry i will if i can stay off the phone ill call in tomorrow ill be there and ill be here good night he hung up checked the refrigerator for hidden or lost beers and returned to the deck emptyhanded rachel was waiting for him with a smile on her face and a waterstained x card in her hand attached to it with a paper clip was a pink pawn slip got it she said she handed it to him and bosch stepped back inside the house where the lighting was better he read the card first it was written on with blue ink that was partially smeared by water but still legible unsatisfied customer customer complained that property was sold before day pawn period expired shown pawn slip and corrected customer complained that days should not have included weekends and holidays cursedslammed door dgf the pink pawn slip attached to the complaint card carried the name robert foxworth the dob and an address on fountain in hollywood the item pawned on october was listed as an heirloom medallion foxworth had been given eighty dollars for it there was a fingerprint square at the bottom right corner of the slip bosch could see the ridges of a fingerprint but the ink had either worn away or leached out of the paper because of the moisture contained in the storage carton the dob is a match rachel said plus the name connects on two levels what do you mean well he took robert forward when he used the name robert saxon and he took the fox in foxworth forward when he used raynard maybe thats where this whole raynard thing came from if his real name is foxworth maybe when he was a kid his parents told him stories about a fox named reynard if his real name is foxworth bosch repeated maybe we just found another alias maybe but at least its something you didnt have before bosch nodded he could feel his excitement building she was right finally they had a new angle to pursue bosch pulled out his phone im going to run the name and see what happens he called central dispatch and asked a service operator to run the name and birth date they had found on the pawn slip it came back clean and with no record of a current drivers license he thanked the operator and hung up nothing he said not even a drivers license but thats good rachel said dont you see robert foxworth would be about to turn thirtyfive right now if theres no history or current license then that is further confirmation that he is no more that hes either dead or he became someone else raynard waits she nodded i guess i was hoping for a dl with an echo park address bosch said i guess thats too much to ask for maybe not is there a way in this state to check defunct drivers licenses robert foxworth if thats his real name probably got a license when he turned sixteen in nineteen eightyseven when he switched identities it would have expired bosch considered this he knew that the state did not start requiring a thumbprint from licensed drivers until the early nineties it meant foxworth could have gotten a drivers license in the late eighties and there would be no way to connect him to his new identity as raynard waits i could check with dmv in the morning its not something i can get through communications dispatch tonight there is something else you can check tomorrow she said remember the quick and dirty profile i did the other night i said these early crimes werent aberrations he built up to them bosch understood a juvy jacket she nodded you might find a juvenile record on robert foxworthagain if thats his real name it wouldnt have been accessible through dispatch either she was right state law kept juvenile records from trailing an offender into adulthood the name may have come up clean when bosch called dispatch to run it but that didnt mean it was squeaky clean as with the drivers license information bosch would have to wait until morning when he could get into the juvenile records at the department of probation but as soon as his hopes were lifted he knocked them down again wait a minute that doesnt work he said his prints would have drawn a match when they ran his prints as raynard waits they would have hit the prints taken from robert foxworth as a juvenile his record might not be available but the prints stay in the system maybe maybe not two separate systems two separate bureaucracies the crossover doesnt always work that was true but it was more wishful thinking than anything else bosch now reduced the juvenile angle to a long shot it was more likely that robert foxworth had never been in the juvenile system bosch was beginning to think the name was just another false identity in a string of them rachel tried to change the subject what do you think about this heirloom medallion he pawned she asked i have no idea the fact that he wanted to get it back is interesting makes me think maybe it wasnt stolen like maybe it belonged to someone in his family and he needed to get it back it would explain him cursing and slamming doors i guess she nodded bosch yawned and all at once he realized how tired he was he had been running all day just to get to this name and the uncertainties that accompanied it the case was crowding his brain rachel seemed to read him harry i say we quit while were ahead and have another beer i dont know how far ahead we are but i could use another beer bosch said theres only one problem with that what no more beer harry you invited a girl over to do your dirty work and help you crack the case and all you give her is one beer whats wrong with you what about wine you have some wine bosch shook his head sadly but im on my way to the store thats good im on my way to the bedroom ill be waiting for you there then i wont delay make mine a red wine will you im on it bosch hurried from the house he had parked earlier at the front curb so that rachel could use the carport if she came over as he walked out the front door he noticed a vehicle sitting at the opposite curb two houses down the vehicle a silver suv caught his eye because it was parked in a red zone there was no parking allowed along that curb since it was too close to the next curve in the road a car could come around the bend and easily collide with any car parked there as bosch looked up the street the suv suddenly took off without its lights on it sped north around the bend and disappeared bosch ran to his car jumped in and headed north after the suv he drove as fast as he could safely go within two minutes he had followed the curving street around to the fourway stop at mulholland drive there was no sign of the suv and it could have gone in any of three directions from the stop shit bosch sat at the intersection for a long moment thinking about what he had just seen and what it might mean he decided that it either meant nothing or it meant someone was watching his house and therefore watching him but at the moment there was nothing he could do he let it go he turned left and drove mulholland at a safe speed all the way down to cahuenga he knew there was a liquor store near lankershim he headed there checking the rearview mirror for a trailer the whole way home duty or not bosch dressed in a suit the next morning before heading out he knew it would give him an aura of authority and confidence while dealing with government bureaucrats and by twenty minutes after nine it had paid off he had a solid lead the department of motor vehicles archives had produced a drivers license issued to a robert foxworth on november the day he turned sixteen and was eligible to drive the license was never renewed in california but there was no dmv record of the holder being deceased this meant foxworth had either moved to another state and was licensed there decided he no longer wanted to drive or changed identities bosch was betting on the third option the address on the license was the lead it listed foxworths residence as the los angeles county department of children and family services wilshire blvd los angeles in he had been a juvenile ward of the county he either had no parents or they had been declared unfit to raise him and he was removed from them the designation of dcfs as his address meant that he was either housed in one of the departments youth halls or had been placed in its foster care program bosch knew all of this because he too had had such a designation on his first drivers license he too had been a ward of the county as bosch stepped out of the dmv offices on spring street he felt a renewed surge of energy he had broken through what had seemed to be a dead end the night before and had turned it into a solid lead as he headed to his car his cell phone vibrated and he answered it without breaking stride or looking at the screen hoping that it would be rachel and that hed be able to share the good news harry where are you no one answered the home line it was abel pratt bosch was getting tired of his constant checking up on him im on my way in to visit kiz is that all right with you sure harry except youre supposed to check in with me once a day its not even ten oclock i want to hear from you every morning whatever tomorrows saturday should i call you what about sunday dont go overboard im just trying to look out for you you know sure top whatever you say you heard the latest i take it bosch stopped in his tracks they caught waits no i wish then what its all over the news everybodys worked up about it down here some girl got snatched off the street in hollywood last night pulled into a van on hollywood boulevard the division had those new street cameras installed last year and one of the cameras caught part of the abduction i havent seen it but they say its waits hes changed his lookshaved his head i thinkbut theyre saying it was him theres a press conference at eleven and theyre going to show the tape to the world bosch felt a dull thud pound in his chest he had been right about waits not leaving town he wished now he had been wrong as he had these thoughts he realized that he still thought of the killer as raynard waits it didnt matter if he was truly robert foxworth bosch knew he would always think of him as waits did they get a plate off the van he asked no it was covered all they put out was that it was a plain white econoline van like the other one he used but older look ive gotta go i just wanted to check in hopefully this is the last day ois will finish up and youll be back in the unit yeah that would be good but listen during his confession waits said he had a different van in the nineties maybe the task force should get somebody to look through old dmv registrations under his name they might come up with a plate to go with the van its worth a shot ill tell them okay stay close to home harry and give my regards to kiz right bosch closed the phone happy that hed been able to come up with the kiz line on the spot like that but he also knew that he was becoming a good liar with pratt and that didnt make him very happy bosch got into his car and headed toward wilshire boulevard the call from pratt had increased his sense of urgency waits had abducted another woman but there had been nothing in the files to indicate that he killed his victims immediately that meant the latest victim might still be alive bosch knew that if he could get to waits he could save her the dcfs offices were crowded and loud he waited at a records counter for fifteen minutes before he got the attention of a clerk after taking boschs information and typing it into a computer she told him that there was indeed a juvenile file relating to robert foxworth dob but that to see it he would need a court order authorizing his search of the records bosch just smiled he was too excited by the fact that a file was actually still in existence to be upset by one more frustration he thanked her and told her he would be back with the court order bosch stepped back out into the sunlight he knew he was at a crossroads now dancing around the truth of where he was during phone calls with abel pratt was one thing but if he was to apply for a search warrant seeking the dcfs records without departmental approvalcoming in the form of a supervisors okaythen he would be completely going off the reservation he would be conducting a rogue investigation and committing a firing offense he figured he could take what he had into randolph at ois or the fugitive task force and let them run with it or he could go the rogue route and accept the possible consequences since coming back from retirement bosch had felt less constricted by the rules and regulations of the department he had already walked out the door once and knew that if push came to shove he would be able to do it again the second time would be easier he didnt want it to come to that but he could do it if he had to he pulled out his phone and made the one call he knew might save him from making a choice between two bad options rachel walling answered her cell on the second ring so whats happening over there in tactical he asked oh we always have something happening here how did it go downtown did you hear that waits abducted another woman last night she had a habit of asking more than one question at a time especially when she was excited bosch told her that he had heard about the abduction and then related the tale of his mornings activities so what are you going to do well im thinking about seeing if the fbi might be interested in joining the case and what about the case would carry it across the federal threshold you know corruption of public officials campaign finance violations kidnapping cats and dogs living togetherthe usual stuff she stayed serious i dont know harry you open that door and theres no telling where it will go but ive got an insider somebody who will watch out for me and safeguard the case wrong they probably wouldnt let me anywhere near this its not my group and theres the conflict of interest what conflict weve worked together before im just telling you how this will likely be received look i need a search warrant if i go off the reservation to get one i probably wont be able to come back on again i know it will be the last straw with pratt thats for sure but if i can say that i was brought into a federal investigation then that would give me a valid explanation it would give me an out all i want is to look at foxworths dcfs file i think it will lead us to whatevers in echo park she was quiet for a long moment before responding where are you right now im still at dcfs go get a doughnut or something ill be there as soon as i can you sure no but thats what were going to do she hung up the phone bosch closed his and looked around instead of a doughnut he went over to a newspaper box and got the morning edition of the times he took a seat on the planter that ran along the front length of the dcfs building and looked through the paper for stories on the raynard waits and beachwood canyon investigations there was no story on the abduction on hollywood boulevard because that had occurred during the night and long after the papers deadline the coverage of the waits story had moved off the front page to the state and local section but it was still extensive there were three stories in all the most prominent report was on the sofarunsuccessful nationwide search for the escaped serial killer most of the information had already been rendered obsolete by the events of the night there was no nationwide search anymore waits was still here in the city this story jumped inside the section and was framed by two sidebars one was an update on the investigation that filled in some of the details of what had happened during the shootout and escape and the other story was a political update this latter story was written by keisha russell and bosch quickly scanned it to see if anything they had discussed about rick osheas campaign financing had gotten into the paper luckily there was nothing and he felt his trust in her rising bosch finished reading the stories and there was still no sign of rachel he moved into other sections of the paper studying the box scores of sporting events he cared nothing about and reading reviews of movies he would never see when there was nothing left for him to read he put the paper aside and started pacing in front of the building he became anxious worried that hed lose the edge the mornings discoveries had given him he got out his phone to call her but decided instead to call st josephs hospital and check on kiz riders condition he was transferred to the thirdfloor nursing station and was then put on hold while he was waiting to be connected he saw rachel finally pull up in a federal cruiser he closed the phone crossed the sidewalk and met her as she was getting out whats the plan he said by way of greeting what no how are you doing or thanks for coming thanks for coming whats the plan they started walking into the building the plan is the federal plan i go in and draw down on the man in charge the full force and weight of the government of this great country i raise the specter of terrorism and he gives us the file bosch stopped you call that a plan its worked pretty well for us for more than fifty years she didnt stop he now had to hurry to catch up how do you know its a man in charge because it always is which way he pointed straight ahead in the main hallway rachel didnt break stride i didnt wait around for forty minutes for this rachel you have a better idea i had a better idea a federal search warrant remember that was a nonstarter bosch i told you i open that door and you get trampled this is better in and out if i get you the file i get you the file doesnt matter how she was two paces in front of him now moving with federal momentum bosch secretly started to believe she moved through the double doors beneath the sign that said records with an authority and command presence that could not be questioned the clerk bosch had dealt with was at the counter speaking with another citizen walling stepped right up and didnt wait for an invitation to speak she drew her credentials from her suit jacket pocket in one smooth move fbi i need to see your office manager in regard to a matter of urgency the clerk looked at her with an unimpressed face i will be with you as soon as i fin youre with me now honey go get your boss or ill go get him this is lifeordeath urgent the woman made a face that seemed to indicate she had never encountered such rudeness before without a word to the citizen in front of her or anyone else she stepped away from the counter and walked to a door behind a row of cubicles they waited less than a minute the clerk stepped back out through the door followed by a man wearing a white shortsleeved shirt and a maroon tie he came directly to rachel walling im mr osborne how can i help you we need to step into your office sir this is a highly confidential matter over this way please he pointed to a swing door at the far end of the counter bosch and walling walked down to it and its lock was buzzed open they followed osborne back through the rear door to his office rachel let him get a look at her credentials once he was seated behind a desk festooned with dusty dodgers memorabilia there was a wrapped sandwich from subway front and center on his desk whats this all mr osborne i work for the tactical intelligence unit here in los angeles im sure you understand what that means and this is detective harry bosch of the lapd were working a joint investigation of high importance and urgency weve learned from your clerk that there exists a file pertaining to an individual named robert foxworth date of birth eleventhreeseventyone it is vitally important that we be allowed to review that file immediately osborne nodded but what he said didnt go with a nod i understand but here at dcfs we work under very precise laws state laws that protect the children the records of our juvenile wards are not open to the public without court order my hands are sir robert foxworth is no longer a juvenile he is thirtyfour years old the file might contain information that will lead us to the containment of a very grave threat to this city it will undoubtedly save lives i know but you have to understand that we are not i do understand i understand perfectly that if we dont see that file now we could be talking about a loss of human life you dont want that on your conscience mr osborne and neither do we thats why we are on the same team ill make a deal with you sir we will review the file right here in your office with you watching in the meantime i will get on the phone and instruct a member of my team at tactical to draw up a search warrant i will see to it that it is signed by a judge and furnished to you before the end of business today well id have to call it up from archives are the archives here in the building yes down below then please call archives and get that file up here we dont have a lot of time sir just wait here i will handle it personally thank you mr osborne the man left the office and walling and bosch sat down in chairs in front of his desk rachel smiled now lets hope he doesnt change his mind she said youre good he responded i tell my daughter that she could talk a zebra out of its stripes i think you could talk a tiger out of its if i get this you owe me another lunch at water grill fine just no sashimi they waited for osbornes return for nearly fifteen minutes when he came back to the office he was carrying a file folder that was nearly an inch thick he presented it to walling who took the file as she was standing up bosch took the cue and stood as well well get this back to you as soon as possible she said thank you mr osborne wait a minute you said you were going to look at it here rachel was heading toward the office door gathering that momentum again theres no longer time mr osborne we have to move youll have the file back by tomorrow morning she was already through the door bosch followed closing it behind him on osbornes final words what about the court ord as they passed behind the clerk walling asked her to buzz them out rachel kept a twopace lead on bosch as they headed out into the hallway he liked walking behind her and admiring how she handled herself command presence in spades is there a starbucks around here where we could sit and look at this thing id like to look before heading back theres always a starbucks around out on the sidewalk they walked east until they came to a tiny luncheonette that had a small inside counter with stools it beat looking for a starbucks so they went in while bosch ordered two coffees from the man behind the counter rachel opened the file by the time the coffees were put down on the counter and paid for she had a onepage lead on him they sat side by side and she passed each page to him after she was finished with her review of it they worked silently and neither one drank their coffee buying the coffee had merely bought them the work space at the counter the first document in the file was a copy of foxworths birth certificate he was born at queen of angels hospital the mother was listed as rosemary foxworth dob philadelphia pa and the father was listed as unknown the mothers address was an apartment on orchid avenue in hollywood bosch placed the address in the middle of what was now called the kodak center part of the hollywood renovation and rebirth plan it was all glitz and glass and red carpets now but back in it would have been a neighborhood patrolled by streetwalkers and hypes the birth certificate also listed the doctor who delivered the child and a hospital social worker involved in the case bosch did the math rosemary foxworth was seventeen years old when she gave birth to her son no father listed or in attendance no father known the listing of a social worker meant the county was picking up the tab on the delivery and the home address did not bode well for a happy start for baby robert all of this led to a picture developing like a polaroid in boschs mind he guessed that rosemary foxworth had been a runaway from philadelphia that she hit hollywood and shared a flop apartment with others like her she probably worked the nearby streets as a prostitute she probably used drugs she gave birth to the boy and then the county eventually stepped in and took him away as rachel passed him more documents the sad story was borne out robert foxworth was removed from his mothers custody at age two and taken into the dcfs system for the next sixteen years of his life he was in and out of foster homes and youth halls bosch noted that among the facilities where he had spent time was the mclaren youth hall in el monte a place where bosch himself had spent a number of years as a child the file was replete with psychiatric evaluations conducted annually or upon foxworths frequent returns from foster care homes in total the file charted the journey of a broken life sad yes unique no it was the story of a child taken from his one parent and then equally mistreated by the institution that had taken him foxworth floated from place to place he had no real home or family he probably never knew what it was like to be wanted or loved reading through the pages brought up memories in bosch two decades before foxworths journey through the system bosch had charted his own path he had survived with his own set of scars but the damage was nothing compared with the extent of foxworths injuries the next document rachel handed him was a copy of a death certificate for rosemary foxworth she died march of complications stemming from drug use and hepatitis c she had died in the jail ward at countyusc medical center robert foxworth would have been fourteen here we go here we go rachel suddenly said what his longest stay in any foster home was in echo park and the people he stayed with harlan and janet saxon whats the address seventen figueroa lane he was there from eightythree to eightyseven almost four years total he must have liked them and i guess they liked him back bosch leaned over to look at the document in front of her he was on figueroa terrace only a couple blocks from there when he got pulled over with the bodies he said if they had followed him for just one more minute they wouldve had the place if thats where he was going its got to be where he was going she handed him the page and moved on to the next but bosch stood up and walked away from the counter he had read enough for the time being he had been looking for the connection to echo park and now he knew he had it he was ready to put the book work aside he was ready to make a move harry these shrink reports from when he was a teenagerhe was talking about some sick shit here like what a lot of anger toward women young promiscuous women prostitutes drug users you know what the psychology is here you know what i think he ended up doing no and no what he was killing his mother over and over again all those missing women and girls theyve hung on him the one last night to him they were like his mother and he wanted to kill her for abandoning him and maybe kill them before they did the same thingbrought a child into the world bosch nodded thats a nice shakeandbake shrink job if we had the time you could probably find his rosebud memory too but she didnt abandon him they took him away from her she shook her head doesnt matter she said abandonment through lifestyle the state had no choice but to step in and take him away from her drugs prostitution the whole thing by being an unfit mother she abandoned him to this deeply flawed institution where he was trapped until he was old enough to walk away on his own in his brain chart that constituted abandonment bosch nodded slowly he guessed that she was right but the whole situation made him uncomfortable it felt too personal to bosch too close to his own path except for a turn here or there bosch and foxworth had made similar journeys foxworth was doomed to kill his own mother over and over again a police shrink had once told bosch that he was doomed to solve his own mothers murder over and over again what is it bosch looked at her he had not yet told rachel his own sordid history he didnt want her profiling skills turned on him nothing he said im just thinking you look like youve seen a ghost bosch he shrugged walling closed the file on the counter and finally raised her coffee cup to sip from it so what now she asked bosch looked at her for a long moment before answering echo park he said what about backup im going to check it out first then call backup she nodded im going with you part four the dog you feed bosch and walling used boschs mustang since it would give them at least a small degree of cover compared with her federal cruiser which screamed law enforcement they drove to echo park but did not approach the saxon house at figueroa lane there was a problem figueroa lane was a short turnaround street that extended for a block off the end of figueroa terrace and curved up along the ridge below chavez ravine there was no cruising by it without being obvious about it even in a mustang if waits was there and watching for law enforcement he would have the advantage of seeing them first bosch stopped the car at the intersection of beaudry and figueroa terrace and drummed his fingers on the steering wheel he picked a good place for the secret castle he said theres no getting close to it without being picked up on radar especially in daylight rachel nodded medieval castles were built on hilltops for the same reason bosch looked to his left toward downtown and saw the tall buildings rising over the roofs of the homes on figueroa terrace one of the closest and tallest buildings was the department of water and power headquarters it was directly across the freeway ive got an idea he said they drove out of the neighborhood and back into downtown bosch entered the dwp garage and parked in one of the visitor slots he popped the trunk and went to the surveillance kit he always kept in the car he got out a pair of highpowered binoculars a surveillance camera and a rolledup sleeping bag what are you going to take pictures of walling asked nothing but its got a long lens and you might want to look through it while i use the binocs and the sleeping bag we might be lying on the roof i dont want your fancy federal suit to get dirty dont worry about me worry about yourself im worried about that girl waits grabbed lets go they headed across the garage floor toward the elevators did you notice that you still call him waits even though we are now sure his name is foxworth she asked when they were going up yeah i have noticed i think its because when we were facetoface he was waits when he started shooting he was waits and it just sort of stuck she nodded and didnt say anything else about it though he guessed that she probably had a psychological angle on it when they reached the lobby bosch went to an information desk showed his badge and credentials and asked to see a security supervisor he told the desk man that it was urgent in less than two minutes a tall black man in gray pants and a navy blazer over his white shirt and tie came through a door and directly toward them this time bosch and walling both showed their creds and the man appeared properly impressed by the federallocal tandem hieronymus he said reading boschs police id do you go by harry thats right the man put out his hand and smiled jason edgar i believe you and my cousin were partners once bosch smiled not just because of the coincidence but because he knew it meant that he would have this mans cooperation he put the sleeping bag under his other arm and shook his hand thats right he told me he had a cousin with dwp you used to get him billing info when we needed it nice to meet you likewise man what do we have here if the fbis involved are we talking about a terrorism situation rachel raised a hand in a calming gesture not quite she said jason were just looking for a place where we can look down on a neighborhood across the freeway in echo park theres a house were interested in and we cant get close to it without being obvious about it know what i mean we were thinking that maybe from one of the offices here or from the roof we could get an angle and just see whats happening over there ive got just the spot edgar said without hesitation follow me he led them back to the elevators and had to use a key to get the fifteenthfloor button to light on the way up he explained that the building was going through a floorbyfloor renovation at the moment the work had moved to the fifteenth floor the floor had been gutted and was empty waiting for the contractor to come in to rebuild according to the renovation plan you can have the whole floor to yourselves he said pick any angle you want for an op bosch nodded op as in observation point that told him something about jason edgar whered you serve he asked marines desert storm the whole shebang thats why i didnt join the pd had my fill of war zones this gig is pretty much nine to five low stress and just interesting enough if you know what i mean bosch didnt but nodded anyway the elevator doors opened and they stepped out onto a floor that was wide open from glass exterior to glass exterior edgar led them toward the glass wall that would look down on echo park whats the case about anyway edgar asked as they approached bosch knew it would come to this he was ready with an answer theres a place down there we think is being used as a safe house for fugitives we just want to see if there is anything there to be seen you know what i mean sure do theres something else you can do to help us walling said bosch turned to her along with edgar he was just as curious what do you need edgar said could you run the address through your computers and tell us who is paying for utilities not a problem let me just get you situated here first bosch nodded to rachel it was a good move it would not only get the inquisitive edgar out of the way for a while but it could also provide them with some valuable information about the house on figueroa lane at the floortoceiling glass wall on the north side of the building bosch and walling looked down and across the freeway at echo park they were farther from the hillside neighborhood than bosch had thought they would be but they still had a good vantage point he pointed out the geographic markers to rachel theres fig terrace he said those three houses up above it on the curve are on fig lane she nodded figueroa lane had only the three houses on it from this height and distance it looked like an afterthought a developers discovery that he could jam three more houses onto the hillside after the main street grid had already been laid out which one is seventen she asked good question bosch dropped the sleeping bag and raised the binoculars he studied the three houses looking for an address he finally zeroed in on a black trash can sitting out front of the house in the middle in large white numerals someone had painted on the can in an effort to safeguard it from theft bosch knew the address numbers would rise as the street extended away from downtown the one on the right is seventen he said got it she said so thats the address edgar asked seventen fig lane figueroa lane bosch said got it let me go see what i can find if anybody comes up here and asks what you are doing just tell them to call me on threethreeeight thats my page thanks jason you got it edgar started walking back to the elevators bosch thought of something and called after him jason this glass has got film on it right nobody can see us looking out right yeah no problem you could stand there naked and nobody would see you from the outside but dont try that at night cause its a different story internal light changes things and you can look right in bosch nodded thanks when i come back ill bring a couple chairs that would be good after edgar disappeared into the elevator walling said good at least well be able to sit naked at the window bosch smiled sounded like he knew all that from experience he said lets hope not bosch raised the binoculars and looked down at the house at figueroa lane it was of similar design to the other two on the street built high on the hillside with steps leading down to a streetfront garage cut into the embankment below the house it had a red barreltile roof and a spanish motif but while the other houses on the street were neatly painted and cared for appeared rundown its pink paint had faded the embankment between the garage and the house was overrun with weeds the flagpole that stood at the corner of the front porch flew no flag bosch finetuned the focus of the field glasses and moved them from window to window looking for indications of occupancy hoping to get lucky and see waits himself looking back out next to him he heard walling click off a few photos she was using the camera i dont think theres any film in that its not digital its all right just force of habit and i wouldnt expect a dinosaur like you to have a digital camera beneath the binoculars bosch smiled he tried to think of a rejoinder but let it go he focused his attention back on the house it was of a style commonly seen in the citys older hillside neighborhoods while with newer construction the contour of the land dictated design the houses on the inclined side of figueroa lane were of a more conquering design at street level the embankment was excavated for a garage then above this the hillside was terraced and a small singlelevel home had been constructed the mountains and hillsides all over the city were molded this way in the forties and fifties as the city sprawled through the flats and grew up the hillsides like a rising tide bosch noticed that at the top of the stairs that ran from the side of the garage up to the front porch there was a small metal platform he checked the stairs again and saw the metal guide rails theres a lift on the stairs he said whoevers living there now is in a wheelchair he saw no movement behind any window viewable from the angle they had he dropped his focus down to the garage it had a pedestrian entrance door and double garage doors that had been painted pink a long time before the paint what was left of it was gray now and the wood was splintering in many places from direct exposure to the afternoon sun one garage door looked as though it had closed at an uneven angle to the pavement it didnt look operational anymore the pedestrian entrance door had a window but a shade was pulled down behind it across the top panel of each of the garage doors was a row of small square windows but they were being hit with direct sunlight and the dazzling reflection prevented bosch from seeing in bosch heard the elevator ding and put the binoculars down for the first time he checked behind him and saw jason edgar carrying two chairs toward them perfect bosch said he took one of the chairs and positioned it near the glass so he could sit on it backwards and prop his elbows on the seat backclassic surveillance form rachel positioned her chair so she could sit normally in it did you get a chance to check with records jason she asked i did edgar said services to that address are billed to a janet saxon and have been for twentyone years thank you no problem i take it thats all you need from me right now bosch looked up at edgar jerry youi mean jasonyouve been a great help we appreciate it well probably stick around a little bit and then split you want us to let you know or drop these chairs off somewhere uh just tell the guy in the lobby on your way out hell get a message to me and leave the chairs i can take care of that will do thanks good luck hope you get your man everybody shook hands and edgar returned to the elevator bosch and walling went back to watching the house on figueroa lane bosch asked rachel if she would prefer taking shifts and she said no he asked if she would rather use the binoculars and she said she would stick with the camera its long lens actually allowed her a closer focus than the binoculars did twenty minutes went by and no movement at the house was seen bosch had spent the time moving back and forth between the house and the garage but was now training his focus on the heavy brush on the ridgeline up above looking for another possible observation position that would put them closer walling spoke excitedly harry the garage bosch lowered his focus and picked up the garage the sun had moved behind a cloud and the glare had dropped off the line of windows across the top panel of each garage door bosch saw rachels discovery through the windows of the garage door that appeared to still be functional he could see the back of a white van i heard that a white van was used in the abduction last night walling said thats what i heard too its part of the bolo he was excited a white van in a house where raynard waits had lived thats it he called out he has to be in there with the girl rachel we gotta go they got up and hurried to the elevator they debated backup as they sped out of the dwp garage walling was for it bosch was against look all we have is a white van he said she might be in that house but he might not be if we storm in there with the troops we could lose him so all i want to do is check it out up close we can call for backup when we get there if we need it he believed his view was certainly reasonable but so was hers and what if he is in there she asked the two of us could be walking into an ambush we need at least one team of backup harry to do this correctly and safely well call them when we get there that will be too late i know what youre doing you want this guy for yourself and youre willing to risk that girland usto get it you want me to drop you off rachel no i dont want you to drop me off harry good i want you to be there decision made they ended the discussion figueroa street ran behind the dwp building bosch took it east under the freeway crossed sunset and then followed it as it jogged north and under the freeway figueroa street became figueroa terrace and they drove to where it ended and figueroa lane curved up to the crest of the hillside bosch pulled the car to the curb before driving up it we walk up and then we stay close to the line of garages until we get to seventen he said if we stay in close he wont have an angle on us from the house what if he isnt in the house what if hes in the garage waiting for us then we deal with it we clear the garage first and then go up the stairs to the house the houses are on the hillside we still need to cross the street he looked at her across the top of the car as they got out rachel are you with me or not i told you im with you then lets go bosch got out and started trotting up the sidewalk leading up the hill he pulled out his phone and turned it off so it wouldnt possibly vibrate while they were sneaking the house he was huffing by the time he got to the top rachel was right behind him and didnt show the same level of oxygen depletion bosch hadnt smoked in years but the damage of twentyfive years before that had been done their only visual exposure to the pink house at the end of the street came when they got to the top and had to cross over to the garages that lined the east side of the street they walked it bosch casually holding walling by the arm and whispering in her ear im using you to block my face he said hes seen me but hes never seen you it doesnt matter she said when they got across if he saw us you can expect he knows whats happening he ignored the warning and started moving in front of the garages which were built right along the sidewalk line they got to quickly and bosch went to the panel of windows over one of the doors cupping his hands against the dirty glass he looked in and saw that the interior was crowded by the van and stacks of boxes barrels and other junk he saw no movement and heard no sound a door at the back wall of the garage was closed he stepped over to the garages pedestrian door and checked the knob locked he whispered he stepped back and looked at the two pullup doors rachel was now standing by the far door and leaning in close to it to listen for sounds from inside she looked at bosch and shook her head nothing he looked down and saw that there was a handle at the bottom of each pullup door but no exterior locking mechanism he went to the first one bent down and tried to pull the door open it came about an inch and then stopped it was locked from the inside he tried the second door and encountered the same response the door gave for a few inches but then stopped because of the minimal movement each door allowed bosch guessed that they were secured inside by padlocks bosch stood up and looked at rachel he shook his head and pointed upward meaning it was time to go up to the house they moved to the concrete stairs and quietly started up bosch led the way and stopped four steps from the top he crouched and tried to catch his breath he looked at rachel he knew they were winging it he was winging it there was no way to approach the house but to go directly to the front door he turned from her and studied the windows one by one he saw no movement but he thought he could hear the sound of a television or radio coming from inside he pulled his gunit was a backup he had gotten out of the hallway closet that morningand went up the final steps holding the weapon down at his side as he quietly crossed the porch to the front door bosch knew that a search warrant was not at issue here waits had abducted a woman and the lifeanddeath nature of the situation assuredly pushed them into nowarrant noknock territory he put his hand on the knob and turned the door was unlocked bosch slowly pushed the door open noticing that a twoinch ramp had been placed over the threshold to accommodate a wheelchair as the door came open the sound of the radio became louder an evangelical station a man talking about the impending rapture they stepped into the houses entry area to the right it opened into a living room with a dining area to the back directly ahead through an arched opening was the kitchen a hallway to the left led to the rest of the house without looking back at rachel he pointed to the right meaning she would go that way while he moved forward and cleared the kitchen before taking the hallway to the left as he reached the archway bosch glanced at rachel and saw her moving through the living room weapon up in a twohanded grip he stepped into the kitchen and saw that it was clean and neat without a dish in the sink the radio was on the counter the speaker was telling his listeners that those who did not believe would be left behind there was another archway leading from the kitchen to the dining room rachel came through it pointed her gun up when she saw bosch and shook her head nothing that left the hallway leading to the bedrooms and the rest of the house bosch turned and went back through the archway to the entry area when he turned toward the hallway he was startled to see an old woman sitting in a wheelchair in the threshold to the hallway on her lap she was holding a longbarrel revolver it looked like it was too heavy for her frail arm to hold up whos there she said forcefully her head was turned at an angle though her eyes were open they were focused on the floor instead of bosch it was her ear that was trained toward him and he knew she was blind he raised his gun and pointed it at her mrs saxon take it easy my name is harry bosch im just looking for robert a look of puzzlement played on her features who robert foxworth is he here youve got the wrong place and how dare you come in here without knocking i bobby uses the garage i dont let him use the house all those chemicals it smells awful bosch started edging toward her his eyes on the gun the whole time im sorry mrs saxon i thought he was up here has he been here lately he comes and goes he comes up here to give me the rent thats all for the garage he was getting closer thats what i said what do you want him for are you his friend i just want to talk to him bosch reached down and took the gun out of her hand hey thats my protection its all right mrs saxon ill give it back i just think it needs to be cleaned up a little and oiled this way it will be sure to work in case you ever really need to use it i need it im going to take it down to the garage and get bobby to clean it then ill bring it back you better bosch checked the gun it was loaded and appeared operational he put it into the waistband at the back of his pants and looked at rachel she was standing three feet behind him in the entryway she made a movement with her hand pantomiming turning a key bosch understood do you have a key to the garage door mrs saxon he asked no bobby came and got the extra key okay mrs saxon ill check with him he moved toward the front door rachel joined him and they went out halfway down the steps to the garage rachel grabbed his arm and whispered we have to call backup now go ahead and call but im going into the garage if hes in there with the girl we cant wait he shook off her grip and continued down when he got to the garage he looked once again through the windows on the top panels and saw no movement inside his eyes focused on the door on the rear wall it was still closed he moved over to the pedestrian door and opened the blade of a small folding knife that was attached to his key ring bosch went to work on the doors lock and got the blade across the tongue he nodded to rachel to be ready and pulled the door open but it didnt come he tried it again and pulled hard again the door would not come open theres an inside lock he whispered it means hes in there no it doesnt he couldve come out through one of the garage doors he shook his head theyre locked from the inside he whispered all the doors are locked from the inside rachel understood and nodded what do we do she whispered back bosch thought about things for a moment and then handed her his keys go back and get the car when you get up here park it with the rear end right here then pop the trunk what are you just do it go she ran down the sidewalk in front of the garages and then crossed the street and dropped from sight down the hill bosch moved toward the pullup door that looked like it had closed awkwardly it was out of alignment and he knew it would be the better of the two doors to try to breach bosch heard the mustangs big engine before he saw his car come over the hill rachel drove toward him fast he stepped back against the garage to give her maximum room to maneuver she made almost a complete turn in the street and then backed toward the garage the trunk was popped and bosch immediately reached in for the rope he kept in the back it was gone he then remembered that osani had taken it after discovering it on the tree in beachwood canyon shit he quickly looked through the trunk and found a shorter length of clothesline he had used once to tie down the trunk lid when he was moving a piece of furniture to the salvation army he quickly tied one end of the cord to a steel towing loop underneath the cars bumper and then the other end to the handle at the bottom of the garage door he knew that something would have to give the door the handle or the rope they had a oneinthree shot at getting the door open rachel had gotten out of the car what are you doing she asked bosch quietly closed the cars trunk were going to pull it open get back in the car and go forward go slow a sudden jerk will snap the line go ahead rachel hurry without a word she got back in the car dropped it in drive and started moving forward she watched in the rearview and he rolled a finger to keep her moving the cord pulled taut and then bosch could hear the sound of the garage door groaning as the pressure mounted he stepped back and at the same time drew his gun again the garage door gave way all at once and popped up and out three feet stop bosch yelled knowing there was no longer any need for whispers rachel stopped pulling but the line remained taut and the garage door was held open bosch moved forward quickly and used his momentum to duck and roll beneath it he came up inside the garage with his gun up and ready he swept the space but saw no one keeping his eyes on the door at the rear wall he sidestepped over to the van he jerked one of the side doors open and quickly checked the interior it was empty bosch moved toward the back wall making his way around an obstacle course of upright barrels rolls of plastic bales of towels squeegee blades and other windowwashing equipment there was a strong smell of ammonia and other chemicals boschs eyes were beginning to water the hinges on the door at the rear wall were visible and bosch knew it would swing toward him when he opened it fbi walling yelled from outside coming in clear bosch yelled back he heard her scrabble under the garage door but kept his attention on the door in the back wall he moved toward it listening all the time for any sound taking a position to the side of the door bosch put his hand on the doorknob and turned it it was unlocked he looked back for the first time at rachel she was in a combat stance at an angle from the door she nodded and in one quick move he flung the door open and moved across the threshold the room was dark and windowless and he saw no one he knew he was a target standing in the light in the doorway and quickly sidestepped into the room he saw a string from an overhead light and reached out and yanked on it the string snapped in his hand but the light came on the hanging bulb jumping and swinging in response he was in a crowded work and storage room that was about ten feet deep there was no one in the room clear rachel entered and they stood there scanning the room a bench cluttered with old paint cans household tools and flashlights was on the right four old and rusting bikes were stacked against the left wall along with folding chairs and a pile of collapsed cardboard boxes the back wall was concrete block hung on it was the dusty old flag for the pole up on the front terrace of the house on the floor in front of it was a standup electric fan its blades caked with dust and crud it looked like at one time somebody had tried to blow the fetid damp smell out of the room shit bosch said he lowered his gun turned and walked past rachel back into the garage she followed him bosch shook his head and tried to rub some of the chemical sting out of his eyes he didnt understand were they too late were they following the wrong lead altogether check the van he said see if there is any sign of the girl rachel crossed behind him to the van and bosch went to the pedestrian door to check for the flaws in his belief that someone had to be in the garage he had to be right there was a dead bolt on the door meaning it could only have been locked from the inside he moved over to the garage doors and stooped down to look at their locking mechanisms he was right again both had padlocks on interior slide locks he tried to puzzle it out all three doors had been locked from the inside it meant that either someone was inside the garage or there was an exit point he hadnt identified yet but this seemed impossible the garage was dug directly into the hillside embankment there was no possibility of a rear exit he was checking the ceiling wondering if it was possible that there was a passageway up to the house when rachel called from inside the van ive got a roll of duct tape she said ive got used strips on the floor with hair it boosted boschs belief that they had the right place he stepped over to the open side door of the van he looked in at rachel while he pulled out his phone he noticed the wheelchair lift in the van ill call for backup and forensics he said we missed him he had to turn the phone back on and while he waited for it to boot up he realized something the standup fan in the back room wasnt pointed toward the garage doors if you were going to air the room out you would point the fan toward the door his phone buzzed in his hand and it distracted him he looked down at the screen it told him he had a message waiting he clicked a button to check the call record and saw that he had just missed a call from jerry edgar hed get to it later he punched in a number for communications and told the dispatcher to connect him with the raynard waits fugitive task force an officer identifying himself as freeman picked up this is detective harry bosch i have harry gun it was rachel who had yelled time slowed down all in a second bosch looked at her in the vans doorway her eyes focused over his shoulder at the back of the garage without thinking he jumped forward and into her pulling his arms around her and taking her to the floor of the van in a crushing tackle four shots came from behind him followed by the instantaneous sound of bullets striking metal and glass breaking bosch rolled off rachel and came up with his gun in hand he caught a glimpse of a figure ducking into the rear storage room he fired six shots through the doorway and raking across the wall to its right rachel okay im okay are you hit i dont think so it was him waits they paused and watched the door to the rear room no one came back through did you hit him rachel whispered i dont think so i thought we cleared that room i thought we did too bosch stood up keeping his aim on the doorway he noticed that the light from within was now off i dropped my phone he said call for backup he started moving toward the door harry wait he could call for backup and remember to tell them im in there he cut to his left and approached the door from an angle that would give him the widest vision of the interior space but without the overhead light the room was cast in shadows and he could see no movement he started taking small steps using his right foot first and maintaining a firing position behind him he heard rachel on her phone identifying herself and asking for a transfer to lapd dispatch bosch got to the threshold and swung the gun across his body to cover the part of the room he had not had an angle on he stepped in and sidestepped to the right there was no movement no sign of waits the room was empty he looked at the fan and confirmed his mistake it was pointed toward the flag hanging on the back wall it had not been used to blow damp air out the fan had been used to blow air in bosch took two steps toward the flag he reached forward grabbed it by the edge and ripped it down in the wall three feet off the ground was a tunnel entrance about a dozen concrete blocks had been removed to create an opening four feet square and the excavation into the hillside continued from there bosch crouched to look into the opening from the safety of the right side the tunnel was deep and dark but he saw a glimmer of light thirty feet in he realized that the tunnel made a turn and that there was a source of light around the bend bosch leaned closer and realized he could hear a sound from the tunnel it was a low whimpering it was a terrible sound but it was beautiful just the same it meant that no matter what horrors she had experienced through the night the woman waits had abducted was still alive bosch reached back over to the workbench and picked up the shiniest flashlight he saw he turned it on it was dead he tried another and got a weak beam of light it would have to do he flashed the beam into the tunnel and confirmed that the first leg was clear he took a step toward the tunnel harry wait he turned and saw rachel in the doorway backups on the way she whispered bosch shook his head shes in there shes alive he turned back to the tunnel and flashed the light in once more it was still clear up to the turn he turned the light off to conserve it he glanced back at rachel and then stepped into the darkness bosch hesitated a moment in the mouth of the tunnel to let his eyes adjust he then started moving he didnt have to crawl the tunnel was large enough for him to move through in a crouch flashlight in his right hand and gun up in his left he kept his eyes on the dim light ahead the sound of the woman crying grew louder as he moved forward ten feet into the tunnel the musty smell that he had noticed outside turned into the deeper stench of decay as rancid as it was it was not something new to him almost forty years before he had been a tunnel rat with the us army taking part in more than a hundred missions in the tunnels of vietnam the enemy sometimes buried their dead in the clay walls of their tunnels that hid them from sight but the odor of decay was impossible to hide once it got into your nose it was equally impossible to forget bosch knew that he was headed toward something horrific that the missing victims of raynard waits were ahead somewhere in the tunnel this had been the destination on the night waits was pulled over in his work van but bosch couldnt help but think that maybe it was his own destination as well he had come many years and many miles but it seemed to him that he had never really left the tunnels behind that his life had always been a slow movement through darkness and tight spaces on the way to a flickering light he knew he was then now and forever a tunnel rat his thigh muscles burned from the strain of moving in a crouched position sweat began to sting his eyes and as he got closer to the turn in the tunnel bosch saw the light changing and rechanging and knew that this was caused by the undulation of a flame candlelight five feet from the turn bosch slowed to a stop and rested on his heels as he listened behind him he thought he could hear sirens backup on the way he tried to concentrate on what could be heard from the tunnel ahead but there was only the intermittent sound of the woman crying he raised himself up and started forward again almost immediately the light ahead went out and the whimpering took on a new energy and urgency bosch froze he then heard nervous laughter from ahead followed by the familiar voice of raynard waits is that you detective bosch welcome to my foxhole there was more laughter and then it stopped bosch let ten seconds go by waits said nothing else waits let her go send her out to me no bosch shes with me now anybody comes in here ill kill her on the spot ill save the last bullet for myself waits no listen just let her come out and i will come in well trade no bosch i like the situation the way it is then what are we doing we need to talk and you need to save yourself theres not a lot of time send the girl out a few seconds went by and then the voice came out of the darkness save myself from what for what boschs muscles were on the verge of cramping he carefully lowered himself to a seated position against the right side of the tunnel he was sure that the candlelight had been coming ahead from the left the tunnel turned to the left he kept his gun up but was now employing a crosswrists bracing with the flashlight up and ready as well theres no way out he said give it up and come out your deal is still in play you dont have to die neither does the girl i dont care about dying bosch thats why im here because i dont fucking care i just want it to be on my own terms not the states or anybody elses just mine bosch noticed that the woman had gone silent he wondered what had happened had waits silenced her had he just waits whats wrong is she all right she passed out too much excitement i guess he laughed and then was silent bosch decided that he needed to keep waits talking if he was engaged by bosch he would be distracted from the woman and what was assuredly being planned outside the tunnel i know who you are he said quietly waits didnt take the bait bosch tried again robert foxworth son of rosemary foxworth raised by the county foster homes youth halls you lived here with the saxons for a time you lived at the mclaren youth hall out in el monte so did i robert bosch was met with a long silence but then the voice came quietly out of the darkness im not robert foxworth anymore i understand i hated that place mclaren i hated them all they closed it down a couple years ago after some kid died in there fuck them and fuck that place how did you find robert foxworth bosch felt a rhythm building in the conversation he understood the cue waits was giving by speaking of robert foxworth as someone other than himself he was raynard waits now it wasnt that hard bosch answered we figured it out through the fitzpatrick case we found the pawn slip in the records and matched birth dates what was the heirloom medallion that had been pawned there was a long silence before an answer it was rosemarys it was all he had from her he had to pawn it and when he went back to get it that pig fitzpatrick had already sold it bosch nodded he had waits answering questions but there wasnt a lot of time he decided to jump to the present raynard tell me about the setup tell me about olivas and oshea there was only silence bosch tried again they used you oshea used you and hes going to just walk away from it is that what you want you die here in this hole and he just walks away bosch put the flashlight down so he could wipe the sweat out of his eyes he then had to feel around on the floor of the tunnel to find it again i cant give you oshea or olivas waits said in the darkness bosch didnt get it was he wrong he doubled back in his head and started at the beginning did you kill marie gesto there was a long silence no i didnt waits finally said then how was this set up how could you know where think about it bosch theyre not stupid they would not directly communicate with me bosch nodded he understood maury swann he said he brokered the deal tell me about it whats to tell it was a setup man he said the whole thing was to make you a believer he said you were bothering the wrong people and had to be convinced what people he didnt tell me that this is maury swann saying this yes but it doesnt matter you cant get to him either this is communication between a lawyer and his client you cant touch it its privileged besides it would be my word against his that wont go anywhere and you know it bosch did know it maury swann was a tough lawyer and a respected member of the bar he was also a media darling there was no way to go after him with just the words of a criminal clientand a serial killer at that it had been a masterstroke by oshea and olivas to use him as the gobetween i dont care bosch said i want to know how it all went down tell me a long silence went by before waits responded swann went to them with the idea of making a deal my clearing the books in exchange for my life he did this without my knowledge if he had asked me i would have said dont bother id rather take the needle than forty years in a cell you understand that bosch youre an eyeforaneye guy i like that about you believe it or not he ended it there and bosch had to prompt him again so then what happened one night in the jail i was taken to the attorney room and there was maury he told me there was a deal on the table but he said it would only work if i threw in a freebie admit to one i didnt do he told me that there would be a field trip and i would have to lead a certain detective to the body this detective had to be convinced and leading him to the body would be the only way to do it that detective was you bosch and you said yes when he said there would be a field trip i said yes that was the only reason it meant daylight i saw a chance at daylight and you were led to believe that this offer this dealthat it came directly from olivas and oshea who else would it come from did maury swann ever use their names in connection with the deal he said this is what they wanted me to do he said it came directly from them they would not make a deal if i didnt throw in the freebie i had to throw in gesto and take you to her or there was no fucking deal you get it bosch nodded yeah i got it he felt his face getting hot with anger he tried to channel it put it aside so that it was ready to be used but not at this moment how did you get the details you gave me during the confession swann he got them from them he said they had the records from the original investigation and he told you how to find the body up there in the woods swann told me there were markers in the woods he showed me pictures and told me how to lead everybody there it was easy the night before my confession i studied up on everything bosch was silent as he thought about how easily he had been led down the path he had wanted something so badly and for so long that it had made him blind and what were you supposed to get out of all of this raynard you mean what was in it for me from their point of view my life man they were offering me my life take it or leave it but the truth is i didnt care about that i told you man when maury said thered be a field trip i knew that i might have a chance to get away and to visit my my foxhole one last time that was enough for me i didnt care about anything else i didnt care if i died trying either bosch tried to think of what he should do or ask next he thought about using his cell to call the district attorney or a judge and have waits confess over the phone he put the flashlight down again and reached into his pocket but then he remembered he had dropped his phone when he had jumped onto rachel as the shooting broke out in the garage are you still there detective im here what about marie gesto did swann tell you why you had to confess to the marie gesto killing waits laughed he didnt have to it was pretty obvious that the fix was in whoever did gesto was trying to get you off his back no name was mentioned no no name bosch shook his head he had nothing nothing on oshea or anthony garland or anybody else he looked down the tunnel in the direction of the garage he could see nothing but he knew that there would be people there they had blacked out that end to prevent backlighting he knew they would be coming at any moment what about your escape he asked in order to keep the dialogue going was that planned or were you just improvising a little of both i met with swann the night before the field trip he told me how i would lead you to the body he showed me the photos and told me about the markings in the trees and how they would begin after we came to where there had been a mud slide and we would have to climb down thats when i knew i knew i might have a chance then so i told him to make them uncuff me if i had to do any climbing i told him that i wouldnt follow through on the deal if i had to do any climbing with my hands cuffed to my sides bosch remembered oshea overruling olivas and telling him to take the cuffs off olivass reluctance had all been a play for boschs benefit everything had been a play for his benefit everything was phony and he had been played perfectly bosch heard the sound of men crawling behind him in the tunnel he turned the flashlight on and saw them it was the swat team black kevlar automatic rifles nightvision goggles they were coming any moment they would launch a flashbang grenade into the tunnel and start coming he turned the light out he thought about the woman he knew waits would kill her the moment they made the move were you really at mclaren waits asked i was there it was before your time but i was there i was in b dorm it was closest to the baseball fields so we always got there first at rec time and got the best equipment it was a youhadtobethere story the best bosch could think of in the moment he had spent most of his life trying to forget about mclaren maybe you were there bosch i was and look at us now you went your way and i went mine i guess i fed the wrong dog what do you mean what dog you dont remember at mclaren they used to pass around that saying about every man having two dogs inside one good and one bad they fight all the time because only one can be the alpha dog the one in charge and and the one that wins is always the dog you chose to feed i fed the wrong one you fed the right one bosch didnt know what to say he heard a click from behind him in the tunnel they were going to launch the grenade he quickly stood up hopeful that they would not shoot him in the back waits im coming in no bosch ill give you my gun watch the light ill give you my gun he switched on the flashlight and played its beam on the turn in the tunnel ahead he moved forward and when he got to the turn extended his left hand into the cone of light he held his gun by the barrel so waits could see it was no threat im coming in now bosch took the turn and entered the final chamber of the tunnel the space was at least twelve feet wide but still not tall enough for him to stand in he dropped to his knees and swept the chamber with his light the dim amber beam revealed a ghastly sight of bones and skulls and decaying flesh and hair the stench was overpowering and bosch had to hold himself from gagging the beam came to the face of the man bosch had known as raynard waits he was propped against the far wall of his foxhole sitting on what looked like a throne carved into the rock and clay to his left the woman he had abducted lay naked and unconscious on a blanket waits held the barrel of freddy olivass gun to her temple easy now bosch said ill give you my gun just dont hurt her anymore waits smiled knowing he was in complete control of the situation bosch you are a fool to the end bosch lowered his arm and tossed the gun to the right side of the throne as waits reached down to grab it he lifted the muzzle of the other gun off the woman bosch dropped the flashlight and reached behind him at the same time his hand finding the grip of the revolver he had taken from the blind woman the long barrel made his aim true he fired twice hitting waits in the center of the chest with both rounds waits was knocked back against the wall bosch saw his eyes go wide then they lost that light that separates life from death his chin dropped and his head tilted forward bosch crawled to the woman and checked her for a pulse she was still alive he covered her with the blanket she was lying on he then called out to the others in the tunnel this is boschrhd its clear we are clear raynard waits is dead a bright light flashed on around the corner in the entrance tunnel it was a blinding light and he knew the men with guns would be waiting on the other side of it no matter he felt safe now he slowly moved toward the light after emerging from the tunnel bosch was led out of the garage by two swat officers wearing gas masks he was delivered into the hands of the waiting members of the fugitive task force and others associated with the case randolph and osani from ois were on hand as well as abel pratt from the openunsolved unit bosch looked around for rachel walling but didnt see her anywhere on the scene next out of the tunnel was waitss last victim the young woman was carried to a waiting ambulance and immediately transported to countyusc medical center for assessment and treatment bosch was pretty sure his own imagination couldnt top the real horrors she had lived through but he knew the important thing was that she was alive the task force leader wanted bosch to sit in a van and tell his story but bosch said he didnt want to be in a closed space even out in the open air on figueroa lane he couldnt get the smell of the tunnel out of his nose and he noticed that the task force members who had crowded around him at first had now all taken a step or two back he saw a garden hose attached to a faucet alongside the stairway of the house next to he went over turned it on and then bent over as he ran the water through his hair on his face and down his neck it pretty much soaked his clothes but he didnt care it washed away a good deal of the dirt and sweat and stench and he knew the clothes were trash now anyway the task force top was a sergeant named bob mcdonald who had been pulled in from hollywood division luckily bosch knew him from past days in the division and that set the stage for a cordial debriefing bosch realized it was just a warmup he would have to submit to a formal interview with randolph and the ois before the end of the day wheres the fbi agent bosch asked wheres rachel walling shes being interviewed mcdonald said were using a neighbors house for her and the old lady upstairs in the house mcdonald nodded shes fine mcdonald said shes blind and in a wheelchair theyre still talking to her but it turns out waits lived here when he was a kid it was a foster home and his real name is robert foxworth she cant get around by herself anymore so she pretty much stays up there county assistance brings in her food foxworth helped her out financially by renting the garage he kept supplies for window washing in there and an old van its got a wheelchair lift in it bosch nodded he guessed that janet saxon had no idea what else her former foster son used her garage for mcdonald told bosch it was time to tell his story and so he did giving the stepbystep playback of the moves he had made after discovering the connection between waits and the pawnbroker fitzpatrick there were no questions not yet nobody asked why he never called the task force or randolph or pratt or anybody else they listened and simply locked in his story bosch was not too concerned he and rachel had saved the girl and he had killed the bad guy he was sure that these two accomplishments would allow him to rise above all transgressions upon protocol and regulations and save his job it took him twenty minutes to tell the story and then mcdonald said they should take a break as the group around him splintered bosch saw his boss waiting to get to him bosch knew this conversation would not be easy pratt finally saw an opening and walked up he looked anxious well harry what did he tell you in there bosch was surprised pratt wasnt jumping all over him for acting on his own without authority but he wasnt going to complain about it in abbreviated form he outlined what he had learned from waits about the setup in beachwood canyon he told me it was all orchestrated through swann he said swann was the gobetween he took the deal from olivas and oshea to waits waits didnt kill gesto but agreed to take the fall for her it was part of the deal for avoiding the death penalty thats it thats enough isnt it why would olivas and oshea do this the oldest reasons in the book money and power and the garland family has plenty of both anthony garland was the person of interest on gesto right the guy who got the court orders keeping you away yeah until olivas and oshea used waits to convince me otherwise you got anything besides what waits said in there bosch shook his head not much i traced twentyfive thousand in contributions to osheas campaign back to t rex garlands lawyers and oil company but it was all done legally it proves a connection nothing else twentyfive seems cheap to me it is but the twentyfive is all we know about we do some digging and therell probably be more you tell all of this to mcdonald and his crew only what waits told me in there i didnt tell them about the contributions only what waits said you think theyll go after maury swann for this bosch thought a moment before answering not a chance whatever was said between them was privileged information besides that nobody would go after him based on the word of a dead madman like waits pratt kicked the ground he had nothing else to say or ask look top im sorry about this bosch said about not being upfront with you on what i was doing the home duty and everything pratt waved it off its okay man you got lucky you ended up doing some good and taking out the bad guy what am i going to say to that bosch nodded his thanks besides im coasting pratt continued another three weeks and youll be someone elses problem he can decide what to do with you whether kiz rider came back or not bosch didnt want to leave the unit hed heard that david lambkin the new top coming up from rhd was a good man to work for bosch hoped when all of this shook out hed still be part of the openunsolved unit holy shit pratt whispered bosch followed his eyes to a car that had just parked on the perimeter near where the media trucks were and the reporters were setting up for standups and sound bites rick oshea was getting out of the passenger side bosch felt the bile immediately rise in his throat he made a move to walk toward the prosecutor but pratt caught his arm harry take it easy what the fuck is he doing here its his case man he can come if he wants and you better play it cool dont show your hand with him or you might never be able to get to him and what meantime he does his dance in front of the cameras and turns this into another campaign commercial bullshit what i ought to do is go over there and kick his ass right in front of the cameras yeah that would be real smart harry very subtle that will help the situation a lot bosch broke free of pratts grasp but simply stepped over and leaned against one of the police cars he folded his arms and kept his head down until he was calmer he knew pratt was right just keep him away from me that will be kind of hard because hes coming right to you bosch looked up just as oshea and the two men that made up his entourage got to him detective bosch are you okay never better bosch kept his arms folded across his chest he didnt want one of his hands getting loose and involuntarily taking a swing at oshea thank you for what you have done here today thank you for saving the young woman bosch just nodded while looking down at the ground oshea turned to the men with him and to pratt who had remained nearby in case he had to pull bosch off the prosecutor could i speak to detective bosch alone osheas minions walked off pratt hesitated until bosch nodded to him telling him everything was cool bosch and oshea were left to themselves detective ive been briefed on what waitsor i should say foxworthrevealed to you in the tunnel good i hope you do not give any credence to what an admitted and confirmed serial killer would say about the men who were prosecuting him especially one who cannot even be here to defend himself bosch stepped away from the patrol cars fender and finally dropped his arms to his sides his hands were balled into fists youre talking about your pal olivas yes i am and i can tell by your posture that you actually believe what foxworth allegedly told you allegedly what now im the one making it up someone is bosch leaned a few inches toward him and spoke in a low voice oshea get away from me i might hit you the prosecutor took a step backwards as if he had already been punched youre wrong bosch he was lying he was confirming what i already knew before i even went into that tunnel olivas was dirty he put the entry in the murder book that falsely tied raynard waits to gesto he went out there and marked a trail for waits to follow and lead us to the body and he wouldnt have done any of it without somebody telling him to do it he wasnt that kind of guy he wasnt smart enough oshea stared at him for a long moment the implication in boschs words was clear i cant dissuade you from this bullshit can i bosch looked at him and then looked away dissuade not a chance and i dont care what it does or doesnt do for the campaign mr prosecutor those are the undisputed facts and i dont need foxworth or what he said to prove them then i guess ill have to appeal to a higher authority than you bosch took half a step closer to him this time he really got into his space you smell that you smell that on me thats the fucking putrid smell of death ive got it all over me oshea but at least i can wash it off what is that supposed to mean whatever you want it to mean whos your higher authority you going to call t rex garland up in his shiny office oshea took a deep breath and shook his head in confusion detective i dont know what happened to you in that tunnel but you arent making much sense bosch nodded yeah well it will make sense soon enough before the election thats for sure help me out bosch what exactly am i missing here i dont think youre missing anything you know it all oshea and before its all over so will the whole wide world somehow some way im going to take down you and the garlands and everybody else who had a part in this count on it now oshea took a step toward bosch are you saying that i did this that i set all of this up for t rex garland bosch started laughing oshea was the consummate actor to the end youre good he said ill give you that youre good t rex garland is a valid contributor to my campaign upfront and legal how you can tie that into then why the fuck didnt you mention he was a valid and legal contributor when i brought up his son the other day and told you he was my suspect on gesto because it would have complicated things i have never met or even spoken to either of the garlands t rex contributed to my campaign so what the guy spreads money through every election in the county for me to bring it up at that point would have been to invite your suspicion i didnt want that now i see i have it anyway you are so full of shit you fuck you bosch there is no connection then weve got nothing else to say yes we do ive got something to say take your best shot with this bullshit and well see who comes out at the end still standing he turned and walked away barking an order to his men he wanted a telephone with a secured line bosch wondered who the first call would go to t rex garland or the chief of police bosch made a snap decision he would call keisha russell and turn her loose he would tell her she was clear to look into those campaign contributions garland had funneled to oshea he put his hand into his pocket and then remembered that his phone was still somewhere in the garage he walked that way and stopped at the yellow tape that was strung across the now fully opened door behind the white van cal cafarelli was in the garage directing the forensic analysis of the scene she had a breathingfilter mask down around her neck bosch could tell by her face that she had been to the macabre scene at the end of the tunnel and she would never be the same again he waved her over hows it going cal its going about as well as youd expect after seeing something like that yeah i know were going to be here long into the night what can i do for you harry have you found a cell phone somewhere in here i lost my phone when things started happening she pointed to the floor near the front tire of the van is that it over there bosch looked over and saw his phone lying on the concrete the red message light was blinking he noticed that someone had circled it on the concrete with chalk that was not good bosch didnt want his phone inventoried as evidence he might never get it back can i get it back i need it im sorry harry not yet this place hasnt been photographed were starting with the tunnel and moving out from there it will be a while then how about if you give it to me and i use it right here and then i give it back when its time to take photos it looks like ive got messages waiting harry come on he knew that his suggestion would break about four rules of evidence okay just let me know when i can get it back hopefully before the batterys dead you got it harry he turned away from the garage and saw rachel walling walking toward the yellow tape that delineated the outside perimeter of the crime scene there was a federal cruiser there and a man in a suit and sunglasses was waiting for her she had apparently called for a ride bosch trotted toward the tape calling her name she stopped and waited for him harry she said are you all right i am now how about you rachel im fine what happened to you she indicated his wet clothes with her hand i had to hose off it was bad i need about a twohour shower are you leaving yes theyre done with me for the time being bosch nodded toward the man in the sunglasses ten feet behind her are you in trouble he asked quietly i dont know yet i should be all right you got the bad guy and saved the girl how can that be a bad thing we got the bad guy and saved the girl bosch corrected but there are people in every institution and bureaucracy who can find a way to turn something good into shit she looked him in the eyes and nodded i know she said her look froze him and he knew they were now different are you mad at me rachel mad no then what then nothing i have to go will you call me then when i can goodbye harry she took two steps toward the waiting car but then stopped and turned back to him that was oshea you were talking to out by the car wasnt it yeah be careful harry if you let your emotions run you the way they did out here today oshea could put you in a world of pain bosch smiled slightly you know what they say about pain dont you no what they say pain is weakness leaving the body she shook her head well they are full of shit dont put it to the test unless you have to goodbye harry ill see you rachel he watched as the man in sunglasses held the tape up for her to duck under she got into the front passenger seat and sunglasses drove them off bosch knew that something had changed in the way she saw him his actions in the garage and going into the tunnel had made her change her mind about him he accepted it and guessed that he might never see her again he decided that it would be one more thing that he would blame on rick oshea he turned back to the scene where randolph and osani were standing waiting for him randolph was putting away his cell phone you two again bosch said gettin to be like déjà vu all over again isnt it randolph said something like that detective we are going to need to take you over to parker center and conduct a more formal interview this time around bosch nodded he knew the drill this time it wasnt about shooting into the trees or the woods he had killed somebody so this time it would be different they would need to nail down every detail im ready to go he said bosch was seated in an interview room in the officer involved shooting unit at parker center randolph had allowed him to shower in the basement locker room and hed changed into blue jeans and a black west coast choppers sweatshirt clothing he kept in a locker for the times he was downtown and unexpectedly needed to fly below the radar that a suit would bring on the way out of the locker room he had dumped his contaminated suit into a trash can he would now be down to two the tape recorder on the table was turned on and from separate sheets of paper osani read to him his constitutional rights as well as the police officers bill of rights the double insulation of protections was designed to safeguard the individual and police office from the unfair assault of the government but bosch knew that when push came to shove in one of these little rooms neither piece of paper would do much to protect him he had to fend for himself he said he understood his rights and agreed to be interviewed randolph took over from there at his request bosch once more told the story of the shooting of robert foxworth aka raynard waits beginning with the discovery made during the review of records from the fitzpatrick case and ending with the two bullets he fired into foxworths chest randolph asked few questions until bosch was finished going through the story then he asked many detailed questions about the moves bosch had made in the garage and then the tunnel more than once he asked bosch why he didnt listen to the cautioning words of fbi agent rachel walling this question told bosch not only that rachel had been interviewed by the ois but also that she had not said things particularly favorable to his case this disappointed bosch greatly but he tried to keep his thoughts and feelings about rachel out of the interview room to randolph he repeated as a mantra a sentence that he believed would ultimately win the day for him no matter what randolph or rachel or anyone else thought of his actions and procedures it was a lifeordeath situation a woman was in jeopardy and we had been fired upon i felt that i could not wait around for backup or anybody else i did what i had to do i used as much caution as i could and used deadly force only when necessary randolph moved on and focused many of the next questions on the actual shooting of robert foxworth he asked bosch what he was thinking when foxworth revealed that bosch had been set up to believe that the gesto case was solved he asked bosch what he was thinking when he saw the remains of foxworths victims positioned in the chamber at the end of the tunnel he asked bosch what he was thinking when he pulled the trigger and killed the defiler and murderer of those victims bosch patiently answered each question but finally hit his limit something was offkilter about the interview it was almost as if randolph were working from a script whats going on here bosch asked im sitting here telling you people everything what arent you telling me randolph looked at osani and then back at bosch he leaned forward arms on the table he had a habit of turning a gold ring on his left hand bosch had noticed him doing it last time he knew it was a usc ring big deal a lot of the departments ruling class had gone through night school at usc randolph looked back at osani and reached over to turn the tape recorder off but held his fingers on the buttons detective osani could you go get us a couple bottles of water all this talking and my voice is about to go probably the same with detective bosch too well hold up until you get back osani got up to leave and randolph turned off the recorder he didnt speak until the interview room door was closed the thing is detective bosch we only have your word on what happened in that tunnel the female was unconscious there were only you and foxworth and he didnt make it out alive thats right are you saying my word is not acceptable im saying that your description of events might be perfectly acceptable but the forensics might come in with an interpretation that varies from your statement you see it can get messy very quickly things can be left open to interpretation and misinterpretation public and political interpretation as well bosch shook his head he didnt understand what was happening so what he said i dont care what the public or politicians think waits pushed the action in that tunnel it was clearly a killorbekilled situation and i did what i had to do but there is no witness to your description of events what about agent walling she didnt go into the tunnel she warned you not to go in you know theres a woman over at countyusc who probably wouldnt be alive right now if i hadnt gone in what is going on here lieutenant randolph started playing with his ring again he looked like a man with a distaste for what his duty called on him to do thats probably enough for today youve been through a lot what were going to do is keep things open for a few days while we wait for the forensics to come in youll continue on home duty once we have everything in order ill bring you in to read and sign your statement i asked whats going on lieutenant and i told you whats going on you didnt tell me enough randolph took his hand away from his ring it had the effect of underlining with importance what he would say next you rescued the hostage and brought a resolution to the case thats good but you were reckless in your actions and got lucky if we believe your story then you shot a man who was threatening the lives of you and others the facts and forensics however might just as easily lead to another interpretation perhaps one that indicates the man you shot was attempting to surrender so what were going to do is take our time with it in a few days well get it right and then well let you know bosch studied him knowing that he was delivering a message that was not so hidden in his words this is about olivas isnt it the funerals set for tomorrow the chief is going to be there and you want to keep olivas a hero killed in the line of duty randolph went back to turning his ring no detective bosch you have that wrong if olivas was dirty then nobody is going to bend over backwards to worry about his reputation bosch nodded he now had it then its about oshea he reached out to a higher authority he told me he would that authority then reached out to you randolph leaned back in his chair and seemed to search the ceiling for a proper reply there are a great number of people in this department as well as the community who believe rick oshea would make a fine district attorney he said they also believe he would be a good friend to have on the side of the lapd bosch closed his eyes and slowly shook his head he couldnt believe what he was hearing randolph continued his opponent gabriel williams has allied himself with an antilaw enforcement constituency it would not be a good day for the lapd if he were to be elected bosch opened his eyes and stared at randolph youre actually going to do this he asked youre going to let this guy skate because you think he could be a friend to the department randolph shook his head sadly i dont know what you are talking about detective im simply making a political observation but i do know this there is no evidence real or imagined of this conspiracy you speak of if you think that robert foxworths attorney will do anything other than deny the conversation you have outlined here then you would be a fool so dont be a fool be wise keep it to yourself bosch took a moment to compose himself who made the call on this excuse me how high up did oshea reach it couldnt have been directly to you he would have gone higher who told you to knock me down randolph spread his hands and shook his head detective i have no idea what you are talking about right of course not bosch stood up then i guess youll write it up the way youve been told and ill either sign it or i wont simple as that randolph nodded but said nothing bosch leaned down and put both hands on the table so he could get close to his face you going to deputy doolans funeral lieutenant its right after they put olivas in the ground remember him the one waits shot in the face out there i thought maybe youd be going to the funeral to explain to his family about how choices had to be made and how the man directly behind that bullet could be a friend to the department and therefore doesnt need to face the consequences of his actions randolph stared straight ahead at the wall across the table he said nothing bosch straightened up and pulled open the door startling osani who had been standing just outside he wasnt holding any water bottles bosch pushed past him and left the squad room at the elevator bosch pushed the up button he waited and paced and thought about taking his grievance up to the sixth floor he envisioned himself charging into the chief of polices suite and demanding to know if he was aware of what was being done in his name and under his command but as the elevator opened he dismissed the idea and pushed the button he knew that the byzantine levels of bureaucracy and politics in the department were impossible to fully understand if he didnt watch himself he could end up complaining about all the bullshit to the very person who created it the openunsolved unit was deserted when he got there it was just after four and most detectives worked seventofour shifts that put them on the road home before rush hour if something wasnt breaking they left at four on the dot even a fifteenminute delay could cost them an hour on the freeways the only one still around was abel pratt and that was because as a supervisor he had to work eight to five company rules bosch waved as he walked by the open door of pratts office on the way to his desk bosch dropped into his chair exhausted by the days events and the weight of the departmental fix he looked down and saw that his desk was littered with pink phone message slips he started looking through them most were from colleagues in different divisions and stations they were all callbacks bosch knew they wanted to say nice shooting or words to that effect anytime anybody got a clean kill the phones lit up there were several messages from reporters including keisha russell bosch knew he owed her a call but would wait until he got home there was also a message from irene gesto and bosch guessed that she and her husband wanted to know if there was any update on the investigation he had called them the night before to tell them that their daughter had been found and the id confirmed he put that slip in his pocket home duty or not he would make the call back to them with the autopsy completed the body would be released and at the very least they could finally after thirteen years claim their daughter and take her home he could not tell them that their daughters killer had been brought to justice but at least he could help them get her home there was also a message from jerry edgar and bosch remembered that his old partner had called his cell right before the shooting had gone down in echo park whoever had taken the message had written says its important on the slip and underlined it bosch checked the time on the slip and noted that this call had come in before the shooting as well edgar had not been calling to congratulate him on taking out a bad guy he assumed that edgar had heard that harry had met his cousin and that he wanted to chew the fat about it at the moment bosch didnt feel up for that bosch wasnt interested in any of the other messages so he stacked them and put them in a desk drawer nothing else to do he then started straightening the papers and files on his desk he thought about whether he should call forensics and see about getting his phone and car back from the echo park crime scene i just got the word bosch looked up pratt was standing in the doorway of his office he was in shirtsleeves his tie loose at his neck what word from ois you havent cleared home duty harry i gotta send you home bosch looked back down at his desk so whats new im leaving pratt paused as he tried to interpret boschs tone of voice everything okay harry he asked tentatively nope everythings not okay the fix is in and when the fix is in then everythings not okay not by a long shot what are you talking about theyre going to cover up olivas and oshea bosch looked up at him i dont think i should talk to you about it top it could put you in a spot you wouldnt want the blowback theyre that serious about it huh bosch hesitated but then answered yeah theyre serious theyre willing to jam me up if i dont play the game he stopped there he didnt want to be having this conversation with his supervisor in pratts position loyalties went both up and down the ladder it didnt matter if he was only a few weeks from retirement pratt had to play the game until the buzzer sounded my cell is back there part of the crime scene he said reaching for the phone i just came in to make a phone call and then im out of here i was wondering about your phone pratt said some of the guys have been trying to call you and they said you werent answering forensics wouldnt let me take it from the scene the phone or my car what did they want i think they wanted to take you out for a drink at nats they might still be heading over there nats was a dive off hollywood boulevard it wasnt a cop bar but a fair number of offduty cops passed through there on any given night enough for the management to keep the clashs hardedged version of i fought the law on the jukebox for going on twenty years now bosch knew that if he showed up at nats the punk anthem would be in heavy if not inappropriate rotation in salute to the recently dispatched robert foxworth aka raynard waits i fought the law but the law won bosch could almost hear them all singing the chorus you going he asked pratt maybe later ive got something to do first bosch nodded i dont think i feel like it he said im going to pass suit yourself theyll understand pratt didnt move from the doorway so bosch picked up his phone he called jerry edgars number just so he could follow through on the lie he had told about having to make a call but pratt remained in the doorway his arm leaning against the jamb as he surveyed the empty squad room he was really trying to get bosch out of there maybe he had gotten the word from higher up the ladder than lieutenant randolph edgar answered the call its bosch you called yeah man i called ive been a little busy i know i heard nice shooting today partner you okay yeah fine what were you calling about just something i thought you might want to know i dont know if it matters anymore what was it bosch said impatiently my cousin jason called me from dwp he said you saw him today yeah nice guy he helped a lot yeah well i wasnt checking on how he treated you im trying to tell you that he called me and said there was something you might want to know but you didnt give him a business card or a number or anything he said that about five minutes after you and the fbi agent you were with left another cop came and asked for him asked at the lobby desk for the guy who was just helping the cops bosch leaned forward at his desk he was suddenly very interested in what edgar was telling him he said this guy showed a badge and said he was monitoring your investigation and he asked jason what you and the agent had wanted my cousin took him up to the floor you people had gone to and walked this guy out to the window they were standing there looking down on the house in echo park when you and the lady agent showed up down there they watched you go into the garage then what happened the guy ran out of there grabbed an elevator and went down did your cousin get a name off this guy yeah the guy said his name was detective smith when he held up his id he sort of had his fingers over the part with his name it was an old ploy bosch knew used mostly when detectives were going off the reservation and didnt want their real name out in circulation bosch had used it himself on occasion what about a description he asked yeah he gave me all that he said white guy about six feet and oneeighty the guy had silvergray hair he kept cut short lets see midfifties and he was wearing a blue suit white shirt and a striped tie he had an american flag on the lapel the description matched about fifty thousand men in the immediate vicinity of downtown and bosch was looking at one of them abel pratt was still standing in his office doorway he was staring at bosch with eyebrows raised in question he wasnt wearing his suit jacket but bosch could see it on a hook on the door behind him there was an american flag pinned to the lapel bosch looked back down at his desk how late does he work to he asked quietly normally i think he stays till five but theres a bunch of people hanging up there watching the scene in echo park okay thanks for the tip ill call you later bosch hung up before edgar could say anything else he looked up and pratt was still staring at him what was that he asked oh just something on the matarese case the one we filed this week it looks like we might have a witness after all it will help at trial bosch said it as nonchalantly as he could he stood up and looked at his boss but dont worry it will hold until i get back from home duty good glad to hear it bosch walked toward pratt he came too close to him invading his personal space which caused pratt to back into his office and move back to his desk this was what bosch wanted he said goodbye and have a good weekend he then headed toward the door of the squad room the openunsolved unit had three cars assigned to its eight detectives and one supervisor the cars were used on a firstcome firstserved basis and the keys hung on hooks next to the squad room door the procedure was for a detective taking a car to write his or her name and the estimated time of return on an erasable white board that hung below the keys when bosch got to the door he opened it wide to block the view from pratts office of the key hooks there were two sets of keys on the hooks bosch grabbed one and left a few minutes later he pulled out of the garage behind parker center and headed toward the dwp building the mad rush to empty downtown by sunset was only just beginning and he made it the seven blocks in quick time he parked illegally in front of the fountain at the entrance to the building and jumped out of his car he checked his watch as he approached the front door it was twenty minutes to five a uniformed security guard came through the doors waving at him you cant park i know bosch showed him his badge and pointed to the radio on the mans belt can you get jason edgar on that thing edgar yeah whats this get him on there and tell him detective bosch is waiting out front i need to see him as soon as possible do it now please bosch turned and headed back to his car he got in and waited five minutes before he saw jason edgar come through the glass doors when he got to the car he opened the passenger door to look in not get in whats up harry i got your message get in edgar reluctantly got in the car bosch pulled away from the curb as he was closing his door wait a minute where are we going i cant just leave this should only take a few minutes where are we going parker center we wont even get out of the car i have to let them know edgar took a small twoway off his belt he called in at the dwp security center and said he would be offlocation on a police matter for a half hour he received a and put the radio back on his belt you shouldve asked me first he said to bosch my cousin said you had a habit of acting first and asking questions later he said that huh yeah he did what are we doing at parker center making an id of the cop who talked to you after i left today traffic had already gotten worse a lot of ninetofivers getting an early jump on the commute home friday afternoons were particularly brutal bosch finally pulled back into the police garage at ten to five and hoped they wouldnt be too late he found a parking space in the first row the garage was an openair structure and the space afforded them a view of san pedro street which ran between parker center and the garage you have a cell phone bosch asked yeah bosch gave him the general number for parker center and told him to call it and ask for the openunsolved unit calls transferred from the main number did not carry forward caller id edgars name and number would not show up on the ou lines i just want to see if somebody answers bosch said if somebody does just ask for rick jackson when youre told that hes not there dont leave a message just say youll get him on his cell and hang up edgars call was answered and he went through the routine bosch had outlined when he was finished he looked over at bosch somebody named pratt answered good hes still there so whats that mean i wanted to make sure he hadnt left hell leave at five and when he does hell cross the street right over there i want to see if hes the guy who told you he was monitoring my investigation is he iad no hes my boss bosch slapped the visor down as a precaution against being seen they were parked a good thirty yards from the crosswalk pratt would use to get to the garage but he didnt know which way pratt would go once he was inside the structure as a squad supervisor he had the perk of being able to park a personal car in the police garage and most of those assigned spaces were on the second level there were two sets of stairs and the ramp up if pratt walked up the ramp he would come right by boschs position edgar asked questions about the echo park shooting and bosch answered them in short sentences he didnt want to talk about it but he had just yanked the guy off post and had to respond in some way it was only being courteous finally at he saw pratt come through the back doors of parker center and down the ramp by the jails intake doors he walked out to san pedro and started to cross with a group of four other detective supervisors who were heading home as well okay bosch said cutting edgar off in the middle of a question see those guys crossing the street which one came to dwp today edgar studied the pack crossing the street he had an unobstructed view of pratt who was walking next to another man at the back of the group yeah the last guy edgar said without hesitation the one puttin on the shades bosch looked over pratt had just put on his raybans bosch felt a deep pressure in his chest like the worst case of heartburn hed ever had he kept his eyes on pratt and watched him turn away from their position once he crossed the street he was heading toward the far stairwell now what you going to follow him bosch remembered pratt saying he had something to do after work i want to but i cant ive got to shoot you back to dwp dont worry about it man i can walk it probably be faster with this traffic anyway edgar cracked his door and turned to get out he looked back at bosch i dont know whats going on but good luck harry i hope you get who youre looking for thanks jason hope to see you again after edgar was clear bosch backed out and left the garage he took san pedro over to temple because he assumed that pratt would take that route on his way to the freeway whether he was going home or not the freeway was the likely choice bosch crossed temple and pulled to the curb in a red zone it gave him a good angle on the exit to the police garage in two minutes a silver suv came out of the garage and headed toward temple it was a jeep commander with a retro boxy design bosch identified pratt behind the wheel he immediately fit the dimensions and color of the commander to those of the mystery suv he had seen take off from the street near his house the night before bosch leaned down across the seat as the commander approached temple he heard it make the turn and after a few seconds he got back up behind the wheel pratt was on temple up at the light at los angeles street and he was turning right bosch waited until he completed the turn and then took off to follow pratt entered the crowded northbound lanes of the freeway and joined the crawl of rushhour traffic bosch came down the ramp and pushed into the line of cars about six vehicles behind the jeep he got lucky in that pratts vehicle had a white ball with a face on it atop the radio antenna it was a giveaway promotion from a fastfood chain it allowed bosch to track the jeep without having to get too close he was in an unmarked crown vic which might as well have had a neon sign on its roof that flashed police slowly but surely pratt made his way north with bosch following at a distance when the freeway cut past echo park he looked up to the ridgeline and saw that the crime scene and media soirée on figueroa lane was still in full swing he counted two media choppers still circling overhead he wondered if his car would be towed from the scene or if he would be able to go back and retrieve it later as he drove bosch tried to piece together what he had on pratt there was little doubt that pratt had been following him while he was on home duty his suv matched the suv that had been on his street the night before and pratt had been ided by jason edgar as the cop who had followed him into the dwp building it was not feasible to think that he had been following bosch simply to see if he was abiding by the rules of home duty there had to be another reason and bosch could think of only one thing the case once hed made this assumption other things quickly came together and they served to only stoke the fire that was burning in boschs chest pratt had told the story about maury swann earlier in the week and that made it clear they knew each other while he had relayed a negative story about the defense attorney that could have been a cover or an attempt to distance himself from someone he was actually close to and possibly working with also obvious to bosch was the fact that pratt was intimately aware that bosch had regarded anthony garland as a person of interest in the gesto case bosch had routinely informed pratt of his activities in reopening the case pratt was also notified when garlands lawyers successfully reacquired a court order restraining bosch from talking to garland without one of his lawyers present last and perhaps most important pratt had access to the gesto murder book it sat most of the time on boschs desk it could have been pratt who put in the phony connection to robert saxon aka raynard waits he could have planted the connection long before the book was given to olivas he could have planted it so olivas would discover it bosch realized that the whole plan for raynard waits to confess to the murder of marie gesto and to lead investigators to the body could have completely originated with abel pratt he was in a perfect position as a gobetween who could monitor bosch as well as all the other parties involved and he realized that with swann part of the plan pratt wouldnt need olivas or oshea the more people in a conspiracy the more likely it is that it will fail or fall apart all swann had to do was tell waits that the prosecutor and investigator were behind it and he would have planted a false trail for someone like bosch to follow bosch felt the hot flash of guilt start to burn at the back of his neck he realized that he could be wrong about everything he had been thinking until a half hour before totally wrong olivas might not be dirty after all maybe he had been used as skillfully as bosch had been used himself and maybe oshea was guilty of nothing more than political maneuveringtaking credit where it was not due him redirecting blame away from where it was due oshea could have called for the department fix simply to contain boschs accusations because they would be politically damaging not because they were true bosch thought this new theory through again and it held up he found no air in the brake lines no sand in the gas tank it was a car that could drive the only thing missing was motive why would a guy who banked twentyfive years with the department and was looking at retiring at fifty risk it all on a scheme like this how could a guy who had spent twentyfive years chasing bad guys let a killer go free bosch knew from working a thousand murders that motive was often the most elusive component of crime obviously money could motivate and the disintegration of a marriage could play a part but those were unfortunate common denominators in many peoples lives they could not readily explain why abel pratt had broken across the line bosch banged the palm of his hand hard on the steering wheel the question of motive aside he was embarrassed and angry with himself pratt had played him perfectly and the betrayal was deep and painful pratt was his boss they had eaten together worked cases together told jokes and talked about their kids together pratt was heading toward a retirement that no one in the department believed was anything other than wellearned and welldeserved it was time to doubledip collect a department pension and grab a lucrative security job in the islands where the pay was high and the hours low everybody was shooting for that and no one would begrudge it it was blue heaven the policemans dream but now bosch saw through all of that its all bullshit he said out loud in the car thirty minutes into the drive pratt exited the freeway in the cahuenga pass he took barham boulevard northeast into burbank the traffic was still thick and bosch had no trouble following and maintaining his distance and cover pratt drove past the back entrance to universal and the front entrance to warner bros he then made a few quick turns and pulled to the curb in front of a row of town houses on catalina near verdugo bosch drove on by quickly took his first right and then another and then another he killed his lights before taking one more right and coming up on the town houses again he pulled to the curb a half block behind pratts suv and slid down in his seat almost immediately bosch saw pratt standing in the street looking both ways before crossing but he was taking too long to do it the street was clear but pratt kept looking back and forth he was looking for someone or checking to see if he had been followed bosch knew that the hardest thing in the world to do was to follow a cop who was looking for it he slouched down lower in the car finally pratt started across the street still looking back and forth continuously and when he got to the other curb he turned and stepped up onto it backwards he took a few steps back surveying the area in both directions when his scan came to boschs car his eyes held on it for a long moment bosch froze he didnt think pratt had seen himhe was slouched too far downbut he might have recognized the car as either an unmarked police cruiser or one of the cars specifically assigned to the openunsolved unit if he walked down the street to check it out bosch knew he would be caught without much of an explanation and without a gun randolph had routinely confiscated his backup weapon for a ballistics analysis in regard to the shooting of robert foxworth pratt started walking toward boschs car bosch grabbed the door handle if he needed to he would bail out of the car and run toward verdugo where there would be traffic and people but suddenly pratt stopped his attention drawn to something behind him he turned around and looked up the steps of the town house he had been standing in front of bosch tracked his eyes and saw the front door of the town house was partially open and a woman was looking out and calling to pratt while smiling she was hiding behind the door but one of her bare shoulders was exposed her expression changed as pratt said something and signaled her back inside she put a pout on her face and stuck her tongue out at him she disappeared from the door leaving it open six inches bosch wished he had his camera but it was back in his car in echo park however he didnt need photographic evidence to know that he recognized the woman in the doorway and that she was not pratts wifebosch had met his wife at the recent squad room party when he had announced his retirement pratt looked toward boschs car again hesitated but then turned back to the town house he strode up the stairs went through the open door and shut it behind him bosch waited and as he expected saw pratt pull back a curtain and look out at the street bosch stayed down as pratts eyes lingered on the crown vic there was no doubt that the car had drawn pratts suspicion but bosch guessed that the lure of illicit sex had overpowered his instinct to check the car out there was a commotion as pratt was grabbed from behind and he turned away from the window and the curtain fell back into place bosch immediately sat up started the car and made a uturn away from the curb he took a right on verdugo and headed toward hollywood way no doubt the crown vic had been blown pratt would be actively looking for it when he came back out of the town house but the burbank airport was close bosch figured he could dump the crown vic at the airport pick up a rental car and be back to the town house in less than a half hour as he drove he tried to place the woman he had seen looking out the door of the town house he used a few mindrelaxation drills he had employed back when hypnotizing witnesses was accepted by the courts soon he was keying in on the womans nose and mouth the parts of her that had triggered his recognition center and soon after that he had it she was an attractive young civilian employee of the department who worked in the office down the hall from openunsolved it was a personnel office known by the rank and file as hiring amp firing because it was the place where both things happened pratt was fishing off the company dock waiting out the rush hour in a burbank shackup spot not bad work if you could get it and get away with it bosch wondered if mrs pratt knew of her husbands extracurricular activities he pulled into the airport and entered the valet parking lanes thinking that that would be fastest the man in the red coat who took the crown vic from him asked when he would be returning i dont know bosch said not having considered it i need to write something on the ticket the man said tomorrow bosch said if im lucky bosch got back to catalina street in thirtyfive minutes he drove his rented taurus past the row of town houses and spotted pratts jeep still at the curb this time he found a spot on the north side of the town house and parked there while he slouched down in the car and watched for activity he turned on the cell phone he had rented with the car he called rachel wallings cell number but got her voice mail he ended the call without leaving a message pratt didnt come out until it was fullon dark outside he stood in front of the complex beneath a streetlight and bosch noticed he was wearing different clothes now he had on blue jeans and a dark longsleeved pullover shirt the change of attire told bosch that the liaison with the woman from hiring amp firing was probably more than a casual shackup pratt kept clothes at her place pratt once again looked up and down the street his eyes lingering longest on the south side where earlier the crown vic had drawn his attention apparently satisfied that the car was gone and he wasnt being watched pratt went to his commander and soon pulled away from the curb he made a uturn and headed south to verdugo he then turned right bosch knew that if pratt was looking for a tail he would slow on verdugo and watch his rearview mirror for any vehicle turning off catalina in his direction so he uturned from the curb and went north a block to clark avenue he turned left and gunned the cars weak engine he drove five blocks to california street and took a quick left at the end of the block he would come to verdugo it was a risky move pratt could be long gone but bosch was playing a hunch seeing the crown vic had spooked his boss he would be on full alert bosch had called it right just as he got to verdugo he saw pratts silver commander go by in front of him he had obviously delayed on verdugo watching for a follower bosch let him get some distance and then turned right to follow pratt made no evasive moves after that first effort to smoke out a tail he stayed on verdugo into north hollywood and then turned south on cahuenga bosch almost lost him at the turn but he went through the light on red it was clear to him now that pratt was not going homebosch knew that he lived in the opposite direction in the northern valley pratt was heading toward hollywood and bosch guessed that he was simply planning to join the other members of the squad at nats but halfway through the cahuenga pass he turned right onto woodrow wilson drive and bosch felt his pulse kick up a notch pratt was now heading toward boschs own house woodrow wilson wound up the side of the santa monica mountains one deep curve after another it was a lonely street and the only way to follow a vehicle was to do it without headlights and to keep at least one curve behind the brake lights of the lead car bosch knew the curves intimately he had lived on woodrow wilson for more than fifteen years and could make the drive half asleepwhich he had done on occasion but following pratt a police officer wary of a tail was a unique difficulty bosch tried to stay two curves back this meant he lost sight of the lights on pratts car from time to time but never for very long when he was two curves away from his house bosch started to coast and the rental car eventually came to a stop before the final bend bosch got out quietly closed the door and trotted up the curve he stayed close to the hedge that guarded the home and studio of a famous painter who lived on the block he edged around it until he could see pratts suv up ahead he had pulled to the curb two houses before boschs house pratts lights were now off and he seemed to be just sitting there and watching the house bosch looked up at his house and saw lights on behind the kitchen and dining room windows he could see the tail end of a car protruding from his carport he recognized the lexus and knew that rachel walling was in his home even as he was buoyed by the prospect of her being there waiting for him bosch was concerned about what pratt was up to it appeared that he was doing exactly what he had been doing the night before just watching and possibly trying to determine if bosch was home bosch heard a car coming behind him he turned and started walking back toward his car as if he were on an evening walk the car drove by slowly and bosch then turned and headed back to the hedge as the car came up behind pratts jeep rather than pull to the side pratt took off again the lights of his suv coming on as he sped away bosch turned and ran back toward his rental car he jumped in and pulled away from the curb as he drove he hit redial on the rental phone and soon rachels line was ringing this time she answered yes rachel its harry are you in my house yes ive been wait come outside im going to pick you up hurry harry what is just come out and bring your gun right now he clicked off and pulled to a stop in front of his house he could see the glow of brake lights disappearing around the curve ahead but he knew those belonged to the car that had spooked pratt pratt was farther ahead bosch turned and looked at his front door ready to hit the horn but rachel was coming out close the door bosch yelled through the open passenger window rachel pulled the door closed and hurried out to the car get in hurry she jumped into the car and bosch took off before she had the door closed what is going on he gave her the shorthand as he sped through the curves on the way up to mulholland he told her that his boss abel pratt was the setup man that what had happened in beachwood canyon had been his plan he told her that for the second night in a row he had been outside boschs home how do you know all of this i just know ill be able to prove it all later for now its a fact what was he doing outside i dont know trying to see if i was home i think your phone rang when right before you called my cell i didnt answer it it was probably him somethings going on they came around the last bend and the fourway stop at mulholland was ahead bosch saw the taillights of a large vehicle just as they disappeared to the right another car moved up to the stop it was the car that had made pratt move on it went straight through the intersection the first one must have been pratt he turned right bosch got to the stop and also turned right mulholland was the winding snake that followed the crest line of the mountains across the city its curves were smoother and not as deep as woodrow wilsons it was also a busier street with plenty of night cruisers he would be able to follow pratt without causing much suspicion they quickly caught up to the vehicle that had turned and confirmed that it was pratts commander bosch then dropped back and for the next ten minutes tailed pratt along the crest line the sparkling lights of the valley sprawled below on the north side it was a clear night and they could see all the way to the shadowy mountains on the far side of the sprawl they stayed on mulholland through the intersection with laurel canyon boulevard and continued west i was waiting at your house to say goodbye rachel suddenly said after a moment of silence bosch responded i know i understand i dont think you do you didnt like the way i was today the way i went after waits im not the man you thought i was ive heard it before rachel its not that harry nobody is ever the man you think they are i can live with that but a woman has to feel safe with a man and that includes when they are not together how can i feel safe when ive seen firsthand how you work it doesnt matter whether it is the way i would do it or not im not talking about us cop to cop what im talking about is that i could never feel comfortable and safe id wonder every night if its the night you wont be coming home i cant do that bosch realized he was giving the car too much gas her words had made him unconsciously press the pedal down harder he was getting too close to pratt he slowed down and pulled back from the taillights a hundred yards its a dangerous job he said i thought you more than anybody would know that i do i do but what i saw out there today with you was recklessness i dont want to have to worry about someone who is reckless theres enough to worry about out there without that bosch blew out his breath he gestured toward the red lights moving in front of them okay he said lets talk about it later lets just concentrate on this for tonight as if on cue pratt hooked a hard left onto coldwater canyon drive and started dropping down toward beverly hills bosch delayed as long as he believed he could and made the same turn well im still glad ive got you with me he said why because if he ends up in beverly hills i wont need to call the locals because im with a fed glad i could do something you have your gun with you always you dont have yours it was part of the crime scene i dont know when ill get it back and thats the second gun theyve taken from me this week its gotta be a record of some kind most guns lost during reckless gunplay he looked over to see if he was getting under her skin she showed nothing hes turning she said bosch snapped his attention back to the road and saw the leftturn signal on the commander blinking pratt made the turn and bosch went on by rachel bent down so she could see out the window and up at the street sign gloaming drive she said are we still in the city yeah gloaming goes way back in there but theres no way out ive been in there before the next street down was stuart lane bosch used it to turn around in and headed back up to gloaming do you know where he could be going rachel asked no idea another girlfriends place for all i know gloaming was another curving mountain road but thats where the similarity to woodrow wilson drive ended the homes here ran a minimum seven figures easy and all had nicely manicured lawns and hedges with not so much as a leaf out of place bosch drove it slowly looking for the silver jeep commander there rachel said she pointed out her window at a jeep parked in the turnaround of a mansion with a french provincial design bosch drove by and parked two houses away they got out and walked back west coast choppers she hadnt been able to see the front of his shirt while he was driving it helped me blend in on a case once nice my daughter saw me in this one time i told her it was from my dentist the gate to the driveway was open the castiron mailbox had no name on it bosch opened it and looked inside they were in luck there was mail a small stack held together with a rubber band he pulled it out and angled the top envelope toward a nearby streetlight in order to read it mauriceits maury swanns place he said nice rachel said i guess i shouldve been a defense attorney youdve been good working with criminals fuck you bosch the banter ended with a loud voice coming from behind a tall hedge that ran along the far side of the turnaround and on the left side of the house i said get in there there was a splash and bosch and walling headed toward the sound bosch searched the hedge with his eyes looking for an opening there didnt appear to be one from the front when they got close he wordlessly signaled rachel to follow the hedge to the right while he went left he noticed that she was carrying her weapon down at her side the hedge was at least ten feet high and so thick that bosch could see no light from the pool or house through it but as he moved along it he heard the sound of splashing and voices one of which he recognized as belonging to abel pratt the voices were close please i cant swim i cant touch the bottom then what dyou have a swimming pool for keep paddling please im not going towhy would i tell a soul about youre a lawyer and lawyers like to play the angles please im telling you if i get even a hint that youre playing an angle on me then next time it wont be a pool it will be the fucking pacific ocean you understand that bosch came to an alcove where the pools filter pump and heater were located on a concrete pad there was also a small opening in the hedge for a pool maintenance man to squeeze through he slipped into the opening and stepped onto the tile surrounding a large oval pool he was twenty feet behind pratt who was standing at the edge looking down at a man in the water pratt held a long blue pole with a curved extension it was for pulling people in trouble to the side but pratt was holding it just out of reach of the man he grabbed at it desperately but each time pratt jerked it away it was hard to identify the man in the water as maury swann the pool was dark with the lights off swanns glasses were gone and his hair looked like it had slipped off his scalp to the back of his head like a mud slide on his gleaming bald dome was a strip of tape for holding his hairpiece in place the sound of the pool filter gave bosch cover he was able to walk unnoticed to within six feet of pratt before speaking whats happening top pratt quickly lowered the pole so that swann could grab the hook hang on maury pratt yelled youre all right swann grabbed on and pratt started pulling him toward the side of the pool i gotcha maury pratt said dont worry you dont have to bother with the lifeguard act bosch said i heard it all pratt paused and looked down at swann in the water he was three feet from the side in that case pratt said he let go of the pole and whipped his right hand behind his back to the belt line dont it was walling she had found her own way through the hedge she was on the other side of the pool pointing her weapon at pratt pratt froze and seemed to be making a decision about whether to draw or not bosch moved in behind him and yanked the gun out of his pants harry rachel called ive got him get the lawyer swann was sinking the blue pole was going down with him bosch quickly went to the pools edge and grabbed it he pulled swann to the surface the lawyer started coughing and spitting water he held tight to the pole and bosch walked him down to the shallow end rachel came around to pratt and ordered him to put his wrists behind his head maury swann was naked he came up the steps in the shallow end cupping his shriveled balls with one hand and trying to pull his toupee back on with the other giving up on the hairpiece he tore it all the way off and threw it down on the tile where it landed with a splat he went directly to a pile of clothes by a bench and started getting dressed while still soaking wet so what was going on here maury bosch asked nothing that concerns you bosch nodded i get it a guy comes here to put you in the pool and watch you drown maybe make it look like suicide or an accident and you dont want anybody concerned about it it was a disagreement thats all he was scaring me not drowning me does that mean you and he had an agreement before you then had this disagreement im not answering that why was he scaring you i dont have to answer any of your questions then maybe we should back on out of here and leave you two to finish your disagreement maybe that would be the best thing to do here do what you want you know what i think i think that with your client raynard waits dead theres only one person who can link detective pratt to the garlands i think your partner over there was getting rid of that link because he was getting scared youd be at the bottom of that pool if we hadnt happened by here you can do and think what you want but what i am telling you is that we had a disagreement he happened by while i was taking my nightly swim and we disagreed about something i thought you didnt know how to swim maury isnt that what you said im finished talking to you detective you can leave my property now not yet maury why dont you finish getting dressed and join us at the deep end bosch left him there as he struggled to get his wet legs into a pair of silk pants at the other end of the pool pratt was now handcuffed and sitting on a concrete bench im not saying anything until i talk to a lawyer he said well theres one over there putting his clothes on bosch said maybe you can hire him im not talking bosch pratt repeated good decision swann called from the far end rule number one never talk to the cops bosch looked at rachel and almost laughed can you believe this two minutes ago he was trying to drown the guy and now the guys giving him free legal advice sound legal advice swann said swann walked over to where the others were waiting bosch noticed that his clothes were sticking to his wet body i wasnt trying to drown him pratt said i was trying to help him but thats all im going to say bosch looked at swann pull your zipper up maury and sit down over here bosch pointed to a spot on the bench next to pratt no i dont think i will swann replied he took a step toward the house but bosch took two steps and cut him off he redirected him to the bench sit down he said youre under arrest for what swann said indignantly double murder both of you are under arrest swann laughed as though he were dealing with a child now that he had his clothes on he was recovering some of his swagger and what murders would these be detective fred olivas and deputy derek doolan now swann shook his head the smile intact on his face im assuming these charges fall under the felonyhomicide rule since there is ample evidence that we did not actually pull the trigger that fired the bullets that killed olivas and doolan its always good to deal with a lawyer i hate having to explain the law all the time its a pity you need the law explained to you detective bosch the felonyhomicide rule comes into play only when someone is killed during the commission of a serious crime if that threshold is satisfied then coconspirators in the criminal enterprise may be charged with murder bosch nodded i got that he said and ive got you then be so kind as to tell me what the threshold crime is that i have conspired to commit bosch thought for a moment before answering how about suborning perjury and obstruction of justice we could start there and move up to corruption of a public official maybe aiding and abetting an escape from lawful custody and we could end there as well swann said i was representing my client i committed none of those crimes and you have not a shred of evidence that i did if you arrest me it will simply prove your own undoing and embarrassment he stood up good evening to you all bosch stepped over and put his hand on swanns shoulder he drove him back down onto the bench sit the fuck down you are under arrest ill leave it to the prosecutors to decide about threshold crimes i dont give a shit about that as far as im concerned two cops are dead and my partner is going to end her career because of you maury so fuck you bosch looked over at pratt who sat with a slight smile on his face its good to have a lawyer in the house harry he said i think maury makes a good point maybe you should think about this before doing anything rash bosch shook his head you arent walking away from this he said not by a long shot he waited a moment but pratt said nothing i know youre the setup man bosch said the whole thing up in beachwood canyon was yours it was you who made the deal with the garlands then you went to maury here who took it to waits you doctored the murder book after waits gave you an alias to stick in it maury might have a point about the felonymurder rap but theres more than enough there for obstruction and if i get that then ive got you that means no island and no pension top that means you go down in flames pratts eyes dropped from bosch to the dark waters of the pool i want the garlands and you can give them to me bosch said pratt shook his head without turning his eyes from the water then have it your way bosch said lets go he signaled pratt and swann to stand up they complied bosch turned swann around so he could cuff him as he did so he looked over the lawyers shoulder at pratt after we book you whore you going to call about bail your wife or the girl from hiring and firing pratt immediately sat back down as if hit by a sucker punch bosch had been saving it for his last shot he kept the pressure on which one was going to go with you to the island to your sugar plantation my guess is it was whatshername her name is jessie templeton and i made you on the tail at her place tonight yeah and i made you making me but tell me how much does jessie templeton know and is she going to be as strong as you when i go see her after i book you bosch she doesnt know anything leave her out of it leave my wife and kids out of it too bosch shook his head doesnt work that way you know that were going to turn everything upside down and shake it to see what falls out im going to find the money the garlands paid you and ill tie it back to you to maury swann everybody i just hope you didnt use your girlfriend to hide it because if you did she goes down too pratt leaned forward on the bench bosch got the impression that if his hands hadnt been cuffed behind his back hed have been using them at that moment to hold his head and hide his face from the world bosch had kept at him like a man with an axe chopping at a tree it was barely standing now it needed one little push and it would go down bosch walked swann over to rachel who took him by one of his arms bosch then turned back to pratt you fed the wrong dog bosch said whats that supposed to mean everybodys got choices and you made the wrong one problem is we dont pay for our mistakes alone we take people down with us bosch walked to the edge of the pool and looked down into the water it shimmered on top but was impenetrably dark beneath the surface he waited but it didnt take long for the tree to fall jessie doesnt need to be part of this and my wife doesnt need to know about her pratt said it was an opening offer pratt was going to talk bosch kicked his foot on the tile edging and turned back to face him im not a prosecutor but ill bet something could be worked out pratt you are making a big mistake swann said urgently bosch reached down to pratt and patted his pockets until he located the keys to the commander and pulled them out rachel take mr swann to detective pratts car it will be better for transporting him well be right there he threw her the keys and she started walking swann to the opening in the hedge she had come through swann had to be pushed he looked over his shoulder as he went and called back to pratt do not talk to that man he yelled do you hear me do not talk to anyone you will talk us all into prison swann kept yelling legal advice through the hedge bosch waited until he heard the car door close on his voice he then stood in front of pratt and noticed that sweat was dripping from his hairline and down his face i dont want jessie or my family involved pratt said and i want a deal no jail time im allowed to retire and i get to keep my pension you want a lot for somebody who got two people killed bosch started to pace trying to figure out a way of making it all work for both of them rachel came back through the hedge bosch looked at her and was about to ask why she had left swann unattended childproof locks she said he cant get out bosch nodded and gave his attention back to pratt like i said you want a lot he said what are you giving back i can give you the garlands easy pratt said desperately anthony took me up there two weeks ago and led me to the girls body and maury swann i can give you him on a platter the guys as dirty as he didnt finish you pratt lowered his eyes and slowly nodded his head bosch tried to put everything aside so that he could think clearly about pratts offer the blood of freddy olivas and deputy doolan was on pratts hands bosch didnt know whether hed be able to sell the deal to a prosecutor he didnt know if he could even sell it to himself but in that moment he was willing to try if it meant he would finally get to the man who killed marie gesto no promises he said well go see a prosecutor bosch moved to the last important question what about oshea and olivas pratt shook his head once they were clean on this garland funneled at least twentyfive grand to osheas campaign thats documented he was just covering his bets if oshea got suspicious t rex could keep him in line because it would look like a payoff bosch nodded he felt the burn of humiliation over what he had thought about oshea and said to him that wasnt the only thing you got wrong pratt said yeah what else you said i went to the garlands with this thing i didnt they came to me harry bosch shook his head he didnt believe pratt for the simple reason that if the garlands had had the idea to buy off a cop their first overture would have been to the source of their problem bosch that never happened and that made bosch feel confident that the scheme had been hatched by pratt as he tried to juggle retirement a possible divorce a mistress and whatever other secrets his life held he had gone to the garlands with it he had gone to maury swann too tell it to the prosecutor bosch said maybe hell care he looked at rachel and she nodded rachel you take the jeep with swann ill take detective pratt in my car i want to keep them separated good idea bosch signaled pratt up lets go pratt stood up again and came facetoface with bosch harry youve got to know something first whats that nobody was supposed to get hurt okay it was a perfect plan with nobody getting hurt it was waitshe turned it all to shit out there in the woods if he had just done what hed been told everybody would still be alive and everybodyd be happy even you you wouldve solved the gesto case end of story thats how it was supposed to be bosch had to work to hold back his anger nice fairy tale he said except for the part of the story where the princess never wakes up and the real killer walks everybody lives happily ever after keep telling yourself that one you might actually be able to live with it someday bosch roughly took him by the arm and led him toward the opening in the hedge part five echopark at am on monday abel pratt walked from his car across the green lawn of echo park to a bench where an old man was sitting beneath the protective arms of the lady of the lake there were five pigeons resting on her shoulders and upturned hands and one on her head but she showed no sign of annoyance or fatigue pratt shoved the folded newspaper he carried into the overly full trash can by the statue and then sat on the bench next to the old man he looked out at the smooth waters of lake echo in front of them the old man who held a cane down by his knee and wore a tan business suit with a maroon handkerchief in the breast pocket spoke first i remember when you could take your family here on a sunday and not have to worry about being shot up by gangbangers pratt cleared his throat is that what youre worried about mr garland the gangbangers well ill give you a little tip right now is one of the safest hours in any neighborhood in the city most of your gangbangers dont roll out of bed until the afternoon thats why whenever we go out with warrants we go in the morning we always catch them in bed garland nodded approvingly thats good to know but thats not what i am worried about im worried about you detective pratt our business was concluded i was not expecting to hear from you ever again pratt leaned forward and scanned the park he studied the rows of tables on the other side of the lake where the old men played dominoes his eyes then moved along the cars parked at the curb that edged the park wheres anthony he asked hell be along hes taking precautions pratt nodded precautions are good he said i dont like this place garland said its full of ugly people and that includes you why are we here wait a minute a voice said from behind them dont say another word dad anthony garland had approached from their blind side he came around the statue to the bench at the waters edge he stood in front of pratt and signaled him to stand up up he said what is this pratt protested mildly just stand up pratt did as he was asked and anthony garland produced a small electronic wand from the pocket of his blazer he began moving it up and down in front of pratt from head to toe if youre transmitting an rf signal this will tell me good i always wondered if i had rf you never know with those women down in tijuana nobody laughed anthony garland seemed satisfied with the scan and started putting his magic wand away pratt started to sit down wait garland said pratt remained standing and garland started running his hands over pratts body a second precaution cant be too sure with a slimeball like you detective he moved his hands to pratts waist thats my gun pratt said garland kept searching thats my cell phone the hands went lower and those are my balls garland then went down both legs and when he was satisfied he told pratt he could sit down the detective returned to his seat next to the old man anthony garland remained standing in front of the bench his back to the lake his arms folded across his chest hes clean he said okay then t rex garland said we can talk whats this about detective pratt i thought it was made clear to you you dont call us you dont threaten us you dont tell us where to be and when if i hadnt threatened you would you have come neither of the garlands answered and pratt smiled smugly and nodded i rest my case why are we here the old man asked i made it quite clear before i dont want my son touched by any of this why did he have to be here well because i sort of missed him since our little walk in the woods weve got a bond dont we anthony anthony said nothing pratt pressed on i mean a guy leads you to a body in the woods id say normally theyd stay pretty tight but i havent heard from anthony since we were up at the top of beachwood together i dont want you talking to my son t rex garland said you dont talk to my son youre bought and paid for detective you get that this is the only time you will ever call a meeting with me i call you you dont call me the old man never looked at pratt as he spoke his eyes were cast toward the lake the message was clear pratt wasnt worth his attention yeah all that was fine but things have changed pratt said in case you havent been reading the papers or watching the news things have gone to shit out there the old man remained seated but stretched his arms forward and put both palms on the polished gold dragons head at the top of his cane he spoke calmly and whose fault is that you told us you and the lawyer could keep raynard waits in line you told us no one would get hurt you called it a clean operation now look at what youve involved us in pratt took a few moments to respond you involved yourself you wanted something and i was the provider no matter whose fault it is the bottom line is i now need more money t rex garland shook his head slowly you were paid one million dollars he said i had to cut it up with maury swann pratt responded your subcontractor costs were not and are not my concern the fee was based on everything working smoothly waits taking the fall for gesto case closed now there are complications ongoing investigations to contend with again not my concern our deal is done pratt leaned forward on the bench and put his elbows on his knees its not quite done yet t rex he said and maybe you should be concerned because you know who paid me a visit on friday night harry bosch and he had an fbi agent with him they took me to a little meeting with mr rick oshea turns out that before bosch capped waits the little bastard told him that he didnt kill marie gesto so that puts bosch back on your ass junior and it puts all of them on mine theyve damn near worked the whole story outconnecting me and maury swann they just need somebody to fill in the blanks and since they cant get to swann they want that somebody to be me theyre starting to apply the pressure anthony garland groaned and kicked at the ground with his expensive loafers goddamn it i knew this whole thing would his father put a hand up for quiet bosch and the fbi dont matter the old man said its all about what oshea will do and oshea is taken care of hes bought and paid for only he doesnt know it yet once i apprise him of his situation he will do what i tell him to do if he wants to be district attorney pratt shook his head bosch isnt going to let go of this he hasnt for thirteen years hes not going to now then you take care of it thats your end of the deal i took care of oshea you take care of bosch lets go son the old man started to get up using the cane to push up on his son stepped over to help him wait a minute pratt said you arent going anywhere i said i want more money and im serious ill take care of bosch but then i need to check out and disappear i need more money to do that anthony garland angrily pointed down at pratt on the bench you goddamn piece of shit he said you were the one who came to us this whole goddamn thing is your plan from start to finish you go out there and get two people killed and then you have the balls to come back to us for more money pratt shrugged and spread his hands im looking at a choice here same as you i could sit tight with the way things are and see how close they come to me or i could disappear right now the thing you should know is that they always make deals with the little fish to get to the bigger fish im a little fish anthony the big fish that would be you he turned to look at the old man and the biggest fish that would be you t rex garland nodded he was a pragmatic businessman he seemed to now understand the gravity of the situation how much he asked how much to disappear pratt didnt hesitate i want another million dollars and it will be well worth it to you to give it to me they cant get to either of you without me if im gone the case is gone so its a million and the price is nonnegotiable anything less and it is not worth it for me to run ill make a deal and take my chances what about bosch the old man asked you already said he wont give up now that he knows raynard waits didnt ill take care of him before i split pratt said cutting him off ill throw that in for free he reached into his pocket and took out a piece of paper with numbers printed on it he slid it across the bench to the old man theres the bank account and wiring code same as before pratt stood up tell you what talk amongst yourselves im going over to the boathouse to take a leak when i come back ill need an answer pratt walked past anthony coming close each man holding the others eyes in a hard stare of hatred harry bosch studied the monitors in the surveillance van the fbi had worked through the night setting cameras in eight locations at the park one whole side of the interior of the van was covered with an array of digital screens that showed a multitude of visual angles on the bench where t rex garland sat and his son stood waiting for abel pratt to return the cameras were located on four of the parks path lights in two of its flower beds in the mock lighthouse atop the boathouse and in the fake pigeon perched on top of the lady of the lakes head added to this the bureau techs had set up microwave sound receivers triangulated on the bench the sound sweep was aided by directional mikes located in the fake pigeon a flower bed and the folded newspaper pratt had placed in the nearby trash can a bureau sound tech named jerry hooten sat in the van wearing a huge set of earphones and manipulating the audio feeds in order to produce the cleanest sound bosch and the others had been able to watch pratt and the garlands and hear their conversation word for word the others were rachel walling and rick oshea the prosecutor was sitting front and center the video screens spread before him this was his show walling and bosch sat on either side of him oshea pulled off his earphones what do we think he asked hes going to call what do i tell him three of the screens showed pratt about to enter the parks restroom according to the plan he would wait until the room was clear and then call the surveillance vans number on his cell phone rachel pulled her earphones down around her neck and so did bosch i dont know she said its your call but we dont have much of an admission from the son in regard to gesto thats what i was thinking oshea responded i dont know bosch said when pratt talked about him leading him through the woods to the body anthony didnt deny it but he didnt admit it either rachel said but if a guy was sitting there talking to you about finding a body you buried and you didnt know what he was talking about i think youd say something well that can be an argument for the jury oshea said im just saying that he hasnt yet made anything i would call a statement of admission we need more bosch nodded conceding the point it had been decided on saturday morning that pratts word was not going to be good enough his testimony that anthony garland had led him to marie gestos body and that he had taken a payoff from t rex garland would not be sufficient to build a solid prosecution on pratt was a crooked cop and building a case on his testimony was too risky in an age when juries were highly suspicious of police integrity and behavior they needed to get admissions from both of the garlands for the case to move onto solid ground look all im saying is i think its good but were not quite there yet oshea said we need to get a direct what about the old man bosch asked i think pratt got him to shit all over himself i agree rachel said hes toast if you send him back tell him to work on anthony as if on cue there was a lowlevel buzzing sound that indicated an incoming call oshea unfamiliar with the equipment raised a finger over the console and looked for the right button to push here hooten said he punched a button that opened the cell line this is the van oshea said youre on speaker howd i do pratt said its a start oshea said what took you so long to call i actually did have to take a leak while oshea talked to pratt about going back to the bench and trying once more for an admission from anthony garland bosch slipped his earphones back on to hear the conversation taking place at the bench from the visuals on the screens it looked like anthony garland was arguing with his father the old man was pointing a finger at him bosch picked it up in the middle its our only out anthony garland said i said no the old man commanded you cannot do this you will not do this on the screen anthony stepped away from his father and then stepped right back it looked like he was on an invisible leash he bent down close to his father and this time he pointed the finger what he said was spoken so low that the fbi microphones picked up only a mumble bosch pressed his hands over the earphones but couldnt get it jerry he said can you work on this bosch pointed to the screens hooten pulled on his earphones and went to work on the audio dials but it was too late the close conversation between father and son was over anthony garland had just straightened up in front of his father and turned his back to him he was silently looking out across the lake bosch leaned back so that he could see the screen that showed an angle on the bench from one of the path lights at the waters edge it was the only screen that showed anthonys face at the moment bosch saw the rage in his eyes he had seen it before anthony set his jaw tightly and shook his head he turned back to his father sorry dad with that he started walking toward the boathouse bosch watched him take forceful strides toward the door of the restrooms he saw his hand go inside his blazer bosch slapped off his earphones anthonys headed to the mens room he said i think hes got a gun bosch jumped up and shoved past hooten to get to the vans door unfamiliar with it he fumbled with the handle trying to get it open behind him he heard oshea barking commands into the radio mike everybody move in move in suspect is armed repeat suspect is armed bosch finally got out of the van and started running toward the boathouse there was no sign of anthony garland he was already inside bosch was on the far side of the park and more than a hundred yards away other agents and district attorneys office investigators had been deployed closer and bosch saw them running with weapons out toward the boathouse as well just as the first man an fbi agent got to the doorway the sound of gunfire echoed from within the restroom four quick shots bosch knew that pratts weapon was dry it was a prop he had needed to have a gun in case the garlands checked him but pratt was in custody and facing charges they had taken away his bullets as bosch watched the agent at the doorway dropped into a combat stance shouted fbi and entered almost immediately there were more shots but these were of a different timbre than the first four bosch knew these were from the agents gun as bosch got to the restroom the agent stepped out gun at his side he held a radio to his mouth we have two down in the restroom he said scene is secured winded from his run bosch gulped down some air and walked toward the doorway detective thats a crime scene in there the agent said he put his hand up in front of boschs chest bosch pushed it aside i dont care he entered the restroom and saw the bodies of pratt and garland on the dirty concrete floor pratt had been shot twice in the face and twice in the chest garland had taken three chest shots the fingers of pratts right hand were touching the sleeve of garlands blazer pools of blood on the floor were blossoming from both bodies and soon would mingle bosch watched for a few moments studying anthonys open eyes the rage bosch had seen moments before was gone replaced by the empty look of death he stepped out of the restroom and looked over at the bench the old man t rex garland sat leaning forward with his face in his hands the cane with the polished dragons head had been dropped to the grass the entirety of echo park was closed for the investigation for the third time in a week bosch was interviewed about a shooting only this time it was the feds doing the questioning and his part was peripheral because he had not fired a weapon when he was finished he walked over to a mariscos truck that was parked at the curb and open for business to the crowd of onlookers outside the yellow tape he ordered a shrimp taco and a dr pepper and took them over to one of the nearby federal cruisers he was leaning on the front fender eating his lunch when rachel walling approached turns out anthony garland had a concealedweapon permit she said his security job required it she leaned casually on the fender next to him bosch nodded i guess we shouldve checked he said he took his last bite wiped his mouth with a napkin and then balled it up in the aluminum foil the taco came in i remembered your story she said what story he asked the one you told me about garland rousting those kids in the oil field what about it you said he drew down on them thats right she didnt say anything she looked out at the lake bosch shook his head like he wasnt sure what was going on she finally spoke you knew about the permit and you knew anthony would be carrying didnt you it was a question but she meant it as a statement rachel what are you saying im saying you knew you knew from way back that anthony carried a gun you knew what could happen today bosch spread his hands wide look that thing with the kids was twelve years ago how would i know that he would have a gun today she got off the fender and turned to face him how many times did you talk to anthony over the years how many times did you shake him down bosch squeezed the ball of aluminum foil tighter in his fist look i never are you telling me that in all those times you never once came up with a gun that you didnt check permits that you didnt know that there was a very high probability that he would bring a gunand his uncontrolled rageto a meeting like this if we had known this guy carried a gun we would never have set this thing up in the first place bosch smiled unpleasantly and shook his head in a disbelieving sort of way what was it you said about mumbojumbo conspiracies the other day marilyn didnt overdose the kennedys had her killed bosch knew anthony would bring a gun to the meeting and would start shooting rachel it all sounds like and what about what you said about being a true detective she stared pointedly at him rachel listen to me there was no way anybody could have predicted this there was no predicted hoped accidentaly set in motionwhats the difference you remember what you said to pratt the other night by the pool i said a lot of things to him her voice took on a tone of sadness you told him about the choices we all make she pointed across the grass at the boathouse and well harry i guess this is the dog you chose to feed i hope youre happy with it and i hope it fits in perfectly well with the way of the true detective she turned and walked back toward the boathouse and the knot of investigators crowding the crime scene bosch let her go for a long time he didnt move her words had gone through him like the sounds of a roller coaster low rumbling and high shrieks he squeezed the ball of aluminum foil in his hand and shot it toward a trash can sitting next to the mariscos truck he missed by a mile kiz rider came through the double doors in a wheelchair she found it embarrassing but that was the hospital rule bosch was waiting for her with a smile and a bouquet of flowers he had bought from a vendor at the freeway exit near the hospital as soon as she was allowed by the nurse she got up and out of the chair she tentatively hugged bosch as though she felt fragile and thanked him for coming to take her home im right out front he said with his arm across her back he walked her out to the waiting mustang he helped her get in then put a bag of cards and gifts she had received into the trunk and came around to the drivers side you want to go anywhere first he asked once he was in the car no just home i cant wait to sleep in my own bed i hear you he started the car and pulled out heading back to the freeway they drove silently when he got back to the the flower vendor was still in the median rider looked down at the bouquet in her hand realized that bosch had gotten them as an afterthought and started laughing bosch joined in oh shit that hurts she said touching her hand to her neck sorry its all right harry i need to laugh bosch nodded his agreement is sheila going to come by today he asked yeah after work good he nodded because there wasnt anything else to do they lapsed back into silence harry i took your advice rider said after a few minutes what was that i told them i didnt have a shot i told them i didnt want to hit olivas thats good kiz he thought about things for a few moments does that mean youre going to
